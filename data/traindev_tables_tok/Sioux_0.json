The Dakota and Lakota were forced to accept US-defined reservations in exchange for the rest of their lands and farming and ranching of domestic cattle , as opposed to a nomadic , hunting economy . During the first years of the Reservation Era , the Sioux people depended upon annual federal payments guaranteed by treaty for survival . In Minnesota , the treaties of Traverse des Sioux and Mendota in 1851 left the Dakota with a reservation 20 miles ( 32 km ) wide on each side of the Minnesota River . Today , half of all enrolled Sioux in the United States live off reservation .

  "intro": "The Sioux (/su\u02d0/; Dakota: O\u010dh\u00e9thi \u0160ak\u00f3wi\u014b /ot\u0283\u02b0e\u02d0t\u02b0i \u0283ako\u02d0w\u0129/) are groups of Native American tribes and First Nations peoples in North America. The term is an exonym created from a French transcription of the Anishinaabe term Nadouessioux, and can refer to any ethnic group within the Great Sioux Nation or to any of the nation's many language dialects. The modern Sioux consist of two major divisions based on language divisions: the Dakota and Lakota. Before the 17th century, the Santee Dakota (Is\u00e1\u014byathi; Knife also known as the Eastern Dakota) lived around Lake Superior with territories in present-day northern Minnesota and Wisconsin. They gathered wild rice, hunted woodland animals and used canoes to fish. Wars with the Ojibwe throughout the 1700s pushed the Dakota into southern Minnesota, where the Western Dakota (Yankton, Yanktonai) and Teton (Lakota) were residing. In the 1800s, the Dakota signed treaties with the United States, ceding much of their land in Minnesota. Failure of the United States to make treaty payments on time, as well as low food supplies, led to the Dakota War of 1862, which resulted in the Dakota being exiled from Minnesota to numerous reservations in Nebraska, North and South Dakota and Canada. After 1870, the Dakota people began to return to Minnesota, creating the present-day reservations in the state. The Yankton and Yanktonai Dakota (Ih\u00e1\u014bkt\u021fu\u014bwa\u014b and Ih\u00e1\u014bkt\u021fu\u014bwa\u014bna; Village-at-the-end and Little village-at-the-end), collectively also referred to by the endonym Wi\u010dh\u00edyena, resided in the Minnesota River area before ceding their land and moving to South Dakota in 1858. Despite ceding their lands, their treaty with the U.S. government allowed them to maintain their traditional role in the O\u010dh\u00e9thi \u0160ak\u00f3wi\u014b as the caretakers of the Pipestone Quarry, which is the cultural center of the Sioux people. They are considered to be the Western Dakota (also called middle Sioux), and have in the past been erroneously classified as Nakota."
