  "section_title": "Treasures -- Japanese literature",
  "section_text": "Waka ( `` Japanese poem '' ) or uta ( `` song '' ) is an important genre of Japanese literature . The term originated in the Heian period to distinguish Japanese-language poetry from kanshi , poetry written in Chinese by Japanese authors . [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Waka began as an oral tradition , in tales , festivals and rituals , [ nb 4 ] and began to be written in the 7th century . [ 14 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] In the Asuka and Nara periods , `` waka '' included a number of poetic forms such as tanka ( `` short poems '' ) , ch\u014dka ( `` long poems '' ) , bussokusekika , sed\u014dka ( `` memorized poem '' ) and katauta ( `` poem fragment '' ) , but by the 10th century only the 31-syllable tanka survived . [ 35 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] The Man'y\u014dsh\u016b , of the mid-8th century , is the primary record of early Japanese poetry and the first waka anthology . [ 16 ] [ 41 ] It contains the three main forms of poetry at time of compilation : 4,200 tanka , 260 ch\u014dka and 60 sed\u014dka ; dating from 759 backwards more than one century . [ nb 5 ] [ 20 ] [ 42 ] The early 9th century , however , was a period of direct imitation of Chinese models making kanshi the major form of poetry at the time . [ 43 ] [ 44 ] In the late 9th century , waka and the development of kana script rose simultaneously with the general revival of traditional values , culminating in the compilation of the first imperial waka anthology , the Kokinsh\u016b , in 905 . [ 26 ] [ 45 ] It was followed in 951 by the Gosen Wakash\u016b ; in all seven imperial anthologies were compiled in the Heian period . [ 46 ] [ 47 ] The main poetic subjects were love and the four seasons ; the standards of vocabulary , grammar and style , established in the Kokinsh\u016b , dominated waka composition into the 19th century . [ 45 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] At the end of the Heian period , the aristocracy lost political and economical power to warrior clans , but retained the prestige as custodians of high culture and literature . [ 34 ] [ 58 ] Nostalgia for the Heian court past , considered then as classical Japanese past ( as opposed to Chinese past ) , created a renaissance in the arts and led to a blossoming of waka in the early Kamakura period . [ 34 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] Poets of middle and lower rank , such as Fujiwara no Shunzei , Saigy\u014d H\u014dshi and Fujiwara no Teika , analyzed earlier works , wrote critical commentaries , and added new aesthetic values such as y\u016bgen to waka poetry . [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] Some of the best imperial anthologies and best poetic anthologies , such as Shunzei 's Korai f\u016bteish\u014d , were created in the early Kamakura period . [ 34 ] The audience was extended from the aristocracy to high ranking warriors and priests , who began to compose waka . [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] By the 14th century , linked verse or renga superseded waka poetry in importance . [ 67 ] [ 68 ] There are 29 National Treasures of 14 collections of waka and two works on waka style , compiled from between the 8th and the mid-13th century with most from the Heian period . The two works of waka theory are Wakatai jisshu ( 945 ) and Korai f\u016bteish\u014d ( 1197 ) . The collections include the two first imperial waka anthologies : Kokinsh\u016b ( 905 , ten treasures ) and Gosen Wakash\u016b ( 951 ) ; seven private anthologies : Man'y\u014dsh\u016b ( after 759 , three treasures ) , Shins\u014d Hish\u014d ( 1008 ) , Ny\u016bd\u014d Udaijin-sh\u016b ( before 1065 ) , Sanj\u016brokunin Kash\u016b ( ca . 1112 ) , Ruij\u016b Kosh\u016b ( before 1120 ) , Sh\u016bi Gus\u014d ( 1216 ) , My\u014de Sh\u014dnin Kash\u016b ( 1248 ) ; and five utaawase contents : including one imaginary content ( Kasen utaawase ) , the Konoe edition of the Poetry Match in Ten Scrolls ( three treasures ) , Ruij\u016b utaawase , the Poetry competition in 29 rounds at Hirota Shrine and the Record of Poetry Match in Fifteen Rounds . The designated manuscripts of these works found in this list date from the Heian and Kamakura periods . [ 4 ]",
  "uid": "List_of_National_Treasures_of_Japan_(writings:_Japanese_books)_0",
  "intro": "The term National Treasure has been used in Japan to denote cultural properties since 1897,\nalthough the definition and the criteria have changed since the introduction of the term. The written materials in the list adhere to the current definition, and have been designated National Treasures according to the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties that came into effect on June 9, 1951. The items are selected by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology based on their especially high historical or artistic value. Writing was introduced from Korea to Japan around 400 AD (in the form of Chinese books), with work done in Chinese by immigrant scribes from the mainland. [nb 1] Literacy remained at an extremely marginal level in the 5th and 6th centuries, but during the 7th century a small number of Japanese scholar-aristocrats such as Prince Sh\u014dtoku began to write in Chinese for official purposes and in order to promote Buddhism. By the late 7th century, reading and writing had become an integral part of life of some sections of the ruling and intellectual classes, particularly in government and religion. The earliest extant large-scale works compiled in Japan are the historical chronicles Kojiki (712) and Nihon Shoki (720). Other early Japanese works from the Nara period include biographies of Prince Sh\u014dtoku, cultural and geographical records (fudoki) and the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b, the first anthology of Japanese poetry. Necessarily all of these works were either written in Chinese or in a hybrid Japanese-Chinese style and were modeled on Chinese prototypes. The development of a distinct Japanese script (kana) in the 9th century was the starting point of the classical age of Japanese literature and led to a number of new, uniquely Japanese genres of literature, such as tales (monogatari) or diaries (nikki). Because of the strong interest and support in literature of the Heian court, writing activities flourished particularly in the 10th and 11th centuries. This list contains books of various type that have been compiled in Classical and early Feudal Japan."
