MTV also describes as her as a natural born leader . Her castmates become concerned over her drinking , which she says leads to blackouts .

        "Ryan is a fourth-generation hairstylist who works in a salon with his father , chafes against the assumption that he is gay , and aspires to cut hair for celebrities . Living with both ADHD and OCD , and noting his tendency to chase his roommates around the house naked , MTV describes him as one of the most bizarre roommates in New Orleans and the life of the party . MTV also describes him as being in touch with his emotions and feminine side , charismatic and creative . In the past he has dealt with both depression and a tumultuous relationship with his father . He indicates an attraction to McKenzie in the premiere , but socializes with her visiting friend in Episode 2 , much to McKenzie 's ire . After recurring conflicts between Ryan and Preston in Episodes 1 and 4 , and because of McKenzie and Preston 's view that Ryan does not do chores or clean up after himself , McKenzie describes him as overall a bad roommate , messy , inconsiderate , and rude . The cast 's concern over Ryan 's behavior escalates , and culminates in his eviction from the house in Episode 10 . He is the first cast member to be evicted unanimously by the other roommates since Puck in Season 3 . He returns , however , for the cast photo shoot in Episode 12",
