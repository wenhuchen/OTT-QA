  "intro": "The Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) is a commuter railway system serving all four counties of Long Island, with one station in the Manhattan borough of New York City in the U.S. state of New York. Its operator is the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York. Serving 301,763 passengers per day as of 2007 and 88.5 million riders for the year of 2008, it is the busiest commuter railroad in the United States. With 324 passenger route-miles, it spans Long Island from Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn to Montauk station at the tip of the southern fork. Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan is the actual westernmost station of the Long Island Rail Road and its busiest station. The system currently has 124 stations on eleven rail lines called branches. (Not included in this count are two additional stations that serve employees of the LIRR: Hillside Facility and Boland's Landing). Two stations are open seasonally: Belmont Park and Mets-Willets Point; in addition, the Pinelawn station exclusively serves cemeteries in its area and is thus served during daytime hours. Hunterspoint Avenue and Long Island City are open only on weekdays. The six stations on the Main Line east of Ronkonkoma get a few weekday-only trains. Jamaica is a major transfer station between branches, as it provides the interchange from the eastern Long Island stations to the western New York terminals and vice versa. Other inter-branch transfer stations include Woodside, Mineola, Hicksville, Valley Stream, Lynbrook and Babylon."
