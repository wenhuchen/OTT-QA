          "In 1908 , John T. Jones built this experimental blast furnace , named the Ardis Furnace after his daughter , to test an iron extraction process he developed . The furnace as originally built was a huge rotating metal tube installed at a slight incline and held in place by a series of concrete supports . The Ardis Furnace was initially a success , but a fundamental heat problem limited its durability , and within two years Jones lost his personal fortune and the project was abandoned . Some elements of Jones 's technology were incorporated into later successful operations , but the ruins of the concrete supports are the only remnants of the Ardis furnace"
