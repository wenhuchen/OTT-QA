Forty percent of the population is concentrated in the provinces of Khorat , Ubon Ratchathani , Udon Thani , and Khon Kaen , known as `` big four of Isan '' . These provinces surround the four major cities of the same names . As of 2010 , their populations were : Khorat 142,169 ; Udon Thani 137,979 ; Khon Kaen 113,828 ; and Ubon Ratchathani 83,148 . However , as of 2010 only 50 per cent of the region 's population lived in municipal areas . Kalasin was the most urbanised province ( with almost 100 percent in municipal areas ) , and Roi Et the least ( 2.8 per cent ) . Thus , the population is still largely rural , but concentrated around the urban centres . The main language of the region is Isan , a dialect of the Lao language . Northern Khmer , a dialect of the Khmer language of Cambodia , is also spoken in the southeast . Standard Thai is understood by everyone and is used for all official matters . The number of speakers of Isan has been estimated at between 15\u201323 million , the majority of those living in Isan . The Khorat dialect , spoken by around 10,000 people , [ 16 ] occupies a linguistic position somewhere between Lao and standard Thai . There is a substantial Khmer minority , concentrated in the southern provinces of Buriram , Surin , and Sisaket , and some Vietnamese refugees in Mukdahan and Nakhon Phanom . Other languages spoken in Isan , mainly by tribal minorities , are as follows :",
