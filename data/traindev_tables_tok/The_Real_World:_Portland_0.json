        "While she is described as having been awkward and dorky in high school , today the 5 ' 11 Anastasia , who describes herself as a girly girl , and is characterized by Jordan in the premiere as a Barbie doll , is a model who does promotional work and a singer . She was raised by her mother and grandmother , with whom she lives , while her alcoholic father , who spent time in and out of jail , was not a strong presence or influence in her life . In fact , she tells Jordan in Episode 7 that she did not get along with him is because his behavior was so reminiscent of her father . Her nickname is Bird , on account of both her sense of wanderlust and her height , which is evocative of the Sesame Street character Big Bird . She has a boyfriend that she has been dating since early 2012 . MTV describes her as a nerd who loves The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter . She graduated in 2008 from Redford High School in Detroit , and is majoring in journalism , with the hopes of obtaining a job where her voice will be heard . MTV observes that while she may appear to be light and goofy , she can also quick to anger when offended , and proves to be a good friend to her castmates . She becomes good friends with Averey",

        "Averey is originally from Tecumseh , Michigan , and is of Mexican , Native American and European heritage . She is proud of her job at Hooters , which allows her to live independently , though she dislikes when others focus on her looks , as she prefers to emphasize her other qualities , and rarely wears makeup or jewelry . Her alcoholic father was not a presence or influence in her life , a point of commonality with which she bonds with Anastasia in the premiere , and she harbors a strained relationship with her mother , whose abusive relationships led Averey to move in with a friend 's family at age 15 . She continues to have a relationship with her younger sister Jenna , however , whom she says she tried to defend from her mother 's abuse when they were younger . She played volleyball and basketball at Britton High School , from which she graduated in 2009 . As soon as she was able to , Averey moved to Arizona , where she was involved in a tempestuous relationship , and although she is no longer in it , the ordeal made it difficult for her to trust men , despite the fact that she considers herself extremely sexual , open to trying new things , and is characterized by MTV as insatiable . She brought her dog , Daisy , to live with her in Portland , and upon arriving there , develops a mutual attraction to Johnny , and the two become a couple . She also becomes close friends with Anastasia",

        "Jessica sees herself as the black sheep of her conservative , half Hispanic , half Irish family due to her outgoing nature . She considers herself sensitive on account of having been she picked on by her two brothers and sister . She also says that she has no friends back home , the only person she is close to is her mother , which is why she wants to be accepted in Portland . When she was 16 , she and her then 26-year-old fianc\u00e9e became engaged , but the relationship eventually ended . She and her boyfriend , James , broke up three weeks before she came to Portland because she says she was putting more into the relationship than he was , which makes it difficult for her when she begins dating a man in Portland named Tyler . Jessica says she tends to choose men who are unable to meet her needs , but she is still looking for the right man . According to MTV she is feisty , and exhibits a wide-eyed innocence and a sense of wacky levity , and her roommates sometimes perceive her to be akin to an attention-seeking , annoying little sister . She was part of the Zeta Tau Alpha sorority at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke . Like Anastasia , she is also a model , and says she wanted to be a Playboy Playmate . She lives with her mother and stepfather , and came to Portland in order to explore who she is outside her sheltered life . Despite her apparently feminine sensibilities , describes herself as an adventurous tomboy who enjoys activities such as fishing , hunting , riding her several dirtbikes in motocross events and skydiving . She comes into conflict with Jordan early in the season , and later , with Averey , Anastasia and Johnny , for which Nia comes to her defense",

        "Marlon is a military brat whose world travels as a child taught him how to adapt to new environments , but which precluded his ability to form long-term friendships with people in whom he can confide . He is an only child who was sheltered by his super-religious family , which includes a pastor grandfather and a pastor father , the latter of whom raised him after his parents divorced when he was six months old . Though Marlon strives to please him , his strong religious upbringing can lead him to feel conflicted where his sex life is concerned . Marlon never saw his mother until her funeral when he was in the seventh grade . He excelled at football in high school , and was a linebacker at Texas Tech University , where he majored in civil engineering . Marlon twice received Honorable mention in the All-Big 12 conference , and wanted to become a professional player , but his professional prospects faded after he was cut by the Canadian Football League during the 2010 NFL Draft , a low point that led him into a depression . It also led to his acceptance into Austin 's gay community , where he experimented with his bisexuality , though he now says that sex with men was n't for him . The last girlfriend he had was for six months in the seventh grade , and though he says he wants a girlfriend , he is averse to the large number of women he has encountered who demand that he spend money on them . His disposition has since improved , and he is majoring in industrial engineering , though he is irritated at being judged by the people of Lubbock for no longer playing football . He hopes that Portland will provide an opportunity for a fresh start , free of others ' expectations and preconceptions about him . He is also pursuing a career as a rap musician",
