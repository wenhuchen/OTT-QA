  "section_text": "In Luxembourgian football , the Double is made up of the National Division title and the Luxembourg Cup . As there are no other senior football competitions in the country , and no club have never come close to winning any European tournament , the Double is the ultimate achievement for a Luxembourgian club in one season . The most successful clubs are Jeunesse Esch and F91 Dudelange , who have completed eight Doubles each .",
  "uid": "Double_(association_football)_156",
  "intro": "The Double, in association football, is the achievement of winning a country's top tier division and its primary cup competition in the same season. The lists in this article examine this definition of a double, while derivative sections examine much less frequent, continental instances. The Double can also mean beating a team both home and away in the same league season, a feat often noted as doing the double over a particular opponent. The first club to achieve a double was Preston North End in 1889, winning the FA Cup and The Football League in the inaugural season of the league. The team that holds the record for the most doubles is Linfield of Northern Ireland, with a total of 24."
