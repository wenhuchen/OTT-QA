  "intro": "In New Zealand, the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ) compiles the top forty singles chart each week. Sales of songs determined 75% of the sorting information, and radio airplay figures were responsible for 25%. From 18 April 2004 to 29 May 2007 the sales/radio airplay split was 50:50. Downloads of songs were included from 29 May 2007. The reporting period is from Monday to Sunday, with the week's chart published the next Monday. Before 18 April 2004, the chart week was from Sunday to Saturday, with the chart published on Sunday. Afterwards, the chart week was from Monday to Sunday, with the charts published on Monday. This meant there was a one-day charting period for 18 April 2004, with the next chart published on 19 April 2004. As a result, Usher spent three weeks and one day at number one with Yeah! instead of four complete weeks. A total of 171 singles topped the chart in the 2000s, including 23 by New Zealand artists. Twenty artists had three or more number-one singles; the most successful was Akon, whose seven number-ones totalled twenty-three weeks on top of the chart."
