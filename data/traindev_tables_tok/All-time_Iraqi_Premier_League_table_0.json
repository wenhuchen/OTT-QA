  "intro": "The Iraqi football champions are the winners of the highest league in Iraqi football, which since the 2013-14 season has been called the Iraqi Premier League. Following the establishment of the Iraq Football Association in 1948, a one-off national tournament called the Iraq FA Championship was played in 1949 and was won by Sharikat Naft Al-Basra. From 1948 to 1974, regional leagues were held in Baghdad, Basra, Mosul and Kirkuk, but the Baghdad league (called the Iraqi Central League) was considered by fans and the media to be the primary league in Iraq, with the FA selecting the Central League winners to participate in the Asian Club Championship rather than the winners of the other regional leagues. The first nationwide league of clubs in Iraq was established in 1974, by the name of the Iraqi National League, with many of the institutes teams merging together to form sports clubs. The first season saw Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya achieving the league. The first team to get relegated was Al-Rafidain, and the first ever promoted teams consisted of five clubs including Al-Zawraa who succeeded in achieving the league title in their first season participating. The four Popular Teams of Baghdad (Al-Zawraa, Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya, Al-Shorta and Al-Talaba), have dominated the now-called Iraqi Premier League over the years. Two of these teams have appeared in every single season since 1974, with those two being Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya and Al-Shorta, while Al-Zawraa and Al-Talaba (known as Al-Jamea at the time) made their first appearance in the Iraqi National League in 1975-76. Al-Zawraa have won 14 titles, the most of any club. Erbil are the only club outside of Baghdad to achieve more than one title, having won four titles, all in the 21st century."
