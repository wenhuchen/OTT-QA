  "intro": "The Turkish minorities/communities in the former Ottoman Empire refers to ethnic Turks, who are the descendants of Ottoman-Turkish settlers from Anatolia and Eastern Thrace, living outside of the modern borders of the Republic of Turkey, and in the independent states which were formerly part of the Ottoman Empire. Thus, they are not considered part of Turkey's modern diaspora, rather, due to living for centuries in their respective regions (and for centuries under Turkish rule), they are now considered natives or locals as they have been living in these countries prior to the independence and establishment of the modern-nation states. Today, whilst the Turkish people form a majority in the Republic of Turkey and Northern Cyprus, they also form one of the Two Communities in the Republic of Cyprus, as well as significant minorities in the Balkans, the Caucasus, the Levant, and North Africa. Consequently, the Turkish ethnicity and/or language is officially recognised under the constitutional law of several states, particularly in the Balkans."
