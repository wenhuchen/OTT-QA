  "intro": "The Jump was a British television series that followed celebrities as they tried to master various winter sports including skeleton, bobsleigh, snowskates, ski cross, and giant slalom. Davina McCall and Alex Brooker presented the first series, with McCall returning for future series. Brooker did not return for future series however. Winter Olympic skier Graham Bell and skeleton gold medallist Amy Williams put the celebrities through training in the UK and Austria. Britain's first Olympic ski jumper, Eddie The Eagle Edwards, appears live on the show to demonstrate the ski jump. The first series was won by singer Joe McElderry on 3 February 2014. In March 2014, Channel 4's chief creative officer, Jay Hunt said she was keen to renew the show for a second series. On 1 September 2014, Channel 4 confirmed that it had renewed the show for a second series in 2015. The second series was won by reality television star Joey Essex. On 28 April 2015, Channel 4 renewed the show for a third series that began on 31 January 2016. The third series concluded on 6 March 2016 with retired rugby union player Ben Cohen winning the series, despite this the series suffered controversy due to it containing the highest amount of injuries/withdrawals out of all the 4 series. Despite reports that the show would be cancelled after the third series due to low ratings and poor views, on 13 July 2016 it was confirmed that the show would be once again renewed for a fourth series, that started on 5 February 2017 and ended 12 March with Spencer Matthews winning."
