  "intro": "Pardubice Region (Czech: Pardubick\u00fd kraj; Polish: Kraj pardubicki) is an administrative unit (Czech: kraj) of the Czech Republic, located mainly in the eastern part of its historical region of Bohemia, with a small part in northwestern Moravia. It is named after its capital Pardubice. As an administrative unit, Pardubice Region has existed three times in the course of history. It was established for the first time in 1850, and extended from \u010cesk\u00fd Brod to the Bohemian-Moravian border. In its second existence, it was one of 19 regions as they were set between 1949 and 1960. After 1960, Pardubice became the capital of Pardubice district, which was part of the Eastern Bohemian Region (capital Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9). The Pardubice Region, as it is now, was reestablished in 2000."
