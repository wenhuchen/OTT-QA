  "intro": "Joanne Palombo-McCallie (born Joanne Elizabeth Palombo; September 6, 1965) is an American college basketball coach who is currently the head coach of the Duke University women's basketball team. McCallie became the first Division I head coach to win a conference title in four different conferences (the ACC, Big Ten, America East and North Atlantic), and also the first Division I coach to be named conference coach of the year in four different conferences. She was only the second Division I head coach to lead two different programs to 30-win seasons, and also to lead two different programs to a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. McCallie has three National Championship game appearances in her career (one as a head coach and two as an assistant), and has been named conference coach of the year five times. She has coached twelve players who have received All-America honors, and has seen nine of her former players go on to play professionally, five being first round pick. McCallie has also won a gold medal as coach of the 2006 U20 National team and the 2007 U21 World Championship team. Since her first season at Duke in 2007, McCallie has led the Women's basketball team to an overall record of 141-32, a 60-12 record in the ACC alone, and was announced the ACC Coach of the year in 2010 and 2012."
