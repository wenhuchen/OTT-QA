  "intro": "The 2012 NCAA Division I FBS football season was the highest level of college football competition in the United States organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The regular season began on August 30, 2012 and ended on December 8, 2012. The postseason concluded on January 7, 2013 with the BCS National Championship Game, where Alabama repeated as national champions by defeating Notre Dame. Although Ohio State finished the regular season as the only undefeated team from an automatic-qualifying (Power 5) BCS conference, they were ineligible to play in the postseason due to sanctions imposed earlier in the year."
