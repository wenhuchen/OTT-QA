  "intro": "The Conference USA Football Championship Game is an annual American football game that has determined the season champion of Conference USA (C-USA) since 2005. The championship game pits the C-USA East Division regular season champion against the West Division regular season champion. It is typically played on the first Saturday of December. The 2018 edition of the game, sponsored by Globe Life, was played on December 1, 2018, and televised by CBSSN. Ryan LLC currently holds sponsorship rights to the game. Nine of the fourteen current C-USA members have played in the Conference USA Football Championship Game. The overall series between both divisions is led by the East Division, 10-5. While nine C-USA members have played in the game, only six have won: Florida Atlantic, Marshall and Western Kentucky of the current East Division members, and Southern Miss, Rice, and UAB of the current West Division members. The C-USA Football Championship Game had been aired on ESPN or its affiliates since 2005, but the 2018 Championship Game was aired on CBSSN."
