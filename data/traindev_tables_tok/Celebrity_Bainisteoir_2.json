  "intro": "Celebrity Bainisteoir is a prime-time reality programme broadcast by RT\u00c9 and produced by Animo Television/Kite Entertainment. Created by Fiona Looney, it involved a number of celebrities competing against each other as a Gaelic football team coach; the title derives from the Irish word for a manager, bainisteoir [\u02c8ban\u02b2\u0259\u0283t\u02b2o\u02d0\u027e\u02b2]. During and after its eight-part original run in 2008, the hugely popular RT\u00c9 Television tournament was widely mentioned in the media including such newspapers such as An Phoblacht, The Belfast Telegraph, the Evening Echo, the Irish Examiner, the Irish Independent, the Irish News and The Irish Times. During the first series, a pop culture website asked its readers If you werent watching Celebrity Bainisteoir last night, then where were you? In the wake of the successful first series, the Evening Herald of Dublin reported in September 2008 that RT\u00c9 was seeking out a new set of celebrities for a second series of Celebrity Bainisteoir set to air in summer 2009, and that a Celebrity Bainisteoir special would air during the Christmas season in 2008. The second series began on 22 March 2009. The series was axed in 2013 and replaced with Ireland's Fittest Family."
