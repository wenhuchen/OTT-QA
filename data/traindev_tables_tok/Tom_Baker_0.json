  "intro": "Thomas Stewart Baker (born 20 January 1934) is an English actor and writer. He is well known for his portrayal of the fourth incarnation of the Doctor in the science fiction series Doctor Who from 1974 to 1981, a longer tenure than any other actor in the title role, and provided narration in the television comedy series Little Britain. His voice, which has been described as sonorous, was voted the fourth-most recognisable in the UK in 2006. At age 15, Baker began study as a religious brother. He gradually lost his vocation, leaving religious life at age 21 to undertake national service in the Royal Army Medical Corps. Upon leaving the army, he served in the Merchant Navy and then became an actor, joining the Royal National Theatre under Laurence Olivier. He was in his thirties when his professional acting career began, and his first major film role was as Grigori Rasputin in Nicholas and Alexandra in 1971, when he was 37. He went on to play the villainous Prince Koura in The Golden Voyage of Sinbad in 1973, which led to his casting in Doctor Who. During his period as the star of Doctor Who, the series received high viewing figures and featured many stories which became regarded as classics. He remains one of the most instantly recognisable incarnations of the character. He continued to feature in regular television roles later in his career, including in the series Medics and Monarch of the Glen. He has also narrated commercials, video games, audiobooks, radio plays, and television series."
