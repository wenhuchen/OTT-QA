  "intro": "Best selling automobiles are those passenger cars and light trucks which, since the introduction of the Benz Patent Motorwagen in 1886, can lay claim to being the highest selling vehicles in the markets they compete in. While references to verify the manufacturers' claims have been included, there is always the possibility of inaccuracy or hyperbole. Also note that a single vehicle can be sold concurrently under several nameplates in different markets, as with for example the Nissan Sunny; in such circumstances manufacturers often provide only cumulative units sold figures for all models. As a result, there is no definitive standard for measuring units sold; \nChrysler minivans has sold over 16 million worldwide. Volkswagen has claimed its Beetle as the bestselling car in history as it did not substantially change throughout its production run. By contrast, Toyota has applied the Corolla nameplate to 13 generations since 1966, which have sold over 44 million through 2016."
