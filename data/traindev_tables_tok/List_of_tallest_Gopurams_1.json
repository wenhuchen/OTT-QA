        "The Vimana with its recessed corners and upward movement presents a striking contrast to the straight-sided pyramidal tower of Thanjavur but with octagon shape of Dravidian architecture . As it rises to a height of 182 feet ( 55 m ) and is shorter than the Thanjavur tower with larger plinth , it is often described as the feminine counterpart of the Thanjavur temple . The Vimana is flanked on either side by small temples ; the one in the north now housing the Goddess is fairly well preserved . The small shrine of Chandikesvara is near the steps in the north . In the north-east are a shire housing Durga , a well called lion-well ( simhakeni ) with a lion figure guarding its steps and a late mandapa housing the office . Nandi is in the east facing the main shrine . In the same direction is the ruined gopura , the entrance tower . The main tower surrounded by little shrines truly presents the appearance of a great Chakravarti ( emperor ) surrounded by chieftains and vassals . The Gangaikondacholapuram Vimana is undoubtedly a devalaya chakravarti , an emperor among temples of South India",

In many cases within South India , the vimanams are confused with gopurams .

  "uid": "List_of_tallest_Gopurams_1",
  "intro": "A Gopuram or Gopura is a monumental tower, usually ornate, at the entrance of any temple, especially in Southern India. This forms a prominent feature of Koils, Hindu temples of the Dravidian style. They are topped by the kalasam, a bulbous stone finial. They function as gateways through the walls that surround the temple complex. The gopuram's origins can be traced back to early structures of the Tamil kings Pallavas, Cholas and by the twelfth century under the Pandya rulers these gateways became a dominant feature of a temple's outer appearance, eventually overshadowing the inner sanctuary which became obscured from view by the gopuram's colossal size. It also dominated the inner sanctum in amount of ornamentation. Often a shrine has more than one gopuram. A koil may have multiple gopurams, typically constructed into multiple walls in tiers around the main shrine.puri temple is 214 feet height."
