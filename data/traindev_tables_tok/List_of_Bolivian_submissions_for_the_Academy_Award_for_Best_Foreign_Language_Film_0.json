  "intro": "Bolivia has submitted films for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film[nb 1] since 1995. The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. It was not created until the 1956 Academy Awards, in which a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since. Eleven Bolivian films have been designated to compete for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Five have been accepted by AMPAS, three of which were directed by Juan Carlos Valdivia. So far, no Bolivian film has yet been nominated for an Oscar. The Bolivian submission is designated by the Asociaci\u00f3n de Cineastas Bolivianos (Asocine)."
