  "intro": "Arkedo Studio was a French independent video game developer, founded in 2006 by Camille Guermonprez and Aur\u00e9lien R\u00e9gard. The company released their first game, Nervous Brickdown for the Nintendo DS, in 2007. They followed that game with 2009's Big Bang Mini - also for DS, and then later OMG: Our Manic Game for Windows Phone 7. The company's founding goal was to be as small as possible, while still creating 'real' games - in boxes, with a manual. The company's owners have sought to retain the rights to their intellectual properties; as of January 2010, they continue to hold them all. On February 23, 2013 it was announced that the studio is shutting down."
