  "section_text": "Cage of Death VIPromotionCombat Zone Wrestling [ 7 ] DateDecember 11 , 2004 [ 7 ] CityPhiladelphia , Pennsylvania [ 7 ] VenueViking Hall [ 7 ] Cage of Death VI took place on December 11 , 2004 , in the ECW Arena where there were two Cage Of Death matches . One saw Team Ca $ h ( Chri $ Ca $ h , J.C. Bailey , Nate Webb , and SeXXXy Eddy ) defeat Team Blackout ( Ruckus , Sabian , Eddie Kingston , and Jack Evans ) . The other match saw the battle of The H8 Club as Wifebeater and Justice Pain took on Nate Hatred and Nick Gage . For Cage of Death 6 there were eliminations that would happen when a wrestler would hit the arena floor much like Cage of Death 5 the year before , the difference being that the tag team titles were hanging on a scaffold stretched across the length of the top of the cage overlooking the two rings . [ 7 ] In the 4 on 4 WarGames elimination match , wrestlers were eliminated when they hit the floor . The cage surrounded two rings , weapons littered around two rings , and there was also a scaffold on top of the cage where Maven Bentley and Robbie Mireno were holding the CZW Tag Team belts . The other Cage of Death match was a Fans Bring the Weapons match inside the cage . Wifebeater and Justice Pain won after Nick Gage turned on Nate Hatred by driving him through a pane of glass covered in salt and thumbtacks . Immediately after the match Pain and Gage turned on Wifebeater .",

It always features the Cage of Death match, a steel cage with various weapons littered in the cage. electrified cage walls, cacti, tables, light tubes, glass, thumbtacks, baseball bats, barbed wire and numerous other weapons and objects have been used in it. The first two were simple either pin and/or submit to win cage matches with weapons littered in and around the cage. The Cage of Death also has different formats and stipulations: singles, tag team, or gauntlet. Each Cage of Death features two or more wrestlers in the cage. For Cage of Death 5, 6, and 7, WarGames stipulations were used."
