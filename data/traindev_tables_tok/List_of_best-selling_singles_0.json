It is notable that, according to Guinness World Records, Irving Berlin's White Christmas (1942) as performed by Bing Crosby is the best-selling single worldwide, with estimated sales of over 50 million copies. The song, recognized as the best-selling single of all time, was released before the pop/rock singles-chart era and was listed as the world's best-selling single in the first-ever Guinness Book of Records (published in 1955) and - remarkably - still retains the title more than 50 years later.

In 1997, John performed a rewritten version of the song as a tribute to the late Diana, Princess of Wales, is the biggest-selling single since UK and US singles charts began in the 1950s, having accumulated worldwide sales of 33 million copies, making it the second-best-selling physical single of all time. There are three best-selling singles lists displayed here:"
