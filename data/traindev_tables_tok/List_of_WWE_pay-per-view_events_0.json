  "intro": "This is a list of WWE pay-per-view and WWE Network events, detailing all professional wrestling cards promoted on pay-per-view (PPV) and the WWE Network by WWE. WWE has been broadcasting PPV events since the 1980s, when its classic Big Four events (Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series) were first established. The company's PPV lineup expanded to a monthly basis in the mid-1990s before expanding even further in the early-2000s. Aside from its standard monthly schedule, WWE produced additional international PPVs between 1997 and 2003. These events were not available in the United States and coincided with overseas tours in the United Kingdom. Following WWE's original brand extension in 2002, the company promoted two touring rosters representing its Raw and SmackDown television programs. The traditional Big Four continued to showcase the entire roster, while the remaining PPV events alternated between Raw and SmackDown cards. A special ECW PPV in 2005 led to the creation of an ECW brand in 2006, which also received its own dedicated PPV events. In March 2007, WWE announced that all subsequent PPV events would feature performers from all brands. In 2008, all WWE PPV events began broadcasting in high-definition. The company's PPV business began to drastically change with the launch of the WWE Network on February 24, 2014. While most of the WWE events still air in many parts of the world on traditional PPV channels, WWE's focus has shifted away from delivering their events on PPV channels."
