        "The Eccleston Park War Memorial stands in a small garden on the St Helens Road and has work by Gilbert and Weingartner . The memorial comprises a pedestal standing on a plinth and at the top of the pedestal is a bronze statue of a soldier who is raising field glasses to his eyes with his left hand and holds a revolver in his right hand . His foot rests on a German helmet . At the foot of the plinth a bronze statue of a young woman stands with her arms outstretched towards the soldier offering him a branch of laurel . On each side of the pedestal are four relief panels . One depicts a group of marching soldiers , another a group of airmen , another some soldiers with camels and in the fourth is a naval scene . The main inscription reads TO THE GLORIOUS MEMORY/ OF ALL THOSE FROM THE/ WEST DERBY HUNDRED OF/ THE COUNTY PALATINE OF/ LANCASTER WHO FOUGHT/ AND GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR KING AND COUNTRY IN/ THE GREAT WAR 1914-1918/ THIS MEMORIAL IS ERECTED BY F R DIXON NUTTALL JP INGLEHOLME and the words THE LAURELS OF THE/ SONS ARE WATERED/ FROM THE HEARTS/ OF THE MOTHERS appear on the relief panels .
