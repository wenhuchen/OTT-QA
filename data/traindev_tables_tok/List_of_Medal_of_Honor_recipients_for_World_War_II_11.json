          "His citation reads as follows : He displayed conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty when his company was pinned down by heavy artillery , mortar , and small arms fire , near Castel d'Aiano , Italy . Volunteering to act as a scout , armed with only a rifle , he charged headlong into withering fire , killing 2 Germans and wounding 3 in order to capture a machinegun . Carrying this enemy weapon across an open field through heavy fire , he neutralized 2 more machinegun nests ; he then circled behind 4 other Germans , killing them with a burst as they were firing on his company . Spotting another dangerous enemy position to this right , he knelt with the machinegun in his arms and exchanged fire with the Germans until he had killed 2 and wounded 3 . The enemy now poured increased mortar and artillery fire on the company 's newly won position . Pfc . Magrath fearlessly volunteered again to brave the shelling in order to collect a report of casualties . Heroically carrying out this task , he made the supreme sacrifice -- a climax to the valor and courage that are in keeping with highest traditions of the military service"

  "intro": "This is a list of Medal of Honor recipients for World War II. The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War and is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States or an opposing foreign force. Due to the nature of this medal, it is commonly presented posthumously. World War II, or the Second World War, was a global military conflict, the joining of what had initially been two separate conflicts. The first began in Asia in 1937 as the Second Sino-Japanese War; the other began in Europe in 1939 with the German and Soviet invasion of Poland. This global conflict split the majority of the world's nations into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. The United States was drawn into World War II on December 8, 1941, a day after the Axis-member Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in Honolulu that killed almost 2,500 people in what was considered the biggest peacetime loss on American soil inflicted by foreign people at that time. For actions during World War II, 472 United States military personnel received the Medal of Honor. Seventeen of these were Japanese-Americans fighting in both Europe and the Pacific, many of which were upgraded from Distinguished Service Crosses during the Clinton administration. Additionally, Douglas Albert Munro was the only serviceman from the United States Coast Guard in United States military history to receive the Medal for his actions during the war. The earliest action for which a U.S. serviceman earned a World War II Medal of Honor was the attack on Pearl Harbor, for which 17 U.S. servicemen were awarded a Medal, although they did so while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force rather than enemy since the United States was neutral during the events of December 7, 1941."
