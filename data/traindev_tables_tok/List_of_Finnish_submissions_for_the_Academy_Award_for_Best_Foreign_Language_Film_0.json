[ 6 ] The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films . Following this , they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award . [ 3 ] Below is a list of the films that have been submitted by Finland for review by the Academy for the award by the year of the submission and the respective Academy Award ceremony . All films were in Finnish except for their 2000 submission Seven Songs from the Tundra which was in Nenets and 2011 submission Le Havre which was in French . Their 2003 & 2005 submissions were half in Swedish ( also an official language of Finland ) , and their 1973 submission was in a Finnish dialect native to the Northern part of the country . The 2015 submission was in Estonian .",

  "intro": "Finland has submitted twenty-seven films for consideration in the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film[nb 1] category. The Award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. The Finnish Academy Awards submission is selected by an expert jury which is chosen by the Finnish Film Foundation. All 32 films listed below were accepted by AMPAS, although two films- Drifting Clouds and Lights in the Dusk- were withdrawn by director Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki after the films were sent to Hollywood in both 1996 and 2006. According to Mark Johnson, the chairman of the Academy's foreign-language committee, he was told by the Finnish selection committee that Kaurismaki does not like film competitions. As of 2017[update], only one Finnish film has been nominated for the Foreign Film Oscar- their 2002 submission The Man Without a Past was nominated for an Oscar on January 2003. Ironically, Past was also directed by Kaurism\u00e4ki, but was not withdrawn. However, Kaurismaki boycotted the Academy Awards ceremony as protest over the U.S. involvement in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Because of Kaurismaki's withdrawals, Klaus H\u00e4r\u00f6 has represented Finland more than any other Finnish director - four times."
