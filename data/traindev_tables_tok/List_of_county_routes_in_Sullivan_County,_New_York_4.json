  "section_text": "The Liberty to Spring Glen series consists of routes 51 through 59 . Routes 51 through 55 follow a single roadway across eastern Sullivan County from Liberty to the Ulster County line , with a brief gap between CR 53 and CR 54 in Woodridge . In Ulster County , the road continues as the short CR 80 , terminating at US 209 in Spring Glen . CR 59 is a connector between NY 17B and CR 174 near Monticello and does not connect to any other route in the Liberty-Spring Glen series . The remaining routes are connectors in the vicinity of Woodridge . Route list",

  "intro": "County routes in Sullivan County, New York, are maintained by the Sullivan County highway department and signed with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices-standard yellow-on-blue pentagon route marker. The county highway system comprises roughly 140 routes arranged across the county in groups of nine. For the most part, state routes in Sullivan County are county-maintained and co-signed with county routes. However, the converse is not true; that is, not all county routes overlap state routes for their entire length. Typically, each series consists of county routes along a single roadway, often overlapping with state highways in the process. The lowest numbered route in the system is County Route 11 (CR 11); the highest is CR 183C. Note that routes 160 through 169 do not conform to any style, and coincidentally the 170 through 179 series (with the exception of the spur designated 174A) follows the pre-expressway routing of New York State Route 17 (NY 17). Sullivan County posted signage of their routes in 1958."
