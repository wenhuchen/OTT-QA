  "intro": "The 2002 AFL draft consisted of a pre-season draft, a national draft, a trade period and the elevation of rookies. The AFL draft is the annual draft of talented players by Australian rules football teams that participate in the main competition of that sport, the Australian Football League. In 2002 there were 88 picks to be drafted between 16 teams in the national draft. Carlton forfeited its priority and first round draft picks due to gross salary cap breaches (it would have also forfeited its second round pick, but they had already traded it to Port Adelaide for Barnaby French). Carlton's punishment came on the back of a dismal 2002 season in which it won its first ever wooden spoon after 105 years of competition. The first pick therefore went to St Kilda, who finished second last during the 2002 AFL season. This was the first draft since their introduction in 1993 that no team received a priority pick, as St Kilda had a record of 5-16-1 (giving them 22 premiership points, above the 20.5 premiership points needed to qualify for a priority pick under the rules at the time)."
