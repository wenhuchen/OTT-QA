He murdered Terence Eve in 1974 , Robert Brown in 1975 , George Brett and his 10-year-old son Terry Brett later on in 1975 , Fred Sherwood in 1978 and Ronald Andrews later on in 1978 and was jailed in December 1979 , with the murders being committed by shooting and stabbing . He confessed to a journalist in 1998 of five more murders while in prison , he appealed against his conviction in 2014 and his whole life sentence in 2016 but was rejected each time on account of his crimes being exceptionally serious"

          "In October 1986 , he was found guilty of shooting dead his adoptive parents , sister and six-year-old twin nephews at the family farmhouse in Essex 14 months earlier , in order to claim a six-figure inheritance while also laying evidence to suggest his sister , a known schizophrenic , had committed the murders before killing herself . This was the police 's original line of inquiry and the media reported the deaths as a murder-suicide , but within weeks of the murders being committed the line of the police investigation had changed and Bamber was charged with five murders . His trial judge said in sentencing him that he found the idea of ever seeing Bamber free again difficult to foresee , and advised that he should serve at least 25 years behind bars before release could even be considered . Before the law lords ' ruling in November 2002 , Bamber was told by at least one Home Secretary that his life sentence would mean life . He has continued to protest his innocence but all appeals against his convictions have so far been unsuccessful"

  "intro": "This is a list of prisoners who have received a whole-life order through some mechanism in jurisdictions of the United Kingdom. It has been reportedly issued in approximately 100 cases since its introduction in 1983, although some of these prisoners have since died in custody, or had their sentences reduced on appeal. There are now[when?] believed to be at least 75 prisoners currently serving whole life sentences in England and Wales. These include some of Britain's most notorious criminals, including the Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe. A number of these prisoners, including Moors murderers Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, have died in prison since being sentenced. There are also some prisoners, including police killer David Bieber, whose sentences have been reduced on appeal. Some of Britain's most notorious murderers are not among those serving whole-life sentences. These include convicted child killers Roy Whiting and Ian Huntley. Both murderers have been issued 40-year minimum terms by the High Court, which means that they are likely to remain imprisoned for most if not all of their remaining lives, while many other prisoners are in a similar position due to the length of their minimum terms and the age they will be when they can be considered for parole. Several prisoners serving whole life sentences have challenged the legality of whole life sentences in the High Court or European Court of Human Rights. These include Jeremy Bamber and Gary Vinter, whose second legal challenge to the European Court of Human Rights was successful, although the High Court later ruled that whole life sentences could still be issued as long as they were reviewed within 25 years of being issued."
