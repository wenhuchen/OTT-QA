        "Britain 's longest serving prisoner , who spent 55 years in prison until his death . Straffen was convicted of murdering two pre-teen girls in July 1951 . The following year , he escaped for a four-hour period and was convicted of murdering another girl during this short spell at large , although he long proclaimed his innocence . Straffen was reprieved from a death sentence owing to learning difficulties , and instead remained in prison for the rest of his life . He died , aged 77 , at Frankland prison in November 2007 . For the final five years of his life , he was the oldest prisoner known to be serving a whole life-tariff , following the death of Archibald Hall",

        "One of the Moors Murderers who was convicted , in May 1966 , of murdering three children between 1963 and 1965 . He was convicted just six months after the abolition of the death penalty , and less than two years after final executions in Britain . His trial judge said it was unlikely that Brady could ever be rehabilitated and suitable for parole , although that the same was not necessarily true of Hindley once removed from Brady 's influence . With accomplice Myra Hindley , he buried the children in shallow graves on Saddleworth Moor . From 1985 until his death he was held in a mental hospital and was on long-term hunger strike , which led to him being force-fed through a tube . In 2001 , he published a book on serial killing . The body of one of his victims , 12-year-old Keith Bennett , remains undiscovered on the Moor , despite Brady 's and Hindley 's own heavily guarded efforts to locate the remains themselves after they admitted two further murders in 1986 ; they did , however , guide police to the buried body of 16-year-old Pauline Reade in 1987 . In 2006 , Brady wrote to Keith Bennett 's mother to claim he remembered enough to be taken to within 20 yards of the grave , but was not permitted to do so . Brady died , aged 79 , at Ashworth Hospital in May 2017",

        "The other of the Moors Murderers , Ian Brady 's girlfriend and accomplice who was involved in all five murders with Brady . She was convicted of two of three murders which were detected in 1965 , and of being an accessory in the third murder , as she was not present when Brady committed the murder . The convictions of Brady and Hindley came just six months after the abolition of the death penalty , and less than two years after the last execution in Britain - although more than 10 years had passed since the last execution of a woman in Britain . In 1986 , she and Brady confessed to two more murders and returned to the moors to help police find the body of one of the victims , although the final body has still not been found . Hindley 's trial judge recommended she should serve at least 25 years in prison , feeling that unlike Brady there was a possibility that Hindley could be rehabilitated and suitable for parole - once removed from Brady 's influence . The 25-year minimum term was endorsed in 1982 by the Lord Chief Justice . By this stage , reports suggested that Hindley was rehabilitating in prison and had found religion and rejected Brady and her past , but her tariff was increased to 30 years in 1985 and , finally , to a whole-life tariff in 1990 , although she was not informed of the whole-life tariff until December 1994 . In 1986 , she and Brady both confessed to two additional murders and helped the police locate one of the bodies the following year . Hindley 's supporters , including penal reformer Lord Longford , journalist David Astor and prison governor Peter Timms , claimed that the increase in Hindley 's sentence was the response of a succession of Home Secretaries to public opinion , as there was widespread media and public opposition to Hindley ever being released , and similarly widespread doubt as to whether her reported remorse and rehabilitation was genuine - the fact that she had not admitted the two additional murders until 20 years into her sentence further strengthened the argument of those who felt that her remorse was nothing more than an attempt to boost her chances of parole . Relatives of the Moors Murders victims were at the centre of a campaign to keep Hindley imprisoned and several of them vowed to kill her if she was ever paroled . Hindley subsequently made three appeals against the whole life tariff , but each appeal was unsuccessful , and she died in jail at the age of 60 in November 2002 , less than two weeks before a long-anticipated law lords ' ruling which could potentially have secured her freedom . The question as to whether Hindley should ever be released prompted more debate than that of any other prisoner of notoriety , with some high-profile backing from the House of Lords , but vitriol from the press and the public , as well as the families of her victims . Lord Longford , who died just over a year before Hindley , regularly condemned the media for their exploitation of Ann West , mother of victim Lesley Ann Downey , who gave regular newspaper and television interviews to argue against any suggestion of Hindley ever being released from prison , and vowed to kill Hindley if she ever was released . Her death left only Rosemary West ( jailed for life for 10 murders in 1995 ) as a confirmed female prisoner serving a whole-life tariff , until the addition of Joanne Dennehy , in 2014",

        "Trevor Joseph Hardy murdered three teenage girls between December 1974 and March 1976 . Janet Lesley Stewart , 15 , was murdered on New Year 's Eve 1974 and buried in a shallow grave in Newton Heath , North Manchester . She had been stabbed . Wanda Skala , 17 , was murdered in July 1975 on Lightbowne Road , Moston . She was hit over the head with a paving stone and sexually assaulted . Sharon Mosoph , 17 , was murdered in March 1976 , and dumped in the Rochdale Canal at Failsworth , Oldham . She had been strangled and mutilated after walking by when Hardy was attempting to burgle a shopping centre at night . He was suspected of committing other murders . At the height of the hunt for the serial killer , 23,000 people were stopped and searched . The case is not widely known and only one independent publication exists which covers the case . Trevor Hardy was arrested for the murders of Wanda Skala and Sharon Mosoph during 1976 . In August 1976 he confessed to both murders and also to that of Janet Lesley Stewart - who until then had been a missing person . Despite the alibis provided by his girlfriend Sheilagh Farrow , Hardy was found guilty of the murders and sentenced to life imprisonment in May 1978 . He remained in prison until his death 36 years later , by which time he was one of the longest serving prisoners in Britain",

        "Robert John Maudsley ( born June 1953 ) killed four people . He committed three of these murders in prison after receiving a life sentence for a single murder in the mid 1970s . He was alleged to have eaten part of the brain of one of three men he killed in prison , which earned him the nickname Hannibal the Cannibal among the British press . He committed his first murder by strangling labourer John Farrell after he allegedly showed him pictures of children he abused and was declared not fit to stand trial and sent to Broadmoor in 1973 . In 1977 he and David Chessman took fellow patient David Francis hostage and tortured him to death and as a result was convicted of manslaughter and sent to Wakefield prison . At Wakefield in July 1978 he killed two fellow prisoners , luring Salney Darwood into his cell and slitting his throat and then smashing Bill Roberts head against a wall at a later time , this time being convicted of double murder at his trial in 1979 . He has served much of his sentence in solitary confinement to prevent him from attacking or killing any more inmates , some of it at Parkhurst prison , but mostly at Wakefield prison in a cell said to resemble Hannibal Lecter 's in the film The Silence of the Lambs with cardboard furniture . He became Britain 's longest-serving prisoner after the death of Ian Brady in May 2017",

        "The Killer Butler or Monster Butler , so named as he committed his murders while working in service to members of the British aristocracy as a butler . Hall , also known as Roy Fontaine , was a Glaswegian thief and confidence trickster with numerous convictions and prison sentences by the time he committed his first murder , of an ex-cellmate , whom he shot and buried after an argument over some jewellery stolen from Hall 's employer . Hall moved to London and began serving an elderly ex-MP and his wife , and with accomplice Michael Kitto , he killed and buried them both after late-night plans to rob them were disturbed . They then killed a female acquaintance and dumped her body in a barn after she refused to destroy a fur coat which was potentially incriminating evidence , and lastly Hall murdered his half-brother , a convicted child molester who was asking too many questions , before beginning a journey to Scotland with the intention of again burying the body . Having stopped at a hotel for the night when the weather became too hazardous for driving , Hall and Kitto were caught when the hotelier , concerned that the two suspicious-looking guests might not pay their bill , called the police . They found the body in Hall 's car boot , and Hall later showed them the three gruesome burial sites . After trials in London and Edinburgh , Hall received four life sentences and Kitto three at their trial in May 1978 , with one judge recommending that Hall should never be freed . This recommendation was upheld when the list of confirmed whole-life tariff prisoners was published , and Hall was the oldest prisoner on the list . He publicly requested the right to die in 1995 , and did so of a stroke in 2002 , while still in prison . At 78 , he was one of the oldest prisoners in Britain . Three years earlier , he had published his autobiography",

        "A fugitive who in 1983 gatecrashed a wedding reception at a house in Sheffield shortly after the bride and groom had left and stabbed to death the bride 's father , mother and brother , before raping her sister at knifepoint . Police quickly labelled him as the killer after identifying a handprint on a champagne bottle and a bitemark in a piece of cheese . He was already on the run from answering a charge of violent rape and had previous convictions for offences of violence , indecent assault and dishonesty . He was convicted in 1984 and sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommended minimum term of 18 years in September 1984 . However , he remains in prison more than 30 years on , having been issued with a whole-life tariff by the Home Secretary , Leon Brittan . Hutchinson has since appealed against this ruling twice through the High Court , but the court upheld the decision of the Home Secretary on both occasions , meaning he is likely to die in prison . Appeals to the European Court of Human Rights in February 2015 and January 2017 were also unsuccessful , with the court 's Grand Chamber ruling that whole life sentences could still be issued provided they were reviewed within 25 years",

Four members of staff were tied up , locked in a cage within the vault before being doused in white spirit and set alight . Two died , two suffered serious burns . Castigador received an initial 25-year tariff from his trial judge which was duly extended to a whole life tariff , but the November 2002 law lords ' ruling means that he could have been released from prison as early as 2015 ( by which time he would have been 61 years old ) if the parole board decided he was no longer a danger to the public , however Castigador was charged with murder on 20 June 2016 after murdering a fellow inmate . He admitted the murder and was sentenced to another whole-life tariff in October . He died in Woodhill prison in March 2017 . One of his teenage accomplices was sentenced to life with a recommended minimum of 20 years ; a subsequent appeal against this recommendation at the High Court was rejected",

        "The Gay Slayer , who set about achieving a New Year 's resolution to become a serial killer by targeting patrons of a public house frequented by gay men . Ireland pretended to be homosexual in order to be taken to each of his victims ' homes , where he took advantage of their desire for S & M activity to truss , torture and murder them , often then robbing them to cover his travelling expenses as he was unemployed . He was able to continue as police found initial difficulty in linking the killings to one perpetrator . Ireland was caught when he visited police to try and explain his sighting on closed-circuit television with his final victim , however his fingerprint was subsequently matched to one found at the man 's flat . He confessed to the other murders while in custody and pleaded guilty to all charges in court . His original recommended tariff was never publicised . Ireland remained in prison for nearly 20 years until his death on 21 February 2012 at the age of 57",

        "A paedophile who was convicted of sexual assault on boys in 1991 and 1992 but jailed for only three years after it was decided he was not dangerous enough to be held involuntarily in a Secure Hospital , against the advice of the psychiatrist . He was paroled early and committed the sexually motivated murder of seven-year-old Sean Williams in summer 1993 , for which he received a whole-life tariff ; Judge Lowry said it was not possible to envisage a time when Hatch could be released safely , so life should mean life . He remained imprisoned until his death in February 2011 ; he was found dead in his cell and it was reported that he had been murdered by another prisoner . His killer was convicted robber Damien Fowkes , who also wounded another child killer , Ian Huntley - whose crime was far more widely reported , but who did not receive a whole life sentence",

  "intro": "This is a list of prisoners who have received a whole-life order through some mechanism in jurisdictions of the United Kingdom. It has been reportedly issued in approximately 100 cases since its introduction in 1983, although some of these prisoners have since died in custody, or had their sentences reduced on appeal. There are now[when?] believed to be at least 75 prisoners currently serving whole life sentences in England and Wales. These include some of Britain's most notorious criminals, including the Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe. A number of these prisoners, including Moors murderers Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, have died in prison since being sentenced. There are also some prisoners, including police killer David Bieber, whose sentences have been reduced on appeal. Some of Britain's most notorious murderers are not among those serving whole-life sentences. These include convicted child killers Roy Whiting and Ian Huntley. Both murderers have been issued 40-year minimum terms by the High Court, which means that they are likely to remain imprisoned for most if not all of their remaining lives, while many other prisoners are in a similar position due to the length of their minimum terms and the age they will be when they can be considered for parole. Several prisoners serving whole life sentences have challenged the legality of whole life sentences in the High Court or European Court of Human Rights. These include Jeremy Bamber and Gary Vinter, whose second legal challenge to the European Court of Human Rights was successful, although the High Court later ruled that whole life sentences could still be issued as long as they were reviewed within 25 years of being issued."
