  "intro": "The New York Red Bulls are an American professional soccer club based in Harrison, New Jersey. The Red Bulls compete as a member of the Eastern Conference of Major League Soccer (MLS). The club was established in October 1994 and began play in the league's inaugural season in 1996 as the New York/New Jersey MetroStars. In 2006, the team was sold to Red Bull GmbH and re-branded as part of the company's global network of football clubs, leading to the team's current name. The Red Bulls have played their home matches at Red Bull Arena since 2010, having previously played at Giants Stadium. The club is one of two teams in MLS based in the New York metropolitan region along with New York City FC, which entered the league in 2015. The two sides compete against each other in the Hudson River Derby. The team's current head coach is former United States international midfielder Chris Armas. The Red Bulls have reached the MLS Cup final once in 2008 where they were defeated by the Columbus Crew. The club has won three regular season Supporters' Shield titles in 2013, 2015 and 2018, and has also twice reached the final of the U.S. Open Cup in 2003 and 2017, losing on both occasions."
