        "Johnston was a machine gunner attached to the Third Platoon of his company and that platoon was the furthest advanced element in the Company 's defenses . About eighty Germans advanced under the cover of an artillery barrage in the darkness and were within about 200 yards of the platoon 's positions when they were discovered by Johnston who was at his gun . He manned his machine gun and the attack was halted . All during the day , without relief , he remained with his weapon and fired at every target that presented itself . One German worked up the draw so close to the position that the machine gun could not be brought to bear upon him . Johnston drew his pistol and killed him . As the day wore on , it became evident that if the Company was to escape it would have to begin its movement . Not everyone could get out . Johnson volunteered to stay . Afterwards an artillery shell made what almost amounted to a direct hit on Johnston 's position and shell fragments penetrated into the left portion of his chest . An examination indicated that he was dying . The rapid advance of large numbers of the Germans prevented any evacuation . A few minutes later one of the last men to withdraw saw Johnston trying to crawl up to his machine gun . At Johnston 's request he was helped to his gun and left believing that he was dying . A few minutes later the Company heard the machine gun in action . It continued to fire for about 10 minutes . Afterwards the gun went silent . The Germans passed him as he lay in his position , and , believing him to be dead , stole his shoes . The next day , he painfully worked his way through the German lines to the 180th Regiment , after having been reported by the Company as killed in action . Despite his weakened condition , he gave accurate and vital information about the German positions on the base of which effective firing that was compiled",

  "intro": "This is a list of Medal of Honor recipients for World War II. The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War and is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States or an opposing foreign force. Due to the nature of this medal, it is commonly presented posthumously. World War II, or the Second World War, was a global military conflict, the joining of what had initially been two separate conflicts. The first began in Asia in 1937 as the Second Sino-Japanese War; the other began in Europe in 1939 with the German and Soviet invasion of Poland. This global conflict split the majority of the world's nations into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. The United States was drawn into World War II on December 8, 1941, a day after the Axis-member Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in Honolulu that killed almost 2,500 people in what was considered the biggest peacetime loss on American soil inflicted by foreign people at that time. For actions during World War II, 472 United States military personnel received the Medal of Honor. Seventeen of these were Japanese-Americans fighting in both Europe and the Pacific, many of which were upgraded from Distinguished Service Crosses during the Clinton administration. Additionally, Douglas Albert Munro was the only serviceman from the United States Coast Guard in United States military history to receive the Medal for his actions during the war. The earliest action for which a U.S. serviceman earned a World War II Medal of Honor was the attack on Pearl Harbor, for which 17 U.S. servicemen were awarded a Medal, although they did so while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force rather than enemy since the United States was neutral during the events of December 7, 1941."
