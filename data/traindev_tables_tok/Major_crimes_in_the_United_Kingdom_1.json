The reconstruction and the matching of DNA in the body to that of Price 's parents allowed her body to be identified . The case was cited as one of the first instances in which DNA technology was used in this way . The police later concluded that Price had run away from home and turned to prostitution . In 1991 , Idris Ali and Alan Charlton , who were alleged to have managed her solicitation as a prostitute , were charged with her murder . Ali 's charge was eventually reduced to manslaughter , and he was released in 1994 . Charlton is still serving a life sentence",
