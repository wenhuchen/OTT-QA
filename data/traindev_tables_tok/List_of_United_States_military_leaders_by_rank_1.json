  "section_text": "The officers listed below are generally accepted in military history circles as the top twenty five officers of all time in United States military history [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Alexander Vandegrift is also frequently included in historical seniority lists due to his status as the first Commandant of the Marine Corps to hold a four-star rank , as is Anna Mae Hays who was the first woman to be promoted to brigadier general in the history of the United States . Historical seniority is rarely referred to after the Korean War since modern military seniority systems had been well-established after the mid 20th century . Expanded seniority lists such as the one listed below do exist mostly in recognition of major military leaders of modern wars and conflicts .",

  "intro": "United States military seniority is the method by which the United States Armed Forces determines precedence among commissioned officers, in particular those who hold the same rank. Seniority is used to determine assignments, tactical commands, promotions and general courtesy. To a lesser extent, historical seniority is used to recognize status of honor given to early United States military leaders such as inaugural holders of certain ranks or those officers who served as leadership during major wars and armed conflicts."
