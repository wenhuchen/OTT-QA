  "intro": "The 2013 Canadian Soccer League season was the 16th since its establishment where a total of 21 teams from Ontario took part in the league. The season began on May 3, 2013, and concluded on November 3, 2013. SC Waterloo captured their first championship in a 3-1 victory over regular season champions Kingston FC in the CSL Championship final at Kalar Sports Park in Niagara, Ontario. Waterloo became the first club to win both the First & Second Division championships in one season. While Toronto Croatia B won the second division regular season title. The 2013 season was a controversial year where the Canadian Soccer Association unexpectedly and immediately de-sanctioned the CSL, which was a member in good standing without due process just two months before the commencement of their season. The CSA`s stated reasons were in order to implement the James Easton Report (Rethink Management Group Report) for the adoption of a new semi-professional soccer structure. In response to the move conducted by the CSA the league appealed to the Sport Dispute Resolution Centre of Canada (SDRCC), where the sport arbitrator ruled that the CSA have the right to de-sanction the CSL, but ruled that the immediate decisions and actions conducted by the CSA were unreasonable and coercive. Which forced the governing body to reinstate sanctioning to the CSL until the next season in order for the CSA to work with all existing leagues to fairly implement the Easton Report. Another controversial moment occurred when before any official CSA or CSL news statement was released the CBC issued an article written by Ben Rycroft which contained only anonymous sources that the CSA decided to no longer sanction the CSL primarily based on the alleged reports of match fixing in the league. During the SDRCC hearing a notable admission was done by CSA president Victor Montagliani, where he stated that the decision to de-sanction the CSL was not made on any alleged grounds of match fixing in the CSL but strictly on the decision made by the CSA board of directors to adopt a new soccer structure in Canada. The aftermath of the sanctioning issue resulted in a decrease in teams in both the first & second divisions as the two MLS academy clubs along with Brantford Galaxy, Mississauga Eagles FC, and SC Toronto left the league after the confusion and damage done by the CSA in their immediate de-sanctioning of the CSL."
