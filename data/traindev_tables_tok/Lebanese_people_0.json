  "section_text": "Main article : Lebanese diaspora Rima Fakih , winner of Miss USA 2010 Carlos Ghosn Amal Clooney The Lebanese diaspora consists of approximately 8.6 [ 2 ] - 14 [ 3 ] million , both Lebanese-born living abroad and those born-abroad of Lebanese descent . The majority of the Lebanese in the diaspora are Christians , [ 43 ] disproportionately so in the Americas where the vast majority reside . An estimate figure show that they represent about 75% of the Lebanese in total . Lebanese abroad are considered `` rich , educated and influential '' [ 44 ] and over the course of time immigration has yielded Lebanese `` commercial networks '' throughout the world . [ 45 ] The largest number of Lebanese is to be found in Brazil , where according to the Brazilian and Lebanese governments claim , there are 7 million Brazilians of Lebanese descent . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] These figures , however , may be an exaggeration given that , according to a 2008 survey conducted by IBGE , in 2008 , covering only the states of Amazonas , Para\u00edba , S\u00e3o Paulo , Rio Grande do Sul , Mato Grosso and Distrito Federal , 0.9% of white Brazilian respondents said they had family origins in the Middle East [ 5 ] Large numbers also reside elsewhere in North America , most notably in the United States ( 489,702 ) [ 46 ] and in Canada , the people of full or partial Lebanese descent are between 190,275 ( by ancestry , 2011 Census ) [ 47 ] to 250,000 based on estimates . [ 14 ] In the rest of the Americas , significant communities are found in Argentina , [ 9 ] Mexico ( 400,000 ) ; [ 48 ] Chile , [ 49 ] Colombia [ 10 ] and Venezuela , with almost every other Latin American country having at least a small presence . In Africa , Ghana and the Ivory Coast are home to over 100,000 Lebanese . [ 50 ] There are significant Lebanese populations in other countries throughout Western and Central Africa . [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Australia hosts over 180,000 and Canada 250,000 . In the Arab world , the Arab states of the Persian Gulf harbour around 400,000 Lebanese . [ 53 ] Lebanese people also can be found in all of the 28 member states of the European Union . More than 2,500 ex-SLA members remain in Israel . [ 54 ] Currently , Lebanon provides no automatic right to Lebanese citizenship for emigrants who lost their citizenship upon acquiring the citizenship of their host country , nor for the descendants of emigrants born abroad . This situation disproportionately affects Christians . Recently , the Maronite Institution of Emigrants called for the establishment of an avenue by which emigrants who lost their citizenship may regain it , or their overseas-born descendants ( if they so wish ) may acquire it . [ 55 ] The list below contains approximate figures for people of Lebanese descent by country of residence , largely taken from the iLoubnan diaspora map . [ 15 ] Additional reliable cites have been provided where possible . Additional estimates have been included where they can be cited ; where applicable , these are used in place of the iLoubnan figures . The Figure below uses the data from the list and calculates the amount of Lebanese residents as a percentage of the total population of the respective country .",

  "intro": "The Lebanese people (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0639\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646\u064a / ALA-LC: ash-sha\u02bbb al-Lubn\u0101n\u012b, Lebanese Arabic pronunciation: [e\u0283\u02c8\u0283\u00e6\u0295eb ell\u026ab\u02c8ne\u02d0ne]) are the people inhabiting or originating from Lebanon. The term may also include those who had inhabited Mount Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon mountains prior to the creation of the modern Lebanese state. The major religious groups among the Lebanese people within Lebanon are Shia Muslims (27%), Sunni Muslims (27%), Maronite Christians (21%), Greek Orthodox Christians (8%), Melkite Christians (5%), Druze (5.6%), Protestant Christians (1%). The largest contingent of Lebanese, however, comprise a diaspora in North America, South America, Europe, Australia and Africa, which is predominantly Maronite Christian. As the relative proportion of the various sects is politically sensitive, Lebanon has not collected official census data on ethnic background since the 1932 under the French Mandate. It is therefore difficult to have an exact demographic analysis of Lebanese society. The largest concentration of people of Lebanese ancestry may be in Brazil having an estimated population of 5.8 to 7 million, but it may be an exaggeration, given that an official survey conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) showed that less than 1 million Brazilians claimed any Middle-Eastern origin. The Lebanese have always traveled the world, many of them settling permanently, most notably in the last two centuries. Estimated to have lost their status as the majority in Lebanon itself, with their reduction in numbers largely as a result of their emigration, Christians still remain one of the principal religious groups in the country. Descendants of Lebanese Christians make up the majority of Lebanese people worldwide, appearing principally in the diaspora."
