  "section_title": "Treasures -- Armour",
  "section_text": "Armour has been employed in battles in Japan since the Yayoi period . Some of the oldest extant items from the 4th to the 7th centuries were excavated from kofun and have been designated as archaeological National Treasures . These ancient armours were of two types : a tight fitting solid plate cuirass ( tank\u014d ) and a skirted lamellar type ( keik\u014d ) , both believed to be based on Chinese or Korean prototypes . [ 135 ] [ 136 ] [ 137 ] This list includes more recent pieces of armour , developed as result of a trend toward ( lamellar ) scale armour that began in Japan in the 6th to the 7th centuries and matured in the mid-Heian period ( 9th to 10th centuries ) . [ 138 ] Combining materials such as leather and silk with iron or steel parts , these armours had the advantage of being light , flexible , foldable and shock absorbent . They were generally lacquered to protect them from the humid climate and were used widely from the late Heian period to the mid-14th century . [ 136 ] [ 138 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ] A complete set consisted of a helmet , mask , neck guard , throat protector , breastplate with shoulder guards , sleeve armour , skirt , greaves , shoes and a pennant attached to the back . [ 141 ] [ 142 ] During this time , there were two popular kinds of armour : the \u014d-yoroi ( lit . `` great armour '' ) with a boxlike appearance , mainly worn by high-ranking samurai on horseback , and the lighter and more flexible d\u014d-maru that wrapped around the body and was initially worn by lower-ranking foot soldiers . [ 143 ] [ 144 ] [ 145 ] The \u014d-yoroi was made of leather and iron lames bound together in horizontal layers , ornamented and reinforced with leather , silk and gilt metal . [ 140 ] It originated around the 10th century but was only commonly used starting with the Genpei War at the end of the 12th century . [ 146 ] Being the most complete and elaborate Japanese armour , it was also worn for ceremonies . [ 147 ] The tighter fitting d\u014d-maru , developed in the 11th century , was generally made of a combination of leather and metal and did not include a solid breastplate or sleeves . [ 145 ] [ 146 ] In many cases its armour plates were replaced with scales of metal , leather or whalebone laced together with silk or leather cords . [ 148 ] Even though it was a plainer armour compared to the \u014d-yoroi , upper class samurai started to adopt it around 1300 , as battles began to be fought on foot favouring a more comfortable suit . [ 143 ] [ 146 ] [ 149 ] Three d\u014d-maru , fifteen \u014d-yoroi armours and one pair of gauntlets have been designated as National Treasures . Most of the items include a helmet and large sleeve protectors . [ 4 ]",

  "intro": "The term National Treasure has been used in Japan to denote cultural properties since 1897,\nalthough the definition and the criteria have changed since the introduction of the term. The crafts items in the list adhere to the current definition and have been designated National Treasures according to the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties that came into effect on June 9, 1951. The items are selected by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology based on their especially high historical or artistic value. The list presents 131 entries from Classical to early modern Japan, spanning from the 7th century Asuka to the 18th century Edo period. The number of items is higher, however, since groups of related objects have been joined as single entries. The listed objects are of many types and include household goods, objects related to Buddhism, armour and harnesses. Some of the oldest objects were imported from China at the time. The listed items consist of materials such as wood over clay or to bronze. Often the articles were decorated using a variety of artistic techniques like gilding of precious metals, line engraving, maki-e, mother of pearl inlay or lacquer. The objects are housed in Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines or museums. The objects in this list represent about half of the 253 National Treasures in the category crafts. They are complemented by 110 swords and 12 Japanese sword mountings National Treasures of the List of National Treasures of Japan (crafts: swords)."
