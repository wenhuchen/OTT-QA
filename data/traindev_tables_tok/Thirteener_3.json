  "intro": "In mountaineering in the United States, a thirteener is a mountain that exceeds above mean sea level, similar to the more familiar fourteeners, which exceed . In most instances, thirteeners refers only to those peaks between 13,000 and 13,999 feet in elevation. The importance of thirteeners is greatest in Colorado, which has the majority of such peaks in North America with over 600 of them. Despite the large number of peaks, over 20 peak baggers have reported climbing all of Colorado's thirteeners. Thirteeners are also significant in states whose highpoints fall between 13,000 and 13,999 feet. Regarding whether or not peaks in excess of 13,999 feet should be considered as thirteeners, this article will count them as such for statistical purposes, but concentrate its focus on those peaks less than 14,000 feet since the higher peaks are already covered in the fourteeners list. Not all summits over 13,000 feet qualify as thirteeners, but only those summits that mountaineers consider to be independent. Objective standards for independence include topographic prominence and isolation (distance from a higher summit), or a combination. However thirteener lists do not always consistently use such objective rules. A rule commonly used by mountaineers in the contiguous United States is that a peak must have at least of prominence to qualify. According to the Mountaineering Club of Alaska, it is standard in Alaska to use a prominence rule rather than a 300-foot rule. These are the standards applied for the lists below."
