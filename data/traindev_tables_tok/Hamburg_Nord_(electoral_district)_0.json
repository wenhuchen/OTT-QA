  "intro": "Hamburg Nord (English: Hamburg north) is one of the 299 single member constituencies used for the German parliament, the Bundestag. Located in the north of Hamburg, the district was created for the 1980 election, combining parts of the abolished Hamburg Nord I and Hamburg Nord II districts. The first two elections in 1980 and 1983 were won by the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), the constituency was then represented by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) from 1987 to 1998 when it was regained by the SPD. The constituency was then regained by the CDU at the 2009 election. The current MP is Dirk Fischer, who had previously represented the constituency from 1987 to 1998."
