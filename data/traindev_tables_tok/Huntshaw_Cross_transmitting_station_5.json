  "intro": "Huntshaw Cross transmitting station is a telecommunications facility serving North Devon including the towns of Barnstaple and South Molton. It broadcasts television, radio and mobile telephone services and is currently owned by Arqiva. It is located on the B3232 road at Huntshaw, Great Torrington. Grid reference SS527220. The mast is 164 metres (538 ft) high. The site was opened by the Independent Television Authority on 22 April 1968 carrying the ITV programmes of Westward Television using the now defunct 405 line VHF transmission system. In this context, the site was treated as an off-air relay of Stockland Hill. 625 line UHF colour TV transmissions commenced on 5 November 1973. The high power output of the UHF transmitter and its location allowed its signal to be received clearly in parts of south Wales. From 1985 and before Freeview it became a popular transmitter from which to receive Channel 4 which was not broadcast on Welsh transmitters (Channel 4 launched in 1982, but wasn't available from Huntshaw Cross until the summer of 1985). Evidence of this can easily be seen in Swansea (for instance) where many Group C/D TV aerials can be seen pointing south, across the water. The 405-line transmissions from Huntshaw Cross were discontinued in the 2nd quarter of 1983, somewhat before the final UK-wide shutdown of the VHF system in January 1985."
