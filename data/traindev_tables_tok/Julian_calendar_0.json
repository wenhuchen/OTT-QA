  "section_title": "New Year 's Day",
  "section_text": "The Roman calendar began the year on 1 January , and this remained the start of the year after the Julian reform . However , even after local calendars were aligned to the Julian calendar , they started the new year on different dates . The Alexandrian calendar in Egypt started on 29 August ( 30 August after an Alexandrian leap year ) . Several local provincial calendars were aligned to start on the birthday of Augustus , 23 September . The indiction caused the Byzantine year , which used the Julian calendar , to begin on 1 September ; this date is still used in the Eastern Orthodox Church for the beginning of the liturgical year . When the Julian calendar was adopted in AD 988 by Vladimir I of Kiev , the year was numbered Anno Mundi 6496 , beginning on 1 March , six months after the start of the Byzantine Anno Mundi year with the same number . In 1492 ( AM 7000 ) , Ivan III , according to church tradition , realigned the start of the year to 1 September , so that AM 7000 only lasted for six months in Russia , from 1 March to 31 August 1492 . [ 82 ] During the Middle Ages 1 January retained the name New Year 's Day ( or an equivalent name ) in all western European countries ( affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church ) , since the medieval calendar continued to display the months from January to December ( in twelve columns containing 28 to 31 days each ) , just as the Romans had . However , most of those countries began their numbered year on 25 December ( the Nativity of Jesus ) , 25 March ( the Incarnation of Jesus ) , or even Easter , as in France ( see the Liturgical year article for more details ) . In Anglo-Saxon England , the year most commonly began on 25 December , which , as ( approximately ) the winter solstice , had marked the start of the year in pagan times , though 25 March ( the equinox ) is occasionally documented in the 11th century . Sometimes the start of the year was reckoned as 24 September , the start of the so-called `` western indiction '' introduced by Bede . [ 83 ] These practices changed after the Norman conquest . From 1087 to 1155 the English year began on 1 January , and from 1155 to 1751 began on 25 March . [ 84 ] In 1752 it was moved back to 1 January . ( See Calendar ( New Style ) Act 1750 ) . Even before 1752 , 1 January was sometimes treated as the start of the new year \u2013 for example by Pepys [ 85 ] \u2013 while the `` year starting 25th March was called the Civil or Legal Year '' . [ 86 ] To reduce misunderstandings on the date , it was not uncommon for a date between 1 January and 24 March to be written as `` 1661/62 '' . This was to explain to the reader that the year was 1661 counting from March and 1662 counting from January as the start of the year . [ 87 ] ( For more detail , see Dual dating ) . Most western European countries shifted the first day of their numbered year to 1 January while they were still using the Julian calendar , before they adopted the Gregorian calendar , many during the 16th century . The following table shows the years in which various countries adopted 1 January as the start of the year . Eastern European countries , with populations showing allegiance to the Orthodox Church , began the year on 1 September from about 988 . The Rumi calendar used in the Ottoman Empire began the civil year on 1 March until 1918 .",
  "uid": "Julian_calendar_0",
  "intro": "The Julian calendar, proposed by Julius Caesar in 708 Ab urbe condita (46 BC), was a reform of the Roman calendar. It took effect on 1 January 709 AUC (45 BC), by edict. It was designed with the aid of Greek mathematicians and Greek astronomers such as Sosigenes of Alexandria. The calendar was the predominant calendar in the Roman world, most of Europe, and in European settlements in the Americas and elsewhere, until it was gradually replaced by the Gregorian calendar, promulgated in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. The Julian calendar is still used in parts of the Eastern Orthodox Church and in parts of Oriental Orthodoxy as well as by the Berbers. During the 20th and 21st centuries, a date according to the Julian calendar is 13 days earlier than its corresponding Gregorian date."
