  "section_text": "Historically AFL broadcasts in other countries have varied . In the 1980s , VFL matches were shown in the United States on ESPN for some time . In the early 1990s , Prime Network , an American regional sports network unrelated to the Australian regional television network , aired Seven 's weekly highlight show as well as the Grand Final . Some other English speaking countries have shown the game , however it has been since 2008 that channels in other countries began televising matches . From 1998 to 2006 games were broadcast in the United States by the Fox Sports World network . [ 75 ] In 2007 , after the record domestic television rights deal , the AFL secured an additional bonus : greater international television rights and increase exposure to overseas markets , including a five-year deal with Setanta Sports and new deals with other overseas pay-TV networks . The deal ended early in 2009 when Setanta stopped broadcasting into Great Britain . ESPN again took up the contract . [ 76 ] The following countries are ranked by the approximate extent of their current television coverage ( and whether it is free to air ) :",

  "intro": "The Australian Football League (AFL) is the pre-eminent and only fully professional men's competition of Australian rules football. Through the AFL Commission, the AFL also serves as the sport's governing body, and is responsible for controlling the laws of the game. Originally known as the Victorian Football League (VFL), it was founded in 1896 as a breakaway competition from the Victorian Football Association (VFA), with its inaugural season commencing the following year. The VFL, aiming to become a national competition, began expanding beyond Victoria to other Australian states in the 1980s, and changed its name to the AFL in 1990. The league currently consists of 18 teams spread over five of Australia's six states (Tasmania being the exception). Matches have been played in all states and mainland territories of Australia, as well as in New Zealand and China to promote the sport abroad. The AFL season currently consists of a 23-round regular (or home-and-away) season, which runs during the Australian winter (March to September). The team with the best record after the home-and-away series is awarded the minor premiership. The top eight teams then play off in a four-round finals series, culminating in the AFL Grand Final, which is held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground each year. The grand final winner is termed the premiers, and is awarded the premiership cup. The current premiers are Richmond."
