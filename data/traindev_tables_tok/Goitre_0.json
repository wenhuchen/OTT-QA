  "section_title": "Causes",
  "section_text": "Worldwide , the most common cause for goitre is iodine deficiency , commonly seen in countries that scarcely use iodized salt . Selenium deficiency is also considered a contributing factor . In countries that use iodized salt , Hashimoto 's thyroiditis is the most common cause . [ 5 ] Goitre can also result from cyanide poisoning ; this is particularly common in tropical countries where people eat the cyanide-rich cassava root as the staple food . [ 6 ]",
  "uid": "Goitre_0",
  "intro": "A goitre, or goiter, is a swelling in the neck resulting from an enlarged thyroid gland. A goitre can be associated with a thyroid that is not functioning properly. Worldwide, over 90% of goitre cases are caused by iodine deficiency. The term is from the Latin gutturia, meaning throat. Most goitres are of a benign nature."
