  "intro": "CBC Television is a Canadian English language public television network made up of fourteen owned-and-operated stations. Some privately owned stations were formerly affiliated with the network until as late as August 2016. This is a table listing of CBC Television's stations, arranged by market. This article also includes former self-supporting stations later operating as rebroadcasters of regional affiliates, stations no longer affiliated with CBC Television, and stations purchased by the CBC that formerly operated as private CBC Television affiliates. The station's virtual channel number (if applicable) follows the call letters. The number in parentheses that follows is the station's actual digital channel number; digital channels allocated for future use listed in parentheses are italicized. CBC Television's O&Os operate for the most part as a seamless national service, with few deviations from the national schedule. The network's former private affiliates had some flexibility to carry a reduced schedule of network programming if they chose. Over the years the CBC has gradually reduced the number of private affiliates; until 2006 this usually involved either opening a new station (or new rebroadcast transmitters) in a market previously served by a private affiliate, or purchasing the affiliate outright. In most cases since 2006 (when CFJC-TV disaffiliated), it declined to open new rebroadcasters in the affected markets for budgetary reasons, and since then has wound down its remaining affiliation agreements, with the last expiring on August 31, 2016. These disaffiliations, along with the CBC's decision to shut down its TV rebroadcaster network in 2012, have significantly reduced the network's terrestrial coverage; however, under Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) regulations, all cable, satellite, and IPTV service providers are required to include a CBC Television signal in their basic service, even if one is not available terrestrially in the applicable service area. Since September 2014, all CBC Television O&Os have also been separately affiliated with the temporary and (since April 2015) permanent part-time networks operated by Rogers Media for the purposes of distributing the Rogers-produced Hockey Night in Canada broadcasts."
