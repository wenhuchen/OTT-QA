  "intro": "Playland is an amusement park in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is located in Hastings Park and is the oldest amusement park in Canada. The regular season lasts from May to the end of September every year. The park reopens for Fright Nights from mid October to the Halloween weekend. Playland usually adds a new ride every year and the park is always near capacity during the Fair. For the 2015 season, the park added Canada's most extreme pendulum ride, The Beast. Playland and its renting partner Pacific National Exhibition (PNE) collectively host an annual fair for the residents of Metro Vancouver. Talent shows, Animal Races, Demolition Derbies, Monster Trucks, agricultural demonstrations, and many foods/snacks are a few of the many interesting events found at the fair. During this time, rides are brought in from West Coast Amusements nearly doubling the number of rides."
