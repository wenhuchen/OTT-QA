  "section_title": "Natural gas power stations",
  "section_text": "Michigan has some of its own natural gas production and is a leading state for natural gas transport and storage . Declining prices for natural gas in the early 21st century led to an increase in the number of natural gas power plants . Consumers Power announced a new 700 MW plant to be built near Flint beginning about 2015 [ 12 ] while the city of Holland replaced its coal plant with a 114 MW natural gas plant [ 13 ] In April 2018 , DTE received permission for a 1,100 MW natural gas plant to replace a coal plant in St . Clair . [ 14 ]",
  "uid": "List_of_power_stations_in_Michigan_4",
  "intro": "This is a list of electricity-generating power stations in Michigan, sorted by type and name. In 2010, Michigan had a total summer capacity of 29,831 MW through all of its power plants. Michigan's energy mix in 2009 was 66% coal, 22% nuclear, 8% natural gas and 3% renewables but coal use has rapidly decreased with natural gas and renewables increasing. The leading source of renewable energy was wind power. Michigan imports all of its coal and nuclear fuel and 82% of its natural gas. A requirement to produce 10% of its electricity from in-state renewables by 2015 has led to the construction of new solar, wind and landfill gas plants. Major electric companies in Michigan are Detroit Edison (11,000 MW) and Consumers Power (9,000 MW). In 2014 Michigan produced 50% of its electricity from coal."
