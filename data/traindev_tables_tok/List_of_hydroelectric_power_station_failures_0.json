[ 7 ] The installation shifted about 2m within the base of the 180m high earth and rock fill gravity dam wall of the 3,906GL reservoir . After initial consternation regarding the integrity of the wall ( declared safe after lengthy assessment ) , the hydro installation was repaired/replaced but was off-line for several years . A breach of the wall would have obliterated only a couple of small towns and a sparsely settled agricultural area in the relatively narrow 120 km Mitta Mitta valley below the dam , but more significantly , would have resulted in the over-topping and probable failure of the earthen walls of the 40m high 3,038GL Lake Hume , 200 km downstream on the Murray River . This is immediately upstream of the regional cities of Albury and Wodonga and a much more intensively settled irrigation area , and consequences would have been disastrous"

  "intro": "This is a list of major hydroelectric power station failures due to damage to a hydroelectric power station or its connections. Every generating station trips from time to time due to minor defects and can usually be restarted when the defect has been remedied. Various protections are built into the stations to cause shutdown before major damage is caused. Some hydroelectric power station failures may go beyond the immediate loss of generation capacity, including destruction of the turbine itself, reservoir breach and significant destruction of national grid infrastructure downstream. These can take years to remedy in some cases. Where a generating station is large compared to the connected grid capacity, any failure can cause extensive disruption with in the network. A serious failure in a proportionally large hydroelectric generating station or its associated transmission line will remove a large block of power from the grid that may lead to widespread disturbances."
