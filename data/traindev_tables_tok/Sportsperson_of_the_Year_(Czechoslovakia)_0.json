  "intro": "Sportsperson of the Year (Czech: Sportovec roku, Slovak: \u0160portovec roka) was a prize awarded annually to the best athletes of Czechoslovakia from 1959 to 1992 by the Club of Czechoslovak Sports Journalists. The first winner was white-water canoer Vladim\u00edr Jir\u00e1sek. From 1961 the prize was also given to the best sports team; the first team recipient was the Czechoslovakia national ice hockey team. Since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the prize has continued in both successor countries as the Sportsperson of the Year of the Czech Republic and the Sportsperson of the Year of Slovakia. The individual prize was usually awarded to a single sportsperson, but on two occasions, two people received it - Eva Romanov\u00e1 and Pavel Roman (ice dancers) in 1962, and the Posp\u00ed\u0161il brothers (cycle-ball players) in 1979. The prize was given to 28 different athletes, 22 men and 6 women, in 23 sports disciplines. Gymnast V\u011bra \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 won the prize four times, the most of any sportsperson. She was also the only one to have received it in three consecutive years (from 1966 to 1968). Six people were awarded the prize more than once. The team prize was won by teams in 12 sport disciplines; all winners but one were national teams. The only time members of a sports club team were awarded the Sportsperson of the Year was the Dukla Prague handball team, in 1963. Ice hockey teams were given the award six times - most of all disciplines."
