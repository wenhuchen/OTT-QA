  "section_title": "Club for Growth PAC -- 2006",
  "section_text": "The original Club 's PAC supported the electoral bids of freshmen U.S . Congressman Adrian Smith ( R-NE ) , Doug Lamborn [ 67 ] ( R-CO ) , Bill Sali [ 68 ] ( R-ID ) , and Tim Walberg [ 69 ] ( R-MI ) , who all were elected . Congressional Quarterly wrote that Smith 's views did not differ greatly from those of his primary election rivals , but the endorsement of the Club for Growth 's PAC `` gave him the imprimatur of the most fiscally conservative candidate , and it helped boost him to the top of the campaign fundraising competition . `` [ 70 ] In the 2006 primaries , the Club 's PAC recommended to its donors that they support incumbent Democratic Congressman Henry Cuellar ( D-TX ) , the first time the Club 's PAC recommended support for a Democrat . Cuellar won the primary race against former Congressman Ciro Rodriguez . [ 6 ] The Club 's PAC endorsed four candidates for U.S. Senate , including Mike Bouchard in Michigan , Mike McGavick in Washington , Michael Steele in Maryland , and Stephen Laffey in Rhode Island , who did not win . [ 6 ] Support by the Club 's PAC was not a guarantee of success : its candidate Sharron Angle was defeated in the Republican primary in Nevada 's 2nd congressional district , although it spent more than $ 1 million on her campaign . [ 71 ] The Club 's PAC also supported primary campaigns of Phil Krinkie in Minnesota and Kevin Calvey in Oklahoma , who lost , as did incumbent congressman Chris Chocola in Indiana , [ 13 ] John Gard in Wisconsin , and Rick O'Donnell in Colorado . [ 72 ] The Club 's PAC supported the reelection of Steve Chabot in Ohio .",

  "intro": "The Club for Growth is a 501(c)(4) conservative organization active in the United States, with an agenda focused on cutting taxes and other economic issues. The Club has two political arms: an affiliated traditional political action committee, called the Club for Growth PAC, and Club for Growth Action, an independent-expenditure only committee or Super-PAC. According to its website, the Club for Growth's policy goals include cutting income tax rates, repealing the estate tax, supporting limited government and a balanced budget amendment, entitlement reform, free trade, tort reform, school choice, and deregulation. The group has opposed government action to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The Club for Growth PAC endorses and raises money for candidates who meet its standards for fiscal conservatism. According to Politico, The Club for Growth is the pre-eminent institution promoting Republican adherence to a free-market, free-trade, anti-regulation agenda."
