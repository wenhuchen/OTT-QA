The Caribbean cruising industry is one of the largest in the world , responsible for over $ 2 billion in direct revenue to the Caribbean islands in 2012 . [ 57 ] Over 45,000 people from the Caribbean are directly employed in the cruise industry . [ 57 ] An estimated 17,457,600 cruise passengers visited the islands in the 2011-2012 cruise year ( May 2011 to April 2012 . [ 57 ] ) Cruise lines operating in the Caribbean include Royal Caribbean International , Princess Cruises , Carnival Cruise Line , Celebrity Cruises , Disney Cruise Line , Holland America , P & O , Cunard , Crystal Cruises , Pullmantur Cruises and Norwegian Cruise Line . There are also smaller cruise lines that cater to a more intimate feeling among their guests . The three largest cruise operators are Carnival Corporation , Royal Caribbean International , and Star Cruises/Norwegian Cruise Lines . Many American cruise lines to the Caribbean depart out of the Port of Miami , with `` nearly one-third of the cruises sailing out of Miami in recent years '' . [ 58 ] Other cruise ships depart from Port Everglades ( in Fort Lauderdale ) , Port Canaveral ( approximately 45 miles ( 72 km ) east of Orlando ) , New York , Tampa , Galveston , New Orleans , Cape Liberty , Baltimore , Jacksonville , Charleston , Norfolk , Mobile , and San Juan , Puerto Rico . Some UK cruise lines base their ships out of Barbados for the Caribbean season , operating direct charter flights out of the UK . The busiest ports of call in the Caribbean for cruising in the 2013 year are listed below [ 59 ]",

  "intro": "A cruise ship is generally a large passenger ship used for ocean voyages in which the voyage itself, the ship's amenities, and usually the different destinations (ports of call) along the way each form part of the passengers' experience. There are also smaller river cruise ships. Transportation from one port or another is usually not the main purpose of the voyage. Voyages that return passengers to their originating port are sometimes known as closed-loop cruises. On cruises to nowhere or nowhere voyages, cruise ships make two- to three-night round trips without visiting any ports of call. In contrast, the few dedicated transport-oriented ocean liners that remain typically transport passengers from one point to another, rather than on round trips. Historically, shipping lines built liners for the transoceanic trade to a higher standard than that of a typical cruise ship, with higher freeboard and stronger plating to withstand rough seas and adverse conditions encountered in the open North Atlantic ocean. Some former ocean liners, such as Marco Polo, now operate as cruise ships, although their number is diminishing. [citation needed] The only dedicated transatlantic ocean liner in operation as of December 2013 was Queen Mary 2 of the Cunard Line, which features amenities of contemporary cruise ships and sees significant service on cruises. Although often luxurious, ocean liners had characteristics that made them unsuitable for cruising: high fuel consumption, deep draughts that prevented them entering shallow ports, enclosed weatherproof decks inappropriate for tropical weather, and cabins designed to maximize passenger numbers rather than comfort. The gradual evolution of passenger-ship design from ocean liners to cruise ships saw passenger cabins shifted from inside the hull to the superstructure and provided with private verandas. Modern cruise ships, while sacrificing some qualities of seaworthiness, have added amenities to cater to water tourists, with recent vessels being described as balcony-laden floating condominiums."
