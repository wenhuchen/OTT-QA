  "section_text": "Men from Minangkabau , West Sumatra A troupe of Bahau Dayak performers during the Hudoq festival ( Harvest festival ) in Samarinda , the Residency of South and East Kalimantan , Indonesia . ( Taken c. 1898\u20131900 ) Pribumi make up about 95% of the Indonesian population . [ 1 ] Using Indonesia \u2019 s population estimate in 2006 , this translates to about 230 million people . As an umbrella of similar cultural heritage among various ethnic groups in Indonesia , Pribumi culture plays a significant role in shaping the country \u2019 s socioeconomic circumstance . The United States Library of Congress Country Study of Indonesia defines Pribumi as : .mw-parser-output .templatequote { overflow : hidden ; margin:1em 0 ; padding:0 40px } .mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite { line-height:1.5em ; text-align : left ; padding-left:1.6em ; margin-top:0 } Literally , an indigene , or native . In the colonial era , the great majority of the population of the archipelago came to regard themselves as indigenous , in contrast to the non-indigenous Dutch and Chinese ( and , to a degree , Arab ) communities . After independence the distinction persisted , expressed as a dichotomy between elements that were pribumi and those that were not . The distinction has had significant implications for economic development policy \u2014 Indonesia : A Country Study , Glossary [ 18 ] There are over 300 ethnic groups in Indonesia , [ 19 ] of which 200 are of Native Indonesian ancestry . The largest ethnic group in Indonesia are the Javanese people who make up 41% of the total population . The Javanese are concentrated on the island of Java but millions have migrated to other islands throughout the archipelago . [ 20 ] The Sundanese , Malay , and Madurese are the next largest groups in the country . [ 20 ] Many ethnic groups , particularly in Kalimantan and the province of Papua , have only hundreds of members . Most of the local languages belong to the Austronesian language family , although a significant number , particularly in North Maluku and West Papua , speak Papuan languages . The division and classification of ethnic groups in Indonesia is not rigid and in some cases are unclear as the result of migrations , along with cultural and linguistic influences ; for example some [ who ? ] may agree that the Bantenese and Cirebonese belong to different ethnic groups with their own distinct dialect , however others [ who ? ] might consider them to be Javanese sub-ethnicities , as members of the larger Javanese people . The same considerations may apply to the Baduy people who share so many similarities with the Sundanese people that they can be considered as belonging to the same ethnic group . The clearest example of hybrid ethnicity are the Betawi people , the result of a mixture of different native ethnicities that have merged with people of Arab , Chinese and Indian origins since the era of colonial Batavia ( Jakarta ) . Several major ethno-linguistic groups of Indonesia The proportional populations of Native Indonesians according to the ( 2009 census ) is as follows :",

  "intro": "Native Indonesians, also Pribumi (literally first on the soil), is a term used to distinguish Indonesians whose ancestral roots lie mainly in the archipelago from Indonesians of known (partial) foreign descent, like Chinese Indonesians and Indo-Europeans (Eurasians)."
