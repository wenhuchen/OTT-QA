Bond back to Boeing to assist with the BEST SOX compliance due to her effectiveness in 2006 . He contacted her again in October 2007 to recruit her as a permanent employee . Ms . Bond became a contractor employee again in November 2007 and immediately resumed her SOX compliance efforts while Managers Draffin and Bruce Warr continued to lobby Ms . Bond to be a permanent Boeing employee based on her knowledge and skills and prior performance achievements ( as well as her ability to hit the ground running ) . She became a permanent employee of Boeing effective February 22 , 2008 . Indeed , Ms . Bond had a very difficult assignment that by its nature often put her in conflict with the individuals and processes that she was required to police . Ms. Bonds advanced knowledge of SOX as well as her ethical obligations as a certified auditor led her to raise and escalate a number of important concerns in 2009 and 2010 involving the lack of internal controls , improper attempts to subvert existing internal controls , as well as other staffing and process complaints . Instead of informing Ms . Bond of the positive outcome and changes Boeing would be implementing as a result of her protected disclosure , her managers chastised her for raising those concerns at all , never confirming for her the obvious value of what she had disclosed . In a meeting with Managers Draffin and Wright , Ms . Bond was instructed by Manager Wright to not report any findings prior to discussing them with Mr. Draffin and reprimanded by Mr. Wright for causing him trouble . Additionally , Ms . Bond filed and pursued her SOX complaints , including each of those concerns articulated above , with OSHA a month before she was even identified as a candidate for layoff . On January 15 , 2010 , Ms . Bond contacted OSHA with her SOX concerns and told them she would like to file a complaint . Ms . Bond filed a formal complaint on January 19 , 2010 . After raising and pursuing her protected disclosures , Boeing began to subject Ms . Bond to a series of hostile actions , including harassment , giving her Corrective Action Memos , initiating an investigation , downgrading her performance without justification , and ultimately causing her layoff . Not only were these actions suspect in their timing , immediately following Ms. Bonds disclosures and escalations of these disclosures , they were unjustified.On September 29 , 2009 , just a few months after escalating her SOX concerns , Boeing Manager Joel Wright issued her two Employee Corrective Action memos , for failure to follow management directives and for not respecting a co-worker",

In September 2000 , the drug Seroquel received FDA approval for the short-term treatment of schizophrenia , then in 2004 , for bipolar depression . James Wetta exposed the company 's alleged fraud , where sales reps were promoting the drug for a wide range of less serious disorders which included aggression , Alzheimer 's disease , anger management , anxiety , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , bipolar maintenance , dementia , depression , mood disorder , sleeplessness and post-traumatic stress disorder . Promoting drugs off-label amounts to fraud under the False Claims Act , as the unapproved uses were not medically accepted indications for which the federal and state Medicaid programs provided coverage . Under the Food , Drug and Cosmetics Act , a company must specify the intended use of a product in its new drug application to the FDA . Once the drug is approved by the FDA , the drug may not be marketed or promoted for off-label uses . The civil settlement agreement required AstraZeneca to pay $ 520 million to the federal government to resolve civil settlements . Jim Wetta provided the information which proved the drug was promoted for conditions other than the FDA medical indication",
