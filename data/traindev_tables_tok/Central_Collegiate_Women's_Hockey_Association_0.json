  "intro": "The Central Collegiate Women's Hockey Association (CCWHA) is a non-profit ice hockey league for college club teams based at Midwestern United States schools. It was formed in 1995. There are currently 15 teams participating in two divisions. All teams in the league are also required to be members of the ACHA that provides the teams with USA Hockey insurance and other member benefits. The CCWHA was established with the goal of encouraging and improving opportunities in ice hockey for women; developing and encouraging sportsmanship among all players for the betterment of their physical and social well-being; and conducting an organized League wherein women enjoy recreational and competitive ice hockey. The CCWHA season runs from September to late February/early March with an annual tournament at the end of each season for each division. Winners of each division are awarded an automatic bid to the ACHA National tournament. All teams benefit by scheduling games against each other in the League and the recognition of the League at local and national levels."
