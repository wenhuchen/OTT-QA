        "Ayiiia is a model and Hooters waitress who won the realworldcasting.com contest , having been chosen by viewers who voted for her with the help of a campaign run by her friends . She says she has an issue with guys due to her last boyfriend , with whom she got pregnant , and who broke up with her a week before she had an abortion . Despite having a boyfriend named Ryan and insisting she is not a lesbian , she enjoys making out with women , and becomes intimate with both Jonna and Emilee . She is of Mexican descent , and this is her first extended trip to that country . She is not easily forgiving , and her candor is sometimes seen as vicious by her roommates , which makes living in the house difficult for her . She has a history of drug abuse and self-mutilation , the latter of which recurs in Episode 5 , after repeatedly coming into conflict with various other members of the cast throughout the first several episodes , in particular Joey . In the season finale she and Joey reconcile and have sex",

  "intro": "The Real World: Cancun is the twenty-second season of MTV's reality television series The Real World, which focuses on a group of diverse strangers living together for several months in a different city each season, as cameras follow their lives and interpersonal relationships. It is the only season of The Real World to be filmed in Mexico. The season featured eight people who lived in a hotel converted into a suite. It is the fourth season of The Real World to be set outside the United States, after The Real World: London in 1995, The Real World: Paris in 2003, and The Real World: Sydney in 2007. Series co-creator Jonathan Murray explained the choice of Cancun, saying, Cancun is a good one to do after Brooklyn, which was a more gritty environment. Primary production started from January 26 to April 2009 and was not affected by the swine flu outbreak in Mexico. Executive Producer Jim Johnston said, We had stopped production before this thing reared its ugly head. Consisting of 12 episodes, the season premiered June 24 of that year and was viewed by 1.4 million viewers, the smallest debut ever for a season of The Real World at the time. The American synthpop band LMFAO has a guest appearance in Episode 7, which ties into the cast's work assignment. Bunim-Murray Productions also shot an unscripted 2003 movie called The Real Cancun, although it was unrelated to the series. This season's suite was used by the cast of The Real World: Las Vegas (2011) for their season vacation."
