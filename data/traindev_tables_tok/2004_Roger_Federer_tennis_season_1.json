  "intro": "Roger Federer won three Grand Slams in 2004 for the first time in his career. The first came at the Australian Open over Marat Safin, 7-6(3), 6-4, 6-2. He went on to win his second Wimbledon crown over Andy Roddick, 4-6, 7-5, 7-6(3), 6-4. In addition, Federer defeated the 2001 US Open Champion Lleyton Hewitt at the US Open for his first US Open title, 6-0, 7-6(3), 6-0. Furthermore, Federer won three ATP Masters 1000 events, one on clay at Hamburg, and two on hard court in Indian Wells and Canada. Federer took the ATP 500 series event at Dubai, and wrapped up the year for the second time over Lleyton Hewitt at the Tennis Masters Cup. Federer was the first player to win three Grand Slams in a single season since Mats Wilander in 1988. Federer became the first man in the Open Era to win at least three Grand Slams and the Year-End Championships. As of 2016[update], Federer and Novak Djokovic are the only male tennis players to accomplish this, with Federer repeating the feat in 2006 and 2007 and Djokovic doing so in 2015."
