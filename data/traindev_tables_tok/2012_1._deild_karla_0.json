  "intro": "The 2012 season of the 1. deild karla (English: Men's First Division) was the 58th season of second-tier football in Iceland and ran from 12 May 2012 until 22 September 2012. The league title was won by \u00de\u00f3r Akureyri, who ended the campaign with a record of 16 wins, 2 draws and 4 defeats, giving them a total of 50 points. The Akureyri club, who had been relegated from the \u00darvalsdeild in 2011, thereby achieved promotion back to the top level of Icelandic football at the first attempt. Also promoted to the \u00darvalsdeild for the 2013 season were runners-up V\u00edkingur \u00d3lafsv\u00edk, who finished nine points clear of third-placed \u00der\u00f3ttur Reykjav\u00edk. At the other end of the table, \u00cdR finished bottom of the division after taking only 14 points from their 22 league matches and were thereby relegated to the 2. deild karla. H\u00f6ttur were also relegated on the final day of the season after losing 0-1 away at \u00de\u00f3r. The top goalscorer for the 2012 season was V\u00edkingur \u00d3lafsv\u00edk midfielder Gu\u00f0mundur Steinn Hafsteinsson, who netted 10 goals in 20 league appearances. Four other players were one behind on nine goals. In total, 387 goals were scored during the campaign at an average of 2.93 per match."
