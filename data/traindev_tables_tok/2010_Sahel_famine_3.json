The coastal plain extends 15 to 150 kilometres ( 9 to 93 mi ) inland from the Gulf of Guinea and has an average elevation of 90 metres ( 295 ft ) . Exceedingly hot and humid with a short dry season , this belt is densely forested and includes some of the wettest places on earth , part of the Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests . The South Cameroon Plateau rises from the coastal plain to an average elevation of 650 metres ( 2,133 ft ) . Equatorial rainforest dominates this region , although its alternation between wet and dry seasons makes it is less humid than the coast . This area is part of the Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests ecoregion . An irregular chain of mountains , hills , and plateaus known as the Cameroon range extends from Mount Cameroon on the coast - Cameroon 's highest point at 4,095 metres ( 13,435 ft ) - almost to Lake Chad at Cameroon 's northern tip . This region has a mild climate , particularly on the Western High Plateau , although rainfall is high . Its soils are among Cameroon 's most fertile , especially around volcanic Mount Cameroon . Volcanism here has created the crater lakes , like Lake Nyos of the Cameroonian Highlands forests ecoregion . The southern plateau rises northward to the grassy , rugged Adamawa Plateau . This feature stretches from the western mountain area and forms a barrier between the country 's north and south . Its average elevation is 1,100 metres ( 3,609 ft ) , and its temperature ranges from 22 \u00b0C ( 71.6 \u00b0F ) to 25 \u00b0C ( 77 \u00b0F ) with high rainfall . The northern lowland region extends from the edge of the Adamawa to Lake Chad with an average elevation of 300 to 350 metres ( 984 to 1,148 ft ) . Its characteristic vegetation is savanna scrub and grass . This is an arid region with sparse rainfall and high median temperatures",

  "intro": "A large-scale, drought-induced famine occurred in Africa's Sahel region and many parts of the neighboring S\u00e9n\u00e9gal River Area from February to August 2010. It is one of many famines to have hit the region in recent times. The Sahel is the ecoclimatic and biogeographic zone of transition between the Sahara desert in the north of Africa and the Sudanian savannas in the south, covering an area of 3,053,200 square kilometers. It is a transitional ecoregion of semi-arid grasslands, savannas, steppes, and thorn shrublands. The neighboring S\u00e9n\u00e9gal River Area contains various vegetation types and covers parts or all of Mauritania, Mali, Senegal and Guinea. It has also had very low rainfall over the last year according to the UN, NGOs and the Senegal River Basin Development Authority. Sudan set a new temperature record of 49.7 \u00b0C (121.3 \u00b0F) on 22 June, in the town of Dongola."
