  "intro": "Slovakia has submitted films for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film[nb 1] since 1993. The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. The Slovak submission is decided annually by the Slovak Film and Television Academy (Slovensk\u00e1 filmov\u00e1 a telev\u00edzna akad\u00e9mia). As of 2019[update], twenty-three Slovak films have been submitted for consideration, none of which have been nominated for an Oscar. Six of these have been directed by Martin \u0160ul\u00edk. Until 1993, the Slovak Republic was a constituent republic within Czechoslovakia, and Czech and Slovaks routinely collaborated on national productions. The Shop on Main Street, which won the Best Foreign Film Oscar in 1966 for Czechoslovakia, was a Slovak-language production. It was also the first Czechoslovak film ever to be nominated for an Oscar."
