Nineteen different teams played in the league at one point or another . The majority came from Connacht but Leinster teams from bordering counties were also invited to join . The league 's membership usually averaged between eight and ten clubs and peaked in the 1995\u201396 season when it featured fourteen clubs . Throughout its history the CSL suffered regularly from clubs dropping out and only two teams , Salthill Devon and UCG/NUI Galway featured every season .",

  "intro": "The Connacht Senior League was an association football league featuring amateur, intermediate, and League of Ireland reserve teams affiliated to the Connacht Football Association. It was a third level league in the Republic of Ireland football league system. An earlier provincial league, the Western League, had been active, on and off, since the 1930s before the Connacht Football Association decided to establish a more permanent league. The CSL was active between 1981 and 2000. In 2013 discussions were held about relaunching the league."
