  "intro": "This is a list of cruise ships, both those in service and those that have ceased to operate. Ocean liners are included on this list only if they also functioned as cruise ships. (See: list of ocean liners.) As some cruise ships have operated under multiple names, all names will be listed in the Status section, along with the history of the vessel, under the vessel's current or most recent name. If a vessel is not currently operating as a cruise ship, only the most recent operation will be listed here. Likewise, if a vessel fulfilled another role before becoming a cruise ship, the first entry for the vessel will occur when the vessel began its career as a cruise ship."
