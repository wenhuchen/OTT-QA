  "intro": "The Seventy-seventh United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It met in Washington, DC from January 3, 1941, to January 3, 1943, during the ninth and tenth years of Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency. The apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives was based on the Sixteenth Census of the United States in 1940. Both chambers had a Democratic majority. This was the first Congress to have more than one Senate President (the Vice President of the United States), John Garner and Henry Wallace, due to the passage of the 20th amendment in 1933."
