  "intro": "The France national rugby team have competed in all the Rugby World Cup tournaments. They are one of five teams who have played in the final match, having done so three times (1987, 1999, 2011), losing and finishing second in the tournament each time. They have made it to at least the quarter-finals at every tournament. France hosted the 2007 tournament, and co-hosted the 1991 competition with Ireland and the United Kingdom. They also hosted some matches of the 1999 event, where the main host was Wales. France will host again in 2023."
