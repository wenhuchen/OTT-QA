In the romanisation system used by the Hong Kong Government known as Standard Romanisation, 'shan' and 'leng' are the transliterations of the Cantonese words for 'mount' (\u5c71) and 'ridge' (\u5dba), respectively. 'Toi', 'kong', 'fung' and 'koi' also correspond to 'mount' in English and 'teng' corresponds to 'peak'. It is this system which is used in the list below."
