  "intro": "American singer Jordin Sparks has released three studio albums, two extended plays, one mixtape, twenty-three singles (including two as a featured artist, nine promotional singles and one charity single), fourteen soundtrack appearances and seventeen music videos. At the age of seventeen, Sparks won the sixth season of American Idol in 2007 and earned a record deal with Jive Records. She made her chart debut with the season's coronation song, This Is My Now, which peaked at number 15 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Sparks' self-titled debut studio album was released in November 2007. The album debuted at number 10 on the US Billboard 200 chart, and was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Tattoo and No Air were released as the album's first and second singles, respectively. Both songs reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 and received platinum certifications. One Step at a Time was released as the third single, and became a top 20 song in multiple countries worldwide. As of November 2010, Jordin Sparks has sold two million copies worldwide. Sparks' second studio album Battlefield was released in July 2009. The album debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200, and was notably unsuccessful compared to Sparks' debut, only selling 190,000 copies in the US as of July 2015. Three singles were released from the album: Battlefield, S.O.S."
