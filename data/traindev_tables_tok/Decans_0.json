  "section_text": "The East Asian zodiac features Decans in the form of Thirty-six Calendar Animals ( Sanj\u016broku Kingy\u014dz\u014d \u4e09\u5341\u516d\u79bd\u5f62\u50cf ; alternatively known as the Chikusan Reiki \u755c\u7523\u66a6 ) . The group originated in China , wherein the 36 were divided into four clusters , with each cluster made up of nine animal-deity pairs ( 4 X 9 = 36 ) . The four clusters represent the four cardinal directions ( north , south , east , west ) . The animals are also grouped in triads\u2014three animals are combined under one of 12 Zodiac Signs ( 3 X 12 = 36 ) . In Japan , the group appeared in the Nich\u016b Reki \u4e8c\u4e2d\u66a6 , a Japanese calendar from the second half of the 14th century . Curiously , eight of the 36 appear \u201c fox like \u201d \u2014almost identical in physical attributes . These eight ( presented below ) include the tanuki , mujna , fox , wolf , jackal , wild cat , and wild male-female dogs . The mujina , fox and rabbit are combined under the zodiacal sign of the rabbit . The tanuki , leopard , and tiger are combined under the zodiacal sign of the tiger . Western scholars have mistranslated tanuki and mujina for decades as \u201c badger \u201d or \u201c racoon-dog. \u201d But in extant artwork like that shown below , the beasts are clearly \u201c fox-like. \u201d It is therefore puzzling why Western scholars call them badgers and racoon dogs . : [ 20 ] [ 21 ]",

  "intro": "The decans (/\u02c8d\u025bk\u0259nz/; Egyptian baktiu) are 36 groups of stars (small constellations) used in the Ancient Egyptian astronomy. They rose consecutively on the horizon throughout each earth rotation. The rising of each decan marked the beginning of a new decanal hour (Greek h\u014dra) of the night for the ancient Egyptians, and they were used as a sidereal star clock beginning by at least the 9th or 10th Dynasty (c. 2100 BCE). Because a new decan also appears heliacally every ten days (that is, every ten days, a new decanic star group reappears in the eastern sky at dawn right before the Sun rises, after a period of being obscured by the Sun's light), the ancient Greeks called them dekanoi (\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af; pl. of \u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 dekanos) or tenths. Decans continued to be used throughout the Renaissance in astrology and in magic, but modern astrologers almost entirely ignore them. [citation needed]"
