  "intro": "The Southeast Division is one of the three divisions in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The division consists of five teams, the Atlanta Hawks, the Charlotte Hornets, the Miami Heat, the Orlando Magic and the Washington Wizards. The division was created at the start of the 2004-05 season, when the league expanded from 29 to 30 teams with the addition of the Charlotte Bobcats. The league realigned itself into three divisions in each conference. The Southeast Division began with five inaugural members, the Hawks, the Bobcats, the Heat, the Magic and the Wizards. The Hawks joined from the Central Division, while the Heat, the Magic and the Wizards joined from the Atlantic Division. The Bobcats changed their name to the Hornets effective with the 2014-15 season, after which it assumed the history of the original Hornets from 1988-2002. The Hornets name was previously used by the now-New Orleans Pelicans from 2002-2013. The Heat has won the most Southeast Division titles, with nine, while the Magic have won four and the Hawks and the Wizards have both won one. The Heat won the Southeast Division in four consecutive seasons from 2011 to 2014. Miami's three championships (2006, 2012, and 2013) each came after winning the Southeast Division. The most recent division champions are the Orlando Magic."
