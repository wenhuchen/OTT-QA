Each season for the next 10 years , `` Retro '' Mr. Basketball award winners will be announced . The initial awards were given to players from the years 1920 , 1930 , 1940 , 1950 , 1960 , 1970 and 1980 . Next year , awards will be announced for the seasons xxx8 from each decade . This pattern will be continued through the year 2019 when the final award winners will be selected for the seasons xxx9 from each decade . [ 4 ]",
  "uid": "Mr._Basketball_of_Michigan_1",
  "intro": "Each year the Hal Schram Mr. Basketball award is given to the person chosen as the best high school senior boys basketball player in the U.S. state of Michigan. The award is named in honor of the late Hal Schram, a sports writer at the Detroit Free Press who covered high school sports for 40 years before retiring in 1983. The award has been given since 1981 by the Basketball Coaches Association of Michigan (BCAM). Most of the award winners have gone on to play at the highest levels of college basketball, and many have gone on to play in the National Basketball Association. Voting is done on a points system. Each voter selects first, second, and third-place votes. A player receives five points for each first-place vote, three points for each second-place vote, and one point for a third-place vote. The player who receives the most points receives the award. Only actively coaching BCAM members can vote. Beginning for the 2007 award, votes may only be cast for a predetermined group of five finalists, whereas in the past, the pool was unlimited."
