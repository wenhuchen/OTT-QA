Each county is administered by a county council , responsible for local affairs , as well as a prefect responsible for the administration of national affairs at the county level . The prefect is appointed by the central government but can not be a member of any political party .

[ 233 ] :17 A total of 103 of the larger cities have municipality statuses , which gives them greater administrative power over local affairs . The municipality of Bucharest is a special case as it enjoys a status on par to that of a county . It is further divided into six sectors [ 233 ] :6 and has a prefect , a general mayor ( primar ) , and a general city council . The NUTS-3 ( Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics ) level divisions of European Union reflect Romania 's administrative-territorial structure , and correspond to the 41 counties plus Bucharest .

  "intro": "Romania (/ro\u028a\u02c8me\u026ani\u0259/ (listen) ro-MAY-nee-\u0259; Romanian: Rom\u00e2nia [rom\u0268\u02c8ni.a] (listen)) is a country located at the crossroads of Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe. It has borders with the Black Sea to the southeast, Bulgaria to the south, Ukraine to the north, Hungary to the west, Serbia to the southwest, and Moldova to the east. It has a predominantly temperate-continental climate. With a total area of 238,397 square kilometers (92,046 square miles), Romania is the 8th largest country and also the 6th most populous member state of the European Union, having almost 20 million inhabitants. Its capital and largest city is Bucharest, and other major urban areas include Cluj-Napoca, Timi\u0219oara, Ia\u0219i, Constan\u021ba, Craiova, Bra\u0219ov, and Gala\u021bi. The River Danube, Europe's second-longest river, rises in Germany's Black Forest and flows in a general southeast direction for 2,857 km (1,775 mi), coursing through ten countries before emptying into Romania's Danube Delta. The Carpathian Mountains, which cross Romania from the north to the southwest, include Moldoveanu Peak, at an altitude of 2,544 m (8,346 ft). Modern Romania was formed in 1859 through a personal union of the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia. The new state, officially named Romania since 1866, gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877. Following World War I after declaring its neutrality in 1914, when Romania fought on the side of the Allied powers starting with 1916, Bukovina, Bessarabia, Transylvania as well as parts of Banat, Cri\u0219ana, and Maramure\u0219 became part of the sovereign Kingdom of Romania. In June-August 1940, as a consequence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and Second Vienna Award, Romania was compelled to cede Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union, and Northern Transylvania to Hungary. In November 1940, Romania signed the Tripartite Pact and, consequently, in June 1941 entered World War II on the Axis side, fighting against the Soviet Union until August 1944, when it joined the Allies and recovered Northern Transylvania."
