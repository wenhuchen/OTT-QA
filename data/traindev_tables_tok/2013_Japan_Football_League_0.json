  "section_text": "Due to unfortunate withdrawal of Arte Takasaki , the previous season has featured only 17 teams , but for 2013 the league has brought the number of teams back to 18 . After having another team ( Sagawa Shiga ) ceasing its operations and withdrawing after the season , the league has welcomed into its ranks two newcomers , SC Sagamihara and Fukushima United . Both clubs are looking forward to eventual J . League promotion , with Sagamihara holding the associate membership status , and Fukushima having applied for it in 2007 , though unsuccessfully . Last season has for the first time ever featured direct exchange of teams between JFL and J . League . JFL champions and J . League associate members V-Varen Nagasaki were promoted at the expense of Machida Zelvia , who returned to JFL after only a single season in J2 . Tochigi Uva were on the brink of relegation , as their play-off series against Norbritz Hokkaido was tied after two rounds . It was decided in penalty shootout , which Tochigi club has won 4\u20131 and retained their place in the JFL . On 26 February Blaublitz Akita and Zweigen Kanazawa were granted J . League associate membership status , [ 1 ] bringing the number of such clubs to six , an all-time high mark for the league . On 20 August YSCC Yokohama 's application was also granted by J . League , [ 2 ] further increasing associate members count to seven . It raised again to 10 members after another J . League board session on 16 September , when applications of Fukushima United , FC Ryukyu and Fujieda MYFC were approved . [ 3 ]",
