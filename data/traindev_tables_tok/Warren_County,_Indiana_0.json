  "section_title": "Geography",
  "section_text": "Map of Warren County , showing townships and settlements The Wabash River , coming out of Tippecanoe County to the east , defines the southeastern border of the county ; the terrain here is hilly and wooded areas are common . Fountain County lies across the river . By contrast , the northwest region consists mainly of flat prairie farmland ; this continues in Benton County to the north . Along the western side of the county is the border with Vermilion County , Illinois . The small southern border is shared with the north end of the similarly named Indiana county of Vermillion . The state capital of Indianapolis lies about 70 miles ( 110 km ) to the southeast . [ 41 ] Williamsport Falls According to the 2010 census , the county has a total area of 366.40 square miles ( 949.0 km2 ) , of which 364.68 square miles ( 944.5 km2 ) ( or 99.53% ) is land and 1.72 square miles ( 4.5 km2 ) ( or 0.47% ) is water . [ 3 ] Elevations in the county range from 480 feet ( 150 m ) above sea level where the Wabash River enters Vermillion County to 830 feet ( 250 m ) in northeastern Prairie Township . [ 47 ] The landscape consists mostly of flat or gently sloping moraine overlaying silty and loamy glacial till , except along the Wabash River where sand , gravel , sandstone and shale are exposed . [ 48 ] Various forms of silt loam constitute most of the county 's soil [ 48 ] and are conducive to agriculture . [ 7 ] Forests cover about 14% of the county , [ 49 ] mainly around major waterways , [ 50 ] and consist principally of deciduous hardwoods among which maple\u2013beech and oak\u2013hickory forests are the most common . [ 51 ] The only coal mines in the county are located in the southeastern part of Steuben Township , near the Wabash River . [ 52 ] When the county was formed in 1827 , it was divided into four townships : Medina , Warren , Pike and Mound . Over the following decades , many changes were made to the township borders and eight new townships were created . Pine and Washington were the first of these , in March 1830 ; [ 53 ] Steuben followed in 1834 . Liberty was formed in 1843 , Adams in 1848 , then Jordan in 1850 . Kent and Prairie were the last to be created , in 1864 . [ 54 ] [ 55 ] As of 2010 [ update ] , Prairie Township , at 5.4 inhabitants per square mile ( 2.1/km2 ) , has the lowest population density ; it covers more area than any of the other townships\u2014nearly 50 square miles ( 130 km2 ) \u2014and contains no incorporated towns . The highest density is in Washington Township , which has 120 inhabitants per square mile ( 46/km2 ) ; it includes Williamsport , the county 's largest town , and covers only about 20 square miles ( 52 km2 ) . [ 4 ] There are four incorporated towns in the county . The largest is Williamsport , which is on the western banks of the Wabash River in the eastern part of the county , just downstream of Attica ( which is on the east side of the river in Fountain County ) ; in 2010 , its population was 1,898\u2014nearly one-fourth of the county 's total . [ 56 ] West Lebanon is about 5 miles ( 8.0 km ) west of Williamsport on State Road 28 , with a population of 723 . [ 57 ] The town of Pine Village lies about 11 miles ( 18 km ) to the north of Williamsport where State Road 55 intersects State Road 26 , near the northern edge of the county ; 217 people live in Pine Village . [ 58 ] State Line City is in the southwestern part of the county and shares its western border with the Illinois state line . A small Illinois community named Illiana lies immediately on the west side of the county road which runs along the state border ( and which is also a street between the two communities ) . State Line City is the smallest of the towns , with a population of 143 . [ 59 ] Railroad crossing sign at Sloan In addition to the incorporated towns , there are over a dozen small unincorporated communities in Warren County [ 60 ] that are historical centers of activity . Now they consist mostly of dwellings , though several have churches and some still have small businesses . The small settlements of Hedrick , Pence and Stewart are in Jordan Township ; Stewart consists of a grain processing facility and a single residence . In Steuben Township , Johnsonville has a church and a handful of residences . Marshfield has an automotive body repair shop , a grain elevator and a church . Independence , platted in 1832 , is located on the site of a trading post set up by Zachariah Cicott . He is buried in a cemetery in Warren Township , just north of town . The township included the small settlement of Winthrop . Liberty Township has three unincorporated communities : Carbondale , Judyville and Kramer ( near the site of the Mudlavia Hotel ) . Several townships contain only a single settlement . Foster is the only one in Mound Township and has a motel and several houses . In the northeast corner of the county , Green Hill is Medina Township 's only settlement . Tab is the only settlement in Prairie Township ; most of this township is agricultural , and a large grain processing facility is Tab 's only remaining business . Pine Township 's only community is Rainsville . [ 61 ] Some settlements did not survive . The river town of Baltimore thrived and was a major center of trade until the river was overshadowed by the railroad for purposes of trade and transportation ; a single house , built long after the town 's heyday , is all that remains . [ 62 ] Warrenton had a promising start as the first county seat , but it began to wane after the seat moved , and today no trace is left . [ 63 ] Chesapeake was the first settlement in Steuben Township , but it faded away so early that even an 1883 county history has little to say on the subject . [ 64 ] Brisco was never large , though it did have a school house from the 1850s through the 1920s . It likewise disappeared by the end of the 20th century . Chatterton had a school , a store and a post office , but it has disappeared even though the name continues to appear on maps . [ 65 ] Other communities were planned but did not develop . Dresser was never much more than a collection of houses , though it did have a post office for a few years around the turn of the 20th century . The settlements of Kickapoo , Locust Grove , Sloan and Walnut Grove were similar in this respect . Point Pleasant never developed much beyond the founder 's residence and a liquor store , and was later described as a `` paper town '' . [ 66 ]",

  "intro": "Warren County lies in western Indiana between the Illinois state line and the Wabash River in the United States. According to the 2010 census, the population was 8,508. The county seat is Williamsport. Before the arrival of non-indigenous settlers in the early 19th century, the area was inhabited by several Native American tribes. The county was officially established in 1827 and was the 55th county to be formed in Indiana. It is one of the most rural counties in the state, with the third-smallest population and the lowest population density at about 23 inhabitants per square mile (8.9/km2). The county has four incorporated towns with a total population of about 3,100, as well as many small unincorporated communities. The county is divided into 12 townships which provide local services. Much of the land in the county is given over to agriculture, especially on the open prairie in the northern and western parts; the county's farmland is among the most productive in the state. Nearer the river along the southeastern border, the land has many hills, valleys, and tributary streams and is more heavily wooded. Agriculture, manufacturing, government, education, and health care each provide substantial portions of the jobs in the county. Four Indiana state roads cross the county, as do two U.S."
