The man forced them to drive him around suburban North London before having them stop at a lay-by on the A6 where he shot the pair . Storie survived the attack but was left paralysed . A police investigation led to the eventual arrest of car thief James Hanratty . Although later convicted of the murder , the Hanratty case has since been disputed . Hanratty was hanged in April 1962 , one of the last people to be executed in Britain before the abolition of the death penalty three years later",

A three-year police investigation resulted in the arrest of Sean Hodgson , a pathological liar who confessed to numerous crimes , including ones he could not have committed and crimes that did not appear to have happened . Hodgson was sentenced to life imprisonment after being found guilty of the murder in 1982 . After serving 27 years he was exonerated and released in 2009 . DNA analysis of semen samples from the original crime scene showed that they could not have been his . In 2009 , on the basis of DNA from his exhumed body , police named a deceased man , David Lace , as the likely killer . Lace had confessed to police in 1983 that he had killed de Simone but officers refused to believe him . Lace committed suicide in 1988",

Under the guise of providing Rackliff with a ride back to her house , Carr tricked the woman into joining the group . Instead of pulling through on her initial offer , Sharon Carr and her accomplices drove Rackliff out into an empty area . Rackliff , who had grown nervous and suspicious , fled the car , with Sharon immediately on her tail . Before Rackliff could flee the scene , Carr withdrew a blade and stabbed Rackliff approximately 32 times and abandoning her body . Upon the discovery of Katie Rackliff 's body , police had assumed a male suspect rather than a female due to the gruesome nature of the crime scene . Carr was jailed in 1994 after police discovered her diaries with entries relating to Rackliff 's murder , after she stabbed a pupil at her secondary school . She remains in jail and will likely never be released as she is regarded a 'danger to society '",
