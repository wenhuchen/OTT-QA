  "intro": "This is a list of fictional crocodiles and alligators from literature, folklore and myth, mascots and emblems of teams and organizations, comics, films, animations and video games. This list is subsidiary to the list of fictional animals. It is restricted to notable crocodilian characters from notable works of fiction. Characters that appear in multiple media may have separate listings for each appearance, while in instances where a character has appeared in several separate works in a single medium, only the earliest will be recorded here."
