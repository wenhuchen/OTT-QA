  "section_text": "For a person to be inducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor , they must have made `` significant contributions to the game of basketball '' . [ 3 ] Of the inaugural Hall of Fame class of 1959 , seven individuals were inducted as contributors , including James Naismith , the inventor of basketball . All former NBA commissioners ( Maurice Podoloff , Walter Kennedy , Larry O'Brien , and David Stern ) have been inducted . Fourteen individuals inducted as contributors have won the John Bunn Award , awarded by the Hall annually to a significant contributor : John Bunn ( its inaugural recipient ) , Walter Kennedy , Clifford Fagan , Edward Gottlieb , Daniel Biasone , Larry O'Brien , Dave Gavitt , C. M. Newton , Tex Winter , Meadowlark Lemon , Tom Jernstedt , Tom `` Satch '' Sanders , George Raveling , [ 4 ] and Rod Thorn . Two inductees in this category are women : Senda Berenson Abbott and Bertha Teague ( both inducted in 1985 ) . The most recent contributor to be inducted is Jerry Reinsdorf , who entered the Hall in 2016 . [ 5 ] The exact number of individuals enshrined as contributors ( as well as the number of player inductees ) is subject to debate because of the Hall 's treatment of 2014 inductee Nathaniel `` Sweetwater '' Clifton , one of the first African Americans to play in the NBA . While he was initially announced as a contributor , [ 7 ] the Hall now classifies him as a player inductee . [ 8 ] Six inductees in this category were associated with teams that have been inducted to the Hall as units . Naismith organized The First Team , the group of players involved in the first-ever basketball game in 1891 and also inducted as part of the inaugural Class of 1959 . Robert L. Douglas , inducted in 1972 , was the founder and owner of the New York Renaissance , inducted in 1963 . Pete Newell , inducted in 1979 , was the head coach of the 1960 U.S. Olympic team inducted in 2010 . Three were associated with the Harlem Globetrotters , inducted in 2002 . Abe Saperstein , inducted in 1971 , was the team 's founder and owner . Kennedy , although best known for his time as NBA commissioner , had been the Globetrotters ' public relations director in the 1950s . Lemon , inducted in 2003 , was one of the team 's most enduring on-court stars . Ten individuals inducted in this category were born outside the United States\u2014Naismith and Newell in Canada , Podoloff and Gottlieb in modern-day Ukraine ( part of the Russian Empire when they were born in 1890 and 1898 respectively ) , Douglas in Saint Kitts and Nevis ( part of the British West Indies at his birth in 1882 ) , Saperstein in the United Kingdom , Biasone and Renato William Jones in Italy , Ferenc Hepp in modern-day Hungary ( Austria\u2013Hungary at his birth in 1909 ) , and Borislav Stankovi\u0107 in what is now Bosnia and Herzegovina ( the Kingdom of Yugoslavia at his birth in 1925 ) . In total , 65 or 66 individuals , depending on how Clifton is classified , have been inducted as contributors . Luther Gulick , inducted in 1959 Amos Alonzo Stagg , inducted in 1959",

  "intro": "The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, located in Springfield, Massachusetts, honors players who have shown exceptional skill at basketball, all-time great coaches, referees, and other major contributors to the sport. It is named after Dr. James Naismith, who conceived the sport in 1891; he was inducted into the Hall as a contributor in 1959. To be considered for induction, nominees must meet certain prerequisites. Players must have been retired for at least three years before becoming eligible. Referees must have either been retired for at least three years, or, if they are still active, have officiated for at least 25 years at high-school-level programs or higher. Coaches must have either been retired for at least three years, or, if they are still active, have coached for at least 25 years at high-school-level programs or higher and from 2020 on must have coached for at least 25 years and reached the age of sixty years. Those being considered for induction as contributors may be inducted at any time; the Hall of Fame and its committees evaluate whether contributions are significant enough for the nominee to be inducted as a contributor. Teams are also inducted at the committees' discretion."
