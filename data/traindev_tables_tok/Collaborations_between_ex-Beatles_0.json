  "intro": "The Beatles were an English rock band who were active from 1960 to 1970. Primarily consisting of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they are commonly regarded as the most influential band of all time. Following their break-up in 1970, all four members enjoyed success as solo artists and collaborated with each other on numerous occasions, including on both studio and live recordings. The only albums to feature compositions and performances by all four ex-Beatles, albeit on separate songs, includes Starr's solo albums Ringo (1973) and Ringo's Rotogravure (1976), and the Carl Perkins album Go Cat Go! (1996). With Starr's participation, Harrison staged the Concert for Bangladesh in New York City in August 1971. Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974, later bootlegged as A Toot and a Snore in '74, Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again. Collaborations by the four ex-Beatles following their breakup are listed below. Collaborations that began before the breakup are included for historical interest. The start date of the act of collaboration, e.g., the recording start date, governs the initial display sequence. Other display sequences may be seen by clicking the buttons in the column headers. None of the albums, performances or singles featured all four members at the same time before John Lennon's death."
