  "intro": "Comic Relief USA was a non-profit charity organization whose mission is to raise funds to help those in need - particularly America's homeless. It has raised and distributed nearly US$50 million toward providing assistance - including health care services - to homeless people throughout the United States. Although Comic Relief's charity work is continuous, its fundraising events were held and televised at irregular intervals - and primarily by Home Box Office (HBO), with comedians Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, and Whoopi Goldberg as the hosts each time. They - along with many other comedians, celebrities, and occasional politicians - perform various segments - both general-purpose and specific to homelessness - of standup comedy, sketch comedy, speeches, live music, and impressions of persons and characters - all in order to entertain and enlighten. There are also documentary segments dealing with real-life problems of homeless people, in order to raise awareness of not only the grim realities but also how many hard-working ordinary people can wind up or grow up homeless. In exchange for contributions exceeding certain key amounts, T-shirts, sweatshirts and other merchandise are typically for sale."
