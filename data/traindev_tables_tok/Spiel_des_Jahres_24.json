  "intro": "The Spiel des Jahres (German: [\u02c8\u0283pi\u02d0l d\u0259s \u02c8ja\u02d0\u0281\u0259s], Game of the Year) is an award for board and card games, created in 1978 with the stated purpose of rewarding excellence in game design, and promoting top-quality games in the German market. It is thought that the existence and popularity of the award is one of the major drivers of the quality of games coming out of Germany. A Spiel des Jahres nomination can increase the typical sales of a game from 500-3000 copies to around 10,000; and the winner can usually expect to sell 300,000 to 500,000 copies."
