  "intro": "Hamburg Altona is one of the 299 single member constituencies used for the German parliament, the Bundestag. Located in west Hamburg, the district was created for the 1949 election, the first election in West Germany after World War II. The first two elections in the district were won by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), however, the district was gained by the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) at the 1957 election. The SPD have held the district since then, with the sole exception of the 1987 election, when it was regained by the CDU. The constituency is almost coterminous with the borough of Altona, one of the seven boroughs (Bezirke) of Hamburg. The exception is a very small portion of the borough east of Schulterblatt Street. The current MP is Olaf Scholz of the SPD, who has represented the district since the 1998 election."
