  "intro": "The 2019 Chicago aldermanic election took place in two rounds on February 26 and April 2, 2019 to elect 50 aldermen to the Chicago City Council. Each alderman represents one of Chicago's 50 wards. The elections are non-partisan and use a two-round system where the top two finishers compete in a second-round run-off if no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote in the first round. The elections are concurrent with the 2019 mayoral election, as well as elections for City Clerk and City Treasurer. Of the 50 incumbent aldermen 45 ran for re-election. Incumbents did not run in the 20th, 22nd, 25th, 39th, and 47th wards. Five aldermen ran unopposed: Brian Hopkins (2nd ward), Scott Waugespack (32nd ward), Gilbert Villegas (36th ward), Brendan Reilly (42nd ward), and Nicholas Sposato (38th ward). Three aldermen were defeated in the first round, and four more were defeated in run-off elections. There were a total of 12 new aldermen elected."
