  "intro": "The Eighty-seventh United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It met in Washington, D.C. from January 3, 1961, to January 3, 1963, during the final weeks of the administration of U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the first two years of the administration of U.S. President John Kennedy. The apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives was based on the Seventeenth Census of the United States in 1950, along with 2 seats temporarily added in 1959 (one member each from recently admitted states of Alaska and Hawaii). Both chambers had a Democratic majority."
