  "intro": "The 1986 Tour de France was the 73rd running of the Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The Tour consisted of 23 stages, beginning with a prologue in Boulogne-Billancourt, Paris, on 4 July, and concluded on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris on 27 July. This year had the first American cycling team, , in Tour's history. The race was organised by the Amaury Sport Organisation, was shown on television in 72 countries, with the total viewers estimated at one billion. Following the success of Bernard Hinault in the previous edition, the team was heavily favored. Hinault promised to return Greg LeMond's support to win the 1985 Tour, however, continuing attacks cast doubt on Hinault's sincerity. He claimed that his tactics were simply to wear down LeMond's (and his) opponents and that he ultimately knew that LeMond would be the winner because of time losses earlier in the race. Regardless of his true motives, this tactic worked well, and rivals Laurent Fignon of and 's Urs Zimmermann were put on the defensive from the first day. Fignon quit the race due to injuries aggravated by stress. The ascent of the legendary Alpe d'Huez gave spectators a spectacular stage in which Hinault made a risky solo attack to demoralize the opposition, to be matched only by LeMond at the top. In a gesture of respect, the two riders reached the top hand-in-hand, beaming smiles, and LeMond let Hinault finish first to claim the stage. However, within hours LeMond and Hinault were interviewed together on joint television, where Hinault stated that the race was not over, seemingly betraying his teammate LeMond."
