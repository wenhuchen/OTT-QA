  "intro": "Six Flags America is a theme park located in Woodmore CDP, Prince George's County, Maryland, near Upper Marlboro, and in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. Founded as a wildlife center in 1973 by Ross Perot, ABC television operated the park as a drive-through safari called The Largo Wildlife Preserve beginning in 1974 until its closure in 1978. The property was bought by Jim Fowler's Wild Kingdom; thereafter the site was converted from a wildlife preserve into a theme park named Wild World gradually over the years. In 1992, the park was renamed Adventure World after being acquired by Premier Parks, and ultimately was branded as the 10th Six Flags park when Premier Parks acquired Six Flags Inc. and adopted its name in 1999. The America in the park's name was chosen regarding the close proximity to the United States' capital."
