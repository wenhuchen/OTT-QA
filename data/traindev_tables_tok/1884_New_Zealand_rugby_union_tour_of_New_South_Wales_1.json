  "intro": "The first New Zealand team was selected in 1884, for a tour to New South Wales, Australia. It was a privately organized selection as the New Zealand Rugby Union was founded not until eight years later. On 22 May 1884, before the tour start, the team played a test match against the Wellington Rugby Football Union team, winning 9 to 0. During the tour, the team recorded eight wins in eight matches in Australia."
