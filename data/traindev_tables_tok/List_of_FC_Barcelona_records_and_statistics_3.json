  "intro": "Futbol Club Barcelona is a professional football club, based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, English and Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto M\u00e9s que un club (More than a club). The official Bar\u00e7a anthem is the Cant del Bar\u00e7a, written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espin\u00e0s. Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the world's second richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of \u20ac495 million in 2011-12 season. Barcelona played its first friendly match on 8 December 1899 against the English colony in Barcelona in the old velodrome in Bonanova. Initially, Barcelona played against other local clubs in various Catalan tournaments. In 1929, the club became one of the founding members of La Liga, Spain's first truly national league, and has since achieved the distinction of being one of only three clubs to have never been relegated, along with Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. Barcelona is the only European club to have played continental football every season since 1955. Barcelona holds a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, with matches between the two teams referred to as El Cl\u00e1sico (El Cl\u00e0ssic in Catalan). Matches against city rivals Espanyol are known as the Derbi barcelon\u00ed. Barcelona has amassed various records since its founding."
