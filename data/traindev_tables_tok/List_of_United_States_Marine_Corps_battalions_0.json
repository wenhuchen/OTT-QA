The mission of locating , closing with , and destroying the enemy with fire and maneuver and repelling the enemy 's assault with fire and close combat lies with the `` grunts '' . Marine infantry battalions often have limited organic equipment outside of small arms , infantry crew-served weapons ( e.g. , heavy machine guns , medium mortars , and anti-tank missiles ) , and a few light tactical trucks . Marine infantry primarily maneuvers by foot as light infantry , and must be supplemented with additional trucks to become motorized infantry or Amphibious Assault Vehicles to become mechanized infantry . A Marine infantry battalion is usually organized into three rifle companies , a weapons company , and a headquarters and service company . The rifle company has a company headquarters , three rifle platoons , with three rifle squads each , and a weapons platoon with medium machineguns , mortars , and assault weapons sections . The weapons company includes a company headquarters , a heavy machinegun platoon , an 81mm mortar platoon , and an antiarmor platoon . Sometimes , the commander will mix these into Combined Anti-Armor Teams . The headquarters and service company includes all command , administration , intelligence , operations , logistics , and communication Marines and equipment , as well as the battalion 's Scout Sniper platoon and Battalion Aid Station ( BAS ) staffed by U.S. Navy Hospital Corpsman . Riflemen Marines on patrol Marine scout sniper Mechanized Marines Machine gunner with M2 .50cal TOW anti-tank missile .",
