  "intro": "The statistics on international films' Box Office in Malaysia has started in 2008. Box Office Mojo is the only website that provides the box office numbers for international films released in Malaysia. However, this does not include the numbers for local films. For top local films gross, please view Cinema of Malaysia. Box Office - Yahoo! Malaysia and Cinema Online Malaysia are two current websites that show the ranking of films weekly inclusive of local films, but not providing any box office number. Golden Screen Cinemas (GSC) also provide only the ranking of both local and international films weekly, based on the popularity at its own cinema. The ranking can be accessed at the right bottom corner of GSC's website."
