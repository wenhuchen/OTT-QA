  "intro": "Long Red is a song recorded by Leslie West for his album Mountain. It was covered by Fat Mattress in 1971 for their unfinished third album (eventually seeing release on The Black Sheep of the Family: The Anthology). West performed the song with his band Mountain in 1972 for their live album Mountain Live: The Road Goes Ever On. West re-recorded the song on his 2013 solo album Still Climbing. The Mountain Live version has one of the most sampled drum breaks in the history of hip hop music. The break (as well as Wests banter with the audience), according to WhoSampled.com, has been sampled in over 600 songs as of 2017. The live version was recorded at Woodstock. The drummer was N.D. Smart. Corky Laing joined the group later in the year. [citation needed]"
