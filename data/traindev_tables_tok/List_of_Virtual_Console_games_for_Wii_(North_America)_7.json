These games could also be played on the Wii U through Wii Mode, but lack the additional features found in Wii U Virtual Console releases. The games are sorted by system and in the order they were added in the Wii Shop Channel. To sort by other columns, click the corresponding icon in the header row. Nintendo discontinued the Wii Shop Channel on January 31, 2019, with the purchase of Wii Points for new games having ended on March 26, 2018. But Wii Shop Channel users can still continue to redownload previously purchased content as of February 1, 2019."
