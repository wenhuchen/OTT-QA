  "section_title": "Splash hits",
  "section_text": "Panoramic view of McCovey Cove , August 2010 . `` Splash hits '' are recorded only when Giants players hit home runs that land in McCovey Cove on the fly . These hits are tallied on an electronic counter on the right field wall . As of August 29 , 2019 , 81 `` splash hits '' have been hit into the Bay by Giants players since the park opened ; 35 of those were by Barry Bonds . [ 3 ] The only Giants other than Bonds to have reached the Cove more than once are Pablo Sandoval and Brandon Belt with eight each , Denard Span with five , and six players with two each : Felipe Crespo , Michael Tucker , Ryan Klesko , Aubrey Huff , Andr\u00e9s Torres , and Brandon Crawford . Eleven other Giants ' players have accomplished the feat just once . Carlos Beltr\u00e1n 's `` Splash Hit '' on September 14 , 2011 , marked his 300th career home run . Klesko is currently the only player to have splash hits as both a Giant and as an opposing player through the 2012 season . Tyler Colvin 's `` splash hit '' on May 12 , 2014 , was also his first hit for the Giants and came off his first at bat at Oracle Park since joining the team . [ 4 ] When the stadium hosted the 2007 Home Run Derby , McCovey Cove was heavily featured in promotional materials , and the namesake slugger presented each participant with special bats before the competition . However , the difficulty of hitting McCovey Cove with a home run was shown , as none of the eight sluggers competing were able to hit water , and all four left-handed batters ( who are more likely to hit home runs to right field , and thus , to the Cove ) were eliminated in the first round of the contest . The only player to hit water was Prince Fielder of the Milwaukee Brewers , who did so on a foul ball . [ 5 ] Fielder would eventually hit McCovey Cove with a fair ball on July 20 , 2008 , as the 17th visiting player to hit a home run into the Cove . No right-handed hitter has ever hit an opposite field home run into McCovey Cove , though Giants catcher Buster Posey has come close several times .",

  "intro": "McCovey Cove is the unofficial name of a section of San Francisco Bay beyond the right field wall of Oracle Park, home of the San Francisco Giants, named after famed Giants first baseman Willie McCovey. The proper name for the cove is China Basin, which is the mouth of Mission Creek as it meets the bay. The cove is bounded along the north by Oracle Park, with a ferry landing and a breakwater at the northeast end. The southern shore is lined by China Basin Park and McCovey Point. To the east, it opens up to San Francisco Bay, while the west end of the cove is bounded by the Lefty O'Doul Bridge, named after San Francisco ballplayer and manager Lefty O'Doul."
