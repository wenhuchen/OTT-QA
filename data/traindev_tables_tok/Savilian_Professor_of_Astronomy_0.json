        "Bainbridge practised as a physician in Leicestershire and London after leaving Cambridge . His first book , An Astronomicall Description of the Late Comet , was published in 1619 and described the comet of the previous year . He was already known by this time to Sir Henry Savile and Henry Briggs ( who Savile appointed as his first geometry professor ) . After his appointment to the chair , Bainbridge also lectured and practised in medicine . Although only a few other publications of his survive , they have been said to reveal an acute intellect and deep learning . He demonstrated a knowledge of contemporary developments in astronomy , such as the work of Johannes Kepler , and studied Arabic to acquire details of astronomical observations in ancient sources . He also exposed the many mistakes that Joseph Scaliger made when attempting to explain the origins of the Julian calendar in observations of Sirius from ancient Egypt - an achievement that was recorded by his successor John Greaves on his memorial in Merton College Chapel",

        "Greaves began studying astronomical texts in Greek , Arabic and Persian at about the time that he was appointed to a fellowship of Merton College in 1624 . He was appointed Professor of Geometry at Gresham College , London , in 1631 . He undertook an expedition to the Levant region of the Mediterranean in 1637 to carry out astronomical observations and to acquire learned books in oriental languages for William Laud ( Chancellor of the University of Oxford and Archbishop of Canterbury ) . Some of the instruments he took with him are now held by the Museum of the History of Science in Oxford . He returned home in 1640 , and succeeded Bainbridge in 1643 . During the English Civil War , he was expelled from Oxford by the Parliamentary authorities in charge of the university in 1648 , and moved to London , where he published various works drawing upon the research carried out in his expedition . He was a friend of Seth Ward and was able to help him succeed to the chair that he had been forced to vacate",

        "When still an undergraduate , Ward impressed John Bainbridge ( the first astronomy professor ) during a mathematical disputation . Ward was appointed as university lecturer in mathematics at Cambridge in 1643 , but was deprived of his fellowship in the following year for refusing to agree to the religious oaths required by the Parliamentary authorities . He spent the following years tutoring and improving his mathematical knowledge , before succeeding his friend John Greaves in the Savilian chair , with Greaves 's assistance . University lectures in astronomy were resumed under Ward , who was the first Savilian professor to teach the Copernican discovery that the Earth and other planets revolved around the Sun . He studied comets and the movements of the planets , observing them from the room at the top of the tower of Wadham College in which he lived ; he also preached and published theological works . He was elected Principal of Jesus College , Oxford , in 1657 , but Oliver Cromwell installed Francis Howell instead , raising Ward 's stipend as compensation . He was President of Trinity College , Oxford , from 1659 but resigned 1660 at The Restoration in favour of his ejected predecessor ; he also gave up the professorship in the same year . He later became Bishop of Exeter and then Bishop of Salisbury , where he did much to restore the cathedrals , but did not continue his astronomical studies",

        "As an undergraduate , Wren joined the circle of mathematicians and natural scientists at Wadham under the leadership of the Warden , John Wilkins . He developed an interest for telescopes and astronomy , building with Wilkins an 80-foot ( 24 m ) long instrument to observe the Moon in 1655 . Oliver Cromwell appointed Wren in 1657 as Professor of Geometry at Gresham College , London , on the recommendation of Wilkins ; Wren lectured on Saturn ( the appearance and phases of which he had earlier studied ) , Kepler 's works , light , and lenses . He provided partial solutions in 1658 to problems relating to curves set by Blaise Pascal , the answers to which would help calculations for planetary orbits . He resigned from Gresham College upon his appointment to the Savilian chair , lecturing on topics such as spheres and navigation . He developed an interest in architecture from his mathematical studies , with early work including the chapel of Pembroke College , Cambridge , and the Sheldonian Theatre in Oxford . His architectural skills led to his role in rebuilding London after the Great Fire of 1666 ( including St Paul 's Cathedral ) and his appointment as Surveyor of the King 's Works in 1669 . Isaac Newton described him as one of the foremost geometers of this age . Wren appointed Edward Bernard as his deputy in the chair in 1669 , on his appointment as Surveyor of the King 's Works , and Bernard succeeded him four years later",

When Christopher Wren was appointed as Surveyor of the King 's Works in 1669 , he appointed Bernard as his deputy in the astronomy chair ; he succeeded Wren in 1673 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on the same day . Bernard 's interests , as demonstrated in his lectures , were more in ancient mathematics and astronomy than in modern developments ; he published comparatively few works . Tiring of his academic duties , he moved to Paris to tutor two of the illegitimate sons of King Charles II , the Duke of Grafton and the Duke of Northumberland , but returned after falling out with their mother , the King 's mistress . He unsuccessfully sought other positions abroad , including the chair of Arabic at the University of Leiden . He resigned in 1691 when appointed to a lucrative parish position as rector of Brightwell-cum-Sotwell near Oxford",

        "Gregory studied in his native Scotland and befriended the Edinburgh physician Archibald Pitcairne before travelling through Europe and continuing his education . He inherited the papers of his uncle James Gregory , a mathematician and astronomer , which he studied carefully . He succeeded his uncle at the University of Edinburgh in 1683 , giving a history of the progress of mathematics as his inaugural lecture . In 1690 , Gregory refused to swear an oath of loyalty to the regime of William III and Mary II but was not removed from his post . He enlisted the support of Isaac Newton and John Flamsteed , the Astronomer Royal , in his efforts to obtain the Oxford chair , and was elected in December 1691 , becoming a Fellow of Balliol and obtaining an Oxford doctorate in February 1692 . As professor , he lectured less often than required by the terms of his appointment , and covered only relatively uncomplicated material rather than Newton 's work . He moved to London in 1704 and was appointed overseer of the Scottish Mint in 1707 to supervise recoinage in Scotland . He died in 1708 . He has been described as not a notable observational astronomer , but instead a talented correspondent , communicator and teacher",

        "Bradley was the nephew of James Pound , a leading astronomer who was a colleague of Edmond Halley and Isaac Newton , and helped his uncle with his observations near London even when Bradley was appointed as vicar of a church in Monmouthshire . He had a particular interest in the moons of Jupiter , correcting errors in published astronomical tables , Mars and nebulae , and was highly regarded by Halley . Bradley resigned as a clergyman on appointment to the chair in 1721 . His major discovery , in 1725 , was the aberration of light , in which stars appeared to move position as the earth moved , which led him to be able to calculate the speed of light and the time it took to travel from the Sun to the Earth . He moved to the Savilian professors ' house in 1732 , and succeeded Halley as Astronomer Royal in 1742 , improving the state of the buildings and instruments at the Greenwich observatory . His continued observations on the positions of the stars ( to help with navigation ) , the moon , and comets led to the discovery of nutation : the nodding of the Earth on its axis as it travelled around the Sun . He recorded observations for 18 years to measure the phenomenon , which helped to show ( as Newton argued ) that the earth was flatter at the poles . He was awarded the Copley Medal of the Royal Society for this work . He carried on his astronomical observations , receiving many honours from home and abroad , until his death in 1762 . Legal disputes about whether the state or his inheritors owned his papers led to a long delay in publication of his papers , but they eventually formed the starting point for further important work about the positions of the stars",

He held the post of Radcliffe Observer in addition to the astronomy chair . Robertson was well-regarded as a lecturer , noted for his clarity and the assistance he gave in encouraging students . He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1795 to mark his work on conic sections ( the subject of his main work , Sectionum conicarum libri septem , in 1792 ) and his literary attainments and diligence in the pursuit of science . He also oversaw publication of an edition of the works of Archimedes",

From about 1805 , he substituted for Thomas Hornsby , astronomy professor and reader in experimental philosophy , because of Hornsby 's illness . When Abraham Robertson succeeded Hornsby in 1810 , Rigaud was appointed as Savilian Professor of Geometry ; he succeeded his father at Kew in 1814 , becoming joint observer with his grandfather . He succeeded Robertson in the astronomy and experimental philosophy positions in 1827 . His wife died in the same year , and Rigaud devoted himself to his children and his work ; he has been described as the foremost historian of astronomy and mathematics in his generation , and as renowned for his personal and scholarly integrity",

His reforms were popular with some of the parents , however , and they established a school for him nearby in Clapham , where he was headmaster from 1834 to 1862 and installed an observatory and other scientific equipment . He was a member , and later president , of the Royal Astronomical Society , taking part in observations and the 1860 expedition to Spain to observe the solar eclipse . An ordained priest , he was appointed Hulsean lecturer at Cambridge in 1867 , but never held a parish post . At the age of 62 , he was appointed to the Savilian chair and ( in the words of the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography ) entered upon his new duties with the ardour of youth . During his time in the position , an observatory was built in the University Parks , making Oxford one of the leading observatories in Europe . His use of photography to assist his observations and calculations of stellar parallax was rewarded with the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society ( 1886 ) and the Royal Medal of the Royal Society ( 1892 )",

This was recognised by the award of the Bruce Medal of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific ( 1927 ) . After his appointment to the Oxford professorship , his attempts to have a house built for him at the university 's observatory were unsuccessful , as the dispute between the university and the Radcliffe Observatory that had begun with George Johnson 's appointment in 1839 continued . He supported the decision of the Radcliffe trustees to move their observatory to a better site , in South Africa , in 1929 , but was attacked by fellow Oxford academics in the struggles for improving science facilities at the university thereafter . He was heavily involved in the work of the Royal Astronomical Society and international astronomical groups , and developed interests in geophysics and seismology , where he was one of the first to suggest that the earth 's core was liquid",

        "Plaskett , a solar physicist , was the son of the Canadian astronomer John Stanley Plaskett . After serving in the Canadian Corps during the First World War , he studied spectroscopy with Alfred Fowler at Imperial College for a few months before taking up an appointment under his father at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory , British Columbia . He taught at Harvard College from 1928 , becoming professor of astrophysics in 1930 , and concentrated on solar research ( which he preferred to lecturing ) . During this time he met the Oxford mathematician and astrophysicist Edward Arthur Milne , and they became close friends . On the death of Herbert Turner in 1930 , Milne warned Plaskett about the antiquated observatory at Oxford and the lack of university support and resources for the work of the Savilian professor , but Plaskett was undeterred and was appointed to the position . He constructed England 's first solar tower telescope to attract new researchers to Oxford , and reduced the work carried out at the observatory on seismology that Turner had begun , eliminating it in 1946 . He ended undergraduate tuition at the observatory and , with Milne , set up the first school of astrophysics in the country , based on the teaching of graduate students through research initiatives . He retired in 1960 , but continued his observations with his successor 's permission until he turned eighty in 1973 . Like his father , he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society",

  "uid": "Savilian_Professor_of_Astronomy_0",
  "intro": "The position of Savilian Professor of Astronomy was established at the University of Oxford in 1619. It was founded (at the same time as the Savilian Professorship of Geometry) by Sir Henry Savile, a mathematician and classical scholar who was Warden of Merton College, Oxford, and Provost of Eton College. He appointed John Bainbridge as the first professor, who took up his duties in 1620 or 1621. There have been 21 astronomy professors in all; Steven Balbus, the professor as of 2015[update], was appointed in 2012. Past professors include Christopher Wren (1661-73), architect of St Paul's Cathedral in London and the Sheldonian Theatre in Oxford; he held the professorship at the time of his commission to rebuild the cathedral after it was destroyed by the Great Fire of London in 1666. Three professors have been awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society: Charles Pritchard (1870-93), Harry Plaskett (1932-60) and Joseph Silk (1999-2012). The two Savilian chairs have been linked with professorial fellowships at New College, Oxford, since the late 19th century. In the past, some of the professors were provided with an official residence, either near New College or at the Radcliffe Observatory, although this practice ended in the 19th century. The astronomy professor is a member of the Sub-Department of Astrophysics at Oxford."
