  "intro": "The Jazztet was a jazz sextet, co-founded in 1959 by trumpeter Art Farmer and tenor saxophonist Benny Golson, always featuring the founders along with a trombonist and a piano-bass-drums rhythm section. In its first phase, the Jazztet lasted until 1962, and helped to launch the careers of pianist McCoy Tyner and trombonist Grachan Moncur III. Farmer and Golson revived the group in 1982 and it again toured extensively. Each generation of the group recorded six albums, which were released on a variety of labels. The Jazztet was famous for nicely structured, precise yet soulful pieces and a swinging style. It benefitted from having a set of strong compositions by Golson, including I Remember Clifford, Whisper Not, Blues March, Killer Joe and Five Spot After Dark. While Golson provided a lot of the arrangements, Farmer took the largest share of the soloing responsibilities."
