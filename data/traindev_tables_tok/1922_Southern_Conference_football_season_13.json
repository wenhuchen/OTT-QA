  "intro": "The 1922 Southern Conference football season was the college football games played by the member schools of the Southern Conference as part of the 1922 college football season. The season began on September 23 as part of the 1922 college football season. Conference play began on October 7 with Washington & Lee defeating North Carolina State 14-6 in Lexington. This was the conference's inaugural season, featuring former members of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) and South Atlantic Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SAIAA). Amongst others, conference co-champion Vanderbilt was still a co-member of the SIAA. Though North Carolina posted the best conference record, most sources listed either Vanderbilt or Georgia Tech as champion. Vanderbilt was the only school to claim a championship and remain undefeated against all opponents. It posted the nation's number one defense as measured by points against per game and was retroactively selected for a national championship by selector Clyde Berryman. Intersectionalism was popular. Vanderbilt fought Michigan to a scoreless tie at the inaugural game at Dudley Field, the first football stadium in the south in the style of the Eastern schools. Alabama, which scored 300 points on the season, upset John Heisman's Penn Quakers 9-7. Auburn's upset of Centre opened the door for the SoCon champion to claim a championship of the South."
