  "intro": "A school of mines (or mining school) is an engineering school, often established in the 18th and 19th centuries, that originally focused on mining engineering and applied science. Most have been integrated within larger constructs such as mineral engineering, some no longer focusing primarily on mining subjects, while retaining the name."
