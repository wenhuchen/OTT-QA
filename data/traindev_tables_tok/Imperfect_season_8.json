  "section_title": "Rugby league -- Great Britain",
  "section_text": "In the Rugby Football League Championship , teams initially played a variable number of games , with the maximum ranging over time from 26 to 38 , and some teams playing as few as fourteen . In more modern times the fixture list has been standardised at 26 games per team . As a result of this fairly lengthy schedule , it has been almost impossible for British rugby league teams to lose all their games , with the only exception being during World War II 's so-called `` Wartime emergency League '' when teams were often able to arrange no more than ten games and some as few as five . The only four winless seasons since normal competition resumed after the war have been in the second and third divisions of the Championship . In 2018 , West Wales Raiders set a number of Rugby League records for futility on course to losing all 26 games , including the largest point differential ( -1930 points ) , most points conceded ( 2106 ) and largest average number of points conceded per game ( 81 ) . In addition , they were on the receiving end of Rugby League 's largest ever defeat - a 144-0 loss to York City Knights .",
  "uid": "Imperfect_season_8",
  "intro": "A winless season is a regular season in which a sports team fails to win any of its games. The antithesis of a perfect season, this ignominy has been suffered twelve times in professional American football, six times in arena football, three times in professional Canadian football, once each in American professional lacrosse and box lacrosse, more than twenty-five times in major Australian football leagues, over twenty times in top-level rugby league, at least twice in top-level rugby union, and twice in English county cricket."
