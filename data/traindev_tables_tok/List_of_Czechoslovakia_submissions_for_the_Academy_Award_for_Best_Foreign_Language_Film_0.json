  "intro": "Czechoslovakia submitted films for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film[nb 1] between 1964 and 1991 before splitting into the independent Czech and Slovakia republics in 1993. The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. Czechoslovak films received six Oscar nominations for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, two of which won the Oscar, namely the Slovak language The Shop on Main Street and the Czech language Closely Watched Trains, both of which are black comedies set during World War II. Director Milo\u0161 Forman had two of his films selected to represent Czechoslovakia in the 1960s, and both were nominated. Forman eventually won two Oscars for Best Director after emigrating to the United States. After the breakup of Czechoslovakia, the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic both began submitting films to the competition regularly. Since then, the Czech Republic has gotten three more Oscar nominations, including one win for Jan Sv\u011br\u00e1k's Kolya."
