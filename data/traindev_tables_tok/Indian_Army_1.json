Mechanised Infantry Lieutenant General R K Jagga Ahmednagar Infantry Armoured Corps Indian Army Armoured Corps in 2006 There are 65 Armoured Regiments in the Indian Army ( including the PBG and 61st Cavalry ) . These include the following historic regiments dating back to the nineteenth century or earlier : 1st ( Skinner 's ) Horse , the 2nd Lancers ( Gardner 's Horse ) , the 3rd Cavalry , the 4th ( Hodson 's ) Horse , the 7th Light Cavalry , the 8th Light Cavalry , the 9th ( Deccan ) Horse , the 14th ( Scinde ) Horse , the 17th ( Poona ) Horse , the 15th Lancers , the 16th Light Cavalry , the 18th Cavalry , the 20th Lancers and the 21st ( Central India ) Horse . A substantial number of additional units designated as either `` Cavalry '' or `` Armoured '' Regiments have been raised since Independence . Mechanised Infantry The Mechanised Infantry is the newest Combat Arm of the Indian Army . Often referred to as `` tomorrow 's arm in today 's Army '' , it is formed of two Regiments ; The Brigade of the Guards and Mechanised Infantry Regiment and comprises 48 Mechanised Infantry Battalions in all . The brain-child of raising of this arm was that of Gen Krishnaswamy Sundarji , PVSM ( 28 April 1930 \u2013 8 February 1999 ) , who was the Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army from 1986 to 1988 . During the late 70s , as part of Indian Army modernisation , there was an urgent need to re-calibrate the Indian Mechanised Forces by forming of Mechanised Infantry units to further the shock-action , fire-power , flexibility and mobility of Armoured formations to include ground-holding ability . Thus , the Mechanised Infantry Regiment was born by careful selection of existing Infantry battalions based on operational performance . As the need for more Mechanised battalions grew , the elite Brigade of The Guards were also converted to the Mechanised profile . The two Regiments along with the Armoured Corps form part of the Indian Army 's elite `` Mechanised Forces '' . Infantry Indian Army soldier during a training exercise . Upon its inception , the Indian Army inherited the British Army 's organisational structure , which is still maintained today . Therefore , like its predecessor , an Indian infantry regiment 's responsibility is not to undertake field operations but to provide battalions and well trained personnel to the field formations . As such it is common to find battalions of the same regiment spread across several brigades , divisions , corps , commands , and even theatres . Like its British and Commonwealth counterparts , troops enlisted within the regiment are immensely loyal , take great pride in the regiment to which they are assigned , and generally spend their entire career within the regiment . Most Indian Army infantry regiments recruit based on certain selection criteria , such as on the basis of region ( for example , the Assam Regiment ) , caste/community ( Jat Regiment ) , or religion ( Sikh Regiment ) . Most regiments continue the heritage of regiments raised under the British Raj , but some have been raised after independence . Some regiments raised after independence have specialised in border defence , in particular the Ladakh Scouts , the Arunachal Scouts and the Sikkim Scouts .

Soldiers of the Rajput Regiment during a Republic Day Parade Soldiers of the Sikh Light Infantry during a Republic Day Parade Soldiers of the Madras Regiment during a Republic Day Parade Over the years there have been fears that troops ' allegiance lay more with their regiments and the regions/castes/communities/religions from which they were recruited , as opposed to the union of India as a whole . Thus some `` all India '' or `` all class '' regiments have been created that recruit troops from all over India regardless of region , caste/community or religion , such as the Brigade of the Guards ( which later converted to the Mechanised Infantry profile ) and the Parachute Regiment .",

  "intro": "The Indian Army (Hindi: Bh\u0101rat\u012bya Thal S\u0113n\u0101) is the land-based branch and the largest component of the Indian Armed Forces. The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Army, and it is commanded by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), who is a four-star general. Two officers have been conferred with the rank of field marshal, a five-star rank, which is a ceremonial position of great honour. The Indian Army originated from the armies of the East India Company, which eventually became the British Indian Army, and the armies of the princely states, which finally became the national army after independence. The units and regiments of the Indian Army have diverse histories and have participated in a number of battles and campaigns across the world, earning many battle and theatre honours before and after Independence. The primary mission of the Indian Army is to ensure national security and national unity, defending the nation from external aggression and internal threats, and maintaining peace and security within its borders. It conducts humanitarian rescue operations during natural calamities and other disturbances, like Operation Surya Hope, and can also be requisitioned by the government to cope with internal threats. It is a major component of national power alongside the Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force. The army has been involved in four wars with neighbouring Pakistan and one with China. Other major operations undertaken by the army include: Operation Vijay, Operation Meghdoot and Operation Cactus. Apart from conflicts, the army has conducted large peace time exercises like Operation Brasstacks and Exercise Shoorveer, and it has also been an active participant in numerous United Nations peacekeeping missions including those in: Cyprus, Lebanon, Congo, Angola, Cambodia, Vietnam, Namibia, El Salvador, Liberia, Mozambique, South Sudan and Somalia. The Indian Army has a regimental system, but is operationally and geographically divided into seven commands, with the basic field formation being a division."
