  "intro": "The Singapore Community Shield (also known as the Great Eastern Community Shield due to sponsorship reasons; formerly the Charity Shield) is the curtain-raiser to the football season in Singapore. The match is contested between the champions of the previous Singapore Premier League season and the Singapore Cup winners. In a situation when the same team wins both competition, then it is contested between the Singapore Premier League's champions and runners-up. The Community Shield (known then as the Charity Shield) was first contested in 2008. In the inaugural match, the Singapore Armed Forces defeated Home United 5-4 on penalties following a 1-1 draw. Home United FC are the current holders of the competition after defeating former champions Albirex Niigata (S) 5-4 on penalties after a 0-0 draw in the 2019 of the Shield."
