  "intro": "The world's first skyscraper was built in Chicago in 1885. Since then, the United States has been home to some of the world's tallest skyscrapers. Eleven American buildings have held the title of tallest building in the world (9 in New York City). New York City and Chicago have always been the centers of American skyscraper building. The 10-story Home Insurance Building, built in Chicago in 1885, is regarded as the world's first skyscraper; the building was constructed using a novel steel-loadbearing frame which became a standard of the industry worldwide. Since its topping out in 2013, One World Trade Center in New York City has been the tallest skyscraper in the United States. Its spire brings the structure to a symbolic architectural height of 1,776 feet (541 m), connoting the year the U.S. Declaration of Independence was signed, though the absolute tip (or pinnacle) of the structure is measured at 1,792 ft (546 m). However, the observation deck elevation and highest occupied floor of One World Trade Center are surpassed by 432 Park Avenue and Chicago's Willis Tower (formerly and still commonly known as the Sears Tower). Steinway Tower, and Central Park Tower will also have higher occupied floors and roofs upon their completion. Prior to the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City, the twin towers of the World Trade Center occupied the second and third positions on the list below, behind Willis Tower. The North Tower stood at 1,368 feet (417 m), while the South Tower was 1,362 feet (415 m) tall."
