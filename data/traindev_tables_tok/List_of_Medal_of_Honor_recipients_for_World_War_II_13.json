Maneuvering on the surface into the midst of a heavily escorted convoy , O'Kane landed hits on three tankers , swung his ship to fire at a freighter and shot out of the path of an onrushing transport . Boxed in by blazing tankers , a freighter , transport , and several destroyers , he blasted two of the targets and cleared the area . Twenty-four hours later , he made contact with another heavily escorted convoy . In the midst of relentless enemy fire , he sent two torpedoes into the first and second transports and an adjacent tanker . He charged the enemy at high speed , exploding the tanker in a burst of flame , smashing the transport dead in the water , and blasting the destroyer . He fired his last two torpedoes at the remnants of the convoy before the second torpedo malfunctioned , performing a circular run and hitting the Tang in the stern . O'Kane along with eight officers survived the sinking . He remained a Japanese prisoner-of-war until 1945"

  "intro": "This is a list of Medal of Honor recipients for World War II. The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War and is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States or an opposing foreign force. Due to the nature of this medal, it is commonly presented posthumously. World War II, or the Second World War, was a global military conflict, the joining of what had initially been two separate conflicts. The first began in Asia in 1937 as the Second Sino-Japanese War; the other began in Europe in 1939 with the German and Soviet invasion of Poland. This global conflict split the majority of the world's nations into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. The United States was drawn into World War II on December 8, 1941, a day after the Axis-member Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in Honolulu that killed almost 2,500 people in what was considered the biggest peacetime loss on American soil inflicted by foreign people at that time. For actions during World War II, 472 United States military personnel received the Medal of Honor. Seventeen of these were Japanese-Americans fighting in both Europe and the Pacific, many of which were upgraded from Distinguished Service Crosses during the Clinton administration. Additionally, Douglas Albert Munro was the only serviceman from the United States Coast Guard in United States military history to receive the Medal for his actions during the war. The earliest action for which a U.S. serviceman earned a World War II Medal of Honor was the attack on Pearl Harbor, for which 17 U.S. servicemen were awarded a Medal, although they did so while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force rather than enemy since the United States was neutral during the events of December 7, 1941."
