  "section_text": "The following is a list of isotopes of elements given in the previous tables which have been designated unique symbols . By this it is meant that a comprehensive list of current systematic symbols ( in the uAtom form ) are not included in the list and can instead be found in the Isotope index chart . The symbols for the named isotopes of hydrogen , deuterium ( D ) , and tritium ( T ) are still in use today , as is thoron ( Tn ) for radon-220 ( though not actinon ; An is usually used instead for a generic actinide ) . Heavy water and other deuterated solvents are commonly used in chemistry , and it is convenient to use a single character rather than a symbol with a subscript in these cases . The practice also continues with tritium compounds . When the name of the solvent is given , a lowercase d is sometimes used . For example , d6-benzene and C6D6 can be used instead of [ 2H6 ] C6H6 . [ 12 ] The symbols for isotopes of elements other than hydrogen and radon are no longer in use within the scientific community . Many of these symbols were designated during the early years of radiochemistry , and several isotopes ( namely those in the decay chains of actinium , radium , and thorium ) bear placeholder names using the early naming system devised by Ernest Rutherford .

  "intro": "Chemical symbols are abbreviations used in chemistry for chemical elements , functional groups and chemical compounds. Element symbols for chemical elements normally consist of one or two letters from the Latin alphabet and are written with the first letter capitalised. Earlier symbols for chemical elements stem from classical Latin and Greek vocabulary. For some elements, this is because the material was known in ancient times, while for others, the name is a more recent invention. For example, Pb is the symbol for lead ( plumbum in Latin); Hg is the symbol for mercury ( hydrargyrum in Greek); and He is the symbol for helium (a new Latin name) because helium was not known in ancient Roman times. Some symbols come from other sources, like W for tungsten ( Wolfram in German) which was not known in Roman times. A 3-letter temporary symbol may be assigned to a newly synthesized (or not yet synthesized) element. For example, Uno was the temporary symbol for hassium (element 108) which had the temporary name of unniloctium , based on its atomic number being 8 greater than 100. There are also some historical symbols that are no longer officially used. In addition to the letters for the element itself, additional details may be added to the symbol as superscripts or subscripts a particular isotope , ionization , or oxidation state , or other atomic detail. A few isotopes have their own specific symbols rather than just an isotopic detail added to their element symbol."
