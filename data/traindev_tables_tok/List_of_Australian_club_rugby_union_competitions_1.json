  "section_text": "Main article : Queensland Premier Rugby Queensland Premier Rugby is the top club competition in Queensland . Nine clubs take part : eight from Brisbane and a club each from the Gold Coast . The first club rugby competition in Queensland was the Hospital Football Challenge , which began in 1899 . It was an annual fund-raising venture for the Brisbane Hospital , but the game fell away during and after WWI , and rugby union was abandoned in Queensland after 1919 . The competition was restored in 1929 and the original trophy , the magnificent Hospital Cup became the premiership trophy again . It is now awarded to the winner of the Premier Rugby grand final .

  "intro": "In Australia, what is considered the third tier of Rugby is often referred to as club rugby, grade rugby or premier rugby. Club Rugby often focuses on the major metropolitan areas of the respective unions, with teams representing various districts and suburbs. The teams represented in the first grade can and have changed over time, and are open to change at the discretion of the governing body."
