  "intro": "The BBC broadcasts all of the BBC One and BBC Two regional variations on digital satellite television from the SES Astra satellites at 28.2\u00b0 east; providing local news programmes and other regional programming with local continuity and presentation for Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The BBC refers to the whole UK regional network as BBC Nations and Regions. The local version of BBC One is normally on channel 101, with BBC Two on channel 102. On Freesat equipment, users enter a postcode during initial set up - this determines the correct local version. On Sky equipment, the address to which the viewing card was issued determines the correct local version - without any viewing card the London versions are shown by default. All other national and regional versions are shown in the EPG."
