  "section_text": "Regional news inserts are broadcast during BBC Breakfast along with 15-minute shows on weekdays after national news bulletins at 1.30 pm and 10.30 pm , along with a 30-minute show at 6.30 pm . On weekends the availability of a regional news bulletin following the national news depends on the timeslot . In England\u2014other than regional news programmes\u2014regional opt-outs include the documentary strand Inside Out , a regional segment of Sunday Politics and in the northern regions ( those based in Hull , Leeds , Manchester and Newcastle ) The Super League Show . Elsewhere , additional local programming is broadcast ; ( notable examples include Give My Head Peace and Spotlight in Northern Ireland , River City and Sportscene in Scotland and Belonging and Crash in Wales ) with network programmes rescheduled to accommodate them . BBC One HD started broadcasting on 3 November 2010 . There are currently four regional variations \u2013 a network variant for England , a Northern Ireland variant that launched on 24 October 2012 , [ 5 ] a Scottish variation that launched on 14 January 2013 and a Welsh variation that launched on 29 January 2013 .

  "intro": "The BBC broadcasts all of the BBC One and BBC Two regional variations on digital satellite television from the SES Astra satellites at 28.2\u00b0 east; providing local news programmes and other regional programming with local continuity and presentation for Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The BBC refers to the whole UK regional network as BBC Nations and Regions. The local version of BBC One is normally on channel 101, with BBC Two on channel 102. On Freesat equipment, users enter a postcode during initial set up - this determines the correct local version. On Sky equipment, the address to which the viewing card was issued determines the correct local version - without any viewing card the London versions are shown by default. All other national and regional versions are shown in the EPG."
