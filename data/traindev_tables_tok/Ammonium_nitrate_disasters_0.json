One hour later , the ship exploded , killing several hundred people and setting fire to another vessel , the High Flyer , which was moored 250 metres away and which contained 1050 tonnes of sulfur and 960 tons of ammonium nitrate . The Grandcamp explosion also created a powerful earthshock that broke windows as far as 40 miles away and knocked two small planes flying at 1,500 feet ( 460 m ) out of the sky . The High Flyer exploded the next day , after having burned for sixteen hours . 500 tonnes of ammonium nitrate on the quayside also burned , but without exploding , probably because it was less tightly packed .

The explosives were to be used in the blasting of rock while constructing Highway 71 . The result of the explosions were the deaths of six firemen from the Kansas City Fire Department 's Pumper Companies 30 and 41 . Both companies were dispatched after 911 calls indicated that a pickup truck located near the trailers had been set on fire . The responding companies were warned that there were explosives on-site ; however , they were unaware that the trailers were essentially magazines filled with explosives . At 4:07 AM one of the magazines caught fire and a catastrophic explosion occurred , killing all six firemen instantly - only sparing remains were found . A second blast occurred 40 minutes later , although all fire crews had been pulled back at this time . The blasts created two craters , each approximately 100 feet ( 30 m ) wide and 8 feet ( 2.4 m ) deep . The explosions also shattered windows within a 10-mile ( 16 km ) area and could be heard 40 miles ( 64 km ) away .

Large stockpiles of the material can be a major fire risk due to their supporting oxidation, and may also detonate, as happened in the Texas City disaster of 1947, which led to major changes in the regulations for storage and handling.
