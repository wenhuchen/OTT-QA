  "section_text": "The first book was written in 1981 , with Richard Sharpe in Spain at the Talavera Campaign in 1809 . The next seven books were written in order up to Sharpe 's Siege in 1814 . The novel Sharpe 's Rifles was written next , set earlier in 1809 at the time of the retreat from Corunna , Spain .

Cornwell then moved to the beginning of Sharpe 's army career in British India with Sharpe 's Tiger set in 1799 , beginning a series of three books , closing with Sharpe 's Prey set in 1807 . Cornwell followed this with two novels and four short stories which lie between Sharpe 's Rifles ( 1809 ) and Sharpe 's Devil ( 1820\u201321 ) . Cornwell published the non-fiction book Waterloo : The History of Four Days , Three Armies and Three Battles in September 2014 , timely for the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo . [ 1 ]",

  "intro": "Sharpe is a series of historical fiction stories by Bernard Cornwell centered on the character of Richard Sharpe. The stories formed the basis for an ITV television series featuring Sean Bean in the title role. Cornwell's series is composed of several novels and short stories, and charts Sharpe's progress in the British Army during the Napoleonic Wars. He begins in Sharpe's Tiger as a private in the 33rd Regiment of Foot who becomes a sergeant by the end of the book; he is an ensign in the 74th Regiment during Sharpe's Trafalgar who is transferred to the newly formed 95th Rifles as a second lieutenant. He is gradually promoted through the ranks, finally becoming a lieutenant colonel in Sharpe's Waterloo. The character of Sharpe is born a guttersnipe in the rookeries of London, and the stories dramatize his struggle for acceptance and respect from his fellow officers and from the men whom he commands. He is commissioned an officer on the battlefield and overcomes class in an army where an officer's rank is often bought. He is an experienced soldier, unlike many of the officers with whom he serves. His adventures result in his improbable presence at nearly every important event in the British Empire at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th Centuries. Sharpe is described as brilliant but wayward in Sharpe's Sword, and he is portrayed by the author as a loose cannon. He is a highly skilled leader of light troops who takes part in a range of historical events during the Napoleonic Wars and other conflicts, including the Battle of Waterloo. He is considered dangerous to have as an enemy; he is a skilled marksman and grows to be a good swordsman."
