  "intro": "Cedar Point is a 364-acre (147 ha) amusement park located on a Lake Erie peninsula in Sandusky, Ohio. Opened in the late-1800s, it is reported to be the second-oldest operating amusement park in the United States behind Lake Compounce. Cedar Point is owned and operated by Cedar Fair and is considered the flagship of the amusement park chain. Known as America's Roller Coast, the park features a world-record 72 rides, including 17 roller coasters - the second-most in the world behind Six Flags Magic Mountain. Its newest roller coaster, Steel Vengeance, opened to the public on May 5, 2018. Cedar Point's normal operating season runs from early May until Labor Day in September. The park then reopens only on weekends until the end of October or early November for a Halloween-themed event known as HalloWeekends. Other attractions near the park include a one-mile-long (1.6 km) white-sand beach, an outdoor water park called Cedar Point Shores, an indoor water park called Castaway Bay, two marinas, an outdoor sports complex called Cedar Point Sports Center, and several nearby resorts. The park has reached several milestones. It is the only amusement park in the world with six roller coasters that are at least 200 feet (61 m) in height - Magnum XL-200, Millennium Force, Wicked Twister, Top Thrill Dragster, Valravn, and Steel Vengeance - as well as the only one with roller coasters in all four height classifications. Cedar Point also received the Golden Ticket Award for Best Amusement Park in the World from Amusement Today for 16 consecutive years from 1997-2013. The park is the most visited seasonal amusement park in the United States with an estimated 3.6 million visitors in 2017."
