  "section_title": "Areas and attractions -- Coney Mall",
  "section_text": "When Kings Island first opened in 1972 , a section of the park was dedicated to its predecessor , Coney Island . The area was constructed to resemble the former park 's carnival-style layout and featured many of its flat rides which were relocated , including Monster , Scrambler , and Dodgem . One of the flagship attractions during the park 's inaugural year , The Racer , was located in this section . [ 61 ] In addition to rides , some of Coney Island 's famous Ginkgo trees were transplanted , lining the middle of the walkway . [ 7 ] Originally called Coney Island , the area was later renamed Old Coney in 1980 and again to its present name Coney Mall in 1986 . [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] The area also features game booths , arcades and concession stands reminiscent of state fairs and traveling carnivals from the early twentieth century . [ 66 ] In 1975 , Zodiac debuted in the Coney Island mall , which was billed as a `` spinning , climbing double ferris wheel '' . [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Brokered by Intamin and manufactured by Waagner-Biro , the three-minute ride featured twelve gondolas on each of the two wheels which were mounted to a long , hydraulic arm . [ 67 ] [ 68 ] It closed in 1986 and reopened at Wonderland Sydney in 1989 . [ 69 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ] In the 1980s , the area saw the additions of Skylab , Zephyr , and Vortex , a six-inversion looping roller coaster that briefly held a world record for most inversions . [ 7 ] [ 72 ] Following Paramount 's acquisition of the park in 1992 , Coney Mall was further expanded in 1994 with Days of Thunder , a motion simulator ride in the new Action Theater attraction , and in 1996 with Flight of Fear , the world 's first launched roller coaster to feature a linear induction motor ( LIM ) . [ 7 ] [ 72 ] In 2005 , one of the last Paramount-themed attractions to open at the park , The Italian Job : Stunt Track ( now known as Backlot Stunt Coaster ) , was unveiled . [ 7 ] [ 73 ] The roller coaster replaced the antique car ride Les Taxis . [ 74 ] Firehawk , a flying roller coaster previously known as X-Flight at Geauga Lake , was relocated to Kings Island next to Flight of Fear in 2007 . [ 72 ] The area housing both roller coasters became known as X-Base , a sub-section within Coney Mall that took on its own theme . [ 75 ] The most recent addition to Coney Mall was WindSeeker , added in 2011 . The 301-foot-tall ( 92 m ) , three-minute swing ride features 32 , two-person carriages that spin around a central tower up to 30 miles per hour ( 48 km/h ) . [ 76 ] Kings Mill Antique Autos , a new antique cars ride , debuted in 2019 . [ 77 ] Kings Island announced in September 2019 that Vortex would be closing permanently after 33 years of operation on October 27 , 2019 . [ 78 ] [ 79 ]",

  "intro": "Kings Island is a 364-acre (147 ha) amusement park located 24 miles (39 km) northeast of Cincinnati in Mason, Ohio. Owned and operated by Cedar Fair, the park first opened in 1972 by the Taft Broadcasting Company. It was part of a larger effort to move and expand Coney Island, a popular resort destination along the banks of the Ohio River that was prone to frequent flooding. After more than $300 million in capital investments, the park features over 100 attractions including fourteen roller coasters and a 33-acre (13 ha) water park. Early in its history, Kings Island has appeared in popular sitcoms and received widespread recognition for its record-breaking attractions and events. One of the park's most well-known attractions, The Racer, is often credited with reviving worldwide interest in roller coasters during the 1970s. Others, such as The Beast and Banshee, have set several world records, some of which remain standing. The largest investment in park history is Orion, a giga coaster scheduled to open in 2020. The park has also suffered through times of negative publicity, particularly surrounding the early demise of roller coasters The Bat and Son of Beast. Kings Island is divided into several themed sections and operates seasonally from early spring through the fall, partially reopening for Winterfest during the holiday season. In 2017, Kings Island was the second-most visited seasonal amusement park in the United States behind Cedar Point, with an estimated 3.47 million visitors. It was third overall for seasonal attendance in North America, which was led by Canada's Wonderland."
