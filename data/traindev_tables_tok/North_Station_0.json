  "section_title": "History -- North Station",
  "section_text": "North Station in the early 1960s Until the 1960s , the station was the hub for long-distance B & M service to multiple locales north and west of Boston , usually in conjunction with other railroads . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Service cutbacks began in the 1950s , and service soon dwindled down to commuter rail operations . The last intercity service to Portland , Maine and to north of Concord , New Hampshire ended on January 4 , 1965 . [ 1 ] By this point , the intercity train itineraries consisted of self-propelled Budd Rail Diesel Cars , often just one or two cars for the trip . Single commuter-oriented daily round trips on these routes to Concord and Dover , New Hampshire lasted until June 30 , 1967 . [ 1 ] Limited MBTA Commuter Rail service to Concord was run from January 28 , 1980 to March 1 , 1981 as part of a federally funded experiment . [ 1 ]",
  "uid": "North_Station_0",
  "intro": "North Station is a major transportation hub located at Causeway and Nashua Streets in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. It is one of the city's two inbound terminals for Amtrak and MBTA Commuter Rail trains, the other being South Station. The main concourse of North Station is located at the street level immediately below TD Garden, Boston's main indoor sports and entertainment facility, allowing people attending events there to take advantage of the extensive transportation connections at the site."
