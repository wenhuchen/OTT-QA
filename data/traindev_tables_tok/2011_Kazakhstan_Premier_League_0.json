The season began on 6 March 2011 and ended on 29 October 2011. Tobol were the defending champions having won their first league championship last year. As in the 2010 season, the competition was completed in two stages, with all twelve clubs playing twice against each other before splitting up into two groups of six teams each, according to their position after 22 matches. However, all earned points after the first stage will be halved this time, with any odd numbers of points being rounded up. Shakhter won the championship, the teams' first title."
