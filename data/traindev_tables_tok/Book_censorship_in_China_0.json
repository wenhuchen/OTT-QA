  "intro": "Book censorship in the People's Republic of China (PRC) is implemented or mandated by the PRC's ruling party, the Communist Party of China. Book censorship is widespread in China. Enforcement is strict and sometimes inconsistent. Punishment for violations can result in prison. [citation needed] The Chinese government is extremely sensitive to any opinions on the politics and history of China and its leaders that differ from currently sanctioned opinions, or that discuss topics which are officially taboo. What is officially taboo can change over time. Nowadays,[clarification needed] book censorship does exist not only in mainland China but also in Hong Kong. Causeway Bay Books is an example."
