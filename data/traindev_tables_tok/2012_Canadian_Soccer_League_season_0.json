  "intro": "The 2012 Canadian Soccer League season (known as the Givova Canadian Soccer League for sponsorship reasons) was the 15th since its establishment where a total of 28 teams from Ontario and Quebec took part in the league. The season began on 5 May 2012, and concluded on 27 October 2012. Toronto Croatia defended their championship in a 1-0 victory over the Montreal Impact Academy in the CSL Championship final at Centennial Park Stadium in Toronto. Montreal became the second Quebec club after Trois-Rivi\u00e8res Attak to reach the final, while Toronto added more silverware to their cabinet by winning the double during the regular season. In the Second Division SC Toronto B won their first Second Division championship, and TFC Academy II secured the regular season title. The league grew to a record amount of 16 first division teams with Kingston, Waterloo, and Niagara being promoted to the first division. A number of CSL teams began operating their academy teams in the Canadian Academy of Futbol (CAF). During the past three seasons the league's player developmental system made further advances with 27 players moving overseas, and 42 being selected to the Canada national team program. While six TFC Academy players were signed by first team Toronto FC of the Major League Soccer. Rogers TV continued broadcasting matches for the CSL, while CogecoTV provided coverage to the Niagara and Kingston regions. The league reintroduced their television program This Week in the CSL with producer Alex Bastyovanszky returning to host the program with Rogers TV broadcasting the program."
