  "intro": "Boss is an American political drama television serial created by Farhad Safinia. The series stars Kelsey Grammer as Tom Kane, the mayor of Chicago, who has recently been diagnosed with dementia with Lewy bodies, a degenerative neurological disorder. The series was broadcast in the United States on the premium television service Starz and was produced by Category 5 Entertainment, Grammnet Productions and Lionsgate Television. On September 27, 2011, before the series premiered, Starz announced that Boss had been renewed for a second season of ten episodes. The first season premiered on October 21, 2011 and the second season premiered on August 17, 2012. On November 20, 2012, it was announced that Starz had cancelled the show. A film was discussed to finish the show's storylines, but those plans were cancelled after series creator Farhad Safinia declined to move forward with the project."
