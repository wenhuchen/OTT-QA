  "intro": "Czech Republic competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation's third appearance at the Summer Olympics after gaining its independence from the former Czechoslovakia. The Czech Olympic Committee sent the nation's largest team to the Games since the post-Czechoslovak era. A total of 142 athletes, 80 men and 62 women, competed in 19 sports; the nation's team size was roughly denser from Sydney by one sixth of the athletes. Women's basketball was the only team-based sport in which the Czech Republic had its representation at these Olympic Games. There was only a single competitor in equestrian, artistic and trampoline gymnastics, judo, and weightlifting. The Czech team featured two defending Olympic champions: slalom kayaker \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nka Hilgertov\u00e1, who made her fourth Olympic appearance as the most experienced female athlete, and javelin throwing legend Jan \u017delezn\u00fd, who had won three consecutive Olympic titles throughout his illustrious sporting career, and competed at his fifth Olympics. Meanwhile, freestyle swimmer and top medal favorite Kv\u011btoslav Svoboda was appointed by the committee to carry the Czech flag in the opening ceremony. Other notable Czech athletes featured decathletes and Olympic medalists Roman \u0160ebrle and Tom\u00e1\u0161 Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, double Olympic champion Martin Doktor in men's sprint canoeing, and rifle shooter Kate\u0159ina K\u016frkov\u00e1, who eventually married to the American and Olympic rifle prone titleholder Matt Emmons. Czech Republic left Athens with a total of nine Olympic medals (one gold, three silver, and four bronze), surpassing the record set in Sydney four years earlier by just a single medal. Roman \u0160ebrle, who previously won silver in Sydney, ended a 20-year drought to set an Olympic record and to receive the nation's only gold medal in men's decathlon, while Libor Capalini set a historic milestone for Czech Republic to pick up its first Olympic medal in modern pentathlon. Meanwhile, V\u011bra Posp\u00ed\u0161ilov\u00e1-Cechlov\u00e1 originally finished fourth in women's discus throw."
