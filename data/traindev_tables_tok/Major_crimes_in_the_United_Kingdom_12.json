        "In September and October 2012 , almost a year after his death , claims were widely publicised that the radio and television presenter Jimmy Savile had committed sexual abuse , his alleged victims ranging from prepubescent girls and boys to adults . By 11 October 2012 allegations had been made to 13 British police forces , and this led to the setting-up of inquiries into practices at the BBC and within the National Health Service . On 19 October 2012 , the Metropolitan Police Service launched a formal criminal investigation , Operation Yewtree , into historic allegations of child sexual abuse by Savile and other people ( some still living ) , over four decades . It stated that it was pursuing over 400 separate lines of inquiry , based on the claims of 200 witnesses , via 14 police forces across the UK . It described the alleged abuse as being on an unprecedented scale , and the number of potential victims as staggering . By December 2012 , eight people had been questioned as part of the investigation . The Metropolitan Police stated that the total number of alleged victims was 589 , of whom 450 alleged abuse by Savile . Inquiries into living people as well as Savile are currently continuing",

In May 2013 , they were convicted of sexual offences including rape , conspiracy to commit rape , arranging or facilitating child prostitution , trafficking for sexual exploitation , and procuring a miscarriage . Their victims were subjected to sexual violence marked out by its sadism : sexual assaults designed to draw blood , multiple rapes , [ and ] physical attacks in which [ they were ] choked . As in the similar Rochdale , Rotherham , Derby and Telford prosecutions , all gang members were from Muslim backgrounds , and the girls were white , leading to renewed discussion as to whether the crimes were racially motivated and whether the initial failure to investigate them was linked to the authorities ' fear of being accused of racism . In March 2015 , a report revealed that more than 300 people ( mostly girls from Oxford ) , had been groomed and sexually exploited by the gang . It accused the Thames Valley Police of disbelieving the girls and failing to act on repeated calls for help , and Oxfordshire Social Services of failing to protect them despite compelling evidence they were in danger . The report also called for research into why a significant amount of perpetrators of child grooming come from Muslim backgrounds",
