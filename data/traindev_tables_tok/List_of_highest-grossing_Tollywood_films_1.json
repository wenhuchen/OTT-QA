  "section_text": "Main article : List of highest-grossing Bengali films Bengali cinema is the Bengali language film industry centered in the Tollygunge neighborhood of Kolkata , West Bengal . It has been known by the nickname Tollywood , a portmanteau of the words Tollygunge and Hollywood , since 1932 .",
  "uid": "List_of_highest-grossing_Tollywood_films_1",
  "intro": "This is a ranking of the highest grossing Indian films which includes films from various languages based on the conservative global box office estimates as reported by reputable sources. There is no official tracking of domestic box office figures within India, and Indian sites publishing data are frequently pressured to increase their domestic box office estimates. Indian films have been screened in markets around the world since the early 20th century. As of 2003, there are markets in over 90 countries where films from India are screened. During the first decade of the 21st century, there was a steady rise in the ticket price, a tripling in the number of theaters and an increase in the number of prints of a film being released, which led to a large increase in the box office collections. The majority of highest-grossing Indian films are Bollywood (Hindi) films. As of 2014, Bollywood represents 43% of the net box office revenue in India, while Tamil and Telugu cinema represent 36%, and other regional industries constitute 21%. See List of highest-grossing films in India for domestic gross figures and List of highest-grossing Indian films in overseas markets for overseas gross figures."
