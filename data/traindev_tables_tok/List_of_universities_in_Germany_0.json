  "section_text": "The University of Greifswald is the smallest among the oldest universities of Germany . This is a list of the ten oldest universities that have been in continuous operation since their founding in present-day Germany . Some universities were established in the 14th or 15th centuries , but shut down for longer periods and later re-opened ( e.g . the universities of Cologne , Erfurt , Ingolstadt , Mainz and W\u00fcrzburg ) . These are not included in this list .",

  "intro": "This is a list of the universities in Germany, of which there are about seventy. The list also includes German Technische Universit\u00e4ten (universities of technology), which have official and full university status, but usually focus on engineering and the natural sciences rather than covering the whole spectrum of academic disciplines. Some seventeen German universities rank among top 250 universities in world Highest ranked universities in Germany include some research oriented universities for MS, MBA and Medical and Engineering. The list does not, however, cover the German Fachhochschulen (University of Applied Sciences) or institutions that cover only certain disciplines such as business studies, fine arts, or engineering. Those do not have all of the responsibilities and limitations of universities, and most cannot award doctorate degrees on their own. A private university is included in the list if it awards its own doctorate degree. In general, public German universities do not charge tuition fees. At many universities this usually also applies to foreign students, though regulations for non-EU foreign citizens differ regionally. Universities may charge small fees for administrative costs."
