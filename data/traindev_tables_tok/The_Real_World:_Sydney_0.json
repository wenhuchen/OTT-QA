  "intro": "The Real World: Sydney is the nineteenth season of MTV's reality television series The Real World, which focuses on a group of diverse strangers living together for several months in a different city each season, as cameras follow their lives and interpersonal relationships. It is the only season to be filmed in Australia. The season featured a total of eight cast members over the course of the season, as one cast member was replaced after she voluntarily left the show. It is the third of four seasons of The Real World to be filmed entirely outside of the United States after The Real World: London in 1995, The Real World: Paris in 2003, and before The Real World: Cancun in 2009. Production lasted from February to May 26, 2007 and premiered on August 8 of that year, consisting of 24 episodes."
