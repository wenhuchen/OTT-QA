        "The son of a welder , Cohutta is a self-employed contractor who builds log homes for a living . Cohutta 's name , which is Cherokee for mountains that hold up the sky , is derived from the Cohutta Mountain Range in Georgia . He attended Dalton State College and North Georgia Technical College , and is close to his family , which includes his parents , as well as his younger sister and grandfather . He enjoys mountain hiking , horseback riding , and playing the guitar , and is looking for someone with whom he can start a family . He took part in The Real World partially due to pressure from friends , and as part of his goal to see as much as possible before settling down with a wife and children . He has done very little traveling away from home , and characterizes his home town and family as being slower , because they take the time to sit down to eat together and enjoy the moment . Consequently , he feels out of place whenever he visits a city . He eventually begins a relationship with KellyAnne . Cohutta subsequently appeared on the Challenge",

In Episode 16 , he reveals that he used to take a lot of LSD , from which he still suffers from occasional hallucinations of birds , and that when he sees a black bird , he interprets it as a premonition that someone close to him has died .
