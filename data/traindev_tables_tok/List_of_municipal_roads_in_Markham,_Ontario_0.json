These roads are named as municipal roads. These municipal roads are served for motorists to travel within the city. The Markham government also funded all of the local, light-duty Collector roads. This article lists all the major municipal roads funded by Markham. Regional roads are maintained by York Region Transportation Services Department and all other roads by the City of Markham's Operations Department."
