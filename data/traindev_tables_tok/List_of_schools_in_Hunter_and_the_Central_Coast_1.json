  "section_text": "In New South Wales , a high school generally covers Years 7 to 12 in the education system , and a central or community school , intended to provide comprehensive education in a rural district , covers Kindergarten to Year 12 . An additional class of high schools has emerged in recent years as a result of amalgamations which have produced multi-campus colleges consisting of Junior and Senior campuses . While most schools are comprehensive and take in all students of high school age living within its defined school boundaries , some schools are either specialist in a given Key Learning Area , or selective in that they set examinations or other performance criteria for entrance . In the Hunter and Central Coast region , Gorokan , Gosford and Merewether High Schools are selective , whilst Hunter School of Performing Arts and Hunter Sports High School are specialist .",
