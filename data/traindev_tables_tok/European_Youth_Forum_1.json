It strives for youth rights in international institutions such as the European Union, the Council of Europe, and the United Nations. The European Youth Forum works in the fields of youth policy and youth work development. It focuses its work on European youth policy matters, whilst through engagement on the global level, it is enhancing the capacities of its members and promoting global interdependence. In its daily work, the European Youth Forum represents the views and opinions of youth organizations in all relevant policy areas and promotes the cross-sectoral nature of youth policy towards a variety of institutional actors. The principles of equality and sustainable development are mainstreamed in the work of the European Youth Forum. As of July 2017, it consists of 43 National Youth Councils and 61 international youth NGOs, a total of 104 bodies from across Europe."
