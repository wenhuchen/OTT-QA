        "Prototype suspended coaster . Although intense , the ride had a fair share of downtime as a result of the designers not banking the track as they did with later suspended coasters . This concept was reintroduced with Top Gun ( later renamed Flight Deck ) in 1993 , which was significantly more reliable . The Bat closed in 1983 , remained standing but not operating in 1984 , and was demolished in spring 1985 . It was replaced with Vortex , the world 's first six-looping roller coaster , which opened in 1987 . The Bat 's name would eventually be reused , as Flight Deck was renamed The Bat for the 2014 season",

On September 27 , 2018 , Kings Island announced that they would remove the ride from the park following the 2018 season due to it operating sporadically and that the manufacturer , Vekoma , had stopped supporting the model and therefore parts were increasing expensive and hard to find . And in August 2019 , Kings Island announced that Firehawk would be replaced by the Orion giga coaster in 2020",

        "Son of Beast was the first wooden roller coaster with a vertical loop and at the time the only wooden hypercoaster . In response to 27 injuries that occurred on July 9 , 2006 , Cedar Fair installed lighter trains acquired from the Hurricane : Category 5 roller coaster at the former Myrtle Beach Pavilion and removed the loop in order for the new trains to complete the circuit . It reopened on July 4 , 2007 , but closed indefinitely on June 23 , 2009 , following another injury report . Park officials confirmed on March 15 , 2010 , that they had no plan to reopen the ride . It was removed from Kings Island 's park map and the ride list on the official web site in early 2010 . After reviewing all options , Kings Island officials announced on July 27 , 2012 , that Son of Beast would be taken down to allow for more park expansion . The lift hill was demolished on November 20 , 2012 , at 11:02 a.m . ET . An inverted roller coaster , Banshee , was opened on the former Son of Beast site on April 18 , 2014 , and the station is now used for the Haunt attraction Wolf Pack",
