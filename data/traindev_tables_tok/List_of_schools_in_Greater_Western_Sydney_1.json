  "section_text": "In New South Wales , a high school generally covers Years 7 to 12 in the education system , and a central or community school , intended to provide comprehensive education in a rural district , covers Kindergarten to Year 12 . An additional class of high schools has emerged in recent years as a result of amalgamations which have produced multi-campus colleges consisting of Junior and Senior campuses . While most schools are comprehensive and take in all students of high school age living within its defined school boundaries , some schools are either specialist in a given key learning area , or selective in that they set examinations or other performance criteria for entrance .",
