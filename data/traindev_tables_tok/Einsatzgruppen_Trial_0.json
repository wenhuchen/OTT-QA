  "intro": "Einsatzgruppen Trial (officially, The United States of America vs. Otto Ohlendorf, et al.) was the ninth of the twelve trials for war crimes and crimes against humanity by the US authorities held in their occupation zone in Germany in Nuremberg after the end of World War II. These twelve trials were all held before US military courts, not before the International Military Tribunal. They took place in the same rooms at the Palace of Justice. The twelve US trials are collectively known as the Subsequent Nuremberg trials or, more formally, as the Trials of War Criminals before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals (NMT)."
