  "section_text": "The RVAH designation was created in 1964 when the Navy 's nuclear bomber role was ended and the Heavy Attack ( VAH ) squadrons which were then equipped with the A-5A Vigilante nuclear bombers were converted to Reconnaissance squadrons and their A-5A nuclear bombers were converted to RA-5C reconnaissance aircraft . Those VAH squadrons which were then still equipped with the A-3B remained designated Heavy Attack ( VAH ) squadrons . The designation was retired in 1979 with the disestablishment of the last RA-5C squadron .",
  "uid": "List_of_inactive_United_States_Navy_aircraft_squadrons_8",
  "intro": "There are hundreds of US Navy aircraft squadrons which are not currently active dating back to before World War II (the U.S. Navy operated aircraft prior to World War I, but it did not organize them in squadrons until after that war). To be more accurate: there are hundreds of former U.S. Navy aircraft squadrons which have been disestablished and no longer exist and there are approximately 40 or so U.S. Navy aircraft squadrons which have been deactivated and which currently exist only on paper in an inactive status. These disestablished and/or deactivated squadrons are sometimes incorrectly referred to as decommissioned squadrons, but proper usage prior to 1998, was that squadrons were established and disestablished and after 1998, squadrons are established, deactivated and sometimes reactivated. It has never been correct to refer to U.S. Navy aircraft squadrons as being commissioned and decommissioned, ships are commissioned and decommissioned, U.S. Navy aircraft squadrons are not."
