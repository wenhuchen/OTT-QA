  "intro": "This is a list of Baptist churches that are notable either as congregations or as buildings. The Baptist churches here are descended from the English dissenters who broke out Baptist church from other Protestant churches in Britain in the 1700s. There is an alternative view, that earlier Anabaptist churches started the Baptist church, but this list-article does not include those. (See List of Anabaptist churches)."
