  "intro": "The Ninety-fourth United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It met in Washington, DC from January 3, 1975, to January 3, 1977, during the administration of U.S. President Gerald Ford. This is the first congress for the currently (as of the 116th) longest serving senator, Patrick Leahy of Vermont. The apportionment of seats in this House of Representatives was based on the Nineteenth Census of the United States in 1970. Both chambers had a Democratic majority."
