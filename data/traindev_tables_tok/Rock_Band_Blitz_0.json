  "intro": "Rock Band Blitz is a rhythm game in the Rock Band series from Harmonix as a downloadable game for Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network and WiiWare, released in August 2012. Unlike previous iterations of Rock Band, Blitz is not sold with any special instrument controllers, and was designed to use regular console controllers to match notes in a song, using gameplay mechanics similar to Harmonix' previous titles of Frequency, Amplitude, and Rock Band Unplugged. In addition to 25 songs that will ship with the game, the title is capable of using any songs the player has downloaded or exported for Rock Band 3. Due to music license expirations, the game was delisted from the PSN and Xbox Live storefronts on August 28, 2017."
