  "intro": "Sport in India refers to the large variety of games played in India, ranging from tribal games to more mainstream sports such as cricket, badminton and football. India's diversity of culture, people and tribe as well as its colonial legacy is reflected in the wide variety of sporting disciplines in the country. Cricket is the most popular sport in India, the country having hosted and won multiple Cricket World Cups. Field hockey is the most successful sport for India at the Olympics; the Indian men's team has won eight Olympic gold medals. Kabaddi is the most popular indigenous sport in the country. Other popular sports in India are badminton, football, shooting, wrestling, boxing, tennis, squash, weightlifting, gymnastics, athletics, table tennis, basketball, volleyball and cycling. Popular indigenous sports include chess, kho-kho, kite-fighting, leg cricket, polo, snooker and gillidanda. India has hosted and co-hosted several international sporting events, most notably the 1987, 1996 and 2011 Cricket World Cups, the 1951 and 1982 Asian Games, the 2010 Commonwealth Games, and the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Domestic professional sports leagues in the country include the Indian Premier League (Twenty20 cricket), the I-League and the Indian Super League (football), the Pro Kabaddi League (kabaddi), the Hockey India League (field hockey), Premier Badminton League (badminton), the Pro Wrestling League (wrestling), the Ultimate Table Tennis league (table tennis), and the Pro Volleyball League (volleyball). Major international sporting events annually held in India include the Chennai Open in tennis, the Indian Open in golf, and the India Open in badminton. The Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna is India's highest award for achievement in sports, while the Dronacharya Award is awarded for excellence in coaching."
