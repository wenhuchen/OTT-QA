        "Barrington Court is a Tudor manor house begun around 1538 and completed in the late 1550s , with a vernacular 17th century stable court . After repair by Alfred Hoare Powell , it was the first house acquired by the National Trust , in 1907 , on the recommendation of the antiquarian Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley . In the 1920s the house was renovated , the stable block turned into a residence and several outbuildings , gardens and gateways constructed . The surrounding medieval deerpark and 17th century formal garden had largely disappeared until a new garden was laid out by Gertrude Jekyll in an Arts and Crafts -style in the first half of the 20th century",

It is a Site of Special Scientific Interest . The earliest recorded settlement is from the Early to Middle Bronze Age . Brean Down Fort was built in 1865 as one of the Palmerston Forts to provide protection to the ports of the Bristol Channel . The fort was decommissioned in 1901 . During World War II it was rearmed and used for experimental weapons testing . The site has been owned by the National Trust since 2002 after which they instituted a \u00a3431,000 renovation project",

It has over 200 pigeon holes . The square tower was built of local stone with Doulting stone dressings . Although it is now a roofless ruin and some of the windows have been blocked up , it previously had a chimney and the fireplace can still be seen .

        "Dunster Castle is a former motte-and-bailey castle , now a country house . The castle lies on the top of a steep hill called the Tor , which has been fortified since the late Anglo-Saxon period . After the Norman conquest of England in the 11th century , William de Mohun constructed a timber castle on the site as part of the pacification of Somerset . A stone shell keep was built on the motte by the start of the 12th century . At the end of the 14th century the de Mohuns sold the castle to the Luttrell family , who continued to occupy the property until the late 20th century . The medieval castle walls were mostly destroyed following a siege at the end of the English Civil War . In the 1860s and 1870s , the architect Anthony Salvin was employed to remodel the castle to fit Victorian tastes . Following the death of Alexander Luttrell in 1944 , the family was unable to afford the death duties on his estate and sold the castle and surrounding lands . The Luttrells bought back the castle in 1954 , but in 1976 Colonel Walter Luttrell gave it and most of its contents to the National Trust",

The plain is actually reclaimed fenland out of which the Tor once rose like an island but now is a peninsula washed on three sides by the River Brue . The remains of Glastonbury Lake Village nearby were identified in 1892 , showing that there was an Iron Age settlement about 300-200 BC on what was an easily defended island in the fens . Earthworks and Roman remains prove later occupation . The spot seems to have been called Ynys yr Afalon ( meaning The Isle of Avalon ) by the Britons , and it is believed by some to be the Avalon of Arthurian legend",

  "intro": "The National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty (informally known as the National Trust) owns or manages a range of properties in the ceremonial county of Somerset, England. These range from sites of Iron and Bronze Age occupations including Brean Down, Cadbury Camp and Cheddar Gorge to Elizabethan and Victorian era mansions, which include examples such as Montacute House and Tyntesfield. Some of the smaller properties include Coleridge Cottage and Stembridge Mill, the last remaining thatched windmill in England. Somerset consists of a non-metropolitan county, administered by Somerset County Council, which is divided into five districts, and two unitary authorities. The districts of Somerset are West Somerset, South Somerset, Taunton Deane, Mendip and Sedgemoor. North Somerset and Bath and North East Somerset historically came under Somerset County Council. In 1974 they became part of county of Avon, and in 1996 they became administratively independent when Avon was broken up into unitary authorities. Many of the buildings included in the list are listed buildings or scheduled monuments. Listed status refers to a building or other structure officially designated as being of special architectural, historical, or cultural significance; Grade I structures are those considered to be buildings of exceptional interest. Listing was begun by a provision in the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. A scheduled monument is a nationally important archaeological site or historic building, given protection against unauthorised change. Scheduled Monuments are specified in the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979, which defines a monument as:"
