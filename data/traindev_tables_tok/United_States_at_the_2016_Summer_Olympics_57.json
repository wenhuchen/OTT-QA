U.S. athletes have appeared in every Summer Olympics of the modern era, with the exception of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, which they boycotted in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. For the second consecutive time in the Summer Olympics, the United States was represented by more female than male athletes (264 men and 291 women). The 2016 Olympics were the third most successful for the United States as far as the medal count (121) and the most successful not held in the United States: St. Louis had 239 total medals won in 1904, and Los Angeles had 174 in 1984. These Games also witnessed the thousandth Summer Olympic gold medal for the Americans."
