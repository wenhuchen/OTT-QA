  "intro": "Kenya competed in the 2008 Summer Olympics held in Beijing, People's Republic of China from August 8 to August 24, 2008. Kenya won a total of 14 medals, 6 of them gold, its best ever performance at the Olympics. Kenya sent a total of 46 athletes, 28 men and 18 women, to the 2008 Summer Olympics. Four Kenyan men won six gold medals, while the other two were awarded to the women. The remaining medals won by Kenyans were four silver and six bronze medals. Among the nation's gold medalists was Brimin Kipruto, who brought home the nation's seventh straight medal in the steeplechase since 1984. Coming in at a close third was Richard Matelong who was unable to surpass the Frenchman Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad. Kenya also marked its Olympic debut in taekwondo by sending two athletes, one man and one woman. For the first time in Olympic history, the Kenyan athletes had participated in the women's 800 meter event final. Shortly after the 3,000 meter steeplechase, the women captured a gold medal against many odds. Along with the gold, they also took home the silver as well. Pamela Jelimo led her fellow Kenyan Janeth Jepkosgei Busienei to a one-two finish."
