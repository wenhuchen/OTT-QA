Her disappearance generated a large amount of press coverage , both nationally and internationally . Five days after she was last seen , a local man , Mark Bridger , was charged with April 's abduction and murder . He was found guilty of all charges on 30 May 2013 . He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommendation that he should never be released . April 's body has never been found , but police found skull fragments and blood in Bridger 's home , which was matched to April Jones and indicated that she had suffered unsurvivable injuries at the hands of 47-year-old Bridger"
