        "Sarah Payne , a seven-year-old girl from Surrey , was abducted and murdered by convicted child sex offender Roy Whiting in Littlehampton , West Sussex , in July 2000 . Her body was found 15 miles away just over two weeks later . Whiting was found guilty of her murder in December 2001 and sentenced to life imprisonment , with the judge saying that it was a rare case in which a life sentence should mean life . The trial judge 's recommendation was later replaced by a 50-year minimum term by the Home Office , just before politicians were stripped of their powers to decide when or if a life sentence prisoner could apply for parole . Whiting 's sentence has since been set at a 40-year minimum term by the High Court , which means that Whiting can not be considered for parole until the age of 82 . At the end of the trial , it was revealed that he already had a previous conviction for abduction and indecent assault on an eight-year-old girl in 1995 , and that he was on the sex offenders register",

The investigation gained national media coverage and was the largest investigation undertaken by Surrey police . Levi Bellfield , who had been convicted of two other murders and an attempted murder ( all committed after Amanda 's disappearance ) in February 2008 , was found guilty of the murder in June 2011 and received an additional life sentence . Shortly after Bellfield 's trial , it was revealed that her mobile phone had been hacked by News of the World reporters a while after she went missing , and they had deleted text messages from her inbox , giving her parents false hope that she was still alive ( it is believed that she died the same afternoon or evening that she went missing ) . These revelations , along with numerous other phone-hacking allegations , contributed to the newspaper 's closure . Rupert Murdoch , owner of the News of the World , later awarded the Dowler family \u00a33 million in compensation",

Maden then dialled 999 to admit the killing ; when asked why , he said because I felt like it .
