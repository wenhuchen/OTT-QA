From 1917\u201318 to 1920\u201321 , the NHL season was split , requiring separate standings , with a single playoff series between the winner of the first half of the season and the winner of the second half of the season . * Team won the O'Brien Trophy as the NHL playoff champion . \u2020 Team won both the O'Brien Trophy and the Stanley Cup . ^ Team lost in the NHL Championship/Final round .",

  "intro": "The Presidents' Trophy (French: Troph\u00e9e des pr\u00e9sidents) is an award presented by the National Hockey League (NHL) to the team that finishes with the most points (i.e. best record) during the NHL regular season. If two teams tie for the most points, then the Trophy goes to the team with the most wins. The Presidents' Trophy has been awarded 33 times to 17 different teams since its inception during the 1985-86 season. As the team with the best regular season record, the Presidents' Trophy winner is guaranteed home-ice advantage in all four rounds of the Stanley Cup playoffs, provided they advance that far. However, it does not guarantee that success; only eight of these winners have gone on to win the Stanley Cup. Three other teams reached the Stanley Cup Finals, but failed to win. The last team to win both the Presidents' Trophy and the Stanley Cup in the same season was the 2012-13 Chicago Blackhawks. The only team to accomplish this more than once is the Detroit Red Wings."
