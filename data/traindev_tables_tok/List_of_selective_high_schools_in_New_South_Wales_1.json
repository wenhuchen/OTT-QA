  "section_text": "The New South Wales Department of Educatio operates creative and performing arts high schools in communities throughout the state . These schools aim to foster excellence in creative fields while teaching the same core syllabus as other state-run high schools and are accorded a high degree of autonomy by the department in selecting students and teaching staff . The schools boast specialised facilities and equipment and competition for places is acute . This list also includes four Independent schools : Australian Performing Arts Grammar School , Talent Development High School , the McDonald College and Village Performing Arts College .",
  "uid": "List_of_selective_high_schools_in_New_South_Wales_1",
  "intro": "This is a list of selective and agricultural high schools run by the Department of Education and Communities. Entry to these schools is managed centrally by the department's Selective High School and Opportunity Class Placement Unit. Prospective students sit the Selective High Schools Test (typically in March of Year 6) and are allocated places at schools according to their profile mark, out of 300, which comprises both exam and school marks. Students may list up to four preferred schools. A number of other government and non-government high schools also select their students based on merit; these include, for example, creative and performing arts schools, and some private schools."
