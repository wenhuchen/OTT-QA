        "Sweden and Finland argued over the control of the \u00c5land Islands ( located between Sweden and Finland ) . The \u00c5land movement ( \u00c5landsr\u00f6relsen ) wanted \u00c5land to reunite with its old mother country Sweden ( Finland and \u00c5land belonged to Sweden before 1809 ) . The movement gathered signatures from over 7000 inhabitants of legal age at the \u00c5land Islands in 1917 ( that was about 96% of the population ) - they all supported a union with Sweden . When Finland became independent ( December 6 , 1917 ) Sweden wanted a plebiscite about the future of the \u00c5land Islands to solve the problem . Finland refused and argued that the \u00c5land Islands had always been a natural part of Finland - even when Finland was under Swedish rule . Sweden appealed to the League of Nations referring to the right of the population to determine which country they should belong to . After studying the matter closely the League of Nations decided Finland should retain sovereignty over the province but that the \u00c5land Islands should be made an autonomous territory . The Swedish Prime Minister said he did n't accept the verdict but he also said that Sweden was not going to use military force to get their claims",

In 1944 with two decrees of the USSR supreme Council the city of Narva and vicinity was split along Narova river leaving Narva with Estonia and Ivangorod with the Leningrad oblast . Pechory , Izborsk and Panikovichi with respective parishes as well as certain areas of Slobodskaya parish were transferred to the Pskov Oblast . Exception was made for some rural areas of the borderland populated by ethnic Estonians leaving these with Estonian SSR .
