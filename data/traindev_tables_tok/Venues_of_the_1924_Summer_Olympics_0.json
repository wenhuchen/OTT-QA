  "intro": "The 1924 Summer Olympics (French: Les Jeux olympiques d'\u00e9t\u00e9 de 1924), officially known as the Games of the VIII Olympiad, were an international multi-sport event which was celebrated in 1924 in Paris, France. It was the second time Paris hosted the games, after 1900. The selection process for the 1924 Summer Olympics consisted of six bids, and Paris was selected ahead of Amsterdam, Barcelona, Los Angeles, Prague, and Rome. The selection was made at the 20th IOC Session in Lausanne in 1921. The cost of the Games of the VIII Olympiad was estimated to be 10,000,000\u20a3. With total receipts at 5,496,610\u20a3, the Olympics resulted in a hefty loss despite crowds that reached 60,000 people at a time. The United States won the most gold and overall medals, having 229 athletes competing compared to France's 401."
