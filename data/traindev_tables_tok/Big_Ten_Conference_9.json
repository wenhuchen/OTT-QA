  "section_title": "Football -- Bowl games",
  "section_text": "Since 1946 , the Big Ten champion has had a tie-in with the Rose Bowl game . Michigan appeared in the first bowl game , the 1902 Rose Bowl . After that , the Big Ten did not allow their schools to participate in bowl games , until the agreement struck with the Pacific Coast Conference for the 1947 Rose Bowl . From 1946 through 1971 , the Big Ten did not allow the same team to represent the conference in consecutive years in the Rose Bowl with an exception made after the 1961 season in which Minnesota played in the 1962 Rose Bowl after playing in the 1961 Rose Bowl due to Ohio State declining the bid because of Ohio State faculty concerns about academics . It was not until the 1975 season that the Big Ten allowed teams to play in bowl games other than the Rose Bowl . Michigan , which had been shut out of the postseason the previous three years , was the first beneficiary of the new rule when it played in the Orange Bowl vs. Oklahoma . Due to the pre-1975 rules , Big Ten teams such as Michigan and Ohio State have lower numbers of all-time bowl appearances than powerhouse teams from the Big 12 Conference ( previously Big Eight and Southwest Conferences ) and Southeastern Conference , which always placed multiple teams in bowl games every year . Starting in the 2014\u201315 season , a new slate of bowl game selections will include several new bowl games . [ 65 ]",

  "intro": "The Big Ten Conference (stylized B1G, formerly the Western Conference and the Big Nine Conference) is the oldest Division I collegiate athletic conference in the United States. It is based in Rosemont, Illinois. For decades the conference consisted of 10 universities, while the present conference has 14 member institutions. They compete in the NCAA Division I; its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), formerly known as Division I-A, the highest level of NCAA competition in that sport. The conference includes the flagship public university in each of 11 states stretching from New Jersey to Nebraska, as well as two additional public land-grant schools and a private university. The Big Ten Conference was established in 1895 when Purdue University president James H. Smart and representatives from the University of Chicago, University of Illinois, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University, and University of Wisconsin gathered at Chicago's Palmer House Hotel to set policies aimed at regulating intercollegiate athletics. In 1899, Indiana University and the University of Iowa joined the conference to increase the membership to nine schools. In 1905, the conference was officially incorporated as the Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives. The conference is one of the nation's oldest, predating the founding of the NCAA by a decade, and was one of the first collegiate conferences to sponsor men's basketball. Big Ten member institutions are major research universities with large financial endowments and strong academic reputations. All institutions except full member University of Nebraska and associate member Notre Dame are members of the Association of American Universities. Large student enrollment is a hallmark of Big Ten Universities, as 12 of the 14 members feature enrollments of 30,000 or more students."
