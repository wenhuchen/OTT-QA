  "section_title": "Milestone nuclear explosions",
  "section_text": "The following list is of milestone nuclear explosions . In addition to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the first nuclear test of a given weapon type for a country is included , and tests which were otherwise notable ( such as the largest test ever ) . All yields ( explosive power ) are given in their estimated energy equivalents in kilotons of TNT ( see TNT equivalent ) . Putative tests ( like Vela Incident ) have not been included .",
  "uid": "Nuclear_weapon_yield_0",
  "intro": "The explosive yield of a nuclear weapon is the amount of energy released when that particular nuclear weapon is detonated, usually expressed as a TNT equivalent (the standardized equivalent mass of trinitrotoluene which, if detonated, would produce the same energy discharge), either in kilotons (kt - thousands of tons of TNT), in megatons (Mt - millions of tons of TNT), or sometimes in terajoules (TJ). An explosive yield of one terajoule is equal to 0.239 kilotonnes of TNT. Because the accuracy of any measurement of the energy released by TNT has always been problematic, the conventional definition is that one kiloton of TNT is held simply to be equivalent to 1012 calories. The yield-to-weight ratio is the amount of weapon yield compared to the mass of the weapon. The practical maximum yield-to-weight ratio for fusion weapons (thermonuclear weapons) has been estimated to six megatons of TNT per metric ton of bomb mass (25 TJ/kg). Yields of 5.2 megatons/ton and higher have been reported for large weapons constructed for single-warhead use in the early 1960s. Since then, the smaller warheads needed to achieve the increased net damage efficiency (bomb damage/bomb mass) of multiple warhead systems have resulted in decreases in the yield/mass ratio for single modern warheads."
