They were thought to have been murdered two days earlier between about 3:00 pm and 4:00 pm , 29 April 2011 - the day of the Royal Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton and an additional Public Holiday . Anxiang Du , a businessman from Coventry who had been involved in a legal dispute with the Ding family , was named as the prime suspect in the case . Du fled the murder scene in the Ding 's rented car ; he drove to London and travelled to Paris by coach . He continued through France , Spain and finally to Morocco , prompting a worldwide manhunt . He lived in a partly built block of flats for 14 months before he was arrested and extradited to the UK . Du was tried at Northampton Crown Court in November 2013 . He was found guilty of the murders and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 40 years"
