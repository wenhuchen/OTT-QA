  "section_text": "Shortly after the October Revolution , in December 1917 , Sergey Fedorovich Oldenburg , a leading ethnographer and political activist in the Kadet party , met with Vladimir Lenin to discuss the future of the Academy . They agreed that the expertise of the Academy would be applied to addressing questions of state construction , while in return the Soviet government would give the Academy financial and political support . The most important activities of the Academy in the 1920s included an investigation of the large Kursk Magnetic Anomaly , of the minerals in the Kola Peninsula , and participation in the GOELRO plan targeted electrification of the whole country . In these years , many research institutions were established , and the number of scientists became four times larger than in 1917 . In 1925 the Soviet government recognized the Russian Academy of Sciences as the `` highest all-Union scientific institution '' and renamed it the Academy of Sciences of the USSR . In 1934 , the Academy headquarters moved from Leningrad to the capital , Moscow . The Stalin years are marked with a rapid industrialisation of the Soviet Union for which a great deal of research , mainly in the technical fields , has been done . However , on the other hand , in these very times , many scientists underwent repressions from ideological reasons . In the years of the Second World War , the Soviet Academy of Sciences made a big contribution to a development of modern weapons \u2013 tanks ( new series of T-34 ) , airplanes , degaussing the ships ( for protection against the naval mines ) etc . \u2013 and therefore to victory of the USSR over the Nazi Germany . During and after the war , the Academy was involved in the Soviet atomic bomb project ; due to its success and other achievements in military techniques , the USSR became one of the superpowers in the Cold War era . At the end of the 1940s , the Academy consisted of eight divisions ( Physico-Mathematical Science , Chemical Sciences , Geological-Geographical Sciences , Biological Science , Technical Science , History and Philosophy , Economics and Law , Literature and Languages ) ; three committees ( one for coordinating the scientific work of the Academies of the Republics , one for scientific and technical propaganda , and one for editorial and publications ) , two commissions ( for publishing popular scientific literature , and for museums and archives ) , a laboratory for scientific photography and cinematography and Academy of Science Press departments external to the divisions . [ 18 ] The Academy of Sciences of the USSR helped to establish national Academies of Sciences in all Soviet republics ( with the exception of the Russian SFSR ) , in many cases delegating prominent scientists to live and work in other republics . In the case of the Ukraine , its academy was formed by the local Ukrainian scientists and prior to occupation of the Ukrainian People 's Republic by Bolsheviks . These academies were :",

Headquartered in Moscow, the Academy (RAS) is considered a civil, self-governed, non-commercial organization chartered by the Government of Russia. It combines the members of RAS (see below) and scientists employed by institutions. Near the central academy building there is a monument to Yuri Gagarin in the square bearing his name. As of November 2017, the Academy included 1008 institutions and other units; in total about 125,000 people were employed of whom 47,000 were scientific researchers."
