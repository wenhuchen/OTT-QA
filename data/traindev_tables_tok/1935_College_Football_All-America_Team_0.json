  "intro": "The 1935 College Football All-America team is composed of college football players who were selected as All-Americans by various organizations and writers that chose College Football All-America Teams in 1935. The nine selectors recognized by the NCAA as official for the 1935 season are (1) Collier's Weekly, as selected by Grantland Rice, (2) the Associated Press (AP), (3) the United Press (UP), (4) the All-America Board (AAB), (5) the International News Service (INS), (6) Liberty magazine, (7) the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA), (8) the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA), and (9) the Sporting News (SN). Jay Berwanger of Chicago was one of two unanimous All-American selections. Berwanger was also the first recipient of the Heisman Trophy and the first player selected in the first NFL Draft. Bobby Grayson of Stanford was the other unanimous All-American. He was one of Stanford's Vow Boys, a group of freshmen players who vowed after a 1932 loss to the University of Southern California that they would never lose to the Trojans when they made the varsity team. The group kept their promise, defeating USC three straight years and becoming the first team in college football history to play in three consecutive Rose Bowl games. Other Vow Boys who made the 1935 All-American team include Monk Moscrip and Bob Reynolds. Bob Wilson of SMU received eight official first-team designations, and Jac Weller of Princeton received seven. The 1935 All-Americans also included two players who went on to Hall of Fame careers as coaches. Bear Bryant was named a third-team All-American at the end position by the NEA, and Bud Wilkinson of the University of Minnesota was named a second-team All-American by the UP and a third-team selection by the NEA and the Central Press Association."
