  "section_text": "During 1776 , the Continental Congress gradually overcame its ideological objections to a standing army , and , on September 16 , 1776 , it resolved that , on January 1 , 1777 , the Continental Line was to consist of 88 infantry regiments , to be maintained for the duration of the war . The quota of regiments assigned to the states was 3 from New Hampshire , 15 from Massachusetts , 2 from Rhode Island , 8 from Connecticut , 4 from New York , 4 from New Jersey , 12 from Pennsylvania , 1 from Delaware , 8 from Maryland , 15 from Virginia , 9 from North Carolina , 6 from South Carolina , and 1 from Georgia . The quotas for states outside New England included regiments that had been on the Continental establishment earlier , but the term Continental Line was now broadened to include the lines of all the states .",
  "uid": "Massachusetts_Line_2",
  "intro": "The Massachusetts Line was the name given to those units within the Continental Army that were assigned to Massachusetts at various times by the Continental Congress during the American Revolutionary War. These, together with similar contingents from the other twelve states, formed the Continental Line. Line regiments were assigned to a particular state, which was then financially responsible for the maintenance (staffing and supplying) of the regiment. The concept of the line was also particularly important in relation to the promotion of commissioned officers. Officers of the Continental Army below the rank of brigadier general were ordinarily ineligible for promotion except in the line of their own state. The size of the Massachusetts Line varied from as many as 27 active regiments (at the outset of the war) to four (at its end). For most of the war after the Siege of Boston (April 1775 to March 1776) almost all of these units were deployed outside Massachusetts, serving as far north as Quebec City, as far west as present-day central Upstate New York, and as far south as Yorktown, Virginia. Massachusetts line troops were involved in most of the war's major battles north of Chesapeake Bay, and were present at the decisive Siege of Yorktown in 1781. General officers of the line included Major Generals Artemas Ward, William Heath, and Benjamin Lincoln, and Brigadier Generals John Glover and John Nixon."
