  "intro": "Since 1915 there have been sixteen Australian winners of the Nobel Prize. Half of these prizes (eight) have been awarded in the field of Physiology or Medicine Most Australians awarded Nobel prizes before the end of the awarding of British/Imperial honours (in 1992) also received (or were offered) knighthoods. This list includes laureates who were not born in Australia, but who nevertheless spent a significant portion of their training or career there."
