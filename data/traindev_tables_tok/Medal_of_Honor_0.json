  "section_text": "Main article : List of Medal of Honor recipients The first Medals of Honor ( Army version ) were awarded and presented to six Union soldiers ( `` Andrews Raiders '' ) on March 25 , 1863 , by Secretary of War Edwin Stanton , in his office of the War Department . Private Jacob Parrott , a U.S. Army volunteer from Ohio , became the first actual Medal of Honor recipient , awarded for his volunteering for and participation in a raid on a Confederate train in Big Shanty , Georgia on April 12 , 1862 , during the American Civil War . After the medal presentations , the six decorated soldiers met with President Lincoln in the White House . [ 26 ] [ 137 ] The first Navy Medal of Honor was awarded by the Navy on April 3 , 1863 to 41 sailors ( 17 awards for action during the Battle of Forts Jackson and St . Philip ) . [ 138 ] The first Marines awarded the Medal of Honor ( Navy version ) were John F. Mackie and Pinkerton R. Vaughn on July 10 , 1863 ; [ 139 ] Mackie for USS Galena on May 15 , 1862 and Vaughn for USS Mississippi on March 14 , 1863 . They both are the first Marine recipients ; Vaughn 's date of receipt/presentation has not been determined . The first and only Coast Guardsman to be awarded the Medal of Honor ( Navy version ) was Signalman First Class Douglas Munro ( posthumously ) on May 27 , 1943 , for evacuating 500 Marines under fire on September 27 , 1942 , during the Battle of Guadalcanal . [ 140 ] Munro was a Canadian American ( Canadian-born , naturalized U.S . citizen ) . [ 141 ] The only woman awarded the Medal of Honor ( Army version ) is Mary Edwards Walker , who was a civilian Army surgeon during the American Civil War . She received the award in 1865 after the Judge Advocate General of the Army determined that she could not be given a retroactive commission , and so President Andrew Johnson directed that `` the usual medal of honor for meritorious services be given her . `` [ 142 ] [ 143 ] The first black Medal of Honor recipients were sixteen Army and sixteen Navy service members that fought during the Civil War . The first award was announced on April 6 , 1865 , to twelve black soldiers from the five regiments of U.S . Colored Troops who fought at New Market Heights outside of Richmond on September 29 , 1864 . [ 52 ] 61 Canadians who served in the United States Armed Forces , mostly during the American Civil War . Since 1900 , four Canadians have received the medal . [ 147 ] The only Canadian-born , naturalized U.S. citizen to receive the medal for heroism during the Vietnam War was Peter C . Lemon . [ 148 ] While the governing statute for the Army Medal of Honor ( 10 U.S.C . \u00a7 6241 ) , beginning in 1918 , explicitly stated that a recipient must be `` an officer or enlisted man of the Army '' , `` distinguish himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty '' , and perform an act of valor `` in action involving actual conflict with an enemy '' , [ 86 ] exceptions have been made :",
  "uid": "Medal_of_Honor_0",
  "intro": "The Medal of Honor is the United States of America's highest and most prestigious personal military decoration that may be awarded to recognize U.S. military service members who have distinguished themselves by acts of valor. The medal is normally awarded by the President of the United States in the name of the U.S. Congress. Because the medal is presented in the name of Congress, it is often referred erroneously as the Congressional Medal of Honor. However, the official name of the current award is Medal of Honor. Within the United States Code the medal is referred to as the Medal of Honor, and less frequently as Congressional Medal of Honor. U.S. awards, including the Medal of Honor, do not have post-nominal titles, and while there is no official abbreviation, the most common abbreviations are MOH and MH. There are three versions of the medal, one each for the Army, Navy and Air Force. Personnel of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard receive the Navy version while members of the Space Force receive the Air Force version. The Medal of Honor was introduced for the Navy in 1861, soon followed by an Army version in 1862. The Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States' armed forces. The President typically presents the Medal at a formal ceremony intended to represent the gratitude of the U.S. people, with posthumous presentations made to the primary next of kin. According to the Medal of Honor Historical Society of the United States, there have been 3,525 Medals of Honor awarded to 3,506 individuals since the decoration's creation, with over 40% awarded for actions during the American Civil War."
