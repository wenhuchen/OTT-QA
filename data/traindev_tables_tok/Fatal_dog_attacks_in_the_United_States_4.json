It was around 4:45 p.m. when authorities were called to a residence in the 1400 block of East First North Street . When police arrived at the scene , they discovered 85-year-old Dorothy Hamilton dead in the living room of her home . Investigators also found a pair of aggressive pit bulls inside of the house . Animal control put down the two dogs that were inside the house when police found Hamilton . Authorities said that the dogs were being held in a bedroom , but it looks as though they broke down the door in order to attack the woman"

  "intro": "Fatal dog attacks in the United States are rare, although non-fatal dog bites are not unusual. Typically, between 30 and 50 people in the US die from dog bites each year, and the number of deaths from dog attacks appear to be increasing. Around 4.5 million Americans are bitten by dogs every year, resulting in the hospitalization of 6,000 to 13,000 people each year in the United States (2005). Injuries, illnesses, and fatalities resulting from encounters with dogs are a major public health concern worldwide. Dogs not only cause morbidity and mortality as a result of bites, they may also transmit zoonotic infections, which may also result in illness or death. In fact, dogs are the main source of rabies transmission to humans worldwide. It is estimated that 3% to 18% of dog bite wounds become infected, with occasional cases of meningitis, endocarditis, and septic shock leading to death reported. Children have the greatest risk of death."
