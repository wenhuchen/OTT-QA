  "section_text": "Druids generally observe eight spiritual festivals annually , which are collectively known as the Wheel of the Year . [ 99 ] These are the same festivals usually celebrated by Wiccans . [ 100 ] In some cases groups attempt to revive folkloric European festivals and their accompanying traditions . [ 98 ] In other cases the rites are modern inventions , inspired by `` the spirit of what they believe was the religious practice of pre-Roman Britain . `` [ 101 ] For reasons of practicality , such celebrations are not always held on the specific date of the festival itself , but on the nearest weekend , thus maximising the number of participants who can attend . [ 59 ] Four of these are solar festivals , being positioned at the solstices and equinoxes ; these are largely inspired by Germanic paganism . The other four are the `` Celtic '' festivals , the crossquarter days inspired by modern interpretations of ancient Celtic polytheism . The idea of the Wheel of the Year was introduced into Druidry by Ross Nichols , who founded the Order of Bards , Ovates and Druids in 1964 , and he had gained this idea from his friend Gerald Gardner , who had implemented it in his Bricket Wood coven of Gardnerian Witches in 1958 .

  "intro": "Druidry, sometimes termed Druidism, is a modern spiritual or religious movement that generally promotes harmony, connection, and reverence for the natural world. This commonly is extended to include respect for all beings, including the environment itself. Many forms of modern Druidry are modern Pagan religions, although most of the earliest modern Druids identified as Christians. Originating in Britain during the 18th century, Druidry was originally a cultural movement, only gaining religious or spiritual connotations in the 19th century. The core principle of Druidry is respect and veneration of nature, and as such it often involves participation in the environmental movement. Another prominent belief among modern Druids is the veneration of ancestors, particularly those who belonged to prehistoric societies. Arising from the 18th century Romanticist movement in Britain, which glorified the ancient Celtic peoples of the Iron Age, the early neo-Druids aimed to imitate the Iron Age priests who were also known as druids. At the time, little accurate information was known about these ancient priests, and the modern Druidic movement has no direct connection to them, despite contrary claims made by some modern Druids. In the late 18th century, modern Druids developed fraternal organizations modeled on Freemasonry that employed the romantic figure of the British Druids and Bards as symbols of the indigenous spirituality of Prehistoric Britain. Some of these groups were purely fraternal and cultural, such as the oldest one that remains, the Ancient Order of Druids founded in 1781, creating traditions from the national imagination of Britain. Others, in the early 20th century, merged with contemporary movements such as the physical culture movement and naturism. Since the 1980s, some modern druid groups have adopted similar methodologies to those of Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism in an effort to create a more historically accurate practice."
