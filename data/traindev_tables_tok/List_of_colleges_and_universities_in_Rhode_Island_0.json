  "intro": "This is a list of colleges and universities in the U.S. state of Rhode Island. There are currently 12 accredited, degree-granting institutions operating in the state, including two research universities, a community college, and a school of art. The state's three public institutions are administered by the Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education. The state operates two public universities, the University of Rhode Island and Rhode Island College, as well as the Community College of Rhode Island, which offers degrees at six locations. The Naval War College, operated by the federal United States Navy, is located in Newport. The oldest school in the state is Brown University, a member of the Ivy League and the only Rhode Island institution founded before the American Revolution. The newest is the Community College of Rhode Island, founded in 1964 in Providence as Rhode Island Junior College. Enrollment sizes range from the Naval War College at 550 students to the University of Rhode Island, the state's flagship public university, which serves over 15,000 students. The institutions included on this list are all accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges."
