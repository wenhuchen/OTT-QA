When Conker accomplishes the latter , Weaso ends up betraying Conker , as he was hired by the malicious Panther King to capture Conker and turn him into a table leg . In the confrontation that follows , Weaso murders Conker 's girlfriend , Berri , under the Panther King 's orders . Upon first sight of Professor Von Kriplespac 's pet Xenomorph , Heinrich , who bursts out of the King 's chest , Weaso ducks behind the now-deceased King 's throne .

  "intro": "The following list of fictional mustelids is subsidiary to the list of fictional animals. This list is limited solely to notable non-badger and non-raccoon characters that appear in works of fiction and that are in the musteloidea superfamily of mammals. This includes weasels, ferrets, minks, otters, martens, and skunks. Fictional badgers are instead found within the list of fictional badgers. Fictional raccoons are found in the list of fictional raccoons. If a character appears in more than one medium, it is sorted under the primary one. Thus, despite occasional appearances in licensed video games, Pep\u00e9 Le Pew is listed under the list of fictional mustelids in animation."
