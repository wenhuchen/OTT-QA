It is the second largest mosque in Pakistan after Faisal Mosque and can accommodate over 100,000 worshipers in its hall and surroundings . The mosque is located opposite to Lahore Fort and symbolizes the rich Mughal architecture . It was the largest mosque in the Mughal empire and held the record of being the largest mosque in the world for 313 years until 1986 . Under Sikh and British rule from 1799 to 1939 , the mosque was used as military garrison and was severely damaged . Extensive repair work were done after 1939 and by 1960 it was restored to its original conditions . A small museum containing relics of Prophet Muhammad , his cousin Ali , and his daughter Fatimah is established inside the mosque",

  "intro": "The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of humanity. The programme was founded with the Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage which was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO on 16 November 1972 in Paris. Pakistan ratified the convention on 23 July 1976, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. Since then, UNESCO has designated six sites in Pakistan as World Heritage Sites and twenty six sites are on the tentative list. The first sites to be inducted in the list were Archaeological Ruins at Moenjodaro, Buddhist Ruins of Takht-i-Bahi and Neighbouring City Remains at Sahr-i-Bahlol, and Taxila, all three of which were inscribed as places of cultural significance in 1980. In 1981 two other sites, Fort and Shalamar Gardens in Lahore and Historical Monuments at Makli, were inscribed. The last site to be designated as a World Heritage Site was Rohtas Fort in 1997. All the six inscribed and twenty six tentative sites are listed under the cultural category."
