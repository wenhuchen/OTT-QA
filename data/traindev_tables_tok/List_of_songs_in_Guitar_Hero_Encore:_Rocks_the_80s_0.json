All of the tracks , excluding `` Because , It 's Midnite '' , were released during the 1980s , as the game 's title suggests ; `` Because , It 's Midnite '' is performed by the fictional `` 80s hair metal '' band Limozeen from the Internet cartoon Homestar Runner ( Harmonix co-founder/CEO Alex Rigopulos is a professed fan of Homestar Runner ) . Two songs were originally written in the 1970s , but were covered by bands in the 1980s . These songs are `` Radar Love '' by Golden Earring , but covered by White Lion and `` Ballroom Blitz '' by Sweet and covered by Krokus . The song list includes tracks such as `` Round and Round '' by Ratt , `` Metal Health '' by Quiet Riot , `` Holy Diver '' by Dio , `` Heat of the Moment '' by Asia and `` Nothin ' But a Good Time '' by Poison . Five of the songs are master tracks : `` Because It 's Midnite '' , `` I Ran ( So Far Away ) '' by A Flock of Seagulls , Scandal 's `` The Warrior '' , Twisted Sister 's `` I Wan na Rock '' , and Judas Priest 's `` Electric Eye '' , while the rest are covers .

  "intro": "Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s (titled Guitar Hero: Rocks the 80s in Europe) is a music rhythm game and the third installment in the popular Guitar Hero series. It was released in July 2007 in North America and Europe, and in August 2007 in Australia. Players use a guitar-shaped controller (purchased separately) to simulate playing rock music by hitting notes as they scroll towards the player. Rocks the 80s is an incremental title in the Guitar Hero series, rather than a full sequel. No changes in gameplay from Guitar Hero II have been introduced to this game. As implied by the game's title, the game features a 1980s theme, consisting of songs from the decade and playable characters, fashions, and artwork that reflect the time period. The game was not as well-received as the prior two Guitar Hero games, due to the lack of new gameplay features and reduced soundtrack. Rocks the 80s is the third and final title in the Guitar Hero series to be developed by Harmonix before they moved on to create Rock Band. The next major installment of the series, Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, was developed by Activision's Neversoft division."
