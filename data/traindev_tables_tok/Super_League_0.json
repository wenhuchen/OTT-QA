  "intro": "Super League (currently known as the Betfred Super League for sponsorship reasons) is the top-level professional rugby league club competition in the Northern Hemisphere. The league has twelve teams: ten from England, one from France and one from Canada. Super League began in 1996, replacing the First Division and switching from a winter to a summer season. Each team plays 29 games between February and September: 11 home games, 11 away games, Magic Weekend and an additional 6 'loop fixtures' decided by league positions. The top five then enter the play-off series leading to the Grand Final which determines the champions. The bottom team is relegated to the Championship. The Super League champions play the National Rugby League champions from Australasia in the World Club Challenge at the start of the season."
