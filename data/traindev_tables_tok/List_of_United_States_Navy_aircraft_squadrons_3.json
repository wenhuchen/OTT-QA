  "intro": "This is a list of active United States Navy aircraft squadrons. Deactivated or disestablished squadrons are listed in the List of Inactive United States Navy aircraft squadrons. Navy aircraft squadrons are composed of several aircraft (from as few as about four to as many as about a dozen), the officers who fly them, the officers and sailors who maintain them and administrative support officers and sailors. Some of the units listed in this article are not technically squadrons, but they all operate U.S. Navy aircraft in some capacity. Squadrons and their history are listed in the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons (DANAS)."
