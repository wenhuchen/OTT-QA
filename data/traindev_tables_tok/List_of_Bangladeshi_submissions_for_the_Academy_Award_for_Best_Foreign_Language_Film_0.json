  "intro": "Bangladesh has submitted films for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film[nb 1] since 2002. The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. It was not created until the 1956 Academy Awards, in which a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since. Fifteen Bangladeshi films have been submitted for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but none of them have been nominated for an Oscar. In addition to the fifteen films officially submitted by Bangladesh, Pakistan submitted The Day Shall Dawn for Oscar consideration in 1959. Dawn was filmed in Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) with a mostly Bangladeshi cast speaking Urdu, the official language of West Pakistan."
