Non-renewable power stations are those that run on coal, fuel oils, nuclear, natural gas, oil shale and peat, while renewable power stations run on fuel sources such as biomass, geothermal heat, hydro, solar energy, solar heat, tides, waves and the wind. Only the most significant fuel source is listed for power stations that run on multiple sources. As of 2019 the largest power generating facility ever built is the Three Gorges Dam in China. The facility generates power by utilizing 32 Francis turbines each having a capacity of and two turbines, totalling the installed capacity to , more than twice the installed capacity of the largest nuclear power station, the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa (Japan) at . As of 2019 no power station comparable to Three Gorges is under construction, as the largest under construction power stations are hydroelectric Baihetan Dam () and Belo Monte Dam (). Although currently only a proposal, the Grand Inga Dam in the Congo would surpass all existing power stations, including the Three Gorges Dam, if construction commences as planned. The design targets to top in installed capacity, nearly twice that of the Three Gorges. Another proposal, Penzhin Tidal Power Plant Project, presumes an installed capacity up to ."
