  "section_text": "Queen Victoria , at times , had contentious relations with her children . She had trouble relating to her children when they were young , some of this possibly owing to her own isolated childhood . [ 4 ] She also , occasionally , resented that they interfered with time that she would prefer to spend with Albert . [ 5 ] According to one modern author , both Victoria and Albert were n't above playing favourites with their children , and unfortunately did little to hide their favouritism . [ 5 ] Both Vicky and Alfred were the favorites of Albert , and Arthur enjoyed the favouritism of both his parents . [ 5 ] According to one modern author , Victoria initially was jealous of the time that Albert had spent with Vicky , but in her widowhood Victoria made Vicky something of her confidante , [ 6 ] and for her part , Vicky had accrued hundreds of letters from her mother , to the point that shortly before her death , she had them smuggled out of Germany by her brother 's secretary , Sir Frederick Ponsonby . [ 7 ] Of her sons , Victoria had the most trouble with her eldest , Albert Edward , and her youngest , Leopold . [ 6 ] Among her daughters , Victoria clashed often with Louise . [ 6 ] She also had an awkward relationship with her second eldest daughter , Alice , whom the queen , despite praising her thoughtfulness , also criticised as being too melancholy and self-absorbed . [ 6 ] In her widowhood , Victoria expected Beatrice , who was only 4 when her father died , to remain at home with her , and only permitted her to marry on the condition that she and her husband remain in England .
