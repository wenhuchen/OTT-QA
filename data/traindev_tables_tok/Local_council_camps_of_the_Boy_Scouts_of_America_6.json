          "This reservation included Camp Apache , Camp Pequot , and Camp Cherokee . With the construction of the Mashantucket Pequot Casino in 1991-1992 , the camp 's surroundings had been changed enough that the Long Rivers Council decided to sell the property to the Native American tribe in 1992 .
