  "intro": "Big Brother 2010, also known as Big Brother 11, was the eleventh series of the British reality television series Big Brother, and the final series of the show to be broadcast by Channel 4. The show followed twenty-one contestants, known as housemates, who were isolated from the outside world for an extended period of time in a custom built House. Each week, one or more of the housemates were evicted by a public vote. The last remaining housemate, Josie Gibson, was declared the winner, winning a cash prize of \u00a3100,000 and a place in a special edition of the show named Ultimate Big Brother, which began immediately after the conclusion of this series. It launched on 9 June 2010 and ended on 24 August 2010, lasting 77 days - the shortest run since the fifth series in 2004. Davina McCall returned as presenter for the eleventh and final time. Fourteen housemates entered on launch night, with seven additional housemate being introduced in later weeks. The series was watched by an average of 3 million viewers. Following Channel 4's decision in 2009 not to renew their contract with Endemol to show the series, Channel 5 bought the rights to Big Brother in the United Kingdom, where it was broadcast from 18 August 2011, Big Brother was axed again on 5 November 2018."
