  "intro": "This is a list of the tallest buildings in Canada. As of December 2017 there are a total of 133 completed and under construction buildings in Canada with an official height of 150 m (492 ft) or more. Greater Toronto has 86 (Toronto 83 (including the eight tallest buildings in Canada) Mississauga 3), Calgary has 19, Metro Vancouver has 14 (Burnaby 7, Vancouver 6, Surrey 1), Montreal has 11, Edmonton has 2, and Niagara Falls has 1. Five of Canada's ten largest cities enforce height restriction laws. In Ottawa, skyscrapers could not be built above the height of the Peace Tower until the late 1970s, when the restriction was changed so that no building could overwhelm the skyline. In Montreal, skyscrapers cannot be built above the elevation of Mount Royal. The City of Vancouver has enacted view corridors which limit the height of buildings in most areas of downtown. The City of Edmonton had an elevation restriction, approximately 150 m (492 ft) above downtown, due to the proximity of the city centre airport, until it closed in November 2013. This list does not include towers, including the CN Tower in Toronto, as they are not technically considered to be a building."
