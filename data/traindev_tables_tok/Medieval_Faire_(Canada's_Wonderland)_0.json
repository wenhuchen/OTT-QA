This section of the park originally opened with five rides : Dragon Fyre , Wilde Beast , Viking \u2019 s Rage , Spinovator , and Wilde Knightmares . [ 2 ] Steel roller coaster Dragon Fyre includes 4 inversions , and is now the only Arrow Dynamics coaster in existence to have counter-clockwise turning corkscrews . Out and back wooden roller coaster Wilde Beast has 3000 feet of track , while Wilde Knight Mares is a standing Enterprise ride featuring ten four-seater gondolas rises 60 feet , tilting 90 degrees . Viking 's Rage , was the first of three pendulum rides the park operated ; unlike the now removed Jet Scream , the boat ride does not go upside down . Spinovator features spinning kettles on a tilted platform . [ 5 ] ( Two years before opening , Dragon Fyre was simply called the Looping Corkscrew , and another ride was to be the Wildcat . ) [ 6 ] In May 1981 , Canada 's Wonderland Director of Rides and Ground Services Jim Wilson told the Toronto Star that The Wilde Beast ( along with two of the other original coasters at the park , Scooby 's Ghoster Coaster , and the Mighty Canadian Minebuster ) was wooden thanks to the apparent popularity of different styles of rides . `` Experiments '' found that steel coasters were n't as popular or enjoyable to the public , `` the sound and feel all contribute to the thrill of the ride . People just did n't like steel roller coasters . `` [ 7 ] Over the years , only four major attractions were added to Medieval Faire . Added in 1987 , The Bat was a backwards looping roller coaster , including one loop and two lifts . The park addition included a shop named the Belfry . [ 9 ] Later additions were Speed City Raceway ( 1997 ) , [ 10 ] Drop Zone ( 1997 ) , [ 11 ] [ 12 ] and Cliffhanger ( 2000 ) . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] During the 1990s , almost all the rides were renamed : Dragon Fyre , Wilde Beast , Quixote 's Kettles , Wilde Night Mares , and Viking 's Rage became Dragon Fire , Wild Beast , Spinovator , Nightmares , and The Rage . When the park was sold to Cedar Fair , Paramount-specific ride names disappeared with Cliffhanger , Drop Zone becoming Riptide , Drop Tower , respectively . [ 11 ] Main article : Renamed attractions at Canada 's Wonderland In 2012 , the Leviathan joined the similarly named Behemoth at Canada 's Wonderland , stripping the Behemoth of its titles as tallest ride in Canada and fastest ride in Canada . [ 15 ] It was the first new ride in Medieval Faire in more than a decade . Leviathan is ranked as the seventh tallest , and the eighth fastest roller coaster in the world . [ 16 ] It is Canada 's Wonderland 's 16th roller coaster . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] The addition came quickly after the launch of the 230-foot-tall Behemoth roller coaster in 2008 , [ 19 ] and the 301-foot-tall swing ride WindSeeker in the 2011 season . [ 20 ]",

  "intro": "Originally themed around the Middle Ages, Medieval Faire is a section of Canada's Wonderland, a theme park in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. As such, early attractions created under Kings Entertainment Company were named after knights, Don Quixote, Vikings, dragons, bats, and beasts. Throughout the Paramount Parks era, the section's new attractions lacked appropriate theming. The introduction of the Leviathan roller coaster to Medieval Faire in 2012 was the first major investment in the section since 2000; the park is now under ownership of Cedar Fair. The section includes four roller coasters (The Bat, Dragon Fire, Leviathan, and Wild Beast) and six other rides. Over the years, atmosphere performers have disappeared from most sections of the park, including Medieval Faire. Two entertainment areas have remained constant in the section, a proscenium theatre and a stunt and acrobatic space surrounded by water. Currently named Canterbury Theatre, the indoor facility has hosted a variety of stage show revues, ice shows, and now an acrobatic production, Tundra: a Cirque Experience. A structure within Arthur's Baye initially featured a pirate diving and acrobatics show, which has changed now to have a more generic theme; it is currently branded as The Flying Frontenacs, a Canadian themed show with the cast dressed up as Mounties. Food in the section was originally themed to the era, with a large indoor pub and rib stand. The food later took on a more traditional North American cuisine, like a buffet, burgers, chicken fingers, and subs. The names and facades of the two primary food locations found in the area however are medieval-themed (Marketplace & Kings Feast)."
