  "intro": "Serbia has submitted films for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film[nb 1] under three different names since the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. Despite the name changes, all submitted films since 1994 have been Serbian productions. The Foreign Film Award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. As of 2019[update], 26 Serbian films have been submitted for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but none of them have been accepted as nominees. In January 2008, it was announced that the acclaimed Serbian thriller The Trap had made the nine-film Oscar shortlist but it ultimately failed to make the final five. Furthermore, six films representing Yugoslavia received Oscar nominations between 1959 and 1992, most or all of which had significant Serbian input."
