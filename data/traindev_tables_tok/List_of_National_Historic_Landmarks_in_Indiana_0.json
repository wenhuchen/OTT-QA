  "intro": "National Historic Landmarks in Indiana represent Indiana's history from the Native American era to its early European settlers and motor racing. There are 42 National Historic Landmarks (NHLs) in the state, which are located in 23 of its 92 counties. They illustrate the state's industrial and architectural heritage, as well as battles, circuses, education, and several other topics. One of the NHLs in the state has military significance, fourteen are significant examples of different architectural styles, nine are associated with significant historical figures, and one is an archaeological site. Two NHL properties, both ships that were formerly located in Indiana, were later moved to another state. The National Historic Landmark Program is administered by the National Park Service, a branch of the Department of the Interior. The National Park Service determines which properties meet NHL criteria and makes nomination recommendations after an owner notification process. The Secretary of the Interior reviews nominations and, based on a set of predetermined criteria, makes a decision on NHL designation or a determination of eligibility for designation. Both public and privately owned properties can be designated as NHLs. This designation provides indirect, partial protection of the historic integrity of the properties via tax incentives, grants, monitoring of threats, and other means. Owners may object to the nomination of the property as a NHL. When this is the case the Secretary of the Interior can only designate a site as eligible for designation."
