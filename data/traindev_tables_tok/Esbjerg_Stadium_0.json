  "intro": "The Esbjerg Stadium (), known as the Blue Water Arena for sponsorship reasons, is a football stadium located within Esbjerg Idr\u00e6tspark in Esbjerg, Denmark. It is the home ground of Esbjerg fB and has a capacity of 16,942, of which 11,451 is seated. It is currently the second-biggest stadium in Jutland, and the fourth-biggest in Denmark. In 1999, the stadium was venue of the football tournament at the European Youth Olympic Festival. On account of the 2008 UEFA qualifier fan attack resulting in the forbidding of play of UEFA qualifier matches for Denmark within 250 km of Copenhagen, the Esbjerg Stadium was mentioned as the only possible venue within Denmark in which Denmark UEFA qualifier home games can be held as it is the biggest stadium in the country more than 250 km from Copenhagen. UEFA later changed the verdict, and on July 9, 2007 the Danish Football Association announced that the games against Spain and Liechtenstein would be played in \u00c5rhus and the games against Latvia and Iceland would be played in Copenhagen."
