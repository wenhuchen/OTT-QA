  "intro": "Alicia Silverstone (/\u02c8s\u026alv\u0259rsto\u028an/; born October 4, 1976) is an American actress. She made her film debut in The Crush (1993), earning the 1994 MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance, and gained further prominence at the age of 16 as a teen idol when she appeared in the music video for Aerosmith's Cryin'. She starred in the comedy hit Clueless (1995), which earned her a multi-million dollar deal with Columbia Pictures, and in the big-budget film Batman & Robin (1997), playing Barbara Gordon/Batgirl. For her role in the short-lived NBC series Miss Match (2003), Silverstone received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress - Television Series Musical or Comedy. She has continued to act in film and television and on stage. A vegan, Silverstone has endorsed PETA activities and has published a vegan cookbook, The Kind Diet."
