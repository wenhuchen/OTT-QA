  "intro": "The International Collegiate Programming Contest, known as the ICPC, is an annual multi-tiered competitive programming competition among the universities of the world. Headquartered at Baylor University, directed by ICPC Executive Director and Baylor Professor Dr. William B. Poucher, the ICPC operates autonomous regional contests covering six continents culminating in a global World Finals every year. In 2018, ICPC participation included 52,709 students from 3,233 universities in 110 countries. The ICPC operates under the auspices of the ICPC Foundation and operates under agreements with host universities and non-profits, all in accordance with the ICPC Policies and Procedures. Since 1977 until 2017 ICPC was held under the auspices of ACM and was referred to as ACM-ICPC. Tracing its roots to 1970, over 320,000 ICPC alumni populate the professional ranks of high-tech companies, consulting firms, financial institutions, investment firms, high-tech startups, venture-capital firms, academia, and public service. ICPC Alumni are developers, software engineers, senior software engineers, leads, chiefs, CTOs, CEOs, founders, and co-founders. They are also professors, researchers, and in public service. A good number are in venture capital, helping others start companies. One is a comedian."
