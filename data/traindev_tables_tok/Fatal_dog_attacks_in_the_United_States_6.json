Neighbors also intervened by throwing rocks at the dogs during the incident . After the attack , Winfrey underwent surgeries to remove both eyes and one leg . Winfrey died one week after the attack . Hicks was charged with misdemeanor possession of crack cocaine , and there was speculation as to whether or not the dogs may have gotten into some narcotics , but the dogs were too aggressive to test without anesthetics , which would have polluted the sample .

  "intro": "Fatal dog attacks in the United States are rare, although non-fatal dog bites are not unusual. Typically, between 30 and 50 people in the US die from dog bites each year, and the number of deaths from dog attacks appear to be increasing. Around 4.5 million Americans are bitten by dogs every year, resulting in the hospitalization of 6,000 to 13,000 people each year in the United States (2005). Injuries, illnesses, and fatalities resulting from encounters with dogs are a major public health concern worldwide. Dogs not only cause morbidity and mortality as a result of bites, they may also transmit zoonotic infections, which may also result in illness or death. In fact, dogs are the main source of rabies transmission to humans worldwide. It is estimated that 3% to 18% of dog bite wounds become infected, with occasional cases of meningitis, endocarditis, and septic shock leading to death reported. Children have the greatest risk of death."
