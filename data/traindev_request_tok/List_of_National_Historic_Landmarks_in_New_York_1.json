  "/wiki/Fort": "A fortification is a military construction or building designed for the defense of territories in warfare , and is also used to solidify rule in a region during peacetime . The term is derived from the Latin fortis ( strong ) and facere ( to make ) . From very early history to modern times , defensive walls have often been necessary for cities to survive in an ever-changing world of invasion and conquest . Some settlements in the Indus Valley Civilization were the first small cities to be fortified . In ancient Greece , large stone walls had been built in Mycenaean Greece , such as the ancient site of Mycenae ( famous for the huge stone blocks of its 'cyclopean ' walls ) . A Greek phrourion was a fortified collection of buildings used as a military garrison , and is the equivalent of the Roman castellum or English fortress . These constructions mainly served the purpose of a watch tower , to guard certain roads , passes , and borders . Though smaller than a real fortress , they acted as a border guard rather than a real strongpoint to watch and maintain the border . The art of setting out a military camp or constructing a fortification traditionally has been called castrametation since the time of the Roman legions . Fortification is usually divided into two branches : permanent fortification and field fortification . There is also an intermediate branch known as semi-permanent fortification . Castles are fortifications which are regarded as being distinct from the generic fort or fortress in that they are a residence of a monarch or noble and command a specific defensive territory .",
  "/wiki/Battery_Park_(New_York)": "The Battery , formerly known as Battery Park , is a 25-acre ( 10 ha ) public park located at the southern tip of Manhattan Island in New York City facing New York Harbor .

The park contains attractions such as an old fort named Castle Clinton ; multiple monuments ; and the SeaGlass Carousel . The surrounding area , known as South Ferry , contains multiple ferry terminals , including the Staten Island Ferry 's Whitehall Terminal as well as boat launches to the Statue of Liberty National Monument . The park and surrounding area is named for the artillery batteries that were built in the late 17th century to protect the settlement behind them . By the 1820s , the Battery had become an entertainment destination , with the conversion of Castle Clinton into a theater venue . During the mid-19th century , the modern-day Battery Park was constructed and Castle Clinton was converted into an immigration and customs center . The Battery was commonly known as the landing point for immigrants to New York City until 1890 , when the Castle Clinton immigration center was replaced by one on Ellis Island . Castle Clinton then hosted the New York Aquarium from 1896 to 1941 . In 1940 , the entirety of Battery Park was closed for twelve years due to the construction of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel and the Battery Park Underpass . The park reopened in 1952 after a renovation , but then subsequently went into decline . The Battery Conservancy , founded in 1994 by Warrie Price , underwrote and funded the restoration and improvement of the once-dilapidated park .",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Saratoga": "The Battles of Saratoga ( September 19 and October 7 , 1777 ) marked the climax of the Saratoga campaign , giving a decisive victory to the Americans over the British in the American Revolutionary War . British General John Burgoyne led a large invasion army southward from Canada in the Champlain Valley , hoping to meet a similar British force marching northward from New York City and another British force marching eastward from Lake Ontario ; the southern and western forces never arrived , and Burgoyne was surrounded by American forces in upstate New York . He fought two small battles to break out which took place 18 days apart on the same ground , 9 miles ( 14 km ) south of Saratoga , New York . They both failed . Burgoyne found himself trapped by superior American forces with no relief , so he retreated to Saratoga ( now Schuylerville ) and surrendered his entire army there on October 17 . His surrender , says historian Edmund Morgan , was a great turning point of the war because it won for Americans the foreign assistance which was the last element needed for victory . Burgoyne 's strategy to divide New England from the southern colonies had started well but slowed due to logistical problems . He won a small tactical victory over General Horatio Gates and the Continental Army in the September 19 Battle of Freeman 's Farm at the cost of significant casualties . His gains were erased when he again attacked the Americans in the October 7 Battle of Bemis Heights and the Americans captured a portion of the British defenses . Burgoyne was therefore compelled to retreat , and his army was surrounded by the much larger American force at Saratoga , forcing him to surrender on October 17 . News of Burgoyne 's surrender was instrumental in formally bringing France into the war as an American ally , although it had previously given supplies , ammunition , and guns , notably the de Valliere cannon which played an important role in Saratoga . This battle also resulted in Spain joining France in the war against Britain .",
  "/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War": "The American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) , also known as the American War of Independence , was fought primarily between the Kingdom of Great Britain and her Thirteen Colonies in America ; it resulted in the overthrow of British rule in the colonies and the establishment of the United States of America . [ N 1 ] After 1765 , growing constitutional and political differences strained the relationship between Great Britain and its American colonies . Patriot protests against taxation without representation followed the Stamp Act and escalated into boycotts , which culminated in 1773 with the Sons of Liberty destroying a shipment of tea in Boston Harbor . Britain responded by closing Boston Harbor and passing a series of punitive measures against Massachusetts Bay Colony . Massachusetts colonists responded with the Suffolk Resolves , and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown . Twelve colonies formed a Continental Congress ( with the exception of Georgia ) to coordinate their resistance , establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power . British attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia in Concord led to open combat and a British defeat on April 19 , 1775 . Militia forces then besieged Boston , forcing a British evacuation in March 1776 , and Congress appointed George Washington to command the Continental Army . Concurrently , the Americans failed decisively in an attempt to invade Quebec and raise insurrection against the British . On July 2 , 1776 , the Second Continental Congress voted for independence , issuing its declaration on July 4 . Sir William Howe launched a British counter-offensive , capturing New York City and leaving American morale at a low ebb .

  "/wiki/Methodism": "Methodism is an umbrella term used to describe denominations of Protestant Christianity which follow the line of the Methodist movement . Methodist denominations are historically related and derive their doctrine of practice and belief from the life and teachings of John Wesley . George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . [ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals , collectively known as the Social Gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people .",

Female Quakers local to the area organized the meeting along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton , who was not a Quaker . They planned the event during a visit to the area by Philadelphia-based Lucretia Mott . Mott , a Quaker , was famous for her oratorical ability , which was rare for non-Quaker women during an era in which women were often not allowed to speak in public . The meeting comprised six sessions including a lecture on law , a humorous presentation , and multiple discussions about the role of women in society . Stanton and the Quaker women presented two prepared documents , the Declaration of Sentiments and an accompanying list of resolutions , to be debated and modified before being put forward for signatures .

Following Franklin 's election as Governor of New York in 1928 , and throughout the remainder of Franklin 's public career in government , Roosevelt regularly made public appearances on his behalf , and as First Lady , while her husband served as President , she significantly reshaped and redefined the role of First Lady .

Val-Kill was located on the banks of a stream that flowed through the Roosevelt family estate in Hyde Park , New York . Eleanor and her business partners financed the construction of a small factory to provide supplemental income for local farming families who would make furniture , pewter , and homespun cloth using traditional craft methods . Capitalizing on the popularity of the Colonial Revival , most Val-Kill products were modelled on eighteenth-century forms . Nancy Cook , a trained artisan and teacher , designed most of the furniture and managed the factory which employed anywhere from three to eight men during its decade-long operation . Eleanor promoted Val-Kill through interviews and public appearances . Dickerman and O'Day were financial investors , but not actively involved in the business . The principal craftsmen at Val-Kill were immigrants , among them Frank Landolfa , Otto Berge , Arnold Berge , and Nelly Johannesen and her son , Karl . Val-Kill Industries never became the subsistence program that Eleanor and her friends imagined , but it did pave the way for larger New Deal initiatives during FDR 's presidential administration .",

The Buffalo area was inhabited before the 17th century by the Native American Iroquois tribe and later by French colonizers . The city grew significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of immigration , the construction of the Erie Canal and rail transportation , and its close proximity to Lake Erie . This growth provided an abundance of fresh water and an ample trade route to the Midwestern United States while grooming its economy for the grain , steel and automobile industries that dominated the city 's economy in the 20th century .

It eventually drains into the Atlantic Ocean at New York Harbor . The river serves as a political boundary between the states of New Jersey and New York at its southern end . Further north , it marks local boundaries between several New York counties . The lower half of the river is a tidal estuary , deeper than the body of water into which it flows , occupying the Hudson Fjord , an inlet which formed during the most recent period of North American glaciation , estimated at 26,000 to 13,300 years ago . Tidal waters influence the Hudson 's flow from as far north as the city of Troy . The river is named after Henry Hudson , an Englishman sailing for the Dutch East India Company , who explored it in 1609 , and after whom Hudson Bay in Canada is also named . It had previously been observed by Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano sailing for King Francis I of France in 1524 , as he became the first European known to have entered the Upper New York Bay , but he considered the river to be an estuary . The Dutch called the river the North River - with the Delaware River called the South River - and it formed the spine of the Dutch colony of New Netherland . Settlements of the colony clustered around the Hudson , and its strategic importance as the gateway to the American interior led to years of competition between the English and the Dutch over control of the river and colony .

  "/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights": "The United States Bill of Rights comprises the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution . Proposed following the often bitter 1787-88 debate over the ratification of the Constitution , and written to address the objections raised by Anti-Federalists , the Bill of Rights amendments add to the Constitution specific guarantees of personal freedoms and rights , clear limitations on the government 's power in judicial and other proceedings , and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically granted to the U.S. Congress by the Constitution are reserved for the states or the people . The concepts codified in these amendments are built upon those found in earlier documents , especially the Virginia Declaration of Rights ( 1776 ) , as well as the English Bill of Rights ( 1689 ) and the Magna Carta ( 1215 ) . Due largely to the efforts of Representative James Madison , who studied the deficiencies of the Constitution pointed out by anti-federalists and then crafted a series of corrective proposals , Congress approved twelve articles of amendment on September 25 , 1789 , and submitted them to the states for ratification . Contrary to Madison 's proposal that the proposed amendments be incorporated into the main body of the Constitution ( at the relevant articles and sections of the document ) , they were proposed as supplemental additions ( codicils ) to it . Articles Three through Twelve were ratified as additions to the Constitution on December 15 , 1791 , and became Amendments One through Ten of the Constitution . Article Two became part of the Constitution on May 5 , 1992 , as the Twenty-seventh Amendment . Article One is still pending before the states . Although Madison 's proposed amendments included a provision to extend the protection of some of the Bill of Rights to the states , the amendments that were finally submitted for ratification applied only to the federal government . The door for their application upon state governments was opened in the 1860s , following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment . Since the early 20th century both federal and state courts have used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply portions of the Bill of Rights to state and local governments .

  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country . [ f ] The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union . [ g ] The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years .",
