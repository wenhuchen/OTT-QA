  "/wiki/Mushroom": "A mushroom , or toadstool , is the fleshy , spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus , typically produced above ground , on soil , or on its food source . The standard for the name mushroom is the cultivated white button mushroom , Agaricus bisporus ; hence the word mushroom is most often applied to those fungi ( Basidiomycota , Agaricomycetes ) that have a stem ( stipe ) , a cap ( pileus ) , and gills ( lamellae , sing . lamella ) on the underside of the cap . Mushroom also describes a variety of other gilled fungi , with or without stems , therefore the term is used to describe the fleshy fruiting bodies of some Ascomycota . These gills produce microscopic spores that help the fungus spread across the ground or its occupant surface . Forms deviating from the standard morphology usually have more specific names , such as bolete , puffball , stinkhorn , and morel , and gilled mushrooms themselves are often called agarics in reference to their similarity to Agaricus or their order Agaricales . By extension , the term mushroom can also refer to either the entire fungus when in culture , the thallus ( called a mycelium ) of species forming the fruiting bodies called mushrooms , or the species itself .",

  "/wiki/Demolition_derby": "Demolition derby is a motorsport usually presented at county fairs and festivals . While rules vary from event to event , the typical demolition derby event consists of five or more drivers competing by deliberately ramming their vehicles into one another . The last driver whose vehicle is still operational is awarded the victory . Demolition derbies originated in the United States and quickly spread to other Western nations . For example , Australia 's first demolition derby took place in January 1963 . Demolition derbies can be dangerous . Although serious injuries are rare , they do happen . Drivers are typically required to sign a waiver to release the promoter of an event from liability . To make the event safer , all glass is removed from the vehicle , and deliberately ramming the driver's-side door area is forbidden . The driver 's door is often required to be painted white with black numbers or blaze orange , or with contrasting colors , for visibility . Most demolition derbies are held on dirt tracks , or in open fields , that are usually soaked with water . This causes the competition area to become muddy , which helps to further slow the vehicles .",

  "/wiki/Powerup": "In video games , a power-up is an object that adds temporary benefits or extra abilities to the player character as a game mechanic . This is in contrast to an item , which may or may not have a permanent benefit that can be used at any time chosen by the player . Although often collected directly through touch , power-ups can sometimes only be gained by collecting several related items , such as the floating letters of the word 'EXTEND ' in Bubble Bobble . Well known examples of power-ups that have entered popular culture include the power pellets from Pac-Man ( regarded as the first power-up ) and the Super Mushroom from Super Mario Bros. , which ranked first in UGO Networks ' Top 11 Video Game Powerups . Items that confer power-ups are usually pre-placed in the game world , spawned randomly , dropped by beaten enemies or picked up from opened or smashed containers . They can be differentiated from items in other games , such as role-playing video games , by the fact that they take effect immediately , feature designs that do not necessarily fit into the game world ( often used letters or symbols emblazoned on a design ) , and are found in specific genres of games . Power-ups are mostly found in action-oriented games such as maze games , run and guns , shoot 'em ups , first-person shooters , and platform games .",

The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from cool to warm , hot , and critical status as it is used . Players can only defuse the ball , resetting it from its current state back to cool by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession , whether through touchdown , interception or fumble . A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball . The robots also possess finite durability . As offensive units are tackled , they wear down , finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits . A flaming robot will explode when hit , thereby fumbling the ball . Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play . Players select from run , pass or option plays on offense , after which the computer presents four individual plays from which to choose . On defense , a player can select short , medium or long defenses , and then select a specific defensive scheme .

  "/wiki/American_football": "American football , referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron , [ nb 1 ] is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end . The offense , the team with possession of the oval-shaped football , attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it , while the defense , the team without possession of the ball , aims to stop the offense 's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves . The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays ; if they fail , they turn over the football to the defense , but if they succeed , they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive . Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins . American football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of soccer and rugby . The first American football match was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the Father of American Football , established the snap , the line of scrimmage , eleven-player teams , and the concept of downs . Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game ( although their rules were developed independently from that of Camp 's ) . Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football . The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football .",
  "/wiki/Robot": "A robot is a machine - especially one programmable by a computer - capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically . Robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within . Robots may be constructed on the lines of human form , but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no regard to their aesthetics . Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids such as Honda 's Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility ( ASIMO ) and TOSY 's TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot ( TOPIO ) to industrial robots , medical operating robots , patient assist robots , dog therapy robots , collectively programmed swarm robots , UAV drones such as General Atomics MQ-1 Predator , and even microscopic nano robots . By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements , a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own . Autonomous things are expected to proliferate in the coming decade , with home robotics and the autonomous car as some of the main drivers . The branch of technology that deals with the design , construction , operation , and application of robots , as well as computer systems for their control , sensory feedback , and information processing is robotics . These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes , or resemble humans in appearance , behavior , or cognition . Many of today 's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics . These robots have also created a newer branch of robotics : soft robotics . From the time of ancient civilization there have been many accounts of user-configurable automated devices and even automata resembling animals and humans , designed primarily as entertainment . As mechanical techniques developed through the Industrial age , there appeared more practical applications such as automated machines , remote-control and wireless remote-control .",

  "/wiki/Fighting_game": "A fighting game is a video game genre based around close combat between a limited number of characters , in a stage in which the boundaries are fixed . The characters fight each others until they defeat their opponents or the time expires . The matches typically consist of several rounds , in an arena , with each player character having different abilities but each is relatively viable to choose . Players must master techniques such as blocking , counter-attacking , and chaining attacks together into combos . Starting in the early 1990s , most fighting games allowed the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations . The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups , which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player . The first game to feature fist fighting was Heavyweight Champ in 1976 , but it was Karate Champ which popularized one-on-one martial arts games in arcades in 1984 . The following year , Yie Ar Kung-Fu featured antagonists with differing fighting styles , while The Way of the Exploding Fist further popularized the genre on home systems . In 1987 , Street Fighter introduced hidden special attacks . In 1991 , Capcom 's highly successful Street Fighter II refined and popularized many of the conventions of the genre . The fighting game subsequently became the preeminent genre for competitive video gaming in the early to mid-1990s , particularly in arcades . This period spawned dozens of other popular fighting games , including franchises like Street Fighter , Super Smash Bros. , Tekken , and Virtua Fighter ."
