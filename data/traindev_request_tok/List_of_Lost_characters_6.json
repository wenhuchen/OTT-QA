  "/wiki/Lottery": "The first recorded signs of a lottery are keno slips from the Chinese Han Dynasty between 205 and 187 BC . These lotteries are believed to have helped to finance major government projects like the Great Wall of China . From the Chinese The Book of Songs ( 2nd millennium BC . ) comes a reference to a game of chance as the drawing of wood , which in context appears to describe the drawing of lots . The first known European lotteries were held during the Roman Empire , mainly as an amusement at dinner parties . Each guest would receive a ticket , and prizes would often consist of fancy items such as dinnerware . Every ticket holder would be assured of winning something . This type of lottery , however , was no more than the distribution of gifts by wealthy noblemen during the Saturnalian revelries . The earliest records of a lottery offering tickets for sale is the lottery organized by Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar . The funds were for repairs in the City of Rome , and the winners were given prizes in the form of articles of unequal value .",
