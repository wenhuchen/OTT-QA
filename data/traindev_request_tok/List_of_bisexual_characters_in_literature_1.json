  "/wiki/Blackmail": "Blackmail is an act of coercion using the threat of revealing or publicizing either substantially true or false information about a person or people unless certain demands are met . It is often damaging information , and may be revealed to family members or associates rather than to the general public . It may involve using threats of physical , mental or emotional harm , or of criminal prosecution , against the victim or someone close to the victim . It is normally carried out for personal gain , most commonly of position , money , or property . Blackmail may also be considered a form of extortion . Although the two are generally synonymous , extortion is the taking of personal property by threat of future harm . Blackmail is the use of threat to prevent another from engaging in a lawful occupation and writing libelous letters or letters that provoke a breach of the peace , as well as use of intimidation for purposes of collecting an unpaid debt . In many jurisdictions , blackmail is a statutory offense , often criminal , carrying punitive sanctions for convicted perpetrators . Blackmail is the name of a statutory offense in the United States , England and Wales , and Australia , and has been used as a convenient way of referring to certain other offenses , but was not a term used in English law until 1968 . Blackmail originally meant payments rendered by settlers in the counties of England bordering Scotland in exchange for protection from Scottish thieves and marauders . The mail part of blackmail derives from Middle English male meaning rent or tribute . This tribute ( male or reditus ) was paid in goods or labour ( nigri ) ; hence reditus nigri , or blackmail .",

He is a self-proclaimed satirist whose trademark technique , as a writer , is the expression of extreme acts and opinions in an affectless style . His novels commonly share recurring characters . When Ellis was 21 , his first novel , the controversial bestseller Less Than Zero ( 1985 ) , was published by Simon & Schuster . His third novel , American Psycho ( 1991 ) , was his most successful ; upon its release , the literary establishment widely condemned it as overly violent and misogynistic . Though many petitions to ban the book saw Ellis dropped by Simon & Schuster , the resounding controversy convinced Alfred A. Knopf to release it as a paperback later that year . Ellis 's novels have become increasingly metafictional . Lunar Park ( 2005 ) , a pseudo-memoir and ghost story , received positive reviews . Imperial Bedrooms ( 2010 ) , marketed as a sequel to Less Than Zero , continues in this vein . Four of Ellis 's works have been made into films . Less Than Zero was adapted in 1987 as a film of the same name , but the film bore little resemblance to the novel .",
