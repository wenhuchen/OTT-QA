Masala films generally fall under the musical film genre , of which Indian cinema has been the largest producer since the 1960s when it exceeded the American film industry 's total musical output after musical films declined in the West ; the first Indian musical talkie was Alam Ara ( 1931 ) , several years after the first Hollywood musical talkie The Jazz Singer ( 1927 ) . Alongside commercial masala films , a distinctive genre of art films known as parallel cinema has also existed , presenting realistic content and avoidance of musical numbers .",
