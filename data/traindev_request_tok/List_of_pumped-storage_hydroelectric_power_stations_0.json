The power plant is equipped with four reversible Francis pump-turbines , each rated at 216 megawatts ( 290,000 hp ) in the generating mode , and 197 megawatts ( 264,000 hp ) in pumping mode . Units 1 and 2 have been in operation since 1995 , and at that time Chaira was the largest pumped-storage plant in southeast Europe with the highest head in the world for a single-stage pump turbine ( 690 metres ( 2,260 ft ) generating and 701 metres ( 2,300 ft ) pumping ) . Units 3 and 4 came online in 1999 . The pump-turbines and motor-generators were supplied by Toshiba , and three of them were manufactured under Japanese supervision in Bulgaria . The upper basin for Chaira is formed by the Belmeken Dam which connects to the pumped storage plant by two headrace tunnels with a diameter of 4.2 metres ( 14 ft ) and two penstocks with diameter 4.4 metres ( 14 ft ) , reducing to 4.2 metres ( 14 ft ) . Outflow from the Belmeken reservoir supplies the Sestrimo Hydro Power Plant",

It is bordered by Romania to the north , Serbia and North Macedonia to the west , Greece and Turkey to the south , and the Black Sea to the east . The capital and largest city is Sofia ; other major cities are Plovdiv , Varna and Burgas . With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres ( 42,855 sq mi ) , Bulgaria is Europe 's 16th-largest country . One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture , which dates back to 6,500 BC . In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for Thracians , Persians , Celts and ancient Macedonians ; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45 . The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries . The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State .",
  "/wiki/Sardar_Sarovar_Dam": "The Sardar Sarovar Dam is a gravity dam on the Narmada river near Navagam , Gujarat in India . Four Indian states , Gujarat , Madhya Pradesh , Maharashtra and Rajasthan , receive water and electricity supplied from the dam . The foundation stone of the project was laid out by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on 5 April 1961 . The project took form in 1979 as part of a development scheme funded by the World Bank through their International Bank for Reconstruction and Development , to increase irrigation and produce hydroelectricity , using a loan of US $ 200 million . The construction for dam begun in 1987 , but the project was stalled by the Supreme Court of India in 1995 in the backdrop of Narmada Bachao Andolan over concerns of displacement of people . In 2000-01 the project was revived but with a lower height of 110.64 metres under directions from SC , which was later increased in 2006 to 121.92 meters and 138.98 meters in 2017 . The water level in the Sardar Sarovar Dam at Kevadia in Narmada district reached its highest capacity at 138.68 metres on 15 September 2019 . One of the 30 dams planned on river Narmada , Sardar Sarovar Dam ( SSD ) is the largest structure to be built . It is one of the largest dams in the world . It is a part of the Narmada Valley Project , a large hydraulic engineering project involving the construction of a series of large irrigation and hydroelectric multi-purpose dams on the Narmada river . Following a number of controversial cases before the Supreme Court of India ( 1999 , 2000 , 2003 ) , by 2014 the Narmada Control Authority had approved a series of changes in the final height - and the associated displacement caused by the increased reservoir , from the original 80 m ( 260 ft ) to a final 163 m ( 535 ft ) from foundation . The project will irrigate more than 18,000 km2 ( 6,900 sq mi ) , most of it in drought prone areas of Kutch and Saurashtra .",
  "/wiki/India": "India ( Hindi : Bh\u0101rat ) , officially the Republic of India ( Hindi : Bh\u0101rat Ga\u1e47ar\u0101jya ) , is a country in South Asia . It is the seventh-largest country by area , the second-most populous country , and the most populous democracy in the world . Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south , the Arabian Sea on the southwest , and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast , it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west ; [ e ] China , Nepal , and Bhutan to the north ; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east . In the Indian Ocean , India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives ; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia . Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief ."
