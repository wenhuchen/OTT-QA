With a depth of about 170 m ( 560 ft ) , Lake Albano is the deepest in Lazio . The lake is 3.5 km ( 2.2 mi ) long by 2.3 km ( 1.4 mi ) wide , and was formed by the overlapping union of two volcanic craters , an origin indicated by the ridge in its center , which rises to a height of 70 m ( 230 ft ) . Plutarch reports that in 406 BC the lake surged over the surrounding hills , despite there being no rain nor tributaries flowing into the lake to account for the rise in water level . The ensuing flood destroyed fields and vineyards before eventually pouring into the sea . It is thought to have been caused by volcanic gases , trapped in sediment at the bottom of the lake and gradually building up until suddenly releasing , causing the water to overflow . Around 395 BC , during the wars between Rome and Veii , a discharge tunnel was built crossing the crater walls . It served as an emissary whenever the water level overflowed its mouth . According to Titus Livius , this feat of engineering was incited by the Oracle of Delphi : the Roman victory against Veii would be possible only when the lake waters were channeled and used for irrigation .
