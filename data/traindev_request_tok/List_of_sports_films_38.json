  "/wiki/Charlie_Chan": "Charlie Chan is a fictional Honolulu police detective created by author Earl Derr Biggers for a series of mystery novels . Biggers loosely based Chan on Hawaiian detective Chang Apana . The benevolent and heroic Chan was conceived of as an alternative to Yellow Peril stereotypes and villains like Fu Manchu . Many stories feature Chan traveling the world beyond Hawaii as he investigates mysteries and solves crimes . Chan first appeared in Biggers ' novels and then was featured in a number of media . Over four dozen films featuring Charlie Chan were made , beginning in 1926 . The character , featured only as a supporting character , was first portrayed by East Asian actors , and the films met with little success . In 1931 , for the first film centering on Chan , Charlie Chan Carries On , the Fox Film Corporation cast Swedish actor Warner Oland ; the film became popular , and Fox went on to produce fifteen more Chan films with Oland in the title role . After Oland 's death , American actor Sidney Toler was cast as Chan ; Toler made twenty-two Chan films , first for Fox and then for Monogram Studios . After Toler 's death , six films were made , starring Roland Winters . Readers and movie-goers of America [ who ? ] initially greeted Chan warmly , seeing him as an attractive character who is portrayed as intelligent , heroic , benevolent and honorable in contrast to the racist depictions of evil or conniving Asians which often dominated Hollywood and national media in the early 20th Century [ citation needed ] .",
  "/wiki/1936_Summer_Olympics": "The 1936 Summer Olympics ( German : Olympische Sommerspiele 1936 ) , officially known as the Games of the XI Olympiad , was an international multi-sport event held in 1936 in Berlin , Nazi Germany . Berlin won the bid to host the Games over Barcelona , Spain , on 26 April 1931 , at the 29th IOC Session in Barcelona . It marked the second and final time the International Olympic Committee gathered to vote in a city that was bidding to host those Games . To outdo the Los Angeles games of 1932 , Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler had a new 100,000-seat track and field stadium built , as well as six gymnasiums and many other smaller arenas . The games were the first to be televised , and radio broadcasts reached 41 countries . Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl was commissioned by the German Olympic Committee to film the Games for $ 7 million . Her film , titled Olympia , pioneered many of the techniques now common in the filming of sports . Hitler saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy and antisemitism , and the official Nazi party paper , the V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter , wrote in the strongest terms that Jews should not be allowed to participate in the Games . German Jewish athletes were barred or prevented from taking part by a variety of methods , although some women swimmers from the Jewish sports club , Hakoah Vienna , did take part . Jewish athletes from other countries seem to have been side-lined in order not to offend the Nazi regime . Total ticket revenues were 7.5 million Reichsmark , generating a profit of over one million \u211b\u2133 . The official budget did not include outlays by the city of Berlin ( which issued an itemized report detailing its costs of 16.5 million \u211b\u2133 ) or outlays of the German national government ( which did not make its costs public , but is estimated to have spent US $ 30 million ) .",
  "/wiki/Olympia_(1938_film)": "Olympia is a 1938 German documentary sports film written , directed and produced by Leni Riefenstahl , which documented the 1936 Summer Olympics , held in the Olympic Stadium in Berlin , Germany . The film was released in two parts : Olympia 1 . Teil - Fest der V\u00f6lker ( Festival of Nations ) and Olympia 2 . Teil - Fest der Sch\u00f6nheit ( Festival of Beauty ) . It was the first documentary feature film of an Olympic Games ever made . Many advanced motion picture techniques , which later became industry standards but which were groundbreaking at the time , were employed , including unusual camera angles , smash cuts , extreme close-ups and placing tracking shot rails within the bleachers . The techniques employed are almost universally admired , but the film is controversial due to its political context . Nevertheless , it appears on many lists of the greatest films of all time , including Time magazine 's All-Time 100 Movies . Olympia set the precedent for future films documenting and glorifying the Olympic Games , particularly the Summer Games . The 1936 Summer Olympics torch relay was devised for the Games by the secretary general of the Organizing Committee , Dr. Carl Diem . Riefenstahl staged the torch relay for the film , with competitive events of the Games . Although restricted to six camera positions on the stadium field , Riefenstahl set up cameras in as many other places as she could , including in the grandstands .",

A talented swimmer and artist , she also became interested in dancing during her childhood , taking dancing lessons and performing across Europe . After seeing a promotional poster for the 1924 film Der Berg des Schicksals ( The Mountain of Destiny ) , Riefenstahl was inspired to move into acting . Between 1925 and 1929 , she starred in five successful motion pictures . Riefenstahl became one of the few women in Germany to direct a film during the Weimar Period when , in 1932 , she decided to try directing with her own film called Das Blaue Licht ( The Blue Light ) . In the 1930s , she directed the Nazi propaganda films Triumph des Willens ( Triumph of the Will ) and Olympia , resulting in worldwide attention and acclaim . The movies are widely considered two of the most effective , and technically innovative , propaganda films ever made . Her involvement in Triumph des Willens , however , significantly damaged her career and reputation after the war . Hitler was in close collaboration with Riefenstahl during the production of at least three important Nazi films , and they formed a friendly relationship . Some have argued that Riefenstahl 's visions were essential to the carrying out of the mission of the Holocaust . After the war , Riefenstahl was arrested , but classified as being a fellow traveler or Nazi sympathizer only and was not associated with war crimes . Throughout her life , she denied having known about the Holocaust .",

These Games were the first to be staged in the Southern Hemisphere and Oceania , as well as the first to be held outside Europe and North America . Melbourne is the most southerly city ever to host the Olympics . Due to the Southern Hemisphere 's seasons being different from those in the Northern Hemisphere , the 1956 Games did not take place at the usual time of year , because of the need to hold the events during the warmer weather of the host 's spring/summer ( which corresponds to the Northern Hemisphere 's autumn/winter ) . The Olympic equestrian events could not be held in Melbourne due to Australia 's strict quarantine regulations , so they were held in Stockholm five months earlier . This was the second time that the Olympics were not held entirely in one country , the first being the 1920 Summer Olympics , which were held in Antwerp , Belgium , with some events taking place in Ostend , Belgium and Amsterdam , Netherlands .

The Olympic Games are considered the world 's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating . The Olympic Games are held every four years , with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart . Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games ( Ancient Greek : \u1f48\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u1f08\u03b3\u1ff6\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 ) , which were held in Olympia , Greece , from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD . Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) in 1894 , leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896 . The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement , with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority . The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games . Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports , the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability , the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18 , the five Continental games ( Pan American , African , Asian , European , and Pacific ) , and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games . The Deaflympics and Special Olympics are also endorsed by the IOC . The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic , political , and technological advancements . The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism , as envisioned by Coubertin , to allowing participation of professional athletes . The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games .",

The games were held every four years , or olympiad , which became a unit of time in historical chronologies . During the celebration of the games , an Olympic Truce was enacted so that athletes could travel from their cities to the games in safety . The prizes for the victors were olive leaf wreaths or crowns . The games became a political tool used by city-states to assert dominance over their rivals .
