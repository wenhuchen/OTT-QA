It was built by the Alcester Railway Company . It connected the manufacturing town of Alcester into the Great Western Railway network , opening in 1876 . Running through sparsely populated country , it was never commercially successful . During World War I it was closed and its track used in support of the war effort . During World War II it brought Coventry factory workers to a relocated manufacturing plant near the line when their own factory had been bombed . The line closed in 1951 .",
  "/wiki/Great_Western_Railway": "The Great Western Railway ( GWR ) was a British railway company that linked London with the southwest and west of England , the West Midlands , and most of Wales . It was founded in 1833 , received its enabling Act of Parliament on 31 August 1835 and ran its first trains in 1838 . It was engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel , who chose a broad gauge of 7 ft ( 2,134 mm ) - later slightly widened to 7 ft 1\u20444 in ( 2,140 mm ) - but , from 1854 , a series of amalgamations saw it also operate 4 ft 8 1\u20442 in ( 1,435 mm ) standard-gauge trains ; the last broad-gauge services were operated in 1892 . The GWR was the only company to keep its identity through the Railways Act 1921 , which amalgamated it with the remaining independent railways within its territory , and it was finally merged at the end of 1947 when it was nationalised and became the Western Region of British Railways . The GWR was called by some God 's Wonderful Railway and by others the Great Way Round but it was famed as the Holiday Line , taking many people to English and Bristol Channel resorts in the West Country as well as the far southwest of England such as Torquay in Devon , Minehead in Somerset , and Newquay and St Ives in Cornwall . The company 's locomotives , many of which were built in the company 's workshops at Swindon , were painted a Brunswick green colour while , for most of its existence , it used a two-tone chocolate and cream livery for its passenger coaches . Goods wagons were painted red but this was later changed to mid-grey . Great Western trains included long-distance express services such as the Flying Dutchman , the Cornish Riviera Express and the Cheltenham Spa Express . It also operated many suburban and rural services , some operated by steam railmotors or autotrains . The company pioneered the use of larger , more economic goods wagons than were usual in Britain . It operated a network of road motor ( bus ) routes , was a part of the Railway Air Services , and owned ships , docks and hotels .",

  "/wiki/Great_Eastern_Railway": "The Great Eastern Railway ( GER ) was a pre-grouping British railway company , whose main line linked London Liverpool Street to Norwich and which had other lines through East Anglia . The company was grouped into the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923 . Formed in 1862 after the amalgamation of the Eastern Counties Railway and several other smaller railway companies the GER served Cambridge , Chelmsford , Colchester , Great Yarmouth , Ipswich , King 's Lynn , Lowestoft , Norwich , Southend-on-Sea ( opened by the GER in 1889 ) , and East Anglian seaside resorts such as Hunstanton ( whose prosperity was largely a result of the GER 's line being built ) and Cromer . It also served a suburban area , including Enfield , Chingford , Loughton and Ilford . This suburban network was , in the early 20th century , the busiest steam-hauled commuter system in the world . The majority of the Great Eastern 's locomotives and rolling stock were built at Stratford Works , part of which was on the site of today 's Stratford International station and the rest was adjacent to Stratford Regional station . The GER owned 1,200 miles ( 1,931 km ) of line and had a near-monopoly in East Anglia until the opening of the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway in 1893 although there were a number of minor lines , such as the Mid-Suffolk Light Railway that stayed resolutely independent until after the grouping in 1923 .",

  "/wiki/Southern_Railway_(Great_Britain)": "The Southern Railway ( SR ) , sometimes shortened to 'Southern ' , was a British railway company established in the 1923 Grouping . It linked London with the Channel ports , South West England , South coast resorts and Kent . The railway was formed by the amalgamation of several smaller railway companies , the largest of which were the London & South Western Railway ( LSWR ) , the London , Brighton and South Coast Railway ( LB & SCR ) and the South Eastern and Chatham Railway ( SE & CR ) . The construction of what was to become the Southern Railway began in 1838 with the opening of the London and Southampton Railway , which was renamed the London & South Western Railway . The railway was noted for its astute use of public relations and a coherent management structure headed by Sir Herbert Walker . At 2,186 miles ( 3,518 km ) , the Southern Railway was the smallest of the Big Four railway companies and , unlike the others , the majority of its revenue came from passenger traffic rather than freight . It created what was at that time the world 's largest electrified main line railway system and the first electrified inter-city route ( London - Brighton ) . There were two Chief Mechanical Engineers ; Richard Maunsell between 1923 and 1937 and Oliver Bulleid from 1937 to 1948 , both of whom designed new locomotives and rolling stock to replace much of that which was inherited in 1923 . The Southern Railway played a vital role in the Second World War , embarking the British Expeditionary Force , during the Dunkirk operations , and supplying Operation Overlord in 1944 ; because the railway was primarily a passenger network , its success was an even more remarkable achievement . The Southern Railway operated a number of famous named trains , including the Brighton Belle , the Bournemouth Belle , the Golden Arrow and the Night Ferry ( London - Paris and Brussels ) . The West Country services were dominated by lucrative summer holiday traffic and included named trains such as the Atlantic Coast Express and the Devon Belle . The company 's best-known livery was highly distinctive : locomotives and carriages were painted in a bright malachite green above plain black frames , with bold , bright yellow lettering .",

  "/wiki/Great_Northern_Railway_(Great_Britain)": "The Great Northern Railway ( GNR ) was a British railway company incorporated in 1846 with the object of building a line from London to York . It quickly saw that seizing control of territory was key to development , and it acquired , or took leases of , many local railways , whether actually built or not . In doing so it overextended itself financially . Nevertheless , it succeeded in reaching into the coalfields of Nottinghamshire , Derbyshire and Yorkshire , as well as establishing dominance in Lincolnshire and North London . Bringing coal south to London was dominant , but general agricultural business and short and long distance passenger traffic were important activities . Its fast passenger express trains captured the public imagination , and its Chief Mechanical Engineer Nigel Gresley became a celebrity . Anglo-Scottish travel on the East Coast Main Line became commercially important ; the GNR controlled the line from London to Doncaster and allied itself with the North Eastern Railway and the North British Railway so as to offer seamless travel facilities . The main line railways of Great Britain were grouped following the Railways Act 1921 into one or other of four new larger concerns . The Great Northern Railway was a constituent of the London and North Eastern Railway , which took control at the beginning of 1923 . Although many local lines have been closed , much of the network is active today .",

  "/wiki/Lancashire_&_Yorkshire_Railway": "The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway ( L & YR ) was a major British railway company before the 1923 Grouping . It was incorporated in 1847 from an amalgamation of several existing railways . It was the third-largest railway system based in northern England ( after the Midland and North Eastern Railways ) . [ citation needed ] The intensity of its service was reflected in the 1,650 locomotives it owned - it was by far the most densely trafficked system in the British Isles with more locomotives per mile than any other company [ citation needed ] - and that one third of its 738 signal boxes controlled junctions averaging one every 3.5 miles ( 6 km ) . No two adjacent stations were more than 5.5 miles ( 9 km ) apart and its 1,904 passenger services occupied 57 pages in Bradshaw , a number exceeded only by the Great Western Railway , the London and North Western Railway , and the Midland Railway .

  "/wiki/Lyme_Regis_branch_line": "The Lyme Regis branch line was a railway branch line connecting the seaside town of Lyme Regis with the main line railway network at Axminster , running through picturesque rural countryside on the Dorset - Devon border . It opened in 1903 ; penetrating difficult topography , the line was very steeply graded and sharply curved ; on summer weekends high passenger levels were carried , with through carriages from London on many services . The line achieved high levels of interest among railway enthusiasts in later years because a veteran type of steam engine , the Adams 'Radial ' Tank 4-4-2T locomotive , was used to handle this traffic ; this engine class survived long after the type had been superseded in its original area of use in the London suburbs . With the decline in usage of rural lines , the branch closed in 1965 .",
  "/wiki/London_and_South_Western_Railway": "The London and South Western Railway ( LSWR or L & SWR ) was a railway company in England from 1838 to 1922 . Starting as the London and Southampton Railway , its network extended from London to Plymouth via Salisbury and Exeter , with branches to Ilfracombe and Padstow and via Southampton to Bournemouth and Weymouth . It also had many routes connecting towns in Hampshire and Berkshire , including Portsmouth and Reading . In the grouping of railways in 1923 the LSWR amalgamated with other railways to create the Southern Railway . Among significant achievements of the LSWR were the electrification of suburban lines , the introduction of power signalling , the development of Southampton Docks , the rebuilding of London Waterloo station as one of the great stations of the world , and the handling of the massive traffic involved in the First World War . Spreading car ownership led to a rapid decline of passenger traffic in Devon and Cornwall from about 1960 to the end of that decade so short mid-distance-from-London branches and the remote peninsular sections of route closed under the Beeching Report , except the line to Penzance from Exeter which had since the very outset been the main preserve of the Great Western Railway , chiefly due to that company 's initial laying of track there and doing so on broad gauge and encouraging Devon and Cornish companies to do so under the 'Gauge War ' .",
  "/wiki/Rawtenstall_to_Bacup_Line": "The Rawtenstall to Bacup railway line opened in two stages , from Rawtenstall to Waterfoot in 1848 , and from Waterfoot to the Bacup terminus in 1852 . There were stations at Rawtenstall , Cloughfold , Stacksteads and Bacup . The line was doubled in 1880 , at the same time as the line from Bacup to Rochdale was also opened ( closed 1947 ) . Passenger and freight services operated until the Beeching cuts in 1966 , the last passenger train running on 5 December 1966 and the track being lifted in 1969 . As the Irwell valley is quite narrow the line had many engineering features in its 5-mile length , including 14 crossings of the River Irwell alone , plus many over and underbridges , embankments and cuttings , and tunnels at Thrutch Gorge ( The Glen ) in Waterfoot .

  "/wiki/Banbury_and_Cheltenham_Direct_Railway": "The Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway ( B & CDR ) was a railway company in England that built a line between points near Banbury and Cheltenham . Its principal objective , as well as a general rural rail service , was the conveyance of iron ore from the East Midlands to South Wales . It extended two pre-existing branches , the Chipping Norton branch of the Oxford , Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway ( OW & WR , opened in 1855 ) and the Bourton-on-the-Water Railway ( opened in 1862 ) . Both branches had their main line junction at Chipping Norton Junction , later renamed Kingham , on the OW & WR main line . The B & CDR opened its western section , from Bourton-on-the-Water to a junction near Cheltenham , in 1881 , and its eastern section , from Chipping Norton to a junction at King 's Sutton , near Banbury , in 1887 . The company was always short of money , and the timescale of construction was correspondingly lengthy . When the extensions opened , the Great Western Railway worked the B & CDR line and the two earlier branches as a single railway throughout . Reversal of through trains was necessary at Chipping Norton Junction until a flyover line was opened , in 1906 , and from that year a through express train from Barry to Newcastle Central ran over the route , using the flyover . The company sold its undertaking to the GWR in 1896 , receiving about a quarter of the capital it had expended on the construction . The line had difficult gradients and curvature , and much of the route was single track . Between 1951 and 1962 the passenger service was withdrawn in stages , and all of the line except a short stub at King 's Sutton was closed on 1964 , followed by complete closure in 1969 .",

Onward routes from there ran to the West Coast Main Line at Bletchley via Brackley and Buckingham and thence to Cambridge , or to Aylesbury for London . The line was promoted by the Buckinghamshire Railway which was formed in 1847 to construct two routes : one from Bletchley to Oxford , later known as the Varsity Line , and another to Banbury . The line to Banbury was opened in May 1850 and the Oxford section followed in October of the same year . The line was worked by the London and North Western Railway , which absorbed the Buckinghamshire Railway in 1879 . In 1923 , the London and North Western became a constituent of the London , Midland and Scottish Railway at the Grouping . The line became part of British Railways upon nationalisation on 1 January 1948 . Increasing competition from motor transport and dwindling receipts after the Second World War led to the line being chosen in 1956 for an experiment with British Rail Derby Lightweight diesel multiple units in an attempt to stem the losses . Although the units were well-patronised , the deficit was not reduced sufficiently to justify keeping the line open . The section between Banbury and Buckingham closed on 2 January 1961 , with the section Buckingham-Verney Jn abandoned on 5 December 1966 . None of the station buildings have survived , although some sections of the line are now public footpaths .",

In fact the route was not greatly used for its intended purpose . After the war the line was again scheduled to be developed as a strategic route , but this scheme too was never fully implemented . Passenger services were withdrawn from most of the line in 1967 , and only the Bletchley-Bedford section remained open for passenger traffic . In 1987 , the section between Oxford and Bicester was reopened , followed in 2015 by a connection to the Chiltern Main Line at Bicester , enabling Chiltern Railways to operate an Oxford to London passenger service .

  "/wiki/North_Staffordshire_Railway": "The North Staffordshire Railway ( NSR ) was a British railway company formed in 1845 to promote a number of lines in the Staffordshire Potteries and surrounding areas in Staffordshire , Cheshire , Derbyshire and Shropshire . The company was based in Stoke-on-Trent and was nicknamed The Knotty ; its lines were built to the standard gauge of 4 ft 8 1\u20442 in ( 1,435 mm ) . The main routes were constructed between 1846 and 1852 and ran from Macclesfield to Norton Bridge , just north of Stafford , and from Crewe to Egginton Junction , west of Derby . Within these main connections with other railway companies , most notably the London and North Western Railway ( LNWR ) , the company operated a network of smaller lines although the total route mileage of the company never exceeded 221 miles ( 355.7 km ) . The majority of the passenger traffic was local although a number of LNWR services from Manchester to London were operated via Stoke . Freight traffic was mostly coal and other minerals but the line also carried the vast majority of china and other pottery goods manufactured in England . As the NSR was surrounded by other larger railway companies , there were in the 19th century several attempts emanating from other companies or proposals from NSR shareholders to amalgamate with one or more of the other companies that adjoined it . None of these came to fruition and the NSR remained an independent company up to 1923 when it became part of the London , Midland and Scottish Railway Company .",
