Bliss 's musical training was cut short by the First World War , in which he served with distinction in the army . In the post-war years he quickly became known as an unconventional and modernist composer , but within the decade he began to display a more traditional and romantic side in his music . In the 1920s and 1930s he composed extensively not only for the concert hall , but also for films and ballet . In the Second World War , Bliss returned to England from the US to work for the BBC and became its director of music . After the war he resumed his work as a composer , and was appointed Master of the Queen 's Music . In Bliss 's later years , his work was respected but was thought old-fashioned , and it was eclipsed by the music of younger colleagues such as William Walton and Benjamin Britten . Since his death , his compositions have been well represented in recordings , and many of his better-known works remain in the repertoire of British orchestras .",
  "/wiki/Birmingham_Town_Hall": "Birmingham Town Hall is a Grade I listed concert hall and venue for popular assemblies opened in 1834 and situated in Victoria Square , Birmingham , England . The first of the monumental town halls that would come to characterise the cities of Victorian England , Birmingham Town Hall was also the first significant work of the 19th-century revival of Roman architecture , a style chosen here in the context of the highly charged radicalism of 1830s Birmingham for its republican associations . The design was based on the proportions of the Temple of Castor and Pollux in the Roman Forum . Perfect and aloof on a tall , rusticated podium , it marked an entirely new concept in English architecture . It was created as a home for the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival established in 1784 , the purpose of which was to raise funds for the General Hospital , after St Philip 's Church ( later to become a Cathedral ) became too small to hold the festival , and for public meetings . The hall underwent a major renovation between 2002 and 2008 . It now hosts a diverse programme of events including jazz , world , folk , rock , pop and classical concerts , organ recitals , spoken word , dance , family , educational and community performances , as well as annual general meetings , product launches , conferences , dinners , fashion shows , graduation ceremonies and broadcasts .",

  "/wiki/London_Symphony_Orchestra": "The London Symphony Orchestra ( LSO ) , founded in 1904 , is a British Orchestra and the oldest of London 's symphony orchestras . It was set up by a group of players who left Henry Wood 's Queen 's Hall Orchestra because of a new rule requiring players to give the orchestra their exclusive services . The LSO itself later introduced a similar rule for its members . From the outset the LSO was organised on co-operative lines , with all players sharing the profits at the end of each season . This practice continued for the orchestra 's first four decades . The LSO underwent periods of eclipse in the 1930s and 1950s when it was regarded as inferior in quality to new London orchestras , to which it lost players and bookings : the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the London Philharmonic in the 1930s and the Philharmonia and Royal Philharmonic after the Second World War . The profit-sharing principle was abandoned in the post-war era as a condition of receiving public subsidy for the first time . In the 1950s the orchestra debated whether to concentrate on film work at the expense of symphony concerts ; many senior players left when the majority of players rejected the idea . By the 1960s the LSO had recovered its leading position , which it has retained subsequently . In 1966 , to perform alongside it in choral works , the orchestra established the LSO Chorus , originally a mix of professional and amateur singers , later a wholly amateur ensemble . As a self-governing body , the orchestra selects the conductors with whom it works . At some stages in its history it has dispensed with a principal conductor and worked only with guests .",
  "/wiki/Malcolm_Sargent": "Sir Harold Malcolm Watts Sargent ( 29 April 1895 - 3 October 1967 ) was an English conductor , organist and composer widely regarded as Britain 's leading conductor of choral works . The musical ensembles with which he was associated included the Ballets Russes , the Huddersfield Choral Society , the Royal Choral Society , the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company , and the London Philharmonic , Hall\u00e9 , Liverpool Philharmonic , BBC Symphony and Royal Philharmonic orchestras . Sargent was held in high esteem by choirs and instrumental soloists , but because of his high standards and a statement that he made in a 1936 interview disputing musicians ' rights to tenure , his relationship with orchestral players was often uneasy . Despite this , he was co-founder of the London Philharmonic , was the first conductor of the Liverpool Philharmonic as a full-time ensemble , and played an important part in saving the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra from disbandment in the 1960s . As chief conductor of London 's internationally famous summer music festival the Proms from 1948 to 1967 , Sargent was one of the best-known English conductors . When he took over the Proms from their founder , Sir Henry Wood , he and two assistants conducted the two-month season between them . By the time he died , he was assisted by a large international roster of guest conductors . At the outbreak of the Second World War , Sargent turned down an offer of a major musical directorship in Australia and returned to the UK to bring music to as many people as possible as his contribution to national morale . His fame extended beyond the concert hall : to the British public , he was a familiar broadcaster in BBC radio talk shows , and generations of Gilbert and Sullivan devotees have known his recordings of the most popular Savoy Operas . He toured widely throughout the world and was noted for his skill as a conductor , his championship of British composers , and his debonair appearance , which won him the nickname Flash Harry .",

He was one of the dominant figures of the post-war classical music world . Born in Montbrison in the Loire department of France , the son of an engineer , Boulez studied at the Conservatoire de Paris with Olivier Messiaen , and privately with Andr\u00e9e Vaurabourg and Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz . He began his professional career in the late 1940s as music director of the Renaud-Barrault theatre company in Paris . As a young composer in the 1950s he quickly became a leading figure in avant-garde music , playing an important role in the development of integral serialism and controlled chance music . From the 1970s onwards he pioneered the electronic transformation of instrumental music in real time . His tendency to revise earlier compositions meant that his body of completed works was relatively small , but it included pieces regarded by many as landmarks of twentieth-century music , such as Le Marteau sans ma\u00eetre , Pli selon pli and R\u00e9pons . His uncompromising commitment to modernism and the trenchant , polemical tone in which he expressed his views on music led some to criticise him as a dogmatist . In parallel with his activities as a composer Boulez became one of the most prominent conductors of his generation . In a career lasting more than sixty years he held the positions of chief conductor of the New York Philharmonic and the BBC Symphony Orchestra , music director of the Ensemble Intercontemporain and principal guest conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Cleveland Orchestra . He made frequent guest appearances with many of the world 's other great orchestras , including the Vienna Philharmonic , the Berlin Philharmonic and the London Symphony Orchestra . He was particularly known for his performances of the music of the first half of the twentieth century - including Debussy and Ravel , Stravinsky and Bart\u00f3k , and the Second Viennese School - as well as that of his contemporaries , such as Ligeti , Berio and Carter .",

  "/wiki/Southwest_German_Radio_Symphony_Orchestra": "The Southwest German Radio Symphony Orchestra ( also known in English as the SWR Baden-Baden Freiburg Symphony Orchestra and in German as the Sinfonieorchester des S\u00fcdwestrundfunks ) was a German radio orchestra located in the German cities of Baden-Baden and Freiburg . The first incarnation of the orchestra occurred in 1946 , initially with members of the discontinued spa orchestra of the city as the core of players . The revival of the spa orchestra two years later forced the reorganization of the radio orchestra . Subsequently , Hans Rosbaud was hired as the orchestra 's first chief conductor . Rosbaud was already well known as a champion of modern music , and Heinrich Strobel , the music director in charge of the orchestra , shared this sympathy with contemporary music . Thus the orchestra had as its focus performances of modern music . The orchestra was first sponsored by S\u00fcdwestfunk ( SWF ) , a public broadcasting corporation headquartered in Baden-Baden . In 1998 SWF merged into S\u00fcdwestrundfunk ( Southwest Broadcasting ) , which took over responsibility for the orchestra . The orchestra 's final chief conductor was Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Roth , from 2011 to 2016 . Michael Gielen , chief conductor from 1986 to 1999 , had the title of Ehrendirigent ( conductor laureate ) with the orchestra . In June 2012 , the SWR Broadcasting Council voted to approve a measure proposed by SWR Intendant Peter Boudgoust to merge the Southwest German Radio Symphony Orchestra with the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra , for ostensible reasons of budgetary limitations for two separate orchestras affiliated with the SWR .

In 1945 he was named music director of the Munich Philharmonic by United States occupation authorities .

Born in London of Italian and French parentage , Barbirolli grew up in a family of professional musicians . After starting out as a cellist , he was given the chance to conduct , from 1926 with the British National Opera Company , and then with Covent Garden 's touring company . On taking up the conductorship of the Hall\u00e9 he had less opportunity to work in the opera house , but in the 1950s he conducted productions of works by Verdi , Wagner , Gluck , and Puccini at Covent Garden with such success that he was invited to become the company 's permanent musical director , an invitation he declined . Late in his career he made several recordings of operas , of which his 1967 set of Puccini 's Madama Butterfly for EMI is probably the best known . Both in the concert hall and on record , Barbirolli was particularly associated with the music of English composers such as Elgar , Delius and Vaughan Williams .

After serving in the Royal Air Force during World War II , Fricker undertook a period of study with M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Seiber . He held a post as professor of composition at the Royal College of Music in London , and in 1952 he became director of music at Morley College , succeeding Michael Tippett . His Wind Quintet ( 1947 ) attracted widespread attention , and his First String Quartet ( 1947 ) and First Symphony ( 1949 ) were also well received . Four more symphonies ( 1951 , 1960 , 1966 , 1976 ) followed , which are among his most appreciated works . Other works include Paseo for guitar ( 1969 ) , Sinfonia in Memoriam Benjamin Britten ( 1977 ) , two violin concertos ( 1950 , 1954 ) , choral and chamber works ( including the 1956 Sonata for Cello and Piano , recorded twenty years later for L'Oiseau Lyre by Julian Lloyd Webber and John McCabe ) and works for piano and organ . Stylistically his music was significantly different from the mainstream English school of the middle 20th century ; instead of following in the lyrical , folk-song influenced tradition of Holst , Vaughan Williams and others , he wrote music which was chromatic , contrapuntal , and acerbic - more akin to Schoenberg , Bart\u00f3k , and Hindemith than to any of his English contemporaries . Unlike Schoenberg , however , he never abandoned tonality altogether , preferring to work in a dissonant idiom which retained a tonal basis - a position considered to be conservative in the musical milieu of the 1950s and 1960s . Fricker became visiting professor of music at the University of California , Santa Barbara in 1964 . Six years later , he took a permanent position at this university ; he became chairman of the Music Department in 1970 , and was appointed faculty research lecturer in 1979 , the highest academic honor which the university bestows on its faculty .

Leibowitz remained firmly committed to the musical aesthetic of Arnold Schoenberg , and was to some extent sidelined among the French avant-garde in the 1950s , when , under the influence of Leibowitz 's former student , Pierre Boulez and others , the music of Schoenberg 's pupil Anton Webern was adopted as the orthodox model by younger composers . Although his compositional ideas remained strictly serialist , as a conductor Leibowitz had broad sympathies , performing works by composers as diverse as Gluck , Beethoven , Brahms , Offenbach and Ravel , and his repertory extended to include pieces by Gershwin , Puccini , Sullivan and Johann Strauss .",

He was one of the major European composers of the 20th century , and one of the preeminent Polish musicians during his last three decades . He earned many international awards and prizes . His compositions ( of which he was a notable conductor ) include four symphonies , a Concerto for Orchestra , a string quartet , instrumental works , concertos , and orchestral song cycles . During his youth , Lutos\u0142awski studied piano and composition in Warsaw . His early works were influenced by Polish folk music . His style demonstrates a wide range of rich atmospheric textures . He began developing his own characteristic composition techniques in the late 1950s . His music from this period onwards incorporates his own methods of building harmonies from small groups of musical intervals . It also uses aleatoric processes , in which the rhythmic coordination of parts is subject to an element of chance . During World War II , after escaping German capture , Lutos\u0142awski made a living by playing the piano in Warsaw bars . After the war , Stalinist authorities banned his First Symphony for being formalist - allegedly accessible only to an elite .",

He wrote 6 symphonies , 15 operas , 14 ballet scores and a large body of orchestral , chamber , vocal and instrumental works . He became a violinist in the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra , and briefly studied under Czech composer and violinist Josef Suk . After leaving Czechoslovakia in 1923 for Paris , Martin\u016f deliberately withdrew from the Romantic style in which he had been trained . During the 1930s he experimented with expressionism and constructivism , and became an admirer of current European technical developments , exemplified by his orchestral works Half-time and La Bagarre . He also adopted jazz idioms , for instance in his Kitchen Revue ( Kuchy\u0148sk\u00e1 revue ) . In the early 1930s he found his main fount for compositional style : neoclassicism as developed by Stravinsky . He became prolific , quickly composing chamber , orchestral , choral and instrumental works . His Concerto Grosso and the Double Concerto for Two String Orchestras , Piano and Timpani are among his best-known works from this period . Among his operas , Juliette and The Greek Passion are considered the finest . He is compared with Prokofiev and Bart\u00f3k in his innovative incorporation of Central European ethnomusicology into his music . He continued using Bohemian and Moravian folk melodies throughout his oeuvre , for instance in The Opening of the Springs ( Otv\u00edr\u00e1n\u00ed stud\u00e1nek ) .",
