  "/wiki/Josephine_Earp": "Josephine Sarah Sadie Earp ( n\u00e9e Marcus ; 1861 - December 19 , 1944 ) was the common-law wife of Wyatt Earp , a famed Old West lawman and gambler . She met Wyatt in 1881 in the frontier boom town of Tombstone , Arizona Territory , when she was living with Johnny Behan , sheriff of Cochise County , Arizona . Josephine was born in New York to a Prussian Jewish family ; her father was a baker . They moved to San Francisco , where Josephine attended dance school as a girl . When her father had difficulty finding work , the family moved in with her older sister and brother-in-law in a working-class tenement . Josephine ran away , possibly as early as age 14 , and traveled to Arizona , where she said she went looking for adventure . Much of her life from about 1874 to 1882 when she lived in the Arizona Territory is uncertain ; she worked hard to keep this period of her life private , even threatening legal action against writers and movie producers . She may have arrived in Prescott , Arizona as early as 1874 . In a book supposedly about her life , I Married Wyatt Earp ( 1967 ) , she describes events in Arizona that she witnessed that occurred before 1879 , the year she previously claimed to have first arrived in Tombstone ( but see article on Wyatt Earp : this book is not a genuine memoir ) . There is some evidence that she lived in Prescott and Tip Top , Arizona Territory under the assumed name of Sadie Mansfield , and worked as a prostitute from 1874 to 1876 , before becoming ill and returning to San Francisco . The name Sadie Mansfield was also recorded in Tombstone . Researchers have found that the two names share extremely similar characteristics and circumstances .",
