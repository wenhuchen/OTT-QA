It was founded in late 1990 by Jimmy Iovine and Ted Field as a $ 20 million joint venture with Warner Music Group 's Atlantic Records . At the time , it differed from most record companies by giving decision-making authority to its A & R staff and allowing artists and producers complete creative control . It had its first hit records less than a year after it was founded , and achieved profitability in 1993 . Iovine served as chairman and CEO until May 2014 , when he was succeeded by John Janick . In 1992 , Interscope acquired the exclusive rights to market and distribute releases from the hardcore hip hop label Death Row , whose artists included 2Pac , Dr. Dre , and Snoop Dogg , a decision which ultimately put the label at the center of the mid-1990s gangsta rap controversy . As a result , Time Warner , then-owner of Atlantic , severed ties with Interscope by selling its 50 percent stake back to Field and Iovine for $ 115 million in 1995 . In 1996 , 50% of the label was acquired for a reported $ 200 million by MCA Inc. , later known as Universal Music Group . Based in Santa Monica , California , Interscope 's roster includes Eminem , Madonna , Billie Eilish , Gwen Stefani , Imagine Dragons , Summer Walker , Kendrick Lamar , Lady Gaga , Lana Del Rey , Maroon 5 , Selena Gomez , and U2 ."
