  "/wiki/Colombian_white-faced_capuchin": "The Colombian white-faced capuchin ( Cebus capucinus ) , also known as the Colombian white-headed capuchin or Colombian white-throated capuchin , is a medium-sized New World monkey of the family Cebidae , subfamily Cebinae . It is native to the extreme eastern portion of Panama and the extreme north-western portion of South America in western Colombia and northwestern Ecuador . The Colombian white-faced capuchin was one of the many species originally described by Linnaeus in his 18th century work , Systema Naturae . It is a member of the family Cebidae , the family of New World monkeys containing capuchin monkeys and squirrel monkeys . It is the type species for the genus Cebus , the genus that includes all the capuchin monkeys . Until the 21st century the Panamanian white-faced capuchin , Cebus imitator , was considered conspecific with the Colombian white-faced capuchin , as the subspecies C. capucinus imitator . Some primatologists continue to consider the Panamanian and Colombian white-faced capuchins as a single species . In 2012 a study by Boubli , et al demonstrated that C. imitator and C. capucinus split up to 2 million years ago . Although the Panamanian white-faced capuchin is the most well-studied capuchin monkey species , as of 2014 there had been no field studies of the Colombian white-faced capuchin . Two subspecies of Colombian white-faced capuchin are recognized :",

He is known as the father of modern taxonomy . Many of his writings were in Latin , and his name is rendered in Latin as Carolus Linn\u00e6us ( after 1761 Carolus a Linn\u00e9 ) . Linnaeus was born in the countryside of Sm\u00e5land in southern Sweden . He received most of his higher education at Uppsala University and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730 . He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738 , where he studied and also published the first edition of his Systema Naturae in the Netherlands . He then returned to Sweden where he became professor of medicine and botany at Uppsala . In the 1740s , he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals . In the 1750s and 1760s , he continued to collect and classify animals , plants , and minerals , while publishing several volumes . He was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe at the time of his death . Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau sent him the message : Tell him I know no greater man on earth . Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote : With the exception of Shakespeare and Spinoza , I know no one among the no longer living who has influenced me more strongly .",

Native to the forests of Central America , the white-faced capuchin is important to rainforest ecology for its role in dispersing seeds and pollen . Among the best known monkeys , the Panamanian white-faced capuchin is recognized as the typical companion to the organ grinder . In recent years the species has become popular in North American media , particularly in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series . It is a highly intelligent monkey and has been trained to assist paraplegic persons . It is a medium-sized monkey , weighing up to 3.9 kg ( 8.6 lb ) . It is mostly black , but with a pink face and white on much of the front part of the body , giving it its common name . It has a distinctive prehensile tail that is often carried coiled up and is used to help support the monkey when it is feeding beneath a branch . In the wild , the Panamanian white-faced capuchin is versatile , living in many different types of forest , and eating many different types of food , including fruit , other plant material , invertebrates , and small vertebrates . It lives in troops that can exceed 20 animals and include both males and females . It is noted for its tool use , including rubbing plants over its body in an apparent use of herbal medicine , and also using tools as weapons and for getting to food . It is a long-lived monkey , with a maximum recorded age of over 54 years .",

Between 1799 and 1804 , Humboldt travelled extensively in the Americas , exploring and describing them for the first time from a modern scientific point of view . His description of the journey was written up and published in an enormous set of volumes over 21 years . Humboldt was one of the first people to propose that the lands bordering the Atlantic Ocean were once joined ( South America and Africa in particular ) . Humboldt resurrected the use of the word cosmos from the ancient Greek and assigned it to his multivolume treatise , Kosmos , in which he sought to unify diverse branches of scientific knowledge and culture .

It is found in northern Brazil , Guyana , French Guiana , Suriname , Venezuela and possibly northern Colombia . The genus Cebus is divided into several different species . However , taxonomists argue over the specific divisions within the genus , which are uncertain and controversial . Cebus olivaceus is known to dwell in tall , primary forest and travel over long distances during the day . These primates are medium-sized monkeys with distinctive wedge cap markings on their head and slightly longer limbs than other capuchins for jumping through the forest canopy . Similar to other capuchin monkeys , the diet of wedge-capped capuchin primarily consists of fruits , invertebrates , other plant parts , and on rare occasions small vertebrates . They have also been known to rub millipedes against their fur , especially in the rainy seasons , as a potential means of mosquito repellent . Although this species is classified as an animal of least concern by IUCN Red List of Threatened Species , it falls prey to many predators in South America ranging from vultures to jaguars . Cebus olivaceus is a polygamous species that lives in groups anywhere from 5-30 individuals , with a female biased sex ratios . The group is organized according to a pre-determined hierarchal system of dominance for both males and females .
