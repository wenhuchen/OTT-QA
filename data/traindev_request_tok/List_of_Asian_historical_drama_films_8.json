Myanmar is bordered by Bangladesh and India to its northwest , China to its northeast , Laos and Thailand to its east and southeast , and the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal to its south and southwest . With a size of 676,578 square kilometres ( 261,228 square miles ) , Myanmar is the largest of the Mainland Southeast Asian states by area . As of 2017 , the population is about 54 million . Its capital city is Naypyidaw , and its largest city is Yangon ( Rangoon ) . Myanmar has been a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) since 1997 . Early civilisations in Myanmar included the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu city-states in Upper Burma and the Mon kingdoms in Lower Burma . In the 9th century , the Bamar people entered the upper Irrawaddy valley and , following the establishment of the Pagan Kingdom in the 1050s , the Burmese language , culture and Theravada Buddhism slowly became dominant in the country . The Pagan Kingdom fell due to the Mongol invasions and several warring states emerged . In the 16th century , reunified by the Taungoo dynasty , the country was for a brief period the largest empire in the history of Mainland Southeast Asia . The early 19th century Konbaung dynasty ruled over an area that included modern Myanmar and briefly controlled Manipur and Assam as well . The British East India Company seized control of the administration of Myanmar after three Anglo-Burmese Wars in the 19th century and the country became a British colony .",

It was the final of three wars fought in the 19th century between the Burmese and the British . The war saw the loss of sovereignty of an independent Burma under the Konbaung dynasty , whose rule had already been reduced to the territory known as Upper Burma , the region of Lower Burma having been annexed by the British in 1853 , as a result of the Second Anglo-Burmese War . Following the war , Burma came under the rule of the British Raj as a province of India . In 1937 , the British governed Burma as a separate colony .

It created the second-largest empire in Burmese history and continued the administrative reforms begun by the Toungoo dynasty , laying the foundations of the modern state of Burma . The reforms , however , proved insufficient to stem the advance of the British , who defeated the Burmese in all three Anglo-Burmese wars over a six-decade span ( 1824-1885 ) and ended the millennium-old Burmese monarchy in 1885 . An expansionist dynasty , the Konbaung kings waged campaigns against Manipur , Arakan , Assam , the Mon kingdom of Pegu and the Siamese kingdom of Ayutthaya , thus establishing the Third Burmese Empire .

The four-year struggle involved sporadic but bloody armed conflict , internal Indonesian political and communal upheavals , and two major international diplomatic interventions . Dutch military forces ( and , for a while , the forces of the World War II Allies ) were able to control the major towns , cities and industrial assets in Republican heartlands on Java and Sumatra but could not control the countryside . By 1949 , international pressure on the Netherlands and the partial military stalemate became such that it recognised Indonesian independence . The revolution marked the end of the colonial administration of the Dutch East Indies , except for Netherlands New Guinea . It also significantly changed ethnic castes as well as reducing the power of many of the local rulers ( raja ) . It did not significantly improve the economic or political fortune of the majority of the population , although a few Indonesians were able to gain a larger role in commerce .",

  "/wiki/The_Quiet_American_(2002_film)": "The Quiet American is a 2002 film adaptation of Graham Greene 's bestselling novel set in Vietnam , The Quiet American . It was directed by Phillip Noyce and starred Michael Caine , Brendan Fraser , and Do Thi Hai Yen . The 2002 version of The Quiet American , in contrast to the earlier 1958 film version , depicted Greene 's original ending and treatment of the principal American character , Pyle . Like the novel , the film illustrates Pyle 's moral culpability in arranging terrorist actions aimed at the French colonial government and the Viet Minh . Going beyond Greene 's original work , the film used a montage ending with superimposed images of American soldiers from the intervening decades of the Vietnam War . Miramax paid $ 5.5 million for the rights to distribute the film in North America and some other territories , but it shelved the film for a year due to the September 11 attacks and the film 's unpatriotic message . The film finally received an Oscar qualification release in November 2002 and went on to gross US $ 12.9 million in limited theatrical release in the United States . The film received positive reviews from critics and Michael Caine was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor .",
  "/wiki/CIA": "The Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the United States , tasked with gathering , processing , and analyzing national security information from around the world , primarily through the use of human intelligence ( HUMINT ) . As one of the principal members of the United States Intelligence Community ( IC ) , the CIA reports to the Director of National Intelligence and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the President and Cabinet of the United States . Unlike the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , which is a domestic security service , the CIA has no law enforcement function and is mainly focused on overseas intelligence gathering , with only limited domestic intelligence collection . Though it is not the only agency of the federal government of the United States specializing in HUMINT , the CIA serves as the national manager for coordination of HUMINT activities across the U.S. intelligence community . Moreover , the CIA is the only agency authorized by law to carry out and oversee covert action at the behest of the President . It exerts foreign political influence through its tactical divisions , such as the Special Activities Center . The CIA was also instrumental in establishing intelligence services in several U.S. allied countries , such as Germany 's BND . Before the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 , the CIA Director concurrently served as the head of the Intelligence Community ; today , the CIA is organized under the Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) . Despite transferring some of its powers to the DNI , the CIA has grown in size as a result of the September 11 attacks . In 2013 , The Washington Post reported that in the fiscal year 2010 , the CIA had the largest budget of all IC agencies , exceeding previous estimates . The CIA has increasingly expanded its role , including covert paramilitary operations . One of its largest divisions , the Information Operations Center ( IOC ) , has shifted focus from counter-terrorism to offensive cyber-operations .",

  "/wiki/Singapore_in_Malaysia": "Singapore was one of the 14 states of Malaysia from 1963 to 1965 . Malaysia was formed on 16 September 1963 in the merger of the Federation of Malaya with the former British colonies of North Borneo , Sarawak and Singapore . This marked the end of a 144-year British rule in Singapore which began with the founding of modern Singapore by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819 . The union was unstable due to distrust and ideological differences between leaders of Singapore and of the federal government of Malaysia . They often disagreed about economics , finance and politics . In the Malaysian general election of 1964 , the political party in power in the federal government , the United Malays National Organisation ( UMNO ) , saw the participation of the Singapore-based People 's Action Party ( PAP ) as a threat to its Malay-based political system . Also , major race riots that year involved the majority Chinese community and the Malay community in Singapore . During a 1965 Singaporean by-election , UMNO supported the opposition , Barisan Sosialis . In 1965 , Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman decided to expel Singapore from the Federation , and the Parliament voted this on 9 August 1965 . Singapore and Malaysia became distinct countries in 1965 . However , they have continued to co-operate in commerce .",

This riot occurred during the procession to celebrate Mawlid ( the birthday of the Muslim prophet Muhammad ) . Twenty-five thousand majority-Muslim Malay people had gathered at the Padang . Aside from the recital of some prayers and engagement in some religious activities , a series of fiery speeches was also made by the organisers , instigating racial tensions . During the procession , clashes occurred between the Malays and the Chinese which eventually led to a riot spreading to other areas . There are multiple accounts and reports on how the riots began . The riots are seen as pivotal leading up to the independence of Singapore , for fear from the government of Malaysia ( of which Singapore was briefly a part ) that Malay-Chinese ethnic violence would spread in the rest of the newly federated country . The racial riot played a pivotal role in shaping Singapore 's future policies which centred on the principles of multiracialism and multiculturalism .",
  "/wiki/Indonesia\u2013Malaysia_confrontation": "The Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation or Borneo confrontation ( also known by its Indonesian/Malay name , Konfrontasi ) was a violent conflict from 1963-66 that stemmed from Indonesia 's opposition to the creation of Malaysia . The creation of Malaysia was the amalgamation of the Federation of Malaya ( now West Malaysia ) , Singapore and the crown colony/British protectorates of North Borneo and Sarawak ( collectively known as British Borneo , now East Malaysia ) in September 1963 . Vital precursors to the conflict included Indonesia 's policy of confrontation against Netherlands New Guinea from March-August 1962 and the Brunei Revolt in December 1962 . The confrontation was an undeclared war with most of the action occurring in the border area between Indonesia and East Malaysia on the island of Borneo ( known as Kalimantan in Indonesia ) . The conflict was characterised by restrained and isolated ground combat , set within tactics of low-level brinkmanship . Combat was usually conducted by company- or platoon-sized operations on either side of the border . Indonesia 's campaign of infiltrations into Borneo sought to exploit the ethnic and religious diversity in Sabah and Sarawak compared to that of Malaya and Singapore , with the intent of unravelling the proposed state of Malaysia . The jungle terrain of Borneo and lack of roads straddling the Malaysia-Indonesia border forced both Indonesian and Commonwealth forces to conduct long foot patrols . Both sides relied on light infantry operations and air transport , although Commonwealth forces enjoyed the advantage of better helicopter deployment and resupply to forward operating bases . Rivers were also used as a method of transport and infiltration . Although combat operations were primarily conducted by ground forces , airborne forces played a vital support role and naval forces ensured the security of the sea flanks . The British provided most of the defensive effort , although Malaysian forces steadily increased their contributions , and there were periodic contributions from Australian and New Zealand forces within the combined Far East Strategic Reserve stationed then in West Malaysia and Singapore .",

  "/wiki/Transition_to_the_New_Order": "Indonesia 's transition to the New Order in the mid-1960s , ousted the country 's first president , Sukarno , after 22 years in the position . One of the most tumultuous periods in the country 's modern history , it was the commencement of Suharto 's 31-year presidency . Described as the great dhalang ( puppet master ) , Sukarno drew power from balancing the opposing and increasingly antagonistic forces of the army and Indonesian Communist Party ( PKI ) . By 1965 , the PKI extensively penetrated all levels of government and gained influence at the expense of the army . On 30 September 1965 , six of the military 's most senior officers were killed in action ( generally labelled an attempted coup ) by the so-called 30 September Movement , a group from within the armed forces . Within a few hours , Major General Suharto mobilised forces under his command and took control of Jakarta . Anti-communists , initially following the army 's lead , went on a violent purge of communists throughout the country , killing an estimated half a million people and destroying the PKI , which was officially blamed for the crisis . The politically weakened Sukarno was forced to transfer key political and military powers to General Suharto , who had become head of the armed forces . In March 1967 , the Indonesian parliament ( MPRS ) named General Suharto acting president . He was formally appointed president one year later .

The name had been coined in the 1950s by Norodom Sihanouk as a blanket term for the Cambodian left .

Despite a massive American bombing campaign against them , the Khmer Rouge won the Cambodian Civil War when they captured the Cambodian capital and overthrew the Khmer Republic in 1975 . Following their victory , the Khmer Rouge who were led by Pol Pot , Nuon Chea , Ieng Sary , Son Sen , and Khieu Samphan immediately set about forcibly evacuating the country 's major cities and in 1976 they renamed the country Democratic Kampuchea . The Khmer Rouge regime was highly autocratic , xenophobic , paranoid , and repressive . A large number of deaths resulted from the regime 's social engineering policies and the Maha Lout Ploh , an imitation of the Great Leap Forward of China which caused the Great Chinese Famine . : Its attempts at agricultural reform through collectivisation led to widespread famine while its insistence on absolute self-sufficiency even in the supply of medicine led to the death of many thousands from treatable diseases such as malaria . The Khmer Rouge regime murdered hundreds of thousands of their perceived political opponents , and its racist emphasis on national purity included several genocides of Cambodian minorities .
