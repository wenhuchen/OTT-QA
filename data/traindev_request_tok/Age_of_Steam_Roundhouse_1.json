  "/wiki/ALCO_S-2_and_S-4": "The ALCO S2 and S4 were diesel electric switchers produced by ALCO and Canadian licensee Montreal Locomotive Works ( MLW ) . These two locomotive models differed only in that the earlier S-2 had ALCo # Blunt bogie trucks and the later S-4 had EMD # AARA bogie trucks . Both were powered by ALCO 539 turbocharged , 6-cylinder diesels . The S-2 was built between August 1940 and June 1950 , with a total of 1502 completed , while the S-4 was constructed between June 1949 and August 1957 ( MLW until 1957 ) with total sales of 797 . Canadian production of the S-4 started more than a year before U S production of the S-4 . ALCO did not start building the S-4 until August 1950 . A modified version , the S-7 , was built by MLW only ; 29 were built between June and August 1957 .",

  "/wiki/Norfolk_and_Western_Railway": "The Norfolk and Western Railway was a US class I railroad , formed by more than 200 railroad mergers between 1838 and 1982 . It was headquartered in Roanoke , Virginia , for most of its existence . Its motto was Precision Transportation ; it had a variety of nicknames , including King Coal and British Railway of America even though the N & W had mostly articulated steam on its roster . During the Civil War , the N & W was the biggest railroad in the south and moved most of the products with their steam locomotives to help the south the best way they could . The N & W was famous for manufacturing its own steam locomotives , which were built at the Roanoke Shops , as well as its own hopper cars . In 1960 , N & W became the last major class I railroad using steam locomotives ; the last remaining Y class 2-8-8-2s would not be retired until 1964 and 1965 . By 1965 , steam on class I railroads was gone but steam was n't gone on class II railroads until 1974 and class III and mining railroads did not retire their steam locomotives from their active roster until 1983 . By 1983 , steam in America on class I , II , III , and mining railroads had finally closed the chapter on America 's 150 years of steam from 1830 - 1983 . In December 1959 , the N & W merged with the Virginian Railway ( reporting mark VGN ) , a longtime rival in the Pocahontas coal region . By 1970 , other mergers with the Nickel Plate Road and Wabash formed a system that operated of road on of track from North Carolina to New York and from Virginia to Iowa . In 1980 , the N & W teamed with the Southern Railway , another profitable carrier and created the Norfolk Southern Corporation holding company by merging its business operations with the business operations of the Southern Railway .

  "/wiki/Baltimore_and_Ohio_Railroad": "The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ( reporting marks B & O , BO ) was the first common carrier railroad and the oldest railroad in the United States , with its first section opening in 1830 . Merchants from the city of Baltimore , which had benefitted to some extent from the construction of the National Road early in the century , wanted to continue to compete for trade with trans-Appalachian settlers with the newly constructed Erie Canal ( which served New York City ) , another canal being proposed by Pennsylvania ( which would have connected Philadelphia and Pittsburgh ) , the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal ( which connected to the nation 's capital , Washington , D.C. ) , and the James River Canal , which directed traffic toward Richmond and Norfolk , Virginia . At first the B & O was located entirely in the state of Maryland , its original line extending from the port of Baltimore west to Sandy Hook . Because of competition with the C & O canal for trade with coal fields in western Maryland , it could not use the C & O right of way . Thus , to continue westward while minimizing high-cost track through the Appalachian Mountains , the B & O chose to cross the Potomac River into Virginia ( now West Virginia ) , near the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers . From there track continued through Virginia from Harpers Ferry to a point just west of the junction of Patterson Creek and the North Branch Potomac River , where it crossed back into Maryland to reach Cumberland , the terminus of the National Road . From there the B & O extended to the Ohio River at Wheeling and a few years later also to Parkersburg , West Virginia ( below rapids which made navigation difficult during parts of the year ) . It proved crucial to Union success during the American Civil War , although the conflict also caused considerable damage ( and repair costs ) . After the war 's end , the B & O consolidated several feeder lines in Virginia and West Virginia , as well as expanded westward into Ohio ( including a junction at Portsmouth ) , Indiana and Illinois . B & O advertising later carried the motto : Linking 13 Great States with the Nation . After several mergers , the B & O became part of the CSX Transportation ( CSX ) network . The B & O also includes the Leiper Railroad , the first permanent horse-drawn railroad in the U.S. At the end of 1970 , the B & O operated 5,552 miles of road and 10,449 miles of track , not including the Staten Island Rapid Transit ( SIRT ) or the Reading and its subsidiaries .",
