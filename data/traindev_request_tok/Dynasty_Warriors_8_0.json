  "/wiki/Cao_Wei": "Wei ( 220-266 ) , also known as Cao Wei , was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period ( 220-280 ) . With its capital initially located at Xuchang , and thereafter Luoyang , the state was established by Cao Pi in 220 , based upon the foundations laid by his father , Cao Cao , towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty . The name Wei first became associated with Cao Cao when he was named the Duke of Wei by the Eastern Han government in 213 , and became the name of the state when Cao Pi proclaimed himself emperor in 220 . Historians often add the prefix Cao to distinguish it from other Chinese states known as Wei , such as Wei of the Warring States period and Northern Wei of the Northern and Southern dynasties . The authority of the ruling Cao family dramatically weakened in the aftermath of the deposal and execution of Cao Shuang and his siblings , the former being one of the regents for the third Wei emperor , Cao Fang , with state authority gradually falling into the hands of Sima Yi , another Wei regent , and his family , from 249 onwards . The last Wei emperors would remain largely as puppet rulers under the control of the Simas until Sima Yi 's grandson , Sima Yan , forced the last Wei ruler , Cao Huan , to abdicate the throne and established the Jin dynasty .",

It previously existed from 220-222 as a vassal kingdom nominally under Cao Wei , its rival state , but declared independence from Wei and became a sovereign state in 222 . It became an empire in 229 after its founding ruler , Sun Quan , declared himself emperor . Its name was derived from the place it was based in - the Jiangnan ( Yangtze River Delta ) region , which was also historically known as Wu . It was referred to as Dong Wu ( Eastern Wu ) or Sun Wu by historians to distinguish it from other Chinese historical states with similar names which were also located in that region , such as the Wu state in the Spring and Autumn period and the Wuyue kingdom in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period . It was called Eastern Wu because it occupied most of eastern China in the Three Kingdoms period , and Sun Wu because the family name of its rulers was Sun . During its existence , Wu 's capital was at Jianye ( present-day Nanjing , Jiangsu ) , but at times it was also at Wuchang ( \u6b66\u660c ; present-day Ezhou , Hubei ) .",

The state was based in the area around present-day Sichuan and Chongqing , which was historically known as Shu after an earlier state in Sichuan named Shu . Shu Han 's founder Liu Bei had named his state Han as he considered it the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty , while Shu is added to the name as a geographical prefix to differentiate it from the many Han states throughout Chinese history .",

It was founded by Sima Yan , son of Sima Zhao , who was made the King of Jin and posthumously declared one of the founders of the dynasty , along with Sima Zhao 's older brother Sima Shi and father Sima Yi . It followed the Three Kingdoms period ( 220-280 AD ) , which ended with the conquest of Eastern Wu by Jin , culminating in the reunification of China . There are two main divisions in the history of the dynasty . The Western Jin ( 266-316 ) was established as a successor state to Cao Wei after Sima Yan usurped the throne and had its capital at Luoyang and later Chang'an ( modern Xi'an ) ; Western Jin reunited China in 280 but fairly shortly thereafter fell into a succession crisis , the War of the Eight Princes and suffered from the invasions instigated by the Five Barbarians ( Wu Hu ) . The rebels and invaders began to establish new self-proclaimed states along the Yellow River valley in 304 , inaugurating the Sixteen Kingdoms era . These states immediately began fighting each other and the Jin Empire , leading to the second division of the dynasty , the Eastern Jin ( 317-420 ) , when Sima Rui moved the capital to Jiankang ( modern Nanjing ) . The Eastern Jin dynasty was eventually overthrown by Liu Yu and replaced with the Liu Song in 420 .",

However , his feelings of alienation and perception of Liu Zhang as an incompetent governor eventually led him to betray Liu Zhang and defect to Liu Bei in 211 . Between 211 and 214 , Fa Zheng assisted Liu Bei in overcoming Liu Zhang and seizing control of Yi Province , and became one of Liu Bei 's most trusted advisers .

  "/wiki/Sima_Zhao": "Sima Zhao ( pronunciation ( help\u00b7info ) ) ( 211 - 6 September 265 ) , courtesy name Zishang , was a Chinese military general , politician , and regent of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China . Sima Zhao capably maintained control of Wei , which had been seized by his father Sima Yi and previously maintained by his older brother Sima Shi , successfully crushing all internal opposition in the form of dissent and rebellion . In 263 , despite opposition , he decided to take advantage of the present weakness in Shu Han to the west and launched an invasion against it , which eventually managed to convince its emperor , Liu Shan , towards formally surrendering , tipping the decades-long established balance of power decisively in Wei 's favor . Towards the end of the campaign , he had himself created the Duke of Jin and accepted the Nine bestowments - a step that put him closer to usurpation of the throne - although he never actually ascended the throne , having further styled himself the King of Jin in 264 , and then died in 265 . His military credit and successful grip on the political scene helped to set up the plot of overthrowing Wei by his son , Sima Yan , who usurped the Wei throne and proclaimed the Jin dynasty with himself as its emperor in 266 . After the establishment of Jin , Sima Yan posthumously honoured his father as Emperor Wen of Jin ( \u6649\u6587\u5e1d ) , with the temple name of Taizu ( \u592a\u7956 ) . A Chinese idiom involving and inspired by Sima Zhao states that Everyone on the street knows what 's in Sima Zhao 's mind ( \u53f8\u99ac\u662d\u4e4b\u5fc3 , \u8def\u4eba\u7686\u77e5 ) , meaning that a person 's supposed hidden intention ( in this case , usurping the throne ) is so well known that it is not really hidden .

A descendant of the general Ma Yuan , Ma Chao was the eldest son of Ma Teng , a prominent warlord in Liang Province ( covering parts of northwestern China ) . In 211 , he formed a coalition with Han Sui and other northwestern warlords and revolted against the Han central government , which was led by the warlord Cao Cao . The coalition broke up after losing the Battle of Tong Pass against Cao Cao 's forces . Ma Chao initially retreated , but later returned to attack and seize control of Liang Province by killing the provincial inspector Wei Kang and forcing Wei Kang 's subordinates to submit to him . About a year after Ma Chao started his uprising , Emperor Xian issued an imperial decree ordering the execution of Ma Chao 's family members , who were in Ye city at the time . In the meantime , Wei Kang 's subordinates , led by Zhao Ang , Yang Fu and others , rebelled against Ma Chao and forced him out of Liang Province . Ma Chao retreated to Hanzhong Commandery , where he borrowed troops from the warlord Zhang Lu , and returned to attack Liang Province but was ultimately defeated and driven back . Ma Chao took shelter under Zhang Lu for a while until around 214 , when he heard that the warlord Liu Bei was fighting for control over Yi Province ( covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing ) with Yi Province 's governor , Liu Zhang . He defected to Liu Bei 's side and assisted Liu Bei in capturing Yi Province from Liu Zhang .

As the Sima clan became more powerful and established themselves as the de facto rulers of Wei , Zhuge Dan feared that he would end up slain like Wang Ling and Guanqiu Jian - the leaders of the first two rebellions - so he started the third rebellion against Sima Zhao , who succeeded Sima Shi as regent of Wei in 255 .

He inherited control of the warlord regime established by his elder brother , Sun Ce , in 200 . He declared formal independence and ruled from 222 to 229 as the King of Wu and from 229 to 252 as the Emperor of Wu . Unlike his rivals Cao Cao and Liu Bei , Sun Quan was much younger than they were and governed his state mostly separate of politics and ideology . He is sometimes portrayed as neutral considering he adopted a flexible foreign policy between his two rivals with the goal of pursuing the greatest interests for the country . Sun Quan was born while his father Sun Jian served as the adjutant of Xiapi County . After Sun Jian 's death in the early 190s , he and his family lived at various cities on the lower Yangtze River , until Sun Ce carved out a warlord regime in the Jiangdong region , based on his own followers and a number of local clan allegiances . When Sun Ce was assassinated by the retainers of Xu Gong in 200 , the 18-year-old Sun Quan inherited the lands southeast of the Yangtze River from his brother . His administration proved to be relatively stable in those early years as Sun Jian and Sun Ce 's most senior officers , such as Zhou Yu , Zhang Zhao , Zhang Hong , and Cheng Pu supported the succession . Thus throughout the 200s , Sun Quan , under the tutelage of his able advisers , continued to build up his strength along the Yangtze River .
