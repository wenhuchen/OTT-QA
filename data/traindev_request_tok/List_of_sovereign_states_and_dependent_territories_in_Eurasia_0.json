Afghanistan is bordered by Pakistan to the east and south ; [ b ] Iran to the west ; Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , and Tajikistan to the north ; and China to the northeast . Occupying 652,000 square kilometers ( 252,000 sq mi ) , it is a mountainous country with plains in the north and southwest . Kabul is the capital and largest city . The population is 32 million , mostly composed of ethnic Pashtuns , Tajiks , Hazaras and Uzbeks . Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the Middle Paleolithic Era , and the country 's strategic location along the Silk Road connected it to the cultures of the Middle East and other parts of Asia . The land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed numerous military campaigns , including those by Alexander the Great , Mauryas , Muslim Arabs , Mongols , British , Soviets , and by the United States with allied countries . The land also served as the source from which the Kushans , Hephthalites , Samanids , Saffarids , Ghaznavids , Ghorids , Khaljis , Mughals , Hotaks , Durranis , and others have risen to form major empires . The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan began with the Hotak and Durrani dynasties in the 18th century . In the late 19th century , Afghanistan became a buffer state in the Great Game between British India and the Russian Empire . Its border with British India , the Durand Line , was formed in 1893 but it is not recognized by the Afghan government and it has led to strained relations with Pakistan since the latter 's independence in 1947 . Following the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919 the country was free of foreign influence , eventually becoming a monarchy under Amanullah Khan , until almost 50 years later when Zahir Shah was overthrown and a republic was established .",

It is a pluricentric language predominantly spoken and used officially within Iran , Afghanistan and Tajikistan in three mutually intelligible standard varieties , namely Iranian Persian , Dari Persian ( officially named Dari since 1958 ) and Tajiki Persian ( officially named Tajik since the Soviet era ) . It is also spoken natively in the Tajik variety by a significant population within Uzbekistan , as well as within other regions with a Persianate history in the cultural sphere of Greater Iran . It is written officially within Iran and Afghanistan in the Persian alphabet , a derivation of the Arabic script , and within Tajikistan in the Tajik alphabet , a derivation of Cyrillic . The Persian language is a continuation of Middle Persian , the official religious and literary language of the Sasanian Empire ( 224-651 CE ) , itself a continuation of Old Persian , which was used in the Achaemenid Empire ( 550-330 BC ) . It originated in the region of Fars ( Persia ) in southwestern Iran . Its grammar is similar to that of many European languages . Throughout history , Persian has been a prestigious cultural language used by various empires in Western Asia , Central Asia , and South Asia . Old Persian written works are attested in Old Persian cuneiform on several inscriptions from between the 6th and the 4th centuries BC , and Middle Persian literature is attested in Aramaic-derived scripts ( Pahlavi and Manichaean ) on inscriptions from the time of the Parthian Empire and in books centered in Zoroastrian and Manichaean scriptures from between the 3rd to the 10th century AD . New Persian literature began to flourish after the Arab conquest of Iran with its earliest records from the 9th century , since then adopting the Arabic script . Persian was the first language to break through the monopoly of Arabic on writing in the Muslim world , with the writing of Persian poetry developed as a court tradition in many eastern courts . Some of the famous works of medieval Persian literature are the Shahnameh of Ferdowsi , the works of Rumi , the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam , the Panj Ganj of Nizami Ganjavi , the Div\u0101n of Hafez , The Conference of the Birds by Attar of Nishapur , and the miscellanea of Gulistan and Bustan by Saadi Shirazi .",

It is also a municipality , forming part of the greater Kabul Province , and divided into 22 districts . According to estimates in 2019 , the population of Kabul is 4.114 million , which includes all the major ethnic groups of Afghanistan . Afghanistan 's only city with a population of over 1 million , Kabul serves as its political , cultural and economical center . Rapid urbanization had made Kabul the world 's 75th largest city . Kabul is located high up in a narrow valley between the Hindu Kush mountains , with an elevation of 1,790 metres ( 5,873 ft ) making it one of the highest capitals in the world . The city is said to be over 3,500 years old , mentioned since at least the time of the Achaemenid Empire . Located at crossroads in Asia - roughly halfway between Istanbul in the west and Hanoi in the east - it is in a strategic location along the trade routes of South and Central Asia , and a key location of the ancient Silk Road . It has been part of the Achaemenids followed by the Seleucids , Mauryans , Kushans , Kabul Shahis , Saffarids , Samanids , Ghaznavids , Ghurids , Khwarazmians , Qarlughids , Khaljis , Timurids , Mughals , and Hotaks , until finally becoming part of the Durrani Empire ( also known as the Afghan Empire ) in 1747 . Kabul became the capital of Afghanistan in 1776 , during the reign of Timur Shah Durrani , the son of Ahmad Shah Durrani . In the early 19th century , the British occupied the city , but after establishing foreign relations , they were compelled to withdraw all forces from Afghanistan . The city was occupied by the Soviets in 1979 but they too abandoned it after the 1988 Geneva Accords were signed .",

It shares land borders with Montenegro to the northwest , Kosovo [ a ] to the northeast , North Macedonia to the east , Greece to the south and maritime borders with Greece , Montenegro and Italy to the west . Geographically , the country displays varied climatic , geological , hydrological and morphological conditions , defined in an area of 28,748 km2 ( 11,100 sq mi ) . It possesses remarkable diversity with the landscape ranging from the snow-capped mountains in the Albanian Alps as well as the Korab , Skanderbeg , Pindus and Ceraunian Mountains to the hot and sunny coasts of the Albanian Adriatic and Ionian Sea along the Mediterranean Sea . Historically , the country has been inhabited by numerous civilisations such as the Illyrians , Thracians , Ancient Greeks , Romans , Byzantines , Venetians and Ottomans . The Albanians established the autonomous Principality of Arb\u00ebr in the 12th century . The Kingdom of Albania and Principality of Albania formed between the 13th and 14th centuries . Prior to the Ottoman conquest of Albania in the 15th century , the Albanian resistance to Ottoman expansion into Europe led by Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg won them acclaim over most of Europe . Between the 18th and 19th centuries , Albanians gathered both spiritual and intellectual strength which conclusively led to the Albanian Renaissance . After the defeat of the Ottomans in the Balkan Wars , the modern nation state of Albania declared independence in 1912 . In the 20th century , the Kingdom of Albania was invaded by Italy which formed Greater Albania before becoming a protectorate of Nazi Germany . Enver Hoxha formed Communist Albania after the Second World War and launched the Albanians on a path of oppression and decades of isolation .",

With about 7.5 million speakers , it comprises an independent branch within the Indo-European languages and is not closely related to any other language . First attested in the 15th century , it is the last Indo-European branch to appear in written records . This is one of the reasons why its still-unknown origin has long been a matter of dispute among linguists and historians . Albanian is considered to be the descendant of one of the Paleo-Balkan languages of antiquity . For more historical and geographical reasons than specifically linguistic ones , there are various modern historians and linguists who believe that the Albanian language may have descended from a southern Illyrian dialect spoken in much the same region in classical times . Alternative hypotheses hold that Albanian may have descended from Thracian or Daco-Moesian , other ancient languages spoken farther east than Illyrian . Not enough is known of these languages to completely prove or disprove the various hypotheses . The two main Albanian dialects , Gheg and Tosk which are primarily distinguished by phonological differences , are mutually intelligible , with Gheg spoken in the north and Tosk spoken in the south of the Shkumbin river . Their characteristics in the treatment of the native and loanwords from other languages , have led to the conclusion that the dialectal split occurred after Christianisation of the region ( 4th century AD ) and at the time of the Slavic migration to the Balkans , with the historic boundary between Gheg and Tosk being the Shkumbin which straddled the Jire\u010dek line . Standard Albanian is a standardised form of spoken Albanian based on the Tosk dialect . It is the official language of Albania and Kosovo [ a ] and a co-official language in North Macedonia as well as a minority language of Italy , Montenegro , Romania and Serbia .",

The city was awarded the title of the European Youth Capital of 2022 . Tirana is located in the center of Albania and is enclosed by mountains and hills with Mount Dajt elevating on the east and a slight valley on the northwest overlooking the Adriatic Sea in the distance . Due to its location within the Plain of Tirana and the close proximity to the Mediterranean Sea , the city is particularly influenced by a Mediterranean seasonal climate . It is among the wettest and sunniest cities in Europe , with 2,544 hours of sun per year . Tirana flourished as a city in 1614 but the region that today corresponds to the city 's territory has been continuously inhabited since the Iron Age . The city 's territory was inhabited by several Illyrian tribes but had no importance within Illyria . Indeed , it was annexed by Rome and became an integral part of the Roman Empire following the Illyrian Wars . The heritage of that period is still evident and represented by the Mosaics of Tirana . Later , in the 5th and 6th centuries , a Paleochristian basilica was built around this site . After the Roman Empire split into East and West in the 4th century , its successor the Byzantine Empire took control over most of Albania , and built the Petrel\u00eb Castle in the reign of Justinian I . The city was fairly unimportant until the 20th century , when the Congress of Lushnj\u00eb proclaimed it as Albania 's capital , after the Albanian Declaration of Independence in 1912 .",

Believed to have been created by Charlemagne , Andorra was ruled by the count of Urgell until 988 , when it was transferred to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell . The present principality was formed by a charter in 1278 . It is known as a principality as it is a diarchy headed by two princes : the Catholic bishop of Urgell in Catalonia , Spain , and the president of the French Republic .

It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire , as did all Romance languages . French evolved from Gallo-Romance , the spoken Latin in Gaul , and more specifically in Northern Gaul . Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders . Today , owing to France 's past overseas expansion , there are numerous French-based creole languages , most notably Haitian Creole . A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French . French is an official language in 29 countries across multiple continents , most of which are members of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie ( OIF ) , the community of 84 countries which share the official use or teaching of French .

It is a global language , the world 's second-most spoken native language , after Mandarin Chinese , and the world 's fourth-most spoken language , after Mandarin Chinese , English and Hindi . Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages , which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century . The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century , and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo , a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile , in the 13th century . Beginning in 1492 , the Spanish language was taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire , most notably to the Americas , as well as territories in Africa , Oceania and the Philippines . A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist Mario Pei , analyzing the degree of difference from a language 's parent ( Latin , in the case of Romance languages ) by comparing phonology , inflection , syntax , vocabulary , and intonation , indicated the following percentages ( the higher the percentage , the greater the distance from Latin ) : In the case of Spanish , it is one of the closest Romance languages to Latin ( 20% distance ) , only behind Sardinian ( 8% distance ) and Italian ( 12% distance ) . Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin , including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek . Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date , having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula . With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin , this language makes up the second greatest vocabulary source after Latin itself . It has also been influenced by Basque , Iberian , Celtiberian , Visigothic , and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages . Additionally , it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages , particularly other Romance languages - French , Italian , Andalusi Romance , Portuguese , Galician , Catalan , Occitan , and Sardinian - as well as from Quechua , Nahuatl , and other indigenous languages of the Americas .

The contemporary name \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576 ( Hayastan ) became popular in the Middle Ages by addition of the Persian suffix -stan ( place ) . [ citation needed ] . However the origins of the name Hayastan trace back to much earlier dates and were first attested in circa 5th century in the works of Agathangelos , Faustus of Byzantium , Ghazar Parpetsi , Koryun , and Sebeos . The name has traditionally been derived from Hayk ( \u0540\u0561\u0575\u056f ) , the legendary patriarch of the Armenians and a great-great-grandson of Noah , who , according to the 5th-century AD author Moses of Chorene ( Movsis Khorenatsi ) , defeated the Babylonian king Bel in 2492 BC and established his nation in the Ararat region . The further origin of the name is uncertain . It is also further postulated that the name Hay comes from one of the two confederated , Hittite vassal states - the \u1e2aaya\u0161a-Azzi ( 1600-1200 BC ) .

Erebuni was designed as a great administrative and religious centre , a fully royal capital . By the late ancient Armenian Kingdom , new capital cities were established and Yerevan declined in importance . Under Iranian and Russian rule , it was the center of the Erivan Khanate from 1736 to 1828 and the Erivan Governorate from 1850 to 1917 , respectively . After World War I , Yerevan became the capital of the First Republic of Armenia as thousands of survivors of the Armenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire arrived in the area . The city expanded rapidly during the 20th century as Armenia became part of the Soviet Union . In a few decades , Yerevan was transformed from a provincial town within the Russian Empire to Armenia 's principal cultural , artistic , and industrial center , as well as becoming the seat of national government . With the growth of the Armenian economy , Yerevan has undergone major transformation .",

In the 16th century , Austria started serving as the heart of the Habsburg Monarchy and the junior branch of the House of Habsburg - one of the most influential royal dynasties in history . As an archduchy , it was a major component and administrative centre of the Holy Roman Empire . Early in the 19th century , Austria established its own empire , which became a great power and the leading force of the German Confederation but pursued its own course independently of the other German states . Following the Austro-Prussian War and the compromise with Hungary , the Dual Monarchy was established . Austria was involved in World War I under Emperor Franz Joseph following the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand , the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne . After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy , the Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed with the intent of the union with Germany , which eventually failed because of the Allied Powers and the state remained unrecognized .",

It is now the lingua franca of the Arab world . It is named after the Arabs , a term initially used to describe peoples living in the area bounded by Mesopotamia in the east and the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west , in Northwestern Arabia and in the Sinai Peninsula . The ISO assigns language codes to thirty varieties of Arabic , including its standard form , Modern Standard Arabic , also referred to as Literary Arabic , which is modernized Classical Arabic .

Arabic is widely taught in schools and universities and is used to varying degrees in workplaces , government and the media . Arabic , in its standard form , is the official language of 26 states , as well as the liturgical language of the religion of Islam , since the Quran and Hadith were written in Arabic . During the Middle Ages , Arabic was a major vehicle of culture in Europe , especially in science , mathematics and philosophy . As a result , many European languages have also borrowed many words from it . Arabic influence , mainly in vocabulary , is seen in European languages - mainly Spanish and to a lesser extent Portuguese and Catalan - owing to both the proximity of Christian European and Muslim Arab civilizations and almost 800 years of Arabic culture and language presence in the Iberian Peninsula , referred to in Arabic as al-Andalus .

Long an important trading center in the Persian Gulf , Manama is home to a very diverse population . After periods of Portuguese and Persian control and invasions from the ruling dynasties of Saudi Arabia and Oman , Bahrain established itself as an independent nation during the 19th century period of British hegemony . Although the current twin cities of Manama and Muharraq appear to have been founded simultaneously in the 1300s , Muharraq took prominence due to its defensive location and was thus the capital of Bahrain until 1337 . Manama became the mercantile capital and was the gateway to the main Bahrain Island . In the 20th century , Bahrain 's oil wealth helped spur fast growth and in the 1990s a concerted diversification effort led to expansion in other industries and helped transform Manama into an important financial hub in the Middle East .

Its predecessor stage is known as Ruthenian ( 14th to 17th centuries ) , in turn descended from Old East Slavic ( 10th to 13th centuries ) . In the first Belarus Census of 1999 , the Belarusian language was declared as a language spoken at home by about 3,686,000 Belarusian citizens ( 36.7% of the population ) . About 6,984,000 ( 85.6% ) of Belarusians declared it their mother tongue . Other sources , such as Ethnologue , put the figure at approximately 2.5 million active speakers . According to a study done by the Belarusian government in 2009 , 72% of Belarusians speak Russian at home , while Belarusian is actively used by only 11.9% of Belarusians .",

It is the official and literary standard of Croatia and one of the official languages of the European Union . Croatian is also one of the official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina and a recognized minority language in Serbia and neighboring countries . Standard Croatian is based on the most widespread dialect of Serbo-Croatian , Shtokavian , more specifically on Eastern Herzegovinian , which is also the basis of Standard Serbian , Bosnian , and Montenegrin . In the mid-18th century , the first attempts to provide a Croatian literary standard began on the basis of the Neo-Shtokavian dialect that served as a supraregional lingua franca pushing back regional Chakavian , Kajkavian , and Shtokavian vernaculars . The decisive role was played by Croatian Vukovians , who cemented the usage of Ijekavian Neo-Shtokavian as the literary standard in the late 19th and the beginning of the 20th century , in addition to designing a phonological orthography . Croatian is written in Gaj 's Latin alphabet . Besides the Shtokavian dialect , on which Standard Croatian is based , there are two other main dialects spoken on the territory of Croatia , Chakavian and Kajkavian . These dialects , and the four national standards , are usually subsumed under the term Serbo-Croatian in English , though this term is controversial for native speakers , and paraphrases such as Bosnian-Croatian-Montenegrin-Serbian are therefore sometimes used instead , especially in diplomatic circles .",

It is one of the two alphabets used to write standard modern Serbian , Bosnian and Montenegrin , the other being Latin . Karad\u017ei\u0107 based his alphabet on the previous Slavonic-Serbian script , following the principle of write as you speak and read as it is written , removing obsolete letters and letters representing iotified vowels , introducing \u27e8J\u27e9 from the Latin alphabet instead , and adding several consonant letters for sounds specific to Serbian phonology . During the same period , Croatian linguists led by Ljudevit Gaj adapted the Latin alphabet , in use in western South Slavic areas , using the same principles . As a result of this joint effort , Cyrillic and Latin alphabets for Serbo-Croatian have a complete one-to-one congruence , with the Latin digraphs Lj , Nj , and D\u017e counting as single letters . Vuk 's Cyrillic alphabet was officially adopted in Serbia in 1868 , and was in exclusive use in the country up to the inter-war period . Both alphabets were co-official in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and later in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . Due to the shared cultural area , Gaj 's Latin alphabet saw a gradual adoption in Serbia since , and both scripts are used to write modern standard Serbian , Montenegrin and Bosnian ; Croatian only uses the Latin alphabet . In Serbia , Cyrillic is seen as being more traditional , and has the official status ( designated in the Constitution as the official script , compared to Latin 's status of script in official use designated by a lower-level act , for national minorities ) . It is also an official script in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro , along with Latin .

This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries . The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State .",

It has the longest documented history of any living Indo-European language , spanning at least 3,500 years of written records . Its writing system has been the Greek alphabet for the major part of its history ; other systems , such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary , were used previously . The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin , Cyrillic , Armenian , Coptic , Gothic , and many other writing systems . The Greek language holds an important place in the history of the Western world and Christianity ; the canon of ancient Greek literature includes works in the Western canon such as the epic poems Iliad and Odyssey . Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science , especially astronomy , mathematics and logic and Western philosophy , such as the Platonic dialogues and the works of Aristotle , are composed ; the New Testament of the Christian Bible was written in Koin\u00e9 Greek . Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world , the study of the Greek texts and society of antiquity constitutes the discipline of Classics . During antiquity , Greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world , West Asia and many places beyond . It would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire and develop into Medieval Greek . In its modern form , Greek is the official language in two countries , Greece and Cyprus , a recognised minority language in seven other countries , and is one of the 24 official languages of the European Union . The language is spoken by at least 13.2 million people today in Greece , Cyprus , Italy , Albania , and Turkey and by the Greek diaspora .

It has been continuously inhabited for over 4,500 years and has been the capital of Cyprus since the 10th century . The Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities of Nicosia segregated into the south and north of the city respectively in early 1964 , following the fighting of the Cyprus crisis of 1963-64 that broke out in the city . This separation became a militarised border between the Republic of Cyprus and Northern Cyprus after Turkey invaded the island of Cyprus in 1974 , occupying the north of the island , including northern Nicosia . Today North Nicosia is the capital of Northern Cyprus , a state recognized only by Turkey , that is considered to be occupied Cypriot territory by the international community . Apart from its legislative and administrative functions , Nicosia has established itself as the island 's financial capital and its main international business centre .

The Czech Republic is a landlocked country with a hilly landscape that covers an area of 78,866 square kilometers ( 30,450 sq mi ) with a mostly temperate continental climate and oceanic climate . It is a unitary parliamentary republic , with 10.7 million inhabitants . Its capital and largest city is Prague , with 1.3 million residents ; other major cities are Brno , Ostrava , Olomouc and Pilsen . The Czech Republic includes the historical territories of Bohemia , Moravia , and Czech Silesia . The Czech state was formed in the late ninth century as the Duchy of Bohemia under the Great Moravian Empire . In 1002 , the duchy was formally recognized as an Imperial State of the Holy Roman Empire along with the Kingdom of Germany , the Kingdom of Burgundy , the Kingdom of Italy ; and became the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1198 , reaching its greatest territorial extent in the 14th century . Prague was the imperial seat in periods between the 14th and 17th century . The Protestant Bohemian Reformation of the 15th century led to the Hussite Wars , the first of many conflicts with the Catholic Church . Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 , the whole Crown of Bohemia was gradually integrated into the Habsburg Monarchy . The Protestant Bohemian Revolt ( 1618-20 ) against the Catholic Habsburgs led to the Thirty Years ' War . After the Battle of the White Mountain , the Habsburgs consolidated their rule , eradicated Protestantism , reimposed Catholicism , and adopted a policy of gradual Germanization .",

Spoken by over 10 million people , it serves as the official language of the Czech Republic . Czech is closely related to Slovak , to the point of mutual intelligibility to a very high degree , as well as Polish . Like other Slavic languages , Czech is a fusional language with a rich system of morphology and relatively flexible word order . Its vocabulary has been extensively influenced by Latin and German . The Czech-Slovak group developed within West Slavic in the high medieval period , and the standardization of Czech and Slovak within the Czech-Slovak dialect continuum emerged in the early modern period . In the later 18th to mid-19th century , the modern written standard became codified in the context of the Czech National Revival . The main non-standard variety , known as Common Czech , is based on the vernacular of Prague , but is now spoken as an interdialect throughout most of the Czech Republic . The Moravian dialects spoken in the eastern part of the country are also classified as Czech , although some of their eastern variants are closer to Slovak . Czech has a moderately-sized phoneme inventory , comprising ten monophthongs , three diphthongs and 25 consonants ( divided into hard , neutral and soft categories ) . Words may contain complicated consonant clusters or lack vowels altogether . Czech has a raised alveolar trill , which is known to occur as a phoneme in only a few other languages , represented by the grapheme \u0159. Czech uses a simple orthography which phonologists have used as a model .",

Also , minor Danish-speaking communities are found in Norway , Sweden , Spain , the United States , Canada , Brazil , and Argentina . Due to immigration and language shift in urban areas , around 15-20% of the population of Greenland speak Danish as their first language . Along with the other North Germanic languages , Danish is a descendant of Old Norse , the common language of the Germanic peoples who lived in Scandinavia during the Viking Era . Danish , together with Swedish , derives from the East Norse dialect group , while the Middle Norwegian language before the influence of Danish and Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l are classified as West Norse along with Faroese and Icelandic . A more recent classification based on mutual intelligibility separates modern spoken Danish , Norwegian , and Swedish as mainland Scandinavian , while Icelandic and Faroese are classified as insular Scandinavian . Until the 16th century , Danish was a continuum of dialects spoken from Schleswig to Scania with no standard variety or spelling conventions . With the Protestant Reformation and the introduction of printing , a standard language was developed which was based on the educated Copenhagen dialect . It spread through use in the education system and administration , though German and Latin continued to be the most important written languages well into the 17th century . Following the loss of territory to Germany and Sweden , a nationalist movement adopted the language as a token of Danish identity , and the language experienced a strong surge in use and popularity , with major works of literature produced in the 18th and 19th centuries . Today , traditional Danish dialects have all but disappeared , though regional variants of the standard language exist . The main differences in language are between generations , with youth language being particularly innovative .",

As of 1 January 2020 , the city had a population of 794,128 , 632,340 in Copenhagen Municipality , 104,305 in Frederiksberg Municipality , 42,989 in T\u00e5rnby Municipality , and 14,494 in Drag\u00f8r Municipality . It forms the core of the wider urban area of Copenhagen ( population 1,320,629 ) and the Copenhagen metropolitan area ( population 2,557,737 ) . Copenhagen is situated on the eastern coast of the island of Zealand ; another small portion of the city is located on Amager , and it is separated from Malm\u00f8 , Sweden , by the strait of \u00d8resund . The \u00d8resund Bridge connects the two cities by rail and road . Originally a Viking fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now Gammel Strand , Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century . Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions , defences and armed forces . During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the Kalmar Union , governing the entire present day Nordic region in a personal union with Sweden and Norway ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state . The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of Scandinavia under the union for well over 120 years , starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion . After a plague outbreak and fire in the 18th century , the city underwent a period of redevelopment . This included construction of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden and founding of such cultural institutions as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts . After further disasters in the early 19th century when Horatio Nelson attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city , rebuilding during the Danish Golden Age brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen 's architecture ."
