Similar positions in Canada 's three territories are termed Commissioners and are representatives of the federal government , however , not the monarch directly . The offices have their roots in the 16th and 17th century colonial governors of New France and British North America , though the present incarnations of the positions emerged with Canadian Confederation and the British North America Act in 1867 , which defined the viceregal offices as the Lieutenant Governor of the Province acting by and with the Advice the Executive Council thereof . However , the posts still ultimately represented the government of Canada ( that is , the Governor-General-in-Council ) until the ruling in 1882 of the Lord Watson of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Maritime Bank v. Receiver-General of New Brunswick , whereafter the lieutenant governors were recognized as the direct representatives of the monarch .
