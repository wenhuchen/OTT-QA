  "/wiki/Baby,_You're_a_Rich_Man": "Baby , You 're a Rich Man is a song by the English rock band the Beatles that was released as the B-side of their All You Need Is Love single in July 1967 . It originated from an unfinished song by John Lennon , titled One of the Beautiful People , to which Paul McCartney added a chorus . It is one of the best-known pop songs to feature a clavioline , a monophonic keyboard instrument that was a forerunner to the synthesizer . Lennon played the clavioline on its oboe setting , creating a sound that suggests an Indian shehnai . The song was recorded and mixed at Olympic Sound Studios in London , making it the first of the Beatles ' EMI recordings to be entirely created outside EMI Studios . Lennon wrote his portion of the song after attending the 14 Hour Technicolor Dream , an all-night festival held at London 's Alexandra Palace that served as a key event in the emergence of the counterculture in the UK . His lyrics address the beautiful people of the 1960s hippie movement and combine with the chorus to present a statement on the universality of non-material wealth . The lyrics have also invited interpretation as a message to the Beatles ' manager , Brian Epstein , and alternatively as a comment on fame . George Harrison performed the song during his visit to San Francisco 's Haight-Ashbury district in August 1967 , at the height of the Summer of Love . The track later appeared on the Beatles ' Magical Mystery Tour album and in a sequence in their 1968 animated film Yellow Submarine . Baby , You 're a Rich Man peaked at number 34 on America 's Billboard Hot 100 chart . Among reviewers ' varied comments on the song , Billboard admired it as an Eastern-flavored rocker with an infectious beat and an intricate lyric , while Pitchfork has dismissed it as a second-rate take on John Lennon 's money-isn't-everything theme .",

Rooted in skiffle , beat and 1950s rock and roll , their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways ; the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock . As pioneers in recording , songwriting and artistic presentation , the group revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era 's youth and sociocultural movements . Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney , the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960 , initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass . The core trio of Lennon , McCartney and Harrison , together since 1958 , went through a succession of drummers , including Pete Best , before asking Starr to join them in 1962 . Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings , greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit , Love Me Do , in late 1962 . As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed Beatlemania , the band acquired the nickname the Fab Four , with Epstein , Martin and other members of the band 's entourage sometimes given the informal title of fifth Beatle . By early 1964 , the Beatles were international stars , leading the British Invasion of the United States pop market and breaking numerous sales records .

Starting a solo career , Brown enjoyed commercial and critical success with his second album Do n't Be Cruel ( 1988 ) which spawned five Billboard Hot 100 top 10 singles including the number one hit My Prerogative , and the Grammy Award-winning Every Little Step . In 1989 , Brown contributed two songs to the soundtrack of Ghostbusters II . In 1992 , Brown married singer Whitney Houston , with whom he had a daughter named Bobbi Kristina Brown . The couple 's drug abuse and domestic disputes made them tabloid fodder . Brown 's next album Bobby ( 1992 ) spawned several hit singles including Humpin ' Around , Get Away , and Good Enough . However , sales of Bobby did not match its predecessor . Some surmise that this may have been due to Brown 's recent marriage to Houston , and his decision to take a break from the business for reasons involving his marriage and impending new-fatherhood . Brown also starred in films such as A Thin Line Between Love and Hate and Two Can Play That Game . He returned to New Edition for a reunion album and tour from 1996 to 1997 , and returned with all six members for another stint in 2005 .",
