  "/wiki/Ion_rapid_transit": "Ion , stylized as ION , is an integrated public transportation network in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo in Ontario , Canada . It is operated by Keolis and is part of the Grand River Transit ( GRT ) system , partially replacing GRT 's Route 200 iXpress bus service . The section of Route 200 serving Cambridge has been renamed Ion Bus . The first phase commenced operations on June 21 , 2019 , between the north end of Waterloo and the south end of Kitchener . A future extension of light rail to the downtown Galt area of Cambridge ( Phase 2 ) is planned but construction may not begin on that line until 2025 . In 2009 , an Environmental Assessment ( EA ) began to create a proposal of electrically-powered light rail transit through Kitchener and Waterloo , and adapted bus rapid transit from Kitchener to Cambridge . On June 24 , 2009 , Regional Council voted to approve the project , subject to funding from higher levels of government , which was in turn approved by council on June 15 , 2011 . This was followed by a community building strategy to guide development , identify key destinations , and strengthen regional connections . The strategy , led by Urban Strategies Inc. of Toronto , consulted hundreds of individuals and stakeholders from Cambridge , Kitchener , and Waterloo . Construction began in August 2014 and service was expected to begin in late 2017 ; however , because of delays in the manufacture and delivery of rolling stock , the introduction of the light rail service was significantly delayed . The total cost of the system was estimated at $ 818 million , but in December 2017 , the overruns were estimated to total approximately $ 50 million . The Province was expected to provide $ 25 million of that amount .",
