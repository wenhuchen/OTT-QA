  "/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity": "Pumped-storage hydroelectricity ( PSH ) , or pumped hydroelectric energy storage ( PHES ) , is a type of hydroelectric energy storage used by electric power systems for load balancing . The method stores energy in the form of gravitational potential energy of water , pumped from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation . Low-cost surplus off-peak electric power is typically used to run the pumps . During periods of high electrical demand , the stored water is released through turbines to produce electric power . Although the losses of the pumping process makes the plant a net consumer of energy overall , the system increases revenue by selling more electricity during periods of peak demand , when electricity prices are highest . If the upper lake collects significant rainfall or is fed by a river then the plant may be a net energy producer in the manner of a traditional hydroelectric plant . Pumped-storage hydroelectricity allows energy from intermittent sources ( such as solar , wind ) and other renewables , or excess electricity from continuous base-load sources ( such as coal or nuclear ) to be saved for periods of higher demand . The reservoirs used with pumped storage are quite small when compared to conventional hydroelectric dams of similar power capacity , and generating periods are often less than half a day . Pumped storage is by far the largest-capacity form of grid energy storage available , and , as of 2017 , the United States Department of Energy Global Energy Storage Database reports that PSH accounts for over 95% of all active tracked storage installations worldwide , with a total installed nameplate capacity of over 184 GW , of which about 25 GW are in the United States . The round-trip energy efficiency of PSH varies between 70-80% , with some sources claiming up to 87% . The main disadvantage of PSH is the specialist nature of the site required , needing both geographical height and water availability . Suitable sites are therefore likely to be in hilly or mountainous regions , and potentially in areas of outstanding natural beauty , and therefore there are also social and ecological issues to overcome .",

  "/wiki/Peat": "Peat ( /pi\u02d0t/ ) , also known as turf ( /t\u025c\u02d0rf/ ) , is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation or organic matter . It is unique to natural areas called peatlands , bogs , mires , moors , or muskegs . The peatland ecosystem is the most efficient carbon sink on the planet , because peatland plants capture CO2 naturally released from the peat , maintaining an equilibrium . In natural peatlands , the annual rate of biomass production is greater than the rate of decomposition , but it takes thousands of years for peatlands to develop the deposits of 1.5 to 2.3 m [ 4.9 to 7.5 ft ] , which is the average depth of the boreal [ northern ] peatlands . Sphagnum moss , also called peat moss , is one of the most common components in peat , although many other plants can contribute . The biological features of Sphagnum mosses act to create a habitat aiding peat formation , a phenomenon termed 'habitat manipulation ' . Soils consisting primarily of peat are known as histosols . Peat forms in wetland conditions , where flooding or stagnant water obstructs the flow of oxygen from the atmosphere , slowing the rate of decomposition . Peatlands , particularly bogs , are the primary source of peat , although less-common wetlands including fens , pocosins , and peat swamp forests also deposit peat . Landscapes covered in peat are home to specific kinds of plants including Sphagnum moss , ericaceous shrubs , and sedges ( see bog for more information on this aspect of peat ) . Because organic matter accumulates over thousands of years , peat deposits provide records of past vegetation and climate by preserving plant remains , such as pollen . This allows the reconstruction of past environments and study changes in land use .",

The other two major lakes are Lough Allen to the north , and Lough Derg to the south , there are also several minor lakes along the length of the river . The lake serves as a border between the counties of Longford and Westmeath ( both in the province of Leinster ) on the eastern side and County Roscommon in the province of Connacht on the western side . The lake is popular for fishing and boating . The lake supports a small commercial eel fishery and is locally famous for its eels on wheels truck . The town of Athlone is situated at the southern end of the lake , and has a harbour for boats going out on the lake . The small town of Lanesboro is at the northern end of the lake . The island of Inchcleraun ( Inis Cloithreann ) in the northern part of the lake is the site of a monastery founded in the early Christian era and contains the remains of several ancient churches .

  "/wiki/Ardnacrusha_power_plant": "The Shannon hydroelectric Scheme was a major development by the Irish Free State in the 1920s to harness the power of the River Shannon . Its product , the Ardnacrusha power plant , is a hydroelectric power station which is still producing power today and is located near Ardnacrusha within County Clare approximately 2.4 kilometres ( 1.5 mi ) from the Limerick border . It is Ireland 's largest river hydroelectric scheme and is operated on a purpose built headrace connected to the River Shannon . The plant includes fish ladders so that returning fish , such as salmon , can climb the river safely past the power station . Completed within 7 years of Irish independence in 1922 at a cost which was equivalent to one fifth of the Irish state 's annual budget , the plant enabled an enormous surge in demand for electricity across the country and demonstrated the ability of the new government to develop during a difficult financial period . The plant was constructed by the German company Siemens-Schuckert , although much of the design was done by Irish engineers and Ireland provided most of the labour force . The scheme involved changes to the flow of the whole river , multiple dams and bridges and the construction of a national power grid . The generating plant at Ardnacrusha is composed of three vertical-shaft Francis turbine generators ( commissioned in 1929 ) and one vertical-shaft Kaplan turbine generator ( commissioned in 1934 ) operating under an average head of 28.5 metres . The scheme originally was designed for six turbines , with four turbines fitted . The 85 MW of generating plant in Ardnacrusha was adequate to meet the electricity demand of the entire country in the early years . The full output equates to about 332,000 MWh generated on an annual basis . Ardnacrusha generates at 10.5 kilovolts ( kV ) but this is transformed to 38 kV for local distribution and to 110 kV for long distance transmission .",
  "/wiki/Hydroelectricity": "Hydroelectricity is electricity produced from hydropower . In 2015 , hydropower generated 16.6% of the world 's total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity , and was expected to increase by about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years . Hydropower is produced in 150 countries , with the Asia-Pacific region generating 33 percent of global hydropower in 2013 . China is the largest hydroelectricity producer , with 920 TWh of production in 2013 , representing 16.9% of domestic electricity use . The cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low , making it a competitive source of renewable electricity . The hydro station consumes no water , unlike coal or gas plants . The typical cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt hour . With a dam and reservoir it is also a flexible source of electricity , since the amount produced by the station can be varied up or down very rapidly ( as little as a few seconds ) to adapt to changing energy demands . Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed , the project produces no direct waste , and it generally has a considerably lower output level of greenhouse gases than photovoltaic power plants and certainly fossil fuel powered energy plants ( see also Life-cycle_greenhouse-gas_emissions_of_energy_sources ) . However , when constructed in lowland rainforest areas , where inundation of a part of the forest is necessary , they actually emit up to 3 to 4 times more greenhouse gases [ clarification needed ] ( see also Environmental_impact_of_reservoirs # Greenhouse_gases ) .",
