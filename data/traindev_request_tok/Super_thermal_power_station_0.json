The power plant is one of the coal fired power plants of NTPC , a Government of India enterprise . The coal for the power plant is sourced from Kalinga Block of Talcher Coal fields in Odisha . The plant is a national asset , and power generated is shared between multiple states , as the operator is national . Power generated by units 1 and 2 , making up for 1,000 MW , is dedicated to power distribution companies owned by the Government of Andhra Pradesh and Telengana . The remaining 1,000 MW , generated by units 3 and 4 , is allocated to the states of Odisha , Tamil Nadu , Karnataka , A. P. , Telangana and pondicherry as per their shares as decided in PPA . NTPC Simhadri is a modern coal-fired power plant , and is a combination of four independent generation units , with common water and fuel sources , and common ash ponds . Each of the four units has a nameplate capacity of 500 MW . Units 1 and 2 were built in the first phase of development , and were commissioned in February 2002 and August 2004 , respectively , to meet urgent needs of power in the largely agrarian Coastal Andhra and North-Coastal Andhra regions . Units 3 and 4 were built in the second phase , and commissioned in March 2011 and March 2012 , respectively . Since the operator of this plant is a Government of India enterprise , and since the plant was built with central government funds , power generated by units 3 and 4 are sold to distribution companies based in neighbouring states of Odisha , Tamil Nadu , and Karnataka , over the National Grid , as power stocks . The allocations are decided between NTPC and the three states ' discoms .",
