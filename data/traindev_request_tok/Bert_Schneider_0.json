  "/wiki/Situation_comedy": "A sitcom , clipping for situational comedy ( situation comedy in the U.S. ) , is a genre of comedy centered on a fixed set of characters who carry over from episode to episode . Sitcoms can be contrasted with sketch comedy , where a troupe may use new characters in each sketch , and stand-up comedy , where a comedian tells jokes and stories to an audience . Sitcoms originated in radio , but today are found mostly on television as one of its dominant narrative forms . A situational comedy television programme may be recorded in front of a studio audience , depending on the programme 's production format . The effect of a live studio audience can be imitated or enhanced by the use of a laugh track . During filming productions , the laugh track is usually pre-recorded . Critics disagree over the utility of the term sitcom in classifying shows that have come into existence since the turn of the century . Many contemporary American sitcoms use the single-camera setup and do not feature a laugh track , thus often resembling the dramedy shows of the 1980s and 1990s rather than the traditional sitcom . Other topics of debate have included whether or not cartoons , such as The Simpsons or Family Guy , can be classified as sitcoms .",

  "/wiki/Road_movie": "A road movie is a film genre in which the main characters leave home on a road trip , typically altering the perspective from their everyday lives . Road movies often depict travel in the hinterlands , with the films exploring the theme of alienation and examining the tensions and issues of the cultural identity of a nation or historical period ; this is all often enmeshed in a mood of actual or potential menace , lawlessness , and violence , a distinctly existential air and is populated by restless , frustrated , often desperate characters . The setting includes not just the close confines of the car as it moves on highways and roads , but also booths in diners and rooms in roadside motels , all of which helps to create intimacy and tension between the characters . Road movies tend to focus on the theme of masculinity ( with the man often going through some type of crisis ) , some type of rebellion , car culture , and self-discovery . The core theme of road movies is rebellion against conservative social norms . There are two main narratives : the quest and the outlaw chase . In the quest-style film , the story meanders as the characters make discoveries ( e.g. , Two-Lane Blacktop from 1971 ) . In outlaw road movies , in which the characters are fleeing from law enforcement , there is usually more sex and violence ( e.g. , Natural Born Killers from 1994 ) . Road films tend to focus more on characters ' internal conflicts and transformations , based on their feelings as they experience new realities on their trip , rather than on the dramatic movement-based sequences that predominate in action films . Road movies do not typically use the standard three-act structure used in mainstream films ; instead , an open-ended , rambling plot structure is used . The road movie keeps its characters on the move , and as such the car , the tracking shot , [ and ] wide and wild open space are important iconography elements , similar to a Western movie . As well , the road movie is similar to a Western in that road films are also about a frontiersmanship and about the codes of discovery ( often self-discovery ) .",

  "/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)": "In film and television , drama is a genre of narrative fiction ( or semi-fiction ) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone . Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre , such as police crime drama , political drama , legal drama , historical period drama , domestic drama , teen drama or comedy-drama . These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods . All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters . In this broader sense , drama is a mode distinct from novels , short stories , and narrative poetry or songs . In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted . Radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance , it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio .",

  "/wiki/Drive,_He_Said": "Drive , He Said is a 1971 American motion picture released by Columbia Pictures . It is one of the lesser-known works in the influential group of New Hollywood films of the late 1960s and early 1970s made by independent production house Raybert Productions ( The Monkees , Easy Rider ) and its successor , BBS Productions . Based upon the 1964 novel of the same title by Jeremy Larner , the film , which stars William Tepper , is notable as the directorial debut of Jack Nicholson ( who also wrote the screenplay ) following his breakthrough as an actor in Easy Rider ( 1969 ) and Five Easy Pieces ( 1970 ) . Although it was coolly received at the time , and has subsequently faded into obscurity , the production brought together many significant Hollywood names . Director of photography Bill Butler gained renown for his later work on classic films such as Steven Spielberg 's Jaws , Francis Ford Coppola 's The Conversation , and One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest . Original music was composed by David Shire ( then married to Coppola 's sister , Talia ) and the screenplay included uncredited contributions from future director Terence Malick . It starred several of Nicholson 's friends and frequent screen collaborators in leading roles - Karen Black , Bruce Dern , Robert Towne and Henry Jaglom ( although Towne and Jaglom became better known as screenwriter and director , respectively ) . Several younger actors who became familiar TV faces in later years were also featured in small supporting roles , including David Ogden Stiers ( M*A*S*H ) , Cindy Williams ( Laverne & Shirley ) and Michael Warren ( Hill Street Blues ) , who ( like Tepper ) was also a former collegiate basketball player . It was filmed on the campus of the University of Oregon and other locations in Eugene , Oregon . The film is also notable for its then-controversial use of profanity , its depictions of sex and drug use , and for several scenes of male frontal nudity , including a locker-room shower scene , and the mental breakdown scene in which Gabriel ( Margotta ) is shown frontally nude , which led to an attempt by the censor to give the film an X rating . The title comes from the poem I Know A Man by Robert Creeley , which a character recites in the opening scene . It also serves as a cryptic reference to basketball , the movie 's dominant milieu .",
