  "/wiki/Science": "Science ( from the Latin word scientia , meaning knowledge ) is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe . The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3500 to 3000 BCE . Their contributions to mathematics , astronomy , and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity , whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes . After the fall of the Western Roman Empire , knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the early centuries ( 400 to 1000 CE ) of the Middle Ages but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age . The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived natural philosophy , which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution that began in the 16th century as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and traditions . The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape ; along with the changing of natural philosophy to natural science . Modern science is typically divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences ( e.g. , biology , chemistry , and physics ) , which study nature in the broadest sense ; the social sciences ( e.g. , economics , psychology , and sociology ) , which study individuals and societies ; and the formal sciences ( e.g. , logic , mathematics , and theoretical computer science ) , which study abstract concepts . There is disagreement , however , on whether the formal sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical evidence . Disciplines that use existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes , such as engineering and medicine , are described as applied sciences . Science is based on research , which is commonly conducted in academic and research institutions as well as in government agencies and companies . The practical impact of scientific research has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the development of commercial products , armaments , health care , and environmental protection .",

  "/wiki/Interview": "An interview is essentially a structured conversation where one participant asks questions , and the other provides answers . In common parlance , the word interview refers to a one-on-one conversation between an interviewer and an interviewee . The interviewer asks questions to which the interviewee responds , usually so information is offered by the interviewee to interviewer -- and that information may be used or provided to other audiences , whether in real time or later . This feature is common to many types of interviews -- a job interview or interview with a witness to an event may have no other audience present at the time , but the answers will be later provided to others in the employment or investigative process . The information or answers may also be transferred in both directions in a tradition interview . Interviews usually take place face-to-face and in person , although modern communications technologies such as the Internet have enabled conversations to happen in which parties are separated geographically , such as with videoconferencing software , and telephone interviews can happen without visual contact . Interviews almost always involve spoken conversation between two or more parties , although in some instances a conversation can happen between two persons who type questions and answers back and forth . Interviews can range from Unstructured interview or free-wheeling and open-ended conversations in which there is no predetermined plan with prearranged questions , to highly structured conversations in which specific questions occur in a specified order . They can follow diverse formats ; for example , in a ladder interview , a respondent 's answers typically guide subsequent interviews , with the object being to explore a respondent 's subconscious motives . Typically the interviewer has some way of recording the information that is gleaned from the interviewee , often by writing with a pencil and paper , sometimes transcribing with a video or audio recorder , depending on the context and extent of information and the length of the interview . Interviews have a duration in time , in the sense that the interview has a beginning and an ending . The traditional two-person interview format , sometimes called a one-on-one interview , permits direct questions and followups , which enables an interviewer to better gauge the accuracy of responses .",

  "/wiki/Comedy": "In a modern sense , comedy ( from the Greek : \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 , k\u014dm\u014did\u00eda ) is a genre of fiction that refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter , especially in theatre , television , film , stand-up comedy , books and novels or any other medium of entertainment . The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece . In the Athenian democracy , the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters . The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict . Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a Society of Youth and a Society of the Old . A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes . In this struggle , the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority , and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter . Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt , thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor . Parody subverts popular genres and forms , critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them . Other forms of comedy include screwball comedy , which derives its humor largely from bizarre , surprising ( and improbable ) situations or characters , and black comedy , which is characterized by a form of humor that includes darker aspects of human behavior or human nature . Similarly scatological humor , sexual humor , and race humor create comedy by violating social conventions or taboos in comic ways . A comedy of manners typically takes as its subject a particular part of society ( usually upper-class society ) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members .",
