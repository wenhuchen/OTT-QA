  "/wiki/Martin_Brodeur": "Martin Pierre Brodeur ( French pronunciation : \u200b [ ma\u0281t\u025b\u0303 b\u0281\u0254d\u0153\u0281 ] ; born May 6 , 1972 ) is a Canadian-American former professional ice hockey goaltender and current team executive . He played 22 seasons in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) , 21 of them for the New Jersey Devils , with whom he won three Stanley Cup championships and five Eastern Conference championships in 17 postseason campaigns . He also won two Olympic gold medals with Team Canada in the 2002 and 2010 Winter Olympic Games , as well as several other medals with Team Canada in other international competitions . Brodeur is widely regarded as one of the greatest goaltenders of all time and in 2017 was named by the league as one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players . He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2018 . Brodeur holds numerous NHL and franchise records among goaltenders ; he ranks as the league 's all-time regular season leader in wins ( 691 ) , losses ( 397 ) , shutouts ( 125 ) , games played ( 1,266 ) , and goals scored ( 3 ) . He won at least 30 games in twelve straight seasons between 1995-96 and 2007-08 and is the only goalie in NHL history with eight 40-win seasons . He is a four-time Vezina Trophy winner , a five-time William M. Jennings Trophy winner , a ten-time NHL All-Star , a Calder Memorial Trophy winner , and one of only 12 NHL goaltenders to score a goal in both the regular season and the playoffs . Brodeur used a hybrid style of goaltending by standing up more than typical butterfly style goalies , though he adapted to more modern techniques at the latter stage of his career . He was known for his puck handling , his positional play , and his reflexes , especially with his glove hand . Brodeur 's prowess at puck handling was so well known that it led in part to the NHL changing its rules regarding where goalies were allowed to handle the puck outside of the goal crease like a sweeper-defenseman , adding what is known as The Brodeur Rule . He announced his retirement in the middle of the 2014-15 season after a brief stint with the St. Louis Blues , having played in seven games with the team .",
  "/wiki/Goaltender": "In ice hockey , the goaltender or goalie is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team 's net , thus preventing the opposing team from scoring . The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the goal crease ( often referred to simply as the crease or the net ) . Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots . In today 's age of goaltending there are two common styles , butterfly and hybrid ( hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique ) . Because of the power of shots , the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact . The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice , as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game . One-on-one situations , such as breakaways and shootouts , have the tendency to highlight a goaltender 's pure skill , or lack thereof . No more than one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time . Teams are not required to use a goaltender and may instead opt to play with an additional skater , but the defensive disadvantage this poses generally means that the strategy is only used as a desperation maneuver when trailing late in a game or can be used if the opposing team has a delayed penalty ( if the team receiving the penalty touches the puck the play will stop ) . The goaltender is also known as the goalie , goaler , goalkeeper , net minder , and tender by those involved in the hockey community . In the early days of the sport , the term was spelled with a hyphen as goal-tender . The art of playing the position is called goaltending and there are coaches , usually called the goalie coach who specialize exclusively in working with goaltenders .",
  "/wiki/1993\u201394_NHL_season": "The 1993-94 NHL season was the 77th regular season of the National Hockey League . The league expanded to 26 teams with the addition of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and the Florida Panthers . The New York Rangers were the Stanley Cup champions . It was the Rangers ' fourth championship overall , and their first in 54 seasons , since 1939-40 . The spectacular play of Dominik Hasek of the Buffalo Sabres ushered in a new era of goaltending dominance in the NHL . Only three teams reached the 300-goal plateau , and only one team , the Detroit Red Wings , averaged more than four goals scored per game . Goaltenders combined for 99 shutouts during the regular season , a mark that broke the all-time regular-season record of 85 set in 1974-75 .",

  "/wiki/Defenceman": "Defence ( defense in the United States ) in ice hockey is a player position whose primary responsibility is to prevent the opposing team from scoring . They are often referred to as defencemen , D , D-men or blueliners ( the latter a reference to the blue line in ice hockey which represents the boundary of the offensive zone ; defencemen generally position themselves along the line to keep the puck in the zone ) . They were once called cover-point . A good defenceman is both strong in defensive and offensive play and for defenceman pairing also need to be good at defending and attacking . In regular play , two defencemen complement three forwards and a goaltender on the ice . Exceptions include overtime during the regular season and when a team is shorthanded ( i.e . has been assessed a penalty ) , in which two defencemen are typically joined by only two forwards and a goaltender ; in National Hockey League play in overtime effective with the 2015-16 season the teams have only three position players and a goaltender on the ice and may use either two forwards and one defenceman ( typically ) , or conversely , two defencemen and one forward .",

  "/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)": "In ice hockey , a forward is a player position on the ice whose primary responsibility is to score and assist goals . Generally , the forwards try to stay in three different lanes , also known as thirds , of the ice going from goal to goal . It is not mandatory , however , to stay in a lane . Staying in a lane aids in forming the common offensive strategy known as a triangle . One forward obtains the puck and then the forwards pass it between themselves making the goalie move side to side . This strategy opens up the net for scoring opportunities . This strategy allows for a constant flow of the play , attempting to maintain the control of play by one team in the offensive zone . The forwards can pass to the defence players playing at the blue line , thus freeing up the play and allowing either a shot from the point ( blue line position where the defence stands ) or a pass back to the offence . This then begins the triangle again . Each team has three forwards in each line :",
