  "/wiki/Call_sign": "In broadcasting and radio communications , a call sign ( also known as a call name or call letters - and historically as a call signal - or abbreviated as a call ) is a unique designation for a transmitter station . In the United States of America , they are used for all FCC-licensed transmitters . A call sign can be formally assigned by a government agency , informally adopted by individuals or organizations , or even cryptographically encoded to disguise a station 's identity . The use of call signs as unique identifiers dates to the landline railroad telegraph system . Because there was only one telegraph line linking all railroad stations , there needed to be a way to address each one when sending a telegram . In order to save time , two-letter identifiers were adopted for this purpose . This pattern continued in radiotelegraph operation ; radio companies initially assigned two-letter identifiers to coastal stations and stations aboard ships at sea . These were not globally unique , so a one-letter company identifier ( for instance , 'M ' and two letters as a Marconi station ) was later added . By 1912 , the need to quickly identify stations operated by multiple companies in multiple nations required an international standard ; an ITU prefix would be used to identify a country , and the rest of the call sign an individual station in that country .",
  "/wiki/Frequency": "Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time . It is also referred to as temporal frequency , which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency . The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event , so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency . For example : if a newborn baby 's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute , its period , T , - the time interval between beats - is half a second ( 60 seconds divided by 120 beats ) . Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena , such as mechanical vibrations , audio signals ( sound ) , radio waves , and light .",
  "/wiki/City_of_license": "In American , Canadian and Philippine broadcasting , a city of license or community of license is the community that a radio station or television station is officially licensed to serve by that country 's broadcast regulator . In North American broadcast law , the concept of community of license dates to the early days of AM radio broadcasting . The requirement that a broadcasting station operate a main studio within a prescribed distance of the community which the station is licensed to serve appears in U.S. law as early as 1939 . Various specific obligations have been applied to broadcasters by governments to fulfill public policy objectives of broadcast localism , both in radio and later also in television , based on the legislative presumption that a broadcaster fills a similar role to that held by community newspaper publishers .",

After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 , which destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless , the city made a concerted effort to rebuild . The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades , and by 1900 , less than 30 years after the great fire , Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world . Chicago made noted contributions to urban planning and zoning standards , including new construction styles ( including the Chicago School of architecture ) , the development of the City Beautiful Movement , and the steel-framed skyscraper . Chicago is an international hub for finance , culture , commerce , industry , education , technology , telecommunications , and transportation . It is the site of the creation of the first standardized futures contracts , issued by the Chicago Board of Trade , which today is the largest and most diverse derivatives market in the world , generating 20% of all volume in commodities and financial futures alone . Depending on the particular year , the city 's O'Hare International Airport is routinely ranked as the world 's fifth or sixth busiest airport according to tracked data by the Airports Council International .",

The capital of Illinois is Springfield , which is located in the central part of the state . Although today Illinois 's largest population center is in its northeast , the state 's European population grew first in the west as the French settled lands near the Mississippi River , when the region was known as Illinois Country and was part of New France . Following the American Revolutionary War , American settlers began arriving from Kentucky in the 1780s via the Ohio River , and the population grew from south to north .",
