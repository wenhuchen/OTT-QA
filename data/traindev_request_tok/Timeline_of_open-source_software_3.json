  "/wiki/Crowdfunding": "Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or venture by raising small amounts of money from a large number of people , typically via the Internet . Crowdfunding is a form of crowdsourcing and alternative finance . In 2015 , over US $ 34 billion was raised worldwide by crowdfunding . Although similar concepts can also be executed through mail-order subscriptions , benefit events , and other methods , the term crowdfunding refers to Internet-mediated registries . This modern crowdfunding model is generally based on three types of actors : the project initiator who proposes the idea or project to be funded , individuals or groups who support the idea , and a moderating organization ( the platform ) that brings the parties together to launch the idea . Crowdfunding has been used to fund a wide range of for-profit , entrepreneurial ventures such as artistic and creative projects , medical expenses , travel , and community-oriented social entrepreneurship projects . Its use has also been criticised for funding quackery , especially costly and fraudulent cancer treatments .",
  "/wiki/MediaWiki": "MediaWiki is a free and open-source wiki engine . It was developed for use on Wikipedia in 2002 , and given the name MediaWiki in 2003 . It remains in use on Wikipedia and almost all other Wikimedia websites , including Wiktionary , Wikimedia Commons and Wikidata ; these sites continue to define a large part of the requirement set for MediaWiki . MediaWiki was originally developed by Magnus Manske and improved by Lee Daniel Crocker . Its development has since then been coordinated by the Wikimedia Foundation . MediaWiki is written in the PHP programming language and stores all text content into a database . The software is optimized to efficiently handle large projects , which can have terabytes of content and hundreds of thousands of hits per second . Because Wikipedia is one of the world 's largest websites , achieving scalability through multiple layers of caching and database replication has been a major concern for developers . Another major aspect of MediaWiki is its internationalization ; its interface is available in more than 300 languages . The software has more than 1,000 configuration settings and more than 1,800 extensions available for enabling various features to be added or changed . Besides its use on Wikimedia sites , MediaWiki has been used as a knowledge management and content management system on many thousands of websites , public and private , including the websites Fandom and wikiHow , and major internal installations like Intellipedia and Diplopedia .",

It is the largest and most popular general reference work on the World Wide Web , and is one of the most popular websites ranked by Alexa as of January 2020 . It features exclusively free content and no commercial ads , and is owned and supported by the Wikimedia Foundation , a non-profit organization funded primarily through donations . Wikipedia was launched on January 15 , 2001 , by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger . Sanger coined its name , as a portmanteau of wiki ( the Hawaiian word for quick ) and encyclopedia . Initially an English-language encyclopedia , versions of Wikipedia in other languages were quickly developed . With at least 6,017,601 articles , [ note 3 ] the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 290 Wikipedia encyclopedias . Overall , Wikipedia comprises more than 40 million articles in 301 different languages and by February 2014 it had reached 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors per month . In 2005 , Nature published a peer review comparing 42 hard science articles from Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica and Wikipedia and found that Wikipedia 's level of accuracy approached that of Britannica , although critics suggested that it might not have fared so well in a similar study of a random sampling of all articles or one focused on social science or contentious social issues . The following year , Time magazine stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best encyclopedia in the world , and was a testament to the vision of Jimmy Wales . Wikipedia has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias , for presenting a mixture of truth , half truth , and some falsehoods , and for being subject to manipulation and spin in controversial topics . Wikipedia has been criticized for gender bias , particularly on its English-language site , where the dominant majority of editors are male .",

Firefox is officially available for Windows 7 or newer , macOS , and Linux . Its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating systems including FreeBSD , OpenBSD , NetBSD , illumos , and Solaris Unix . Firefox is also available for Android and iOS ; however , the iOS version uses the WebKit layout engine instead of Gecko due to platform limitations , as with all other iOS web browsers . Firefox was created in 2002 under the codename Phoenix by the Mozilla community members who desired a standalone browser , rather than the Mozilla Application Suite bundle . During its beta phase , Firefox proved to be popular with its testers and was praised for its speed , security , and add-ons compared to Microsoft 's then-dominant Internet Explorer 6 . Firefox was released on November 9 , 2004 , and challenged Internet Explorer 's dominance with 60 million downloads within nine months . Firefox is the spiritual successor of Netscape Navigator , as the Mozilla community was created by Netscape in 1998 before their acquisition by AOL . Firefox usage grew to a peak of 32.21% at the end of 2009 , with version 3.5 overtaking Internet Explorer 7 , although not all versions of Internet Explorer as a whole .
