Following the style of her sister ships she was named for an ethnic group , in this case the Ashanti people of the Gold Coast in West Africa . She served in the Second World War and was broken up in 1949 . She was the first of two Royal Navy ships to bear the name Ashanti .",
  "/wiki/Tribal-class_destroyer_(1936)": "The Tribal class , or Afridi class , were a class of destroyers built for the Royal Navy , Royal Canadian Navy and Royal Australian Navy that saw service in World War II . Originally conceived during design studies for a light fleet cruiser , the Tribals evolved into fast , powerful destroyers , with greater emphasis on guns over torpedoes than previous destroyers , in response to new designs by Japan , Italy , and Germany . The Tribals were well admired by their crews and the public when they were in service due to their power , often becoming symbols of prestige while in service . As some of the Royal Navy 's most modern and powerful escort ships , the Tribal class served with distinction in nearly all theatres of World War II . Only a handful of Royal Navy Tribals survived the war , all of which were subsequently scrapped from hard use , while Commonwealth Tribals continued to serve into the Cold War , serving with distinction in the Korean War . Only one Tribal survives to this day : HMCS Haida , which is now a museum ship in Hamilton Harbour , Ontario , Canada .",
  "/wiki/Royal_Navy": "The Royal Navy ( RN ) is the United Kingdom 's naval warfare force . Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels .",
  "/wiki/Naval_trawler": "A naval trawler is a vessel built along the lines of a fishing trawler but fitted out for naval purposes . Naval trawlers were widely used during the First and Second World Wars . Fishing trawlers were particularly suited for many naval requirements because they were robust boats designed to work heavy trawls in all types of weather and had large clear working decks . One could create a mine sweeper simply by replacing the trawl with a mine sweep . Adding depth charge racks on the deck , ASDIC below , and a 3-inch ( 76 mm ) or 4-inch ( 102 mm ) gun in the bow equipped the trawler for anti-submarine duties .",
  "/wiki/HMS_Blankney_(L30)": "HMS Blankney was a Hunt-class destroyer of the Royal Navy and was the first and so far only warship to bear the Name . She was laid down on 17 May 1940 at John Brown & Company , Clydebank , Scotland , launched on 19 December 1940 and commissioned on 11 April 1941 . Blankney was one of 33 , Type II Hunt Escort Destroyers . The hulls of this second batch had an extra section which with the increased beam , gave stability for a third twin 4 AA gun to be mounted as originally designed and to give additional storage for depth charges ( increased from 40 to 110 ) . The class were named after fox hunts located in different parts of Britain and in Blankney 's case , this was the Blankney Hunt , a fox-hunting pack based in the North Kesteven district of Lincolnshire . In 1942 the British Wartime Government introduced a National Savings campaign named Warship Week where towns could adopt a Royal Navy ship . Blankney was adopted by Nantwich in Cheshire . The town still has two roads named after the destroyer , Blankney Avenue and The Blankney . There is a plaque hanging in Civic Hall , commemorating the towns support for the crew .",
  "/wiki/Hunt-class_destroyer": "The Hunt class was a class of escort destroyer of the Royal Navy . The first vessels were ordered early in 1939 , and the class saw extensive service in the Second World War , particularly on the British east coast and Mediterranean convoys .

  "/wiki/HMS_Cumberland_(57)": "HMS Cumberland was a County-class heavy cruiser of the Royal Navy that saw action during the Second World War .",
  "/wiki/County-class_cruiser": "The County class was a class of heavy cruisers built for the Royal Navy in the years between the First and Second World Wars . They were the first post-war cruisers constructed for the Royal Navy and were designed within the limits of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 . Such ships , with a limit of 10,000 tons , standard displacement and 8-inch calibre main guns may be referred to as treaty cruisers ( the term heavy cruiser was not defined until the London Naval Treaty of 1930 [ page needed ] ) . The thirteen Counties were built in the Kent , London and Norfolk sub-classes . They were the only 10,000-ton 8-inch gun , or A , cruisers that the Royal Navy built . The Counties are remembered for their distinctive three-funnel layout and service in all the major naval theatres of the Second World War . To extract more ships from the treaty limits , the navy planned to construct 8,250-ton B ships , six of which could be built in place of five Counties . The extra ship that this afforded was an attractive proposition for a navy that had the immense peacetime commitments of empire . [ page needed ] Peacetime economies and politics intervened and only two B-type cruisers were built , an 8-inch gun modified County design : the York class . In 1929 , the mean cost of each A ship was estimated to be \u00a32,180,000 , whilst the mean cost of each B ship was estimated to be \u00a31,800,000 .",
  "/wiki/HMS_Dianella_(K07)": "HMS Dianella was a Flower-class corvette of the Royal Navy . She served during the Second World War . The Flower-class corvettes were designed as a cheap and simple multi-role warship capable of being built in the multitude of small civilian shipyards not usually accustomed to building to naval standards . John Lewis , & Sons Ltd , Torry , Aberdeen was such a company that constructed coasters , drifters and cargo vessels . During the Second World War , John Lewis & Sons built more than thirty vessels , including small warships . minesweeper trawlers and patrol vessels ; six of these were Flower-class corvettes . She had been launched with the name HMS Daffodil and , unusually , this was changed to HMS Dianella on 26 October 1940 prior to commissioning . She sailed from Aberdeen in January 1941 for Tobermory , to work-up before being sent to join a group on ocean escort of convoys . After a few weeks working-up the ship and the crew , Admiral Stephenson would the personally inspect each escort and put the Captain and crew through a stiff test before releasing them for operational service . Anti-submarine trial exercises were conducted on 11 February .",
  "/wiki/Flower-class_corvette": "The Flower-class corvette ( also referred to as the Gladiolus class after the lead ship ) was a British class of 294 corvettes used during World War II , specifically with the Allied navies as anti-submarine convoy escorts during the Battle of the Atlantic . Royal Navy ships of this class were named after flowers , hence the name of the class . The majority served during World War II with the Royal Navy ( RN ) and Royal Canadian Navy ( RCN ) . Several ships built largely in Canada were transferred from the RN to the United States Navy ( USN ) under the lend-lease programme , seeing service in both navies . Some corvettes transferred to the USN were manned by the US Coast Guard . The vessels serving with the US Navy were known as Temptress and Action-class patrol gunboats . Other Flower-class corvettes served with the Free French Naval Forces , the Royal Netherlands Navy , the Royal Norwegian Navy , the Royal Indian Navy , the Royal Hellenic Navy , the Royal New Zealand Navy , the Royal Yugoslav Navy , and , immediately post-war , the South African Navy . After World War II many surplus Flower-class vessels saw worldwide use in other navies , as well as civilian use . HMCS Sackville is the only member of the class to be preserved as a museum ship .",
  "/wiki/HMS_Duke_of_York_(17)": "HMS Duke of York was a King George V-class battleship of the Royal Navy . Laid down in May 1937 , the ship was constructed by John Brown and Company at Clydebank , Scotland , and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 4 November 1941 , subsequently seeing combat service during the Second World War . In mid-December 1941 , Duke of York transported Prime Minister Winston Churchill to the United States to meet President Franklin D. Roosevelt . Between March and September 1942 Duke of York was involved with convoy escort duties , including as flagship of the Heavy Covering Force of Convoy PQ-17 , but in October she was dispatched to Gibraltar where she became the flagship of Force H. In October 1942 , Duke of York was involved in the Allied invasion of North Africa , but saw little action as her role only required her to protect the accompanying aircraft carriers . Duke of York stopped the Portuguese vessel Gil Eannes on 1 November 1942 and a commando arrested Gast\u00e3o de Freitas Ferraz . The British had picked up radio traffic indicating naval espionage , possibly compromising the secrecy of the upcoming Operation Torch . After Operation Torch , Duke of York was involved in Operations Camera and Governor , which were diversionary operations designed to draw the Germans ' attention away from Operation Husky , the invasion of Sicily . On 4 October , Duke of York operated with her sister ship Anson in covering a force of Allied cruisers and destroyers and the American carrier Ranger , during Operation Leader , which raided German shipping off Norway . The attack sank four merchant ships and badly damaged a further seven . On 26 December 1943 Duke of York was part of a task force which encountered the German battleship Scharnhorst off the North Cape of Norway . During the engagement that followed , Scharnhorst hit Duke of York twice with little effect , but was herself hit by several of Duke of York 's 14-inch shells , silencing one of her turrets and hitting a boiler room . After temporarily escaping from Duke of York 's heavy fire , Scharnhorst was struck several times by torpedoes , allowing Duke of York to again open fire , contributing to the eventual sinking of Scharnhorst after a running action lasting ten-and-a-half hours .",
  "/wiki/King_George_V-class_battleship_(1939)": "The King George V-class battleships were the most modern British battleships in commission during World War II . Five ships of this class were built : HMS King George V ( 1940 ) , HMS Prince of Wales ( 1941 ) , HMS Duke of York ( 1941 ) , HMS Anson ( 1942 ) and HMS Howe ( 1942 ) . The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 limited all of the number , displacement , and armament of warships built following its ratification , and this was extended by the First London Naval Treaty but these treaties were due to expire in 1936 . With increased tension between Britain , the United States , Japan , France and Italy , it was supposed by the designers of these battleships that the treaty might not be renewed and the ships of the King George V class were designed with this possibility in mind . All five ships saw combat during World War II , with King George V and Prince of Wales being involved in the action on 24 May to 27 May 1941 that resulted in the German battleship Bismarck being sunk . Following this on 25 October 1941 , Prince of Wales was sent to Singapore arriving on 2 December and becoming the flagship of Force Z . On 10 December , Prince of Wales was attacked by Japanese bombers and sank with the loss of 327 of its men . In the aftermath of the sinking , King George V , Duke of York , Howe and Anson provided escort duty to convoys bound for Russia . On 1 May 1942 , King George V collided with the destroyer HMS Punjabi , resulting in King George V being sent to Gladstone docks for repairs on 9 May , before returning to escort duty on 1 July 1942 . In October 1942 Duke of York was sent to Gibraltar as the new flagship of Force H and supported the Allied landings in North Africa in November . Anson and Howe would also provide cover for multiple convoys bound for Russia from late 1942 until 1 March 1943 , when Howe provided convoy cover for the last time .

During the Spanish Civil War of 1936-1939 she spent considerable time in Spanish waters , enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict . Escapade was assigned to convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol duties in the Western Approaches when World War II began in September 1939 , but transferred back to the Home Fleet at the end of the year . After participating in the Norwegian Campaign in early 1940 , she participated in anti-invasion duty and escorted capital ships to Gibraltar and in Operation Menace . The destroyer returned to the British Isles for continued escort duty , punctuated by Operation Rubble and the hunt for Scharnhorst and Gneisenau in early 1941 . Following a midyear refit she escorted Arctic convoys and a convoy to Malta , then went into another refit in mid-1942 before returning to the Atlantic from late 1942 to early 1943 . After a refit , she returned to duty in the Atlantic later that year , but was sidelined for more than a year when a projectile from her Hedgehog anti-submarine weapon exploded , causing significant damage .

After the beginning of the Second World War in August 1939 , the E-class ships were mostly assigned to escort duties under the Western Approaches Command , while the Fs were assigned to escort the ships of the Home Fleet . Between them they sank four German submarines through March 1940 while losing only one ship to a submarine . Most of the sisters were committed to the Norwegian Campaign in April-June where they helped to sink one German destroyer and a submarine . The two E-class minelayer-destroyers helped to evacuate Allied troops from Dunkirk in May-June .

Thornycroft & Company and built by them at Woolston , Southampton for the Royal Navy towards the end of World War I . They were named after historical naval leaders . Only Shakespeare and Spenser were completed in time for wartime service . The other three were completed after the war , Broke and Keppel after being towed to Royal dockyards for completion , and two further ships - Saunders and Spragge - were cancelled . The function of a leader was to carry the flag staff of a destroyer flotilla , therefore they were enlarged to carry additional crew , offices and signalling equipment , allowing a fifth gun to be carried . These ships were very similar to the Admiralty type leader , but had broad , slab-sided funnels characteristic of Thornycroft designs .

They were known as four-pipers or four-stackers because they had four smokestacks ( funnels ) . Later classes of destroyers typically had one or two . Some went to the Royal Canadian Navy at the outset . Others went on to the Royal Norwegian Navy , the Royal Netherlands Navy , and the Soviet Navy after serving with the Royal Navy . Although given a set of names by the Commonwealth navies that suggested they were one class they actually came from three classes of destroyer : Caldwell , Wickes , and Clemson . Town class refers to the Admiralty 's practice of renaming these ships after towns common to the United States and the British Commonwealth . Ships initially commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy , however , followed the Canadian practice of giving destroyers the names of Canadian rivers . The rivers selected for the Town class were on the border between Canada and the United States , with the exception of the Nova Scotia river sharing the name of the United States Naval Academy location . One of the Towns achieved lasting fame : HMS Campbeltown ( ex-USS Buchanan ) . In the Commando raid Operation Chariot , Campbeltown , fitted with a large demolition charge , rammed the Normandie Lock at Saint-Nazaire , France .
