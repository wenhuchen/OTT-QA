The battles on the Eastern Front of the Second World War constituted the largest military confrontation in history . They were characterised by unprecedented ferocity , wholesale destruction , mass deportations , and immense loss of life due to combat , starvation , exposure , disease , and massacres . The Eastern Front , as the site of nearly all extermination camps , death marches , ghettos , and the majority of pogroms , was central to the Holocaust . Of the estimated 70-85 million deaths attributed to World War II , around 30 million occurred on the Eastern Front . The Eastern Front was decisive in determining the outcome in the European theatre of operations in World War II , eventually serving as the main reason for the defeat of Nazi Germany and the Axis nations . The two principal belligerent powers were Germany and the Soviet Union , along with their respective allies . Though never engaged in military action in the Eastern Front , the United States and the United Kingdom both provided substantial material aid in the form of the Lend-Lease to the Soviet Union . The joint German-Finnish operations across the northernmost Finnish-Soviet border and in the Murmansk region are considered part of the Eastern Front .

The Japanese were initially successful in their offensive operation , capturing the city of Changde and causing terror among its civilians . However , they were pinned down in the city by a single Chinese division long enough for other Chinese units to surround them with a counter-encirclement . Heavy casualties and the loss of their supply lines then forced the Japanese to withdraw , returning territorial control to the original status quo . Some contemporary Western newspapers depicted the battle as a Chinese victory . American government film footage showed victorious Chinese troops with Japanese prisoners and captured Japanese flags and equipment on display after the battle .

The camps became a major site of the Nazis ' Final Solution to the Jewish Question . After Germany sparked World War II by invading Poland in September 1939 , the Schutzstaffel ( SS ) converted Auschwitz I , an army barracks , into a prisoner-of-war camp for Polish political prisoners . The first inmates , German criminals brought to the camp in May 1940 as functionaries , established the camp 's reputation for sadism , beating , torturing , and executing prisoners for the most trivial reasons . The first gassings - of Soviet and Polish prisoners - took place in block 11 of Auschwitz I around August 1941 . Construction of Auschwitz II began the following month , and from 1942 until late 1944 freight trains delivered Jews from all over German-occupied Europe to its gas chambers . Of the 1.3 million people sent to Auschwitz , 1.1 million died .

Used to hold and torture political opponents and union organizers , the camps initially held around 45,000 prisoners . In 1933-1939 , before the onset of war , most prisoners consisted of German Communists , Socialists , Social Democrats , Roma , Jehovah 's Witnesses , homosexuals , and persons accused of 'asocial ' or socially 'deviant ' behavior by the Germans . Heinrich Himmler 's Schutzstaffel ( SS ) took full control of the police and the concentration camps throughout Germany in 1934-35 . The role of the camps expanded to hold so-called undesirables such as Jews , Romanis/Sintis , Serbs , Soviet POWs , Poles , disabled people , and clergymen . The number of people in the camps , which had fallen to 7,500 , grew again to 21,000 by the start of World War II and peaked at 715,000 in January 1945 . Beginning in 1934 the concentration camps were administered by the Concentration Camps Inspectorate ( CCI ) , which in 1942 was merged into SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt , and they were guarded by SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde ( SS-TV ) .

The men become friends as they work together , and after his brother abdicates the throne , the new king relies on Logue to help him make his first wartime radio broadcast on Britain 's declaration of war on Germany in 1939 . Seidler read about George VI 's life after overcoming a stuttering condition he endured during his own youth . He started writing about the relationship between the therapist and his royal patient as early as the 1980s , but at the request of the King 's widow , Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother , postponed work until her death in 2002 . He later rewrote his screenplay for the stage to focus on the essential relationship between the two protagonists . Nine weeks before filming began , Logue 's notebooks were discovered and quotations from them were incorporated into the script . Principal photography took place in London and around Britain from November 2009 to January 2010 . Hard light was used to give the story a greater resonance and wider than normal lenses were employed to recreate the Duke of York 's feelings of constriction . A third technique Hooper employed was the off-centre framing of characters . The King 's Speech was a major box office and critical success .

English-language speakers also use the word gulag to refer to any forced-labour camp in the Soviet Union , including camps which existed in post-Stalin times . The camps housed a wide range of convicts , from petty criminals to political prisoners . Large numbers were convicted by simplified procedures , such as by NKVD troikas or by other instruments of extrajudicial punishment . The Gulag is recognised as a major instrument of political repression in the Soviet Union . The agency was first administered by the GPU , later by the NKVD and in the final years by the Ministry of Internal Affairs ( MVD ) . The Solovki prison camp , the first corrective labor camp constructed after the revolution , was established in 1918 and legalised by a decree On the creation of the forced-labour camps on April 15 , 1919 . The internment system grew rapidly , reaching a population of 100,000 in the 1920s . According to Nicolas Werth , author of The Black Book of Communism , the yearly mortality rate in the Soviet concentration camps strongly varied , reaching 5% ( 1933 ) and 20% ( 1942-1943 ) while dropping considerably in the post-war years ( about 1 to 3% per year at the beginning of the 1950s ) . The emergent consensus among scholars who utilize official archival data is that of the 18 million who were sent to the Gulag from 1930 to 1953 , roughly 1.5 to 1.7 million perished there or as a result of their detention . However , some historians question the reliability of such data and instead rely heavily on literary sources that come to higher estimations . Archival researchers have found no plan of destruction of the gulag population and no statement of official intent to kill them , and prisoner releases vastly exceeded the number of deaths in the Gulag .",

The campaign resulted in a crushing defeat and heavy losses for the Empire of Japan . As in most Pacific War campaigns , disease and starvation claimed more Japanese lives than enemy action . Most Japanese troops never even came into contact with Allied forces , and were instead simply cut off and subjected to an effective blockade by the US Navy . Garrisons were effectively besieged and denied shipments of food and medical supplies , and as a result , some claim that 97% of Japanese deaths in this campaign were from non-combat causes .

The beach spanned from Courseulles , a village just east of the British beach Gold , to Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer , and just west of the British beach Sword . Taking Juno was the responsibility of the Canadian Army , with sea transport , mine sweeping , and a naval bombardment force provided by the Royal Canadian Navy and the British Royal Navy as well as elements from the Free French , Norwegian , and other Allied navies . The objectives of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division on D-Day were to cut the Caen-Bayeux road , seize the Carpiquet airport west of Caen , and form a link between the two British beaches on either flank . The beach was defended by two battalions of the German 716th Infantry Division , with elements of the 21st Panzer Division held in reserve near Caen . The invasion plan called for two brigades of the 3rd Canadian Division to land on two beach sectors - Mike and Nan - focusing on Courseulles , Berni\u00e8res and Saint-Aubin . [ a ] It was hoped that the preliminary naval and air bombardments would soften up the beach defences and destroy coastal strong points . Close support on the beaches was to be provided by amphibious tanks of the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade and specialized armoured vehicles of the 79th Armoured Division ( United Kingdom ) . Once the landing zones were secured , the plan called for the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade to land reserve battalions and deploy inland , the Royal Marine commandos to establish contact with the British 3rd Infantry Division on Sword and the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade to link up with the British 50th Infantry Division on Gold . The 3rd Canadian Division 's D-Day objectives were to capture Carpiquet Airfield and reach the Caen-Bayeux railway line by nightfall . The landings initially encountered heavy resistance from the German 716th Division ; the preliminary bombardment proved less effective than had been hoped , and rough weather forced the first wave to be delayed until 07:35 . Several assault companies - notably those of the Royal Winnipeg Rifles and The Queen 's Own Rifles of Canada - took heavy casualties in the opening minutes of the first wave .",

Codenamed Operation Neptune and often referred to as D-Day , it was the largest seaborne invasion in history . The operation began the liberation of German-occupied France ( and later western Europe ) and laid the foundations of the Allied victory on the Western Front . Planning for the operation began in 1943 . In the months leading up to the invasion , the Allies conducted a substantial military deception , codenamed Operation Bodyguard , to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings . The weather on D-Day was far from ideal , and the operation had to be delayed 24 hours ; a further postponement would have meant a delay of at least two weeks , as the invasion planners had requirements for the phase of the moon , the tides , and the time of day that meant only a few days each month were deemed suitable . Adolf Hitler placed German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in command of German forces and of developing fortifications along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an Allied invasion . The amphibious landings were preceded by extensive aerial and naval bombardment and an airborne assault - the landing of 24,000 American , British , and Canadian airborne troops shortly after midnight . Allied infantry and armoured divisions began landing on the coast of France at 06:30 . The target 50-mile ( 80 km ) stretch of the Normandy coast was divided into five sectors : Utah , Omaha , Gold , Juno , and Sword . Strong winds blew the landing craft east of their intended positions , particularly at Utah and Omaha . The men landed under heavy fire from gun emplacements overlooking the beaches , and the shore was mined and covered with obstacles such as wooden stakes , metal tripods , and barbed wire , making the work of the beach-clearing teams difficult and dangerous .",

  "/wiki/Pope_Pius_XII_and_the_Roman_razzia": "Pope Pius XII 's response to the Roman razzia ( Italian for roundup ) or mass deportation of Jews on October 16 , 1943 is a significant issue relating to Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust . Under Mussolini , no policy of abduction of Jews had been implemented in Italy . Following the capitulation of Italy in 1943 , Nazi forces invaded and occupied much of the country , and began deportations of Jews to extermination camps . Pius XII protested at diplomatic levels , while several thousand Jews found refuge in Catholic networks , institutions and homes across Italy - including in the Vatican City and Pope Pius ' Summer Residence . The Catholic Church and some historians have credited this rescue in large part to the direction of Pope Pius XII , however , Susan Zuccotti researched the matter in detail and discovered that although the pope was aware of The Holocaust , he did not issue a rescue order . Zuccotti states that there is , in fact , considerable evidence of papal disapproval of the hiding of Jews and other fugitives in Vatican properties . Various historians have given different emphases to accounts of Pius ' actions . According to Michael Phayer , the question of the pope 's silence has become the focus of intense historical debate and analysis because the deportations occurred under his very windows . The term under his very windows was used as the title of a book on the subject by Zuccotti . The phrase is based on an actual quotation from the report of Ernst von Weizs\u00e4cker , the German ambassador to the Vatican , who reported to Berlin that the razzia had taken place under the Pope 's windows . It also echoes the reported words of the protest made to von Weizs\u00e4cker by the pope 's Secretary of State on the morning of the round up : It is sad for the Holy Father , sad beyond imagination , that here in Rome , under the very eyes of the Common Father , that so many people should suffer only because they belong to a specific race . Phayer and Zuccotti 's emphasis on papal silence can be contrasted with Jewish historian of the Holocaust , Sir Martin Gilbert 's , emphasis on papal action in relation to the roundup ."
