  "/wiki/Basic_Instinct": "Basic Instinct is a 1992 American neo-noir erotic thriller film directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Joe Eszterhas , and starring Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone . The film follows a police detective , Nick Curran ( Douglas ) , who is investigating the brutal murder of a wealthy rock star . During the investigation Curran becomes involved in a torrid and intense relationship with the prime suspect , Catherine Tramell ( Stone ) , an enigmatic writer . Eszterhas developed the script in the 1980s , which became a subject of a bidding war until Carolco Pictures acquired the rights to the film . From there , Verhoeven signed on to direct and Douglas and Stone joined the project , after many actresses were considered the role of Tramell . Before its release , Basic Instinct generated heated controversy due to its overt sexuality and graphic depictions of violence , including a scene of rape . It was strongly opposed by gay rights activists , who criticized the film 's depiction of homosexual relationships and the portrayal of a bisexual woman as a murderous psychopath . In a 2006 interview , Stone alleged that a scene in which her vulva was exposed as she crossed her legs was filmed without her knowledge . Basic Instinct premiered in Los Angeles on March 18 , 1992 , and was released in the United States by TriStar Pictures on March 20 , 1992 . The film received mixed reviews from critics , who praised the performances of its cast , original score , and editing , but criticized its writing and character development . Despite initial mixed critical reception and public protest , Basic Instinct was a box office success , grossing $ 352 million worldwide , making it the fourth highest grossing film of 1992 . Several versions of the film have been released on videocassette , DVD , and Blu-ray including a director 's cut with extended footage previously unseen in North American cinemas .",

An allegory for gender stereotypes and internalized homophobia , the film stars Daniel MacIvor as a fairy who approaches a surgical team ( Holly Cole as the doctor and Micah Barnes as the nurse ) to have his wings removed so that he can become a normal human being , after facing anti-fairy discrimination . Following a musical debate between the three , the doctor agrees to perform the surgery . As he leaves the clinic the now-wingless fairy is initially happy to be just like everyone else around him , but soon comes to regret his decision as he belatedly realizes the unique qualities and gifts , such as the ability to fly , that he has given up by pushing his identity into the closet . Michael Kennard and John Turner , in character as the clown duo Mump and Smoot , also appear in the film , depicted as reading the story in the form of a book they have found on the sidewalk . MacIvor also wrote the film 's screenplay . The film also won the award for Best Short Film at the Seattle International Film Festival in 1993 .

  "/wiki/Autobiographical_novel": "An autobiographical novel is a form of novel using autofiction techniques , or the merging of autobiographical and fictive elements . The literary technique is distinguished from an autobiography or memoir by the stipulation of being fiction . Because an autobiographical novel is partially fiction , the author does not ask the reader to expect the text to fulfill the autobiographical pact . Names and locations are often changed and events are recreated to make them more dramatic but the story still bears a close resemblance to that of the author 's life . While the events of the author 's life are recounted , there is no pretense of exact truth . Events may be exaggerated or altered for artistic or thematic purposes . Novels that portray settings and/or situations with which the author is familiar are not necessarily autobiographical . Neither are novels that include aspects drawn from the author 's life as minor plot details . To be considered an autobiographical novel by most standards , there must be a protagonist modeled after the author and a central plotline that mirrors events in his or her life . Novels that do not fully meet these requirements or are further distanced from true events are sometimes called semi-autobiographical novels . Many novels about intense , private experiences such as war , family conflict or sex , are written as autobiographical novels . Some works openly refer to themselves as 'nonfiction novels . '",

  "/wiki/Gay": "Gay is a term that primarily refers to a homosexual person or the trait of being homosexual . The term was originally used to mean carefree , cheerful , or bright and showy . The term 's use as a reference to homosexuality may date as early as the late 19th century , but its use gradually increased in the mid-20th century . In modern English , gay has come to be used as an adjective , and as a noun , referring to the community , practices and cultures associated with homosexuality . In the 1960s , gay became the word favored by homosexual men to describe their sexual orientation . By the end of the 20th century , the word gay was recommended by major LGBT groups and style guides to describe people attracted to members of the same sex . At about the same time , a new , pejorative use became prevalent in some parts of the world . Among younger speakers , the word has a meaning ranging from derision ( e.g. , equivalent to rubbish or stupid ) to a light-hearted mockery or ridicule ( e.g. , equivalent to weak , unmanly , or lame ) . In this use , the word rarely means homosexual , as it is often used , for example , to refer to an inanimate object or abstract concept of which one disapproves . The extent to which these usages still retain connotations of homosexuality has been debated and harshly criticized ."
