  "/wiki/Spanish_culture": "The culture of Spain is based on a variety of historical influences , primarily based on pre-Roman Celtic and Iberian culture . [ citation needed ] Other ancient peoples such as Romans , Phoenicians , Carthaginians , and Greeks also had some influence . In the areas of language and also religion , the Ancient Romans left a lasting legacy in the Spanish culture because Rome created Hispania as a political , legal and administrative unit . The subsequent course of Spanish history added other elements to the country 's culture and traditions . The Visigothic Kingdom left a united Christian Hispania that was going to be welded in the Reconquista . The Visigoths kept the Roman legacy in Spain between the fall of the Roman Empire and the Early Middle Ages . Muslim influences remained during the Middle Ages in the areas conquered by the Umayyads , however , these influences had not been completely assimilated into the Spanish culture . Spanish culture before and after the arrival of the Muslims was based heavily on Roman heritage and the primary religion practised was Catholicism . A comparison can be drawn with the North African nations , who also lived under the Roman Empire before Muslim rule . However , there is scarce reminder of the Roman presence in North Africa as the predominant culture is Arabic nowadays . Around 75% of modern Spanish language is derived from Latin . Ancient Greek has also contributed substantially to Spanish vocabulary , especially through Latin , where it had a great impact .",

Verne is generally considered a major literary author in France and most of Europe , where he has had a wide influence on the literary avant-garde and on surrealism . His reputation was markedly different in Anglophone regions where he had often been labeled a writer of genre fiction or children 's books , largely because of the highly abridged and altered translations in which his novels have often been printed ( until the 1980s , when his literary reputation . began to improve ) .
