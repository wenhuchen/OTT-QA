  "/wiki/Bahamas": "The Bahamas ( /b\u0259\u02c8h\u0251\u02d0m\u0259z/ ( listen ) ) , known officially as the Commonwealth of The Bahamas , is a country within the Lucayan Archipelago in the West Indies . It is a member of the Commonwealth Realms under the monarchy of Queen Elizabeth II . The archipelagic state consists of more than 700 islands , cays , and islets in the Atlantic Ocean , and is located north of Cuba and Hispaniola Island ( Haiti and the Dominican Republic ) , northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands , southeast of the U.S. state of Florida , and east of the Florida Keys . The capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence . The Royal Bahamas Defence Force describes the Bahamas ' territory as encompassing 470,000 km2 ( 180,000 sq mi ) of ocean space . The Bahamas were inhabited by the Lucayans , a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Ta\u00edno people , for many centuries . Columbus was the first European to see the islands , making his first landfall in the 'New World ' in 1492 . Later , the Spanish shipped the native Lucayans to slavery on Hispaniola , after which the Bahama islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648 , when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera . The Bahamas became a British crown colony in 1718 , when the British clamped down on piracy . After the American Revolutionary War , the Crown resettled thousands of American Loyalists to the Bahamas ; they took their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants . African slaves and their descendants constituted the majority of the population from this period on . The slave trade was abolished by the British in 1807 ; slavery in the Bahamas was abolished in 1834 .",

  "/wiki/Asylum_seekers": "An asylum seeker ( also rarely called an asylee applicant ) is a person who flees their home country , enters another country and applies for asylum , i.e . the right to international protection , in this other country . An asylum seeker is a type of migrant and may be a refugee , a displaced person , but not an economic migrant . Migrants are not necessarily asylum seekers . A person becomes an asylum seeker by making a formal application for the right to remain in another country and keeps that status until the application has been concluded . The applicant becomes an asylee if their claim is accepted and asylum is granted . The relevant immigration authorities of the country of asylum determine whether the asylum seeker will be granted protection and become an officially recognised refugee ( asylee ) or whether asylum will be refused and asylum seeker becomes an illegal immigrant who has to leave the country and may even be deported . The asylum seeker may be recognised as a refugee and given refugee status if the person 's circumstances fall into the definition of refugee according to the 1951 Refugee Convention or other refugee laws , such as the European Convention on Human Rights - if asylum is claimed within the European Union . However signatories to the refugee convention create their own policies for assessing the protection status of asylum seekers , and the proportion of asylum applicants who are rejected varies from country to country and year to year . The terms asylum seeker and refugee are often confused : an asylum-seeker is someone who says he or she is a refugee , but whose claim has not yet been definitively evaluated . On average , about 1 million people seek asylum on an individual basis every year . Non-governmental organizations concerned with refugees and asylum seekers have pointed out difficulties for displaced persons to seek asylum in industrialized countries .",

Construction of the camp began in 1935 and it was opened in 1936 , when it quickly proved to be a success with a need for expansion . The camp included dining and recreation facilities , such as dance halls and sports fields .
