The World Wide Web Consortium 's XML 1.0 Specification of 1998 and several other related specifications - all of them free open standards - define XML . The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity , generality , and usability across the Internet . It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages . Although the design of XML focuses on documents , the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web services . Several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of XML-based languages , while programmers have developed many application programming interfaces ( APIs ) to aid the processing of XML data .",
  "/wiki/DocBook": "DocBook is a semantic markup language for technical documentation . It was originally intended for writing technical documents related to computer hardware and software but it can be used for any other sort of documentation . As a semantic language , DocBook enables its users to create document content in a presentation-neutral form that captures the logical structure of the content ; that content can then be published in a variety of formats , including HTML , XHTML , EPUB , PDF , man pages , Web help and HTML Help , without requiring users to make any changes to the source . In other words , when a document is written in DocBook format it becomes easily portable into other formats , rather than needing to be rewritten .",

  "/wiki/HTML": "Hypertext Markup Language ( HTML ) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser . It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) and scripting languages such as JavaScript . Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages . HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document . HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages . With HTML constructs , images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page . HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings , paragraphs , lists , links , quotes and other items . HTML elements are delineated by tags , written using angle brackets . Tags such as < img / > and < input / > directly introduce content into the page . Other tags such as < p > surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements . Browsers do not display the HTML tags , but use them to interpret the content of the page . HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript , which affects the behavior and content of web pages .",

  "/wiki/Music_notation": "Music notation or musical notation is any system used to visually represent aurally perceived music played with instruments or sung by the human voice through the use of written , printed , or otherwise-produced symbols . Types and methods of notation have varied between cultures and throughout history , and much information about ancient music notation is fragmentary . Even in the same time period , such as in the 2010s , different styles of music and different cultures use different music notation methods ; for example , for professional classical music performers , sheet music using staves and noteheads is the most common way of notating music , but for professional country music session musicians , the Nashville Number System is the main method . The symbols used include ancient symbols and modern symbols made upon any media such as symbols cut into stone , made in clay tablets , made using a pen on papyrus or parchment or manuscript paper ; printed using a printing press ( c. 1400s ) , a computer printer ( c. 1980s ) or other printing or modern copying technology . Although many ancient cultures used symbols to represent melodies and rhythms , none of them were particularly comprehensive , and this has limited today 's understanding of their music . The seeds of what would eventually become modern western notation were sown in medieval Europe , starting with the Catholic Church 's goal for ecclesiastical uniformity . The church began notating plainchant melodies so that the same chants could be used throughout the church . Music notation developed further in the Renaissance and Baroque music eras . In the classical period ( 1750-1820 ) and the Romantic music era ( 1820-1900 ) , notation continued to develop as new musical instrument technologies were developed . In the contemporary classical music of the 20th and 21st century , music notation has continued to develop , with the introduction of graphical notation by some modern composers and the use , since the 1980s , of computer-based score writer programs for notating music . Music notation has been adapted to many kinds of music , including classical music , popular music , and traditional music .",

  "/wiki/E-mail": "Electronic mail ( email or e-mail ) is a method of exchanging messages ( mail ) between people using electronic devices . Invented by Ray Tomlinson , email first entered limited use in the 1960s and by the mid-1970s had taken the form now recognized as email . Email operates across computer networks , which today is primarily the Internet . Some early email systems required the author and the recipient to both be online at the same time , in common with instant messaging . Today 's email systems are based on a store-and-forward model . Email servers accept , forward , deliver , and store messages . Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously ; they need to connect only briefly , typically to a mail server or a webmail interface for as long as it takes to send or receive messages or to download it . Originally an ASCII text-only communications medium , Internet email was extended by Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions ( MIME ) to carry text in other character sets and multimedia content attachments . International email , with internationalized email addresses using UTF-8 , has been standardized , but as of 2017 [ update ] it has not been widely adopted . The history of modern Internet email services reaches back to the early ARPANET , with standards for encoding email messages published as early as 1973 ( RFC 561 ) . An email message sent in the early 1970s looks very similar to a basic email sent today .",

  "/wiki/Mathematics": "Mathematics ( from Greek \u03bc\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 m\u00e1th\u0113ma , knowledge , study , learning ) includes the study of such topics as quantity ( number theory ) , structure ( algebra ) , space ( geometry ) , and change ( mathematical analysis ) . It has no generally accepted definition . Mathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures ; they resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof . When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena , mathematical reasoning can be used to provide insight or predictions about nature . Through the use of abstraction and logic , mathematics developed from counting , calculation , measurement , and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects . Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist . The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry . Rigorous arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics , most notably in Euclid 's Elements . Since the pioneering work of Giuseppe Peano ( 1858-1932 ) , David Hilbert ( 1862-1943 ) , and others on axiomatic systems in the late 19th century , it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions . Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance , when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day . Mathematics is essential in many fields , including natural science , engineering , medicine , finance , and the social sciences . Applied mathematics has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines , such as statistics and game theory .",
  "/wiki/Music_Encoding_Initiative": "The Music Encoding Initiative ( MEI ) is an open-source effort to create a system for representation of musical documents in a machine-readable structure . MEI closely mirrors work done by text scholars in the Text Encoding Initiative ( TEI ) and while the two encoding initiatives are not formally related , they share many common characteristics and development practices . The term MEI , like TEI , describes the governing organization and the markup language . The MEI community solicits input and development directions from specialists in various music research communities , including technologists , librarians , historians , and theorists in a common effort to discuss and define best practices for representing a broad range of musical documents and structures . The results of these discussions are then formalized into the MEI schema , a core set of rules for recording physical and intellectual characteristics of music notation documents . This schema is expressed in an XML Schema Language , with RelaxNG being the preferred format . The MEI schema is developed using the One-Document-Does-it-all ( ODD ) format , a literate programming XML format developed by the Text Encoding Initiative . MEI is often used for music metadata catalogs , critical editing ( particularly of early music ) , and OMR-based data collection and interchange . MEI uses permissive software licence ; the Educational Community License , Version 2.0 , ( related to the Apache license , 2.0 ) .
