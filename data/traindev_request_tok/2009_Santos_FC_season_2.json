  "/wiki/Association_football_positions": "In the sport of association football , each of the 11 players on a team is assigned to a particular position on the field of play . A team is made up of one goalkeeper and ten outfield players who fill various defensive , midfield , and attacking positions depending on the formation deployed . These positions describe both the player 's main role and their area of operation on the pitch . In the early development of the game , formations were much more offensively aggressive , with the 1-2-7 being prominent in the late 1800s . In the latter part of the 19th century , the 2-3-5 formation became widely used and the position names became more refined to reflect this . In defence , there were full-backs , known as the left-back and right-back ; in midfield , left-half , centre-half and right-half ; and for the forward line there were outside-left ( or left wing ) , inside-left , centre-forward , inside-right and outside-right ( or right wing ) . As the game has evolved , tactics and team formations have changed and so many of the names of the positions have changed to reflect their duties in the modern game ( though some old familiar ones remain ) . The term half-back fell out of use by the early 1970s and midfield was used in naming the positions that play around the middle third as in centre midfield and wide midfield . The fluid nature of the modern game means that positions in football are not as rigidly defined as in sports such as rugby or American football . Even so , most players will play in a limited range of positions throughout their career , as each position requires a particular set of skills and physical attributes . Footballers who are able to play comfortably in a number of positions are referred to as utility players . However , in Total Football tactics , the players are only loosely defined into a position .",
  "/wiki/Midfielder": "A midfielder is an association football position . Midfielders are generally positioned on the field between their team 's defenders and forwards . Some midfielders play a disciplined defensive role , breaking up attacks , and are otherwise known as defensive midfielders . Others blur the boundaries , being more mobile and efficient in passing : they are commonly referred to as deep-lying midfielders , play-makers , box-to-box , or holding midfielders . The number of midfielders on a team and their assigned roles depends on the team 's formation ; the collective group of these players on the field is sometimes referred to as the midfield . Most managers assign at least one midfielder to disrupt the opposing team 's attacks , while others may be tasked with creating goals , or have equal responsibilities between attack and defence . Midfielders are the players who typically travel the greatest distance during a match . Because midfielders arguably have the most possession during a game they are among the fittest players on the pitch .",
