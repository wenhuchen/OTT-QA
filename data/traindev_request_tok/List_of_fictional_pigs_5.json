  "/wiki/Cybernetics": "Cybernetics is a transdisciplinary approach for exploring regulatory systems - their structures , constraints , and possibilities . Norbert Wiener defined cybernetics in 1948 as the scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine . In other words , it is the scientific study of how humans , animals and machines control and communicate with each other . Cybernetics is applicable when a system being analyzed incorporates a closed signaling loop - originally referred to as a circular causal relationship - that is , where action by the system generates some change in its environment and that change is reflected in the system in some manner ( feedback ) that triggers a system change . Cybernetics is relevant to , for example , mechanical , physical , biological , cognitive , and social systems . The essential goal of the broad field of cybernetics is to understand and define the functions and processes of systems that have goals and that participate in circular , causal chains that move from action to sensing to comparison with desired goal , and again to action . Its focus is how anything ( digital , mechanical or biological ) processes information , reacts to information , and changes or can be changed to better accomplish the first two tasks . Cybernetics includes the study of feedback , black boxes and derived concepts such as communication and control in living organisms , machines and organizations including self-organization . Concepts studied by cyberneticists include , but are not limited to : learning , cognition , adaptation , social control , emergence , convergence , communication , efficiency , efficacy , and connectivity . In cybernetics these concepts ( otherwise already objects of study in other disciplines such as biology and engineering ) are abstracted from the context of the specific organism or device . The word cybernetics comes from Greek \u03ba\u03c5\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae ( kybern\u0113tik\u1e17 ) , meaning governance , i.e. , all that are pertinent to \u03ba\u03c5\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c9 ( kybern\u00e1\u014d ) , the latter meaning to steer , navigate or govern , hence \u03ba\u03c5\u03b2\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 ( kyb\u00e9rn\u0113sis ) , meaning government , is the government while \u03ba\u03c5\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 ( kybern\u1e17t\u0113s ) is the governor or helmperson of the ship .

The format of Sesame Street consists of a combination of commercial television production elements and techniques which have evolved to reflect the changes in American culture and the audience 's viewing habits . With the creation of Sesame Street , producers and writers of a children 's television show used , for the first time , educational goals and a curriculum to shape its content . It was also the first time a show 's educational effects were formally studied . The show , therefore , has undergone significant changes in its history as adjustments to the format and content have been made to reflect change sources to the curriculum . Shortly after creating Sesame Street , its producers developed what came to be called the CTW model ( after the production company 's previous name ) , a system of television show planning , production , and evaluation based on collaborations between producers , writers , educators , and researchers . The show was initially funded by government and private foundations but has become somewhat self-supporting due to revenues from licensing arrangements , international sales , and other media .

  "/wiki/Cerebral_cortex": "The cerebral cortex ( plural cortices ) , also known as the cerebral mantle , is the outer layer of neural tissue of the cerebrum of the brain in humans and other mammals . It is separated into two cortices , by the longitudinal fissure that divides the cerebrum into the left and right cerebral hemispheres . The two hemispheres are joined beneath the cortex by the corpus callosum . The cerebral cortex is the largest site of neural integration in the central nervous system . It plays a key role in attention , perception , awareness , thought , memory , language , and consciousness . In most mammals , apart from small mammals that have small brains , the cerebral cortex is folded , providing a greater surface area in the confined volume of the cranium . Apart from minimising brain and cranial volume , cortical folding is crucial for the wiring of the brain and its functional organisation . In mammals with a small brain there is no folding and the cortex is smooth . A fold or ridge in the cortex is termed a gyrus ( plural gyri ) and a groove is termed a sulcus ( plural sulci ) . These surface convolutions appear during fetal development and continue to mature after birth through the process of gyrification . In the human brain the majority of the cerebral cortex is not visible from the outside , but buried in the sulci , and the insular cortex is completely hidden . The major sulci and gyri mark the divisions of the cerebrum into the lobes of the brain .",

During the Industrial Revolution , it became one of the most industrialised parts of the UK with coal mines , coking , iron foundries , glass factories , brickworks and steel mills producing a high level of air pollution . The first trace of the phrase The Black Country as an expression dates from the 1840s . The name is believed to come from the soot from the heavy industries that covered the area , although the 30-foot-thick ( 10-metre ) coal seam close to the surface is another possible origin . The 14-mile ( 23 km ) road between Wolverhampton and Birmingham was described as one continuous town in 1785 . Although the heavy polluting industry that gave the region its name has long since disappeared , a sense of shared history and tradition in the area has kept the term in use . In addition , the regeneration of the area by local and national government has brought official recognition to the region and to some extent defined its boundary .",
