The Cubs are one of two major league teams in Chicago ; the other , the Chicago White Sox , is a member of the American League ( AL ) Central division . The Cubs , first known as the White Stockings , were a founding member of the NL in 1876 , becoming the Chicago Cubs in 1903 . The Cubs have appeared in a total of eleven World Series . The 1906 Cubs won 116 games , finishing 116-36 and posting a modern-era record winning percentage of .763 , before losing the World Series to the Chicago White Sox ( The Hitless Wonders ) by four games to two . The Cubs won back-to-back World Series championships in 1907 and 1908 , becoming the first major league team to play in three consecutive World Series , and the first to win it twice . Most recently , the Cubs won the 2016 National League Championship Series and 2016 World Series , which ended a 71-year National League pennant drought and a 108-year World Series championship drought , both of which are record droughts in Major League Baseball . The 108-year drought was also the longest such occurrence in all major North American sports . Since the start of divisional play in 1969 , the Cubs have appeared in the postseason ten times through the 2019 season . The Cubs are known as the North Siders , a reference to the location of Wrigley Field within the city of Chicago , and in contrast to the White Sox , whose home field ( Guaranteed Rate Field ) is located on the South Side .",

  "/wiki/Washington_Nationals": "The Washington Nationals are an American professional baseball team based in Washington , D.C . The Nationals compete in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) as a member club of the National League ( NL ) East division . From 2005 to 2007 , the team played in RFK Stadium while their permanent stadium was being built . In 2008 , they moved in to Nationals Park , located on South Capitol Street in the Southeast quadrant of D.C. , near the Anacostia River . The Nationals are the eighth major league franchise to be based in Washington , D.C. , and the first since 1971 . The current franchise was founded in 1969 as the Montreal Expos as part of the MLB expansion . After a failed contraction plan , the Expos were purchased by MLB , which sought to relocate the team to a new city . Washington , D.C. was chosen in 2004 , and the Nationals were established in 2005 as the first franchise relocation in MLB since the third Washington Senators moved to Texas in 1971 . While the team initially struggled after moving to Washington , the Nationals had considerable success throughout the 2010s . The team 's two overall first picks in the MLB draft , Stephen Strasburg in 2009 and Bryce Harper in 2010 , attracted new levels of attention to the team . They achieved their first playoff berth and first division title in 2012 , but were knocked out in the NLDS . They won the National League East again in 2014 , 2016 , and 2017 , but were eliminated in the NLDS each time ."
