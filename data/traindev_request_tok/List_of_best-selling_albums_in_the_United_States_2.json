With a line-up comprising John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison and Ringo Starr , they are regarded as the most influential band of all time .

Rooted in skiffle , beat and 1950s rock and roll , their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways ; the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock . As pioneers in recording , songwriting and artistic presentation , the group revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era 's youth and sociocultural movements . Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney , the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960 , initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass . The core trio of Lennon , McCartney and Harrison , together since 1958 , went through a succession of drummers , including Pete Best , before asking Starr to join them in 1962 . Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings , greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit , Love Me Do , in late 1962 . As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed Beatlemania , the band acquired the nickname the Fab Four , with Epstein , Martin and other members of the band 's entourage sometimes given the informal title of fifth Beatle . By early 1964 , the Beatles were international stars , leading the British Invasion of the United States pop market and breaking numerous sales records . They soon made their film debut with A Hard Day 's Night ( 1964 ) . From 1965 onwards , they produced increasingly innovative recordings , including the albums Rubber Soul ( 1965 ) , Revolver ( 1966 ) and Sgt .",

Its plain white sleeve has no graphics or text other than the band 's name embossed , [ a ] which was intended as a direct contrast to the vivid cover artwork of the band 's previous LP Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . The Beatles is recognised for its fragmentary style and diverse range of genres , including folk , British blues , ska , music hall and the avant-garde . It has since been viewed by some critics as a postmodern work , as well as among the greatest albums of all time . Most of the songs on the album were written during March and April 1968 at a Transcendental Meditation course in Rishikesh , India . There , the only western instrument available to the band was the acoustic guitar ; some of these songs remained acoustic on The Beatles and were recorded solo , or only by part of the group . The production aesthetic ensured that the album 's sound was scaled-down and less reliant on studio innovation , relative to all their releases since 1966 's Revolver . The Beatles also broke with the band 's recent tradition of incorporating several musical styles in one song by keeping each piece of music consistently faithful to a select genre . At the end of May 1968 , the Beatles returned to EMI Studios in London to commence recording sessions that lasted through to mid-October . During these sessions , arguments broke out among the foursome over creative differences and John Lennon 's new partner , Yoko Ono , whose constant presence subverted the Beatles ' policy regarding wives and girlfriends in the studio .
