  "/wiki/Norman_people": "The Normans ( Norman : Normaunds ; French : Normands ; Latin : Nortmanni/Normanni ; Old Norse : Nor\u00f0ma\u00f0r ) are an ethnic group that arose from contact between Norse Viking settlers of a region in France , named Normandy after them , and indigenous Franks and Gallo-Romans . The settlements in France followed a series of raids on the French coast from mainly Norway , but also Denmark , and Iceland , and they gained political legitimacy when the Viking leader Rollo agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia . The distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the Normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century , and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries . The Norman dynasty had a major political , cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and the Near East . The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Catholic piety , becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy of the Romance community into which they assimilated . They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled , their dialect becoming known as Norman , Normaund or Norman French , an important literary language which is still spoken today in parts of Normandy and the nearby Channel Islands . The Duchy of Normandy , which they formed by treaty with the French crown , was a great fief of medieval France , and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure . The Normans are noted both for their culture , such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions , and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations . Norman adventurers played a role in founding the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after briefly conquering southern Italy and Malta from the Saracens and Byzantines , during an expedition on behalf of their duke , William the Conqueror , which also led to the Norman conquest of England at the historic Battle of Hastings in 1066 . Norman and Anglo-Norman forces contributed to the Iberian Reconquista from the early eleventh to the mid-thirteenth centuries . Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East , where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant , to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain , to Ireland , and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands . The legacy of the Normans persists today through the regional languages and dialects of France , England , Spain , and Sicily , as well as the various cultural , judicial , and political arrangements they introduced in their conquered territories .",

  "/wiki/Thomond": "Thomond ( Classical Irish : Tuadhmhumhain ; Modern Irish : Tuamhain ) was a kingdom of Gaelic Ireland , associated geographically with present-day County Clare and County Limerick , as well as parts of County Tipperary around Nenagh and its hinterland . The kingdom represented the core homeland of the D\u00e1l gCais people , although there were other Gaels in the area such as the \u00c9ile and E\u00f3ganachta , and even the Norse of Limerick . It existed from the collapse of the Kingdom of Munster in the 12th century as competition between the \u00d3 Briain and the Mac C\u00e1rthaigh led to the schism between Thomond ( North Munster ) and Desmond ( South Munster ) . It continued to exist outside of the Anglo-Norman controlled Lordship of Ireland until the 16th century . The exact origin of Thomond , originally as an internal part of Munster , is debated . It is generally held that the D\u00e9isi Muman pushed north-west starting from the 5th to the early 8th century , taking the area from the U\u00ed Fiachrach Aidhne of the Connachta . Eventually , the D\u00e1l gCais rose to power in all of Munster , to the detriment of the E\u00f3ganachta . The person most famously associated with this is Brian B\u00f3ruma , High King of Ireland , best known for his feats at the Battle of Clontarf . Four generations down the line and after providing three more High Kings , the D\u00e1l gCais were unable to hold onto all of Munster and so Thomond came into being as a separate entity . Between the mid-12th and late 13th century , when much of Ireland came under direct English control and/or settlement , Thomond too came into the Anglo-Irish sphere . The de Clare family established a colony at Bunratty , while the Butler and FitzGerald families also made inroads . However , from the time of the Battle of Dysert O'Dea , Thomond was restored as a kingdom , with its rulers reinstating Limerick within their overrule .",

  "/wiki/Viking": "Vikings [ a ] were Scandinavians , who from the late 8th to late 11th centuries , raided and traded from their Northern European homelands across wide areas of Europe , and explored westwards to Iceland , Greenland , and Vinland . The term is also commonly extended in modern English and other vernaculars to include the inhabitants of Norse home communities during what has become known as the Viking Age , 793-1066 AD . This period of Nordic military , mercantile and demographic expansion constitutes an important element in the early medieval history of Scandinavia , Estonia , the British Isles , France , Kievan Rus ' and Sicily . Facilitated by advanced sailing and navigational skills , and characterised by the longship , Viking activities at times also extended into the Mediterranean littoral , North Africa , and the Middle East . Following extended phases of ( primarily sea- or river-borne ) exploration , expansion and settlement , Viking ( Norse ) communities and governments were established in diverse areas of north-western Europe , Belarus , Ukraine and European Russia , the North Atlantic islands and as far as the north-eastern coast of North America . This period of expansion witnessed the wider dissemination of Norse culture , while simultaneously introducing strong foreign cultural influences into Scandinavia itself , with profound developmental implications in both directions . Popular , modern conceptions of the Vikings - the term frequently applied casually to their modern descendants and the inhabitants of modern Scandinavia - often strongly differ from the complex picture that emerges from archaeology and historical sources . A romanticised picture of Vikings as noble savages began to emerge in the 18th century ; this developed and became widely propagated during the 19th-century Viking revival . Perceived views of the Vikings as alternatively violent , piratical heathens or as intrepid adventurers owe much to conflicting varieties of the modern Viking myth that had taken shape by the early 20th century . Current popular representations of the Vikings are typically based on cultural clich\u00e9s and stereotypes , complicating modern appreciation of the Viking legacy . These representations are not always accurate - for example , there is no evidence that they wore horned helmets , a costuming element that first appeared in Wagnerian opera .",

He was the son of Niall No\u00edgiallach . His by-name Gulban derives from Benn Ghulbain in County Sligo , from which centre the sons of Niall set out upon their conquest of the North . King Conall Gulban was murdered by the Masraige at Magh Sl\u00e9cht ( located in the west of modern County Cavan ) in 464 , on a Friday . He was buried by Saint Caillin at Fenagh , County Leitrim .

However , more recent dating of the haplotype and corresponding SNP mutation M222 strongly indicates that all men carrying this signature are instead male-line descendants of a single man who lived several thousand years ago , well before the lifetime of Niall , essentially debunking the Niall hypothesis . If Niall was a real life figure , he may have belonged to this male lineage , but this is not certain . Notably , many O'Neills and McShanes ( a surname associated with a line of O'Neill cadets ) arise from an entirely different lineage . [ citation needed ]",

Up to the 9th century it consisted of several independent major kingdoms ( L\u00faighne , U\u00ed Maine , and Iarthar Connacht ) . Between the reigns of Conchobar mac Taidg M\u00f3r ( died 882 ) and his descendant , Aedh mac Ruaidri \u00d3 Conchobair ( reigned 1228-33 ) , it became a kingdom under the rule of the U\u00ed Bri\u00fain A\u00ed dynasty , whose ruling sept adopted the surname Ua Conchobair . At its greatest extent , it incorporated the often independent Kingdom of Breifne , as well as vassalage from the lordships of western Mide and west Leinster . Two of its greatest kings , Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair ( 1088-1156 ) and his son Ruaidri Ua Conchobair ( c.1115-1198 ) greatly expanded the kingdom 's dominance , so much so that both became Kings of Ireland . The Kingdom of Connacht collapsed in the 1230s because of civil war within the royal dynasty , which enabled widespread Anglo-Irish settlement under Richard M\u00f3r de Burgh , 1st Baron of Connaught , and his successors . The English colony in Connacht shrank from c. 1300 to c. 1360 , with events such as the 1307 battle of Ahascragh ( see Donnchad Muimnech \u00d3 Cellaigh ) , the 1316 Second Battle of Athenry and the murder in June 1333 of William Donn de Burgh , 3rd Earl of Ulster , all leading to Gaelic resurgence and colonial withdrawal to towns such as Ballinrobe , Loughrea , Athenry , and Galway . Well into the 16th century kingdoms such as U\u00ed Maine and T\u00edr Fh\u00edacrach M\u00faaidhe remained beyond English rule , while many Anglo-Irish families such as de Burgh , de Bermingham , de Exeter , de Staunton , became entirely Gaelicised . Only in the late 1500s , during the Tudor conquest of Ireland , was Connacht shired into its present counties . The province of Connacht has the highest number of Irish language speakers among the four Irish provinces . Currently , the total percentage of people who consider themselves as Irish speakers in Connacht is 39.8% ( more than 202,000 persons ) . There are Gaeltacht areas in Counties Galway and Mayo .",

She restored to the Church some of the property taken from it in the previous two reigns . She was not able to legislate to force those who , at that time , held property which had been plundered from the Catholic Church and the monasteries . During her five-year reign , Mary had over 280 religious dissenters burned at the stake in the Marian persecutions , which led to her denunciation as Bloody Mary by her Protestant opponents .

Her younger half-brother Edward VI ( son of Henry and Jane Seymour ) succeeded their father in 1547 at the age of nine . When Edward became mortally ill in 1553 , he attempted to remove Mary from the line of succession because he supposed , correctly , that she would reverse the Protestant reforms that had begun during his reign . Upon his death , leading politicians proclaimed Lady Jane Grey as queen . Mary speedily assembled a force in East Anglia and deposed Jane , who was ultimately beheaded .

  "/wiki/Old_Norse": "Old Norse was a North Germanic language that was spoken by inhabitants of Scandinavia and their overseas settlements from about the 9th to the 13th centuries . The Proto-Norse language developed into Old Norse by the 8th century , and Old Norse began to develop into the modern North Germanic languages in the mid- to late 14th century , ending the language phase known as Old Norse . These dates , however , are not absolute , since written Old Norse is found well into the 15th century . Old Norse was divided into three dialects : Old West Norse , Old East Norse , and Old Gutnish . Old West and East Norse formed a dialect continuum , with no clear geographical boundary between them . For example , Old East Norse traits were found in eastern Norway , although Old Norwegian is classified as Old West Norse , and Old West Norse traits were found in western Sweden . Most speakers spoke Old East Norse in what is present-day Denmark and Sweden . Old Gutnish , the more obscure dialectal branch , is sometimes included in the Old East Norse dialect due to geographical associations . It developed its own unique features and shared in changes to both other branches . The 12th-century Icelandic Gray Goose Laws state that Swedes , Norwegians , Icelanders , and Danes spoke the same language , d\u01ebnsk tunga ( Danish tongue ; speakers of Old East Norse would have said dansk tunga ) . Another term , used especially commonly with reference to West Norse , was norr\u0153nt m\u00e1l or norr\u01ffnt m\u00e1l ( Nordic/Northern speech ) .

Proto-Celtic is a descendant of the Proto-Indo-European language and is itself the ancestor of the Celtic languages which are members of the modern Indo-European language family , the most commonly spoken language family . Modern Celtic languages share common features with Italic languages that are unseen in other branches and according to one theory they may have formed an ancient Italo-Celtic branch . The duration of the cultures speaking Proto-Celtic was relatively brief compared to PIEs 2,000 years . The earliest archaeological culture that may justifiably be considered as Proto-Celtic is the Late Bronze Age Urnfield culture of Central Europe c.1300 BCE . By the Iron Age Hallstatt culture of around 800 BC these people had become fully Celtic . The reconstruction of Proto-Celtic is currently being undertaken , by necessity relying on later iterations of Celtic languages . Although Continental Celtic presents much substantiation for Proto-Celtics phonology , and some for its morphology , recorded material is too scanty to allow a secure reconstruction of syntax , although some complete sentences are recorded in the Continental Gaulish and Celtiberian . Therefore , the primary sources for reconstruction come from the Insular Celtic languages with the oldest literature found in Old Irish and Middle Welsh . dating back to authors flourishing in the 6th century CE .",
  "/wiki/Derry/Londonderry_name_dispute": "The names of the city and county of Derry or Londonderry in Northern Ireland are the subject of a naming dispute between Irish nationalists and unionists . Generally , although not always , nationalists favour using the name Derry , and unionists Londonderry . Legally , the city and county are called Londonderry , while the local government district containing the city is called Derry and Strabane . The naming debate became particularly politicised at the outset of the Troubles , with the mention of either name acting as a shibboleth used to associate the speaker with one of Northern Ireland 's two main communities . The district of Derry and Strabane was created in 2015 , subsuming a district created in 1973 with the name Londonderry , which changed to Derry in 1984 .",
