  "/wiki/Manhattan": "Manhattan ( /m\u00e6n\u02c8h\u00e6t\u0259n , m\u0259n-/ ) , often referred to by residents of the New York City area as the City , is the most densely populated of the five boroughs of New York City , and coextensive with the County of New York , one of the original counties of the U.S. state of New York . Manhattan serves as the city 's economic and administrative center , cultural identifier , and historical birthplace . The borough consists mostly of Manhattan Island , bounded by the Hudson , East , and Harlem rivers ; as well as several small adjacent islands . Manhattan additionally contains Marble Hill , a small neighborhood now on the U.S. mainland , that was connected using landfill to the Bronx and separated from the rest of Manhattan by the Harlem River . Manhattan Island is divided into three informally bounded components , each aligned with the borough 's long axis : Lower , Midtown , and Upper Manhattan . Manhattan has been described as the cultural , financial , media , and entertainment capital of the world , and the borough hosts the United Nations Headquarters . Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan , New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world , and Manhattan is home to the world 's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization : the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ . Many multinational media conglomerates are based in Manhattan , and the borough has been the setting for numerous books , films , and television shows . Manhattan real estate has since become among the most expensive in the world , with the value of Manhattan Island , including real estate , estimated to exceed US $ 3 trillion in 2013 ; median residential property sale prices in Manhattan approximated US $ 1,600 per square foot ( $ 17,000/m2 ) as of 2018 , with Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan commanding the highest retail rents in the world , at US $ 3,000 per square foot ( $ 32,000/m2 ) per year in 2017 . Manhattan traces its origins to a trading post founded by colonists from the Dutch Republic in 1624 on Lower Manhattan ; the post was named New Amsterdam in 1626 . Manhattan is historically documented to have been purchased by Dutch colonists from Native Americans in 1626 for 60 guilders , which equals roughly $ 1059 in current terms . The territory and its surroundings came under English control in 1664 and were renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother , the Duke of York .",
  "/wiki/Cooper_Union": "The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art , commonly known as Cooper Union or The Cooper Union and informally referred to , especially during the 19th century , as 'the Cooper Institute , ' is a private college at Cooper Square on the border of the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan , New York City . Inspired in 1830 when Peter Cooper learned about the government-supported \u00c9cole Polytechnique in France , Cooper Union was established in 1859 . The school was built on a radical new model of American higher education based on founder Peter Cooper 's fundamental belief that an education equal to the best technology schools [ then ] established should be accessible to those who qualify , independent of their race , religion , sex , wealth or social status , and should be open and free to all . Cooper envisioned his school replacing the declining master/apprentice system with a higher form of education suited to a new age . Machinery has , in a great measure , driven out the old trades , and the discipline of the old apprentice system has passed away . Our youth in the industrial classes begin life under very different auspices . The situation was particularly dire for girls who rarely had the advantage of apprenticeship and were easily exploited by their employers , and for young women of refinement and general culture thrown upon their own resources by the peculiar conditions and characteristics of American life . All I want , Cooper was remembered often saying , is that these poor women shall earn decent and respectable livings , and especially that they shall be kept from marrying bad husbands . True to his ideals , the institute 's night school was open to boys and girls , and in 1858 , a year before the Cooper Union officially opened , the New York School of Design for Women was moved into the building . The Cooper Union originally offered free courses to its admitted students , and when a four-year undergraduate program was established in 1902 , the school granted each admitted student a full-tuition scholarship . Following its own financial crisis , the school decided to abandon this policy starting in the fall of 2014 . Each incoming student receives at least a half-tuition merit scholarship , with additional school financial support , which is provided on a sliding scale up to full tuition scholarships ( for which a significant number of students qualify ) , based on financial needs .",

Aristotle Onassis died in 1975 , and had directed in his will that half of his estate should be transferred upon his own death to a foundation to be established in Alexander 's name . In 1975 , the executors of the estate accordingly established a pair of foundations , incorporated in Vaduz , Liechtenstein : the Business Foundation , which acts as a holding company for the underlying business interests , and the Alexander S. Onassis Public Benefit Foundation , which is the sole beneficiary of the Business Foundation . The public benefit foundation is based in Athens , Greece . Aristotle 's daughter , Christina Onassis , was the first president of the foundation . The foundation is one of the largest in Europe , using its assets to create scholarship and prize programs , build the $ 75 million Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center in Athens ( designed by London-based hospital architect Llewelyn Davies ) , endow Greek studies chairs at universities , and support other projects . All activities of the Alexander S. Onassis Public Benefit Foundation , from the time of its establishment to the present , are funded exclusively by the profits of the Business Foundation , which engages mainly in shipping and real estate investments .

  "/wiki/Poppenhusen_Institute": "Poppenhusen Institute is a historic building at 114 - 04 14th Road in College Point , Queens that housed the first free kindergarten in America . In addition , this institute provided the first free evening classes for adults ( in America ) . Currently , the Institute operates as a community cultural center . The institute stands at five-stories and was constructed in a stern Victorian style . The Poppenhusen Institute is similar to the Cooper Union Institute in Manhattan : the reason for this is because the so-called home arts and the study of machinery were principally taught free to ambitious residents of the North Shore . It was constructed in 1868 with private funds donated by Conrad Poppenhusen , the benefactor of College Point , New York . He began work on the institute on his 50th birthday in 1868 , when he provided $ 100,000 to set up this project as a private educational venture : this venture remains one of the principal features of College Point . Conrad Poppenhusen 's zeal , ability , and civic pride brought unprecedented prosperity to College Point . The original charter specified that it be open to all , irrespective of race , creed or religion , giving people the opportunity to improve their lives either by preparing them for better jobs or improving their leisure time . The institute was established for vocational training and is also served in the interests of Poppenhusen to provide educational opportunities for industrial workers . This institute was also built with the purpose of teaching English and factory crafts : even though it was still teaching these classes , the English courses have been supplemented or replaced by those in French and Spanish . The reason for this was because certain individuals felt their English was good enough .",

It is New York City 's most populous borough , with an estimated 2,504,700 residents in 2010 . Named after the Dutch village of Breukelen , it shares a land border with the borough of Queens at the western end of Long Island . Brooklyn has several bridge and tunnel connections to the borough of Manhattan across the East River , and the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge connects it with Staten Island . With a land area of 70.82 square miles ( 183.4 km2 ) and water area of 26 square miles ( 67 km2 ) , Kings County is New York state 's fourth-smallest county by land area and third-smallest by total area , though it is the second-largest among the city 's five boroughs . If each borough were ranked as a city , Brooklyn would rank as the third-most populous in the U.S. , after Los Angeles and Chicago . Brooklyn was an independent incorporated city ( and previously an authorized village and town within the provisions of the New York State Constitution ) until January 1 , 1898 , when , after a long political campaign and public relations battle during the 1890s , according to the new Municipal Charter of Greater New York , Brooklyn was consolidated with the other cities , boroughs , and counties to form the modern City of New York , surrounding the Upper New York Bay with five constituent boroughs . The borough continues , however , to maintain a distinct culture . Many Brooklyn neighborhoods are ethnic enclaves . Brooklyn 's official motto , displayed on the Borough seal and flag , is Eendraght Maeckt Maght , which translates from early modern Dutch as Unity makes strength . In the first decades of the 21st century , Brooklyn has experienced a renaissance as an avant-garde destination for hipsters , with concomitant gentrification , dramatic house price increases and a decrease in housing affordability . Since the 2010s , Brooklyn has evolved into a thriving hub of entrepreneurship , high technology startup firms , postmodern art and design .",
