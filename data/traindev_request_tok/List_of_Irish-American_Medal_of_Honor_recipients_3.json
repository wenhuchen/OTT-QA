  "/wiki/United_States_Army": "The United States Army ( USA ) is the land warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces . It is one of the eight U.S. uniformed services , and is designated as the Army of the United States in the U.S. Constitution . As the oldest and most senior branch of the U.S. military in order of precedence , the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army , which was formed ( 14 June 1775 ) to fight the American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) - before the United States of America was established as a country . After the Revolutionary War , the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784 to replace the disbanded Continental Army . The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army , and considers its institutional inception to be the origin of that armed force in 1775 . As a uniformed military service , the U.S. Army is part of the Department of the Army , which is one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense . The U.S. Army is headed by a civilian senior appointed civil servant , the secretary of the Army ( SECARMY ) and by a chief military officer , the chief of staff of the Army ( CSA ) who is also a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . It is the largest military branch , and in the fiscal year 2017 , the projected end strength for the Regular Army ( USA ) was 476,000 soldiers ; the Army National Guard ( ARNG ) had 343,000 soldiers and the U.S. Army Reserve ( USAR ) had 199,000 soldiers ; the combined-component strength of the U.S. Army was 1,018,000 soldiers . As a branch of the armed forces , the mission of the U.S. Army is to fight and win our Nation 's wars , by providing prompt , sustained land dominance , across the full range of military operations and the spectrum of conflict , in support of combatant commanders . The branch participates in conflicts worldwide and is the major ground-based offensive and defensive force of the United States .",

The U.S. Navy traces its origins to the Continental Navy , which was established during the American Revolutionary War and was effectively disbanded as a separate entity shortly thereafter . After suffering significant loss of goods and personnel at the hands of the Barbary pirates from Algiers , the U.S. Congress passed the Naval Act of 1794 for the construction of six heavy frigates , the first ships of the U.S. Navy . The U.S. Navy played a major role in the American Civil War by blockading the Confederacy and seizing control of its rivers . It played the central role in the World War II defeat of Imperial Japan . The U.S. Navy emerged from World War II as the most powerful navy in the world . The 21st century U.S. Navy maintains a sizable global presence , deploying in strength in such areas as the Western Pacific , the Mediterranean , and the Indian Ocean . It is a blue-water navy with the ability to project force onto the littoral regions of the world , engage in forward deployments during peacetime and rapidly respond to regional crises , making it a frequent actor in U.S. foreign and military policy .",

( Striking is no longer authorized in the USCG ) It is also possible cross rate to Gunner 's Mate . Cross rating refers to the act of an enlisted sailor crossing from their current rating to another rating of their choice , provided their ASVAB scores are high enough and there are open slots for the rate . The Gunner 's Mate A school is held at Naval Training Center Great Lakes , Illinois and Yorktown , VA for the USCG . In its early years , the school was very hands-on , but it is now primarily conducted through technical educational tools , such as self-study computer-based training ( CBT ) . Training focuses on the operation , maintenance , and troubleshooting of naval guns , missile launchers and torpedoes as well as a strong emphasis on basic explosives , guidance and tracking systems , small arms , Naval ammunition classification , and safety . Upon completion of this basic training , enlisted members often continue on to a specialized C school , where they learn a particular weapons system .",

  "/wiki/Bahamas": "The Bahamas ( /b\u0259\u02c8h\u0251\u02d0m\u0259z/ ( listen ) ) , known officially as the Commonwealth of The Bahamas , is a country within the Lucayan Archipelago in the West Indies . It is a member of the Commonwealth Realms under the monarchy of Queen Elizabeth II . The archipelagic state consists of more than 700 islands , cays , and islets in the Atlantic Ocean , and is located north of Cuba and Hispaniola Island ( Haiti and the Dominican Republic ) , northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands , southeast of the U.S. state of Florida , and east of the Florida Keys . The capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence . The Royal Bahamas Defence Force describes the Bahamas ' territory as encompassing 470,000 km2 ( 180,000 sq mi ) of ocean space . The Bahamas were inhabited by the Lucayans , a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Ta\u00edno people , for many centuries . Columbus was the first European to see the islands , making his first landfall in the 'New World ' in 1492 . Later , the Spanish shipped the native Lucayans to slavery on Hispaniola , after which the Bahama islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648 , when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera . The Bahamas became a British crown colony in 1718 , when the British clamped down on piracy . After the American Revolutionary War , the Crown resettled thousands of American Loyalists to the Bahamas ; they took their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants . African slaves and their descendants constituted the majority of the population from this period on . The slave trade was abolished by the British in 1807 ; slavery in the Bahamas was abolished in 1834 .",

  "/wiki/Corporal": "Corporal is a military rank in use in some form by many militaries and by some police forces or other uniformed organizations . Within NATO , each member nation 's corresponding military rank of corporal is combined under the NATO-standard rank scale code OR-3 or OR-4 . However , there are often differences in how each nation ( or service in each nation ) employs corporals . Some militaries do n't have corporals , but may instead have a Junior Sergeant . In some militaries , the rank of corporal nominally corresponds to commanding a section or squad of soldiers . However , in the United States Army , the rank of corporal is considered a lateral promotion from E-4 Specialist and usually only occurs when the soldier has been selected by a promotion board to become an E-5 Sergeant and is serving in an E-5 billet such as a fireteam leader in a rifle squad . The lateral promotion is used to make the soldier a non-commissioned officer without changing the soldier 's pay . As the Table of Organization & Equipment ( TO & E ) rank of a fire team leader is sergeant and that of squad leader is staff sergeant . In the United States Marine Corps , corporal is the Table of Organization ( TO ) rank for a rifle fire team leader , machine gun team leader , light mortar squad leader , and assault weapon squad leader , as well as gunner on most larger crew served weapons ( i.e . medium mortars , heavy machine guns , and anti-tank missiles ) , armored vehicles ( e.g . tanks , light armored vehicles , and armored assault vehicles ) , and the two assistant gunners on a howitzer ( the gunner is a sergeant ) .

Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea , Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean meet . It is east of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula ( Mexico ) , south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas , west of Haiti and north of both Jamaica and the Cayman Islands . Havana is the largest city and capital ; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camag\u00fcey . The area of the Republic of Cuba is 110,860 square kilometers ( 42,800 sq mi ) ( 109,884 square kilometers ( 42,426 sq mi ) without the territorial waters ) . The island of Cuba is the largest island in Cuba and in the Caribbean , with an area of 105,006 square kilometers ( 40,543 sq mi ) , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola , with over 11 million inhabitants . The territory that is now Cuba was inhabited by the Ciboney Ta\u00edno people from the 4th millennium BC until Spanish colonization in the 15th century . From the 15th century , it was a colony of Spain until the Spanish-American War of 1898 , when Cuba was occupied by the United States and gained nominal independence as a de facto United States protectorate in 1902 . As a fragile republic , in 1940 Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system , but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in a coup and subsequent dictatorship under Fulgencio Batista in 1952 . Open corruption and oppression under Batista 's rule led to his ousting in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement , which afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro . Since 1965 , the state has been governed by the Communist Party of Cuba . The country was a point of contention during the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States , and a nuclear war nearly broke out during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 .",

In most armies the rank of sergeant corresponds to command of a squad ( or section ) . In Commonwealth armies , it is a more senior rank , corresponding roughly to a platoon second-in-command . In the United States Army , sergeant is a more junior rank corresponding to a four-soldier fireteam leader . More senior non-commissioned ranks are often variations on sergeant , for example staff sergeant , first sergeant , and sergeant major .
