  "/wiki/ICC_ODI_Championship": "The ICC ODI Championship is an international One Day International ( ODI ) cricket competition run by the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) . The competition is notional in that it is simply a ranking scheme overlaid on the regular ODI match schedule . After every ODI match , the two teams involved receive points based on a mathematical formula . Each team 's points total is divided by their total number of matches played to give a rating , and all the teams are ranked in a table in order of rating . By analogy to cricket batting averages , the points for winning an ODI match are always greater than the team 's rating , increasing the rating , and the points for losing an ODI match are always less than the rating , reducing the rating . A drawn match between higher and lower rated teams will benefit the lower-rated team at the expense of the higher-rated team . An average team that wins as often as it loses while playing a mix of stronger and weaker teams should have a rating of 100 . As of 13 November 2019 [ update ] , England lead the ICC ODI Championship with a rating of 125 from 54 weighted matches , while the lowest rated team , Papua New Guinea , has a rating of 0 from 17 weighted matches .",
