Its name refers to an urban agglomeration of 9,993 km2 ( 3,858 sq mi ) , comprising a metropolitan area with 31 municipalities , and is also the common name for its city centre . The city occupies much of the coastline of Port Phillip bay and spreads into the hinterlands towards the Dandenong and Macedon ranges , Mornington Peninsula and Yarra Valley . It has a population of 5 million ( 19% of the population of Australia ) , and its inhabitants are referred to as Melburnians . [ note 2 ] The city was founded on 30 August 1835 , in the then-British colony of New South Wales , by free settlers from the colony of Van Diemens Land ( modern-day Tasmania ) . It was incorporated as a Crown settlement in 1837 , and named Melbourne by Governor General Richard Bourke on 10 April 1837 in honour of the British Prime Minister , William Lamb , 2nd Viscount Melbourne . In 1851 , four years after Queen Victoria declared it a city , Melbourne became the capital of the new colony of Victoria . In the wake of the 1850s Victorian gold rush , the city entered a lengthy boom period that , by the late 1880s , had transformed it into one of the world 's largest and wealthiest metropolises . After the federation of Australia in 1901 , it served as interim seat of government of the new nation until Canberra became the permanent capital in 1927 . Today , it is a leading financial centre in the Asia-Pacific region and ranks 15th in the Global Financial Centres Index . Melbourne is home to many of Australia 's best-known landmarks , such as the Melbourne Cricket Ground , the National Gallery of Victoria and the World Heritage-listed Royal Exhibition Building .

As of June 2017 , Sydney 's estimated metropolitan population was 5,230,330 and is home to approximately 65% of the state 's population . Indigenous Australians have inhabited the Sydney area for at least 30,000 years , and thousands of engravings remain throughout the region , making it one of the richest in Australia in terms of Aboriginal archaeological sites . During his first Pacific voyage in 1770 , Lieutenant James Cook and his crew became the first Europeans to chart the eastern coast of Australia , making landfall at Botany Bay and inspiring British interest in the area . In 1788 , the First Fleet of convicts , led by Arthur Phillip , founded Sydney as a British penal colony , the first European settlement in Australia . Phillip named the city Sydney in recognition of Thomas Townshend , 1st Viscount Sydney . Penal transportation to New South Wales ended soon after Sydney was incorporated as a city in 1842 . A gold rush occurred in the colony in 1851 , and over the next century , Sydney transformed from a colonial outpost into a major global cultural and economic centre . After World War II , it experienced mass migration and became one of the most multicultural cities in the world .",

It is named after the city of Perth , Scotland and is Australia 's fourth-most populous city , with a population of 2.06 million living in Greater Perth . Perth is part of the South West Land Division of Western Australia , with most of the metropolitan area on the Swan Coastal Plain , a narrow strip between the Indian Ocean and the Darling Scarp . The first areas settled were on the Swan River at Guildford , with the city 's central business district and port ( Fremantle ) both later founded downriver . Captain James Stirling founded Perth in 1829 as the administrative centre of the Swan River Colony . It gained city status ( currently vested in the smaller City of Perth ) in 1856 and was promoted to the status of a Lord Mayorality in 1929 . The city inherited its name due to the influence of Sir George Murray , then Member of Parliament for Perthshire and Secretary of State for War and the Colonies . The city 's population increased substantially as a result of the Western Australian gold rushes in the late 19th century . During Australia 's involvement in World War II , Fremantle served as a base for submarines operating in the Pacific Theatre , and a US Navy Catalina flying boat fleet was based at Matilda Bay . An influx of immigrants after the war , predominantly from Britain , Italy , Greece , and Yugoslavia , led to rapid population growth . This was followed by a surge in economic activity flowing from several mining booms in the late 20th and early 21st centuries that saw Perth become the regional headquarters for several large mining operations . As part of Perth 's role as the capital of Western Australia , the state 's Parliament and Supreme Court are in the city , as is Government House , the residence of the Governor of Western Australia .",

Named in honour of Queen Adelaide , consort to King William IV , the city was founded in 1836 as the planned capital for the only freely-settled British province in Australia . Colonel William Light , one of Adelaide 's founding fathers , designed the city centre and chose its location close to the River Torrens , in the area originally inhabited by the Kaurna people and known as Tarndanyangga ( place of the red kangaroo ) . Light 's design , now listed as national heritage , set out the city centre in a grid layout , interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares , and entirely surrounded by parklands . Early colonial Adelaide was shaped by the diversity and wealth of its free settlers , in contrast to the convict history of other Australian cities . Until the post-war era , it was Australia 's third-largest city . It has been noted for its leading examples of religious freedom and progressive political reforms , and became known as the City of Churches due to its diversity of faiths . Today , Adelaide is noted for its many festivals and sporting events , its food and wine , its coastline and hills , and its large defence and manufacturing sectors . Adelaide 's quality of life has ranked consistently highly in various measures through the 21st century ."
