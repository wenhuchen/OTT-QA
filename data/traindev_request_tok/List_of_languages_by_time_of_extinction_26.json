  "/wiki/Sumerian_language": "Sumerian ( \ud808\udd74\ud808\udca0 EME.G\u0303IR15 native tongue ) is the language of ancient Sumer and a language isolate that was spoken in Mesopotamia ( modern-day Iraq ) and in Syria . During the 3rd millennium BC , an intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and the Semitic-speaking Akkadians , which included widespread bilingualism . The influence of Sumerian and the East Semitic language Akkadian on each other is evident in all areas , from lexical borrowing on a substantial scale , to syntactic , morphological , and phonological convergence . This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium BC as a Sprachbund . Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as a spoken language around 2000 BC ( the exact dating being subject to debate ) , but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred , ceremonial , literary and scientific language in Akkadian-speaking Mesopotamian states such as Assyria and Babylonia until the 1st century AD . Thereafter it was likely forgotten until the 19th century , when Assyriologists began deciphering the cuneiform inscriptions and excavated tablets left by these speakers .",
  "/wiki/Language_isolate": "A language isolate , in the absolute sense , is a natural language with no demonstrable genealogical ( or genetic ) relationship with other languages , one that has not been demonstrated to descend from an ancestor common with any other language . Language isolates are in effect language families consisting of a single language . Commonly cited examples include Ainu , Basque , Sumerian , Elamite , and Vedda , though in each case a minority of linguists claim to have demonstrated a relationship with other languages . Some sources use the term language isolate to indicate a branch of a larger family with only one surviving member . For instance , Albanian , Armenian and Greek are commonly called Indo-European isolates . While part of the Indo-European family , they do not belong to any established branch ( such as the Romance , Indo-Iranian , Celtic , Slavic or Germanic branches ) , but instead form independent branches . Similarly , within the Romance languages , Sardinian is a relative isolate . However , without a qualifier , isolate is understood to mean having no demonstrable genetic relationship to any other known language . Some languages once seen as isolates may be reclassified as small families . This happened with Japanese ( now included in the Japonic family along with Ryukyuan languages such as Okinawan ) and Korean in Koreanic languages with Jeju language . The Etruscan language of Italy has long been considered an isolate , but some have proposed that it is related to the so-called Tyrsenian languages , an extinct family of closely related ancient languages proposed by Helmut Rix in 1998 , including the Rhaetian language , formerly spoken in the central Alps , and the Lemnian language , formerly spoken on the Greek island of Lemnos . Language isolates may be seen as a special case of unclassified languages that remain unclassified even after extensive efforts .",
  "/wiki/Mesopotamia": "Mesopotamia ( Greek : \u039c\u03b5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 ) is a historical region of Western Asia situated within the Tigris-Euphrates river system , in the northern part of the Fertile Crescent , in modern days roughly corresponding to most of Iraq , Kuwait , the eastern parts of Syria , Southeastern Turkey , and regions along the Turkish-Syrian and Iran-Iraq borders . The Sumerians and Akkadians ( including Assyrians and Babylonians ) dominated Mesopotamia from the beginning of written history ( c. 3100 BC ) to the fall of Babylon in 539 BC , when it was conquered by the Achaemenid Empire . It fell to Alexander the Great in 332 BC , and after his death , it became part of the Greek Seleucid Empire . Around 150 BC , Mesopotamia was under the control of the Parthian Empire . Mesopotamia became a battleground between the Romans and Parthians , with western parts of Mesopotamia coming under ephemeral Roman control . In AD 226 , the eastern regions of Mesopotamia fell to the Sassanid Persians . The division of Mesopotamia between Roman ( Byzantine from AD 395 ) and Sassanid Empires lasted until the 7th century Muslim conquest of Persia of the Sasanian Empire and Muslim conquest of the Levant from Byzantines . A number of primarily neo-Assyrian and Christian native Mesopotamian states existed between the 1st century BC and 3rd century AD , including Adiabene , Osroene , and Hatra . Mesopotamia is the site of the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000 BC . It has been identified as having inspired some of the most important developments in human history , including the invention of the wheel , the planting of the first cereal crops and the development of cursive script , mathematics , astronomy and agriculture .",
  "/wiki/Eblaite_language": "Eblaite /\u02c8\u025bbl\u0259.a\u026at/ ( also known as Eblan ISO 639-3 ) , or Paleo Syrian , is an extinct Semitic language which was used during the third millennium BCE by the populations of Northern Syria . It was named after the ancient city of Ebla , in modern western Syria . Variants of the language were also spoken in Mari and Nagar . According to Cyrus H. Gordon , although scribes might have spoken it sometimes , Eblaite was probably not spoken much , being rather a written lingua franca with East and West Semitic features .",
  "/wiki/Semitic_languages": "The Semitic languages , previously also named Syro-Arabian languages , are a branch of the Afroasiatic language family originating in the Middle East that are spoken by more than 330 million people across much of Western Asia , North Africa and the Horn of Africa , as well as in often large immigrant and expatriate communities in North America , Europe and Australasia . The terminology was first used in the 1780s by members of the G\u00f6ttingen School of History , who derived the name from Shem , one of the three sons of Noah in the Book of Genesis . The most widely spoken Semitic languages today are ( numbers given are for native speakers only ) Arabic ( 300 million ) , Amharic ( ~65 million ) , Tigrinya ( 7 million ) , Hebrew ( ~5 million native/L1 speakers ) , Tigre ( ~1.05 million ) , Aramaic ( 575,000 to 1 million largely Assyrian fluent speakers ) and Maltese ( 483,000 speakers ) . Semitic languages occur in written form from a very early historical date , with East Semitic Akkadian and Eblaite texts ( written in a script adapted from Sumerian cuneiform ) appearing from the 30th century BCE and the 25th century BCE in Mesopotamia and the northern Levant respectively . The only earlier attested languages are Sumerian , Elamite ( 2800 BCE to 550 BCE ) ( both language isolates ) , Egyptian and unclassified Lullubi from the 30th century BCE . Most scripts used to write Semitic languages are abjads - a type of alphabetic script that omits some or all of the vowels , which is feasible for these languages because the consonants in the Semitic languages are the primary carriers of meaning . Among them are the Ugaritic , Phoenician , Aramaic , Hebrew , Syriac , Arabic , and South Arabian alphabets . The Ge'ez script , used for writing the Semitic languages of Ethiopia and Eritrea , is technically an abugida - a modified abjad in which vowels are notated using diacritic marks added to the consonants at all times , in contrast with other Semitic languages which indicate diacritics based on need or for introductory purposes . Maltese is the only Semitic language written in the Latin script and the only Semitic language to be an official language of the European Union . The Semitic languages are notable for their nonconcatenative morphology . That is , word roots are not themselves syllables or words , but instead are isolated sets of consonants ( usually three , making a so-called triliteral root ) . Words are composed out of roots not so much by adding prefixes or suffixes , but rather by filling in the vowels between the root consonants ( although prefixes and suffixes are often added as well ) .",

A country of fertile plains , high mountains , and deserts , Syria is home to diverse ethnic and religious groups , including Syrian Arabs , Kurds , Turkemens , Assyrians , Armenians , Circassians , Mandeans and Greeks . Religious groups include Sunnis , Christians , Alawites , Druze , Isma'ilis , Mandeans , Shiites , Salafis , Yazidis , and Jews . Arabs are the largest ethnic group , and Sunnis the largest religious group . Syria is a unitary republic consisting of 14 governorates and is the only country that politically espouses Ba'athism . It is a member of one international organization other than the United Nations , the Non-Aligned Movement ; it was suspended from the Arab League in November 2011 and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , and self-suspended from the Union for the Mediterranean . The name Syria historically referred to a wider region , broadly synonymous with the Levant , and known in Arabic as al-Sham . The modern state encompasses the sites of several ancient kingdoms and empires , including the Eblan civilization of the 3rd millennium BC . Aleppo and the capital city Damascus are among the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world . In the Islamic era , Damascus was the seat of the Umayyad Caliphate and a provincial capital of the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt . The modern Syrian state was established in the mid-20th century after centuries of Ottoman and a brief period French mandate , and represented the largest Arab state to emerge from the formerly Ottoman-ruled Syrian provinces . It gained de jure independence as a parliamentary republic on 24 October 1945 , when Republic of Syria became a founding member of the United Nations , an act which legally ended the former French Mandate - although French troops did not leave the country until April 1946 .",
  "/wiki/Hittite_language": "Hittite ( natively \ud808\ude48\ud808\udd46\ud808\uddf7 ne\u0161ili [ in the language ] of Ne\u0161a ) , also known as Nesite and Neshite , was an Indo-European language that was spoken by the Hittites , a people of Bronze Age Anatolia who created an empire , centred on Hattusa , as well as parts of the northern Levant and Upper Mesopotamia . The language , now long extinct , is attested in cuneiform , in records dating from the 16th ( Anitta text ) to the 13th centuries BCE , with isolated Hittite loanwords and numerous personal names appearing in an Old Assyrian context from as early as the 20th century BCE . By the Late Bronze Age , Hittite had started losing ground to its close relative Luwian . It appears that in the 13th century BCE , Luwian was the most-widely spoken language in the Hittite capital , Hattusa . After the collapse of the Hittite Empire during the more general Late Bronze Age collapse , Luwian emerged in the Early Iron Age as the main language of the so-called Syro-Hittite states , in southwestern Anatolia and northern Syria . Hittite is the earliest-attested of the Indo-European languages and is the best-known of the Anatolian languages .",
  "/wiki/Anatolian_languages": "The Anatolian languages are an extinct family of Indo-European languages that were spoken in Asia Minor ( ancient Anatolia ) , the best attested of them being the Hittite language . Undiscovered until the late 19th and 20th centuries , they are considered the earliest group of languages to branch off from the Indo-European family . Once discovered , the presence of laryngeal consonants \u1e2b and \u1e2b\u1e2b in Hittite and Luwian provided support for the laryngeal theory of Proto-Indo-European linguistics . While Hittite attestation ends after the Bronze Age , hieroglyphic Luwian survived until the conquest of the Neo-Hittite kingdoms by Assyria , and the alphabetic Anatolian languages are fragmentarily attested until the early first millennium AD , eventually succumbing to the Hellenization of Asia Minor .",
  "/wiki/Anatolia": "Anatolia ( from Greek : \u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae , Anatol\u1e17 , east or [ sun ] rise ; Turkish : Anadolu ) , also known as Asia Minor ( Medieval and Modern Greek : \u039c\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac \u1f08\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 , Mikr\u00e1 As\u00eda , small Asia ; Turkish : K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Asya ) , Asian Turkey , the Anatolian peninsula or the Anatolian plateau , is a large peninsula in West Asia and the westernmost protrusion of the Asian continent . It makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey . The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , the Armenian Highlands to the east and the Aegean Sea to the west . The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the Balkan peninsula of Europe . The eastern border of Anatolia is traditionally held to be a line between the Gulf of Alexandretta and the Black Sea , bounded by the Armenian Highland to the east and Mesopotamia to the southeast . Thus , traditionally Anatolia is the territory that comprises approximately the western two-thirds of the Asian part of Turkey . Today , Anatolia is also often considered to be synonymous with Asian Turkey , which comprises almost the entire country ; its eastern and southeastern borders are widely taken to be Turkey 's eastern border . By some definitions , the Armenian Highlands lies beyond the boundary of the Anatolian plateau . The official name of this inland region is the Eastern Anatolia Region . The ancient inhabitants of Anatolia spoke the now-extinct Anatolian languages , which were largely replaced by the Greek language starting from classical antiquity and during the Hellenistic , Roman and Byzantine periods . Major Anatolian languages included Hittite , Luwian , and Lydian , among other more poorly attested relatives . The Turkification of Anatolia began under the Seljuk Empire in the late 11th century and continued under the Ottoman Empire between the late 13th and early 20th centuries .",

It is known almost only in the Ugarit texts found in the ruined city of Ugarit ( modern Ras Shamra , Syria ) . It has been used by scholars of the Hebrew Bible to clarify Biblical Hebrew texts and has revealed ways in which the cultures of ancient Israel and Judah found parallels in the neighboring cultures .

  "/wiki/Palaic_language": "Palaic is an extinct Indo-European language , attested in cuneiform tablets in Bronze Age Hattusa , the capital of the Hittites . Its name in Hittite is palaumnili , or of the people of Pala ; Pala was probably to the northwest of the Hittite core area , so in the northwest of present mainland Turkey . That region was overrun by the Kaskas in the 15th century BC , and the language likely went out of daily use at that time . [ citation needed ] The entire corpus of Palaic spans only CTH 751-754 in Emmanuel Laroche 's catalog of Hittite texts ; in addition Hittite texts elsewhere cite passages in Palaic in reference to the god Zaparwa ( Hittite Ziparwa ) , the leading God of the land of Pala . In particular , CTH 750 , a festival in Hittite for Ziparwa and associated deities , includes passages stating , The Old Woman speaks the words of the bread in Palaic , or alternately the words of the meal , though no Palaic passages are quoted . The Palaic-language texts are all from a religious context , with ritual and mythological content . In addition to Zaparwa , the Palaumnili-speakers worshipped a sky god Tiyaz ( Luwian Tiwaz ) . Palaic is a fairly typical specimen of Indo-European . Old Hittite has the genitive singular suffix -as circa 1600 BC ( compare Proto-Indo-European *-os ) ; where Cuneiform Luwian instead uses the -ssa adjectival suffix . Palaic , on the northern border of both , like later Hieroglyphic Luwian has both an -as genitive and an -asa adjectival suffix . Palaic also shows the same gender distinction as seen in Hittite , i.e . animate vs. inanimate ; and has similar pronoun forms .",
  "/wiki/Hattic_language": "Hattic ( Hattian ) was a non-Indo-European agglutinative language spoken by the Hattians in Asia Minor between the 3rd and the 2nd millennia BC . Scholars call the language Hattic to distinguish it from Hittite , the Indo-European language of the Hittite Empire . The form Hittite in English originally comes from Biblical Heth , quite possibly connected to common Assyrian and Egyptian designations of Land of the Hatti ( Khatti ) west of the Euphrates . It is unknown what the native speakers of hattili called their own language . The heartland of the oldest attested language of Anatolia , before the arrival of Hittite-speakers , ranged from Hattusa , then called Hattus , northward to Nerik . Other cities mentioned in Hattic include Tuhumiyara and Tissaruliya . Hittite-speakers conquered Hattus from Kanesh to its south in the 18th century BC . They eventually absorbed or replaced the Hattic-speakers ( Hattians ) [ citation needed ] but retained the name Hatti for the region .",

  "/wiki/Unclassified_language": "An unclassified language is a language whose genetic affiliation to other languages has not been established . Languages can be unclassified for a variety of reasons , mostly due to a lack of reliable data but sometimes due to the confounding influence of language contact , if different layers of its vocabulary or morphology point in different directions and it is not clear which represents the ancestral form of the language . Some poorly known extinct languages , such as Gutian and Cac\u00e1n , are simply unclassifiable , and it is unlikely the situation will ever change . A supposedly unclassified language may turn out not to be a language at all , or even a distinct dialect , but merely a family , tribal or village name , or an alternative name for a people or language that is classified . If a language 's genetic relationship has not been established after significant documentation of the language and comparison with other languages and families , as in the case of Basque in Europe , it is considered a language isolate - that is , it is classified as a language family of its own . An 'unclassified ' language therefore is one which may still turn out to belong to an established family once better data is available or more thorough comparative research is done . Extinct unclassified languages for which little evidence has been preserved are likely to remain in limbo indefinitely , unless lost documents or a surviving speaking population are discovered .",

Cypriot Republic ; Turkish : K\u0131br\u0131s Cumhuriyeti , lit . Republic of Cyprus ) , is an island country in the Eastern Mediterranean and the third-largest and third-most populous island in the Mediterranean , located south of Turkey , west of Syria and Lebanon , north of Israel , the Gaza Strip ( Palestinian region ) and Egypt , and southeast of Greece . The earliest known human activity on the island dates to around the 10th millennium BC . Archaeological remains from this period include the well-preserved Neolithic village of Khirokitia , and Cyprus is home to some of the oldest water wells in the world . Cyprus was settled by Mycenaean Greeks in two waves in the 2nd millennium BC . As a strategic location in the Middle East , it was subsequently occupied by several major powers , including the empires of the Assyrians , Egyptians and Persians , from whom the island was seized in 333 BC by Alexander the Great . Subsequent rule by Ptolemaic Egypt , the Classical and Eastern Roman Empire , Arab caliphates for a short period , the French Lusignan dynasty and the Venetians , was followed by over three centuries of Ottoman rule between 1571 and 1878 ( de jure until 1914 ) . Cyprus was placed under the UK 's administration based on the Cyprus Convention in 1878 and was formally annexed by the UK in 1914 . While Turkish Cypriots made up 18% of the population , the partition of Cyprus and creation of a Turkish state in the north became a policy of Turkish Cypriot leaders and Turkey in the 1950s . Turkish leaders for a period advocated the annexation of Cyprus to Turkey as Cyprus was considered an extension of Anatolia by them ; while , since the 19th century , the majority Greek Cypriot population and its Orthodox church had been pursuing union with Greece , which became a Greek national policy in the 1950s . Following nationalist violence in the 1950s , Cyprus was granted independence in 1960 ."
