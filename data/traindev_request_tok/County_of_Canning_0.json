  "/wiki/Local_government_in_Australia": "Local government in Australia is the third tier of government in Australia administered by the states and territories , which in turn are beneath the federal tier . Local government is not mentioned in the Constitution of Australia and two referenda in the 1970s and 1980s to alter the Constitution relating to local government were unsuccessful . Every state government recognises local government in their respective constitutions . Unlike Canada or the United States , there is only one level of local government in each state , with no distinction such as cities and counties . The local governing body is generally referred to as a council , and the territories governed are collectively referred to as local government areas ; however , terms such as city or shire also have a geographic interpretation . In August 2016 there were 547 local councils in Australia . Despite the single level of local government in Australia , there are a number of extensive areas with relatively low populations which are not a part of any local government area . Powers of local governments in these areas may be exercised by special purpose bodies established outside the general legislation , as with Victoria 's alpine resorts , or directly by state governments . The area covered by local councils in Australia ranges from as small as 1.5 km2 ( 0.58 sq mi ) for the Shire of Peppermint Grove in metropolitan Perth , to the Shire of East Pilbara in the Pilbara region of Western Australia , which covers 380,000 km2 ( 150,000 sq mi ) , an area larger than Germany or Japan .",

Bribie Island hugs the coastline and tapers to a long spit at its most northern point near Caloundra , and is separated from the mainland by Pumicestone Passage . The ocean side of the island is somewhat sheltered from prevailing winds by Moreton Island and associated sand banks and has only a small surf break . The lee side is calm , with white sandy beaches in the south . Most of the island is uninhabited national park ( 55.8 square kilometres or 21.5 square miles ) and forestry plantations . The southern end of the island has been intensively urbanised as part of the Moreton Bay Region , the main suburbs being Bongaree , Woorim , Bellara and Banksia Beach . A bridge from Sandstone Point on the mainland was completed in 1963 . Buckley 's Hole , at the southern tip of the island , is an important bird habitat and refuge ."
