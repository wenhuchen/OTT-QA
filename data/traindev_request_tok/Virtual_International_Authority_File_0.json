It is both a commemoration of the Library of Alexandria that was lost in antiquity , and an attempt to rekindle something of the brilliance that this earlier center of study and erudition represented . The idea of reviving the old library dates back to 1974 , when a committee set up by Alexandria University selected a plot of land for its new library . Construction work began in 1995 and , after some US $ 220 million had been spent , the complex was officially inaugurated on 16 October 2002 . In 2010 , the library received a donation of 500,000 books from the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France ( BnF ) . The gift makes the Bibliotheca Alexandrina the sixth-largest Francophone library in the world . The library has shelf space for eight million books , with the main reading room covering 20,000 square metres ( 220,000 sq ft ) . The complex also houses a conference center ; specialized libraries for maps , multimedia , the blind and visually impaired , young people , and for children ; four museums ; four art galleries for temporary exhibitions ; 15 permanent exhibitions ; a planetarium ; and a manuscript restoration laboratory .",

It is now the lingua franca of the Arab world . It is named after the Arabs , a term initially used to describe peoples living in the area bounded by Mesopotamia in the east and the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west , in Northwestern Arabia and in the Sinai Peninsula . The ISO assigns language codes to thirty varieties of Arabic , including its standard form , Modern Standard Arabic , also referred to as Literary Arabic , which is modernized Classical Arabic . This distinction exists primarily among Western linguists ; Arabic speakers themselves generally do not distinguish between Modern Standard Arabic and Classical Arabic , but rather refer to both as al-\u02bfarabiyyatu l-fu\u1e63\u1e25\u0101 ( \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0639\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0641\u064f\u0635\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0649\u0670 , the purest Arabic ) or simply al-fu\u1e63\u1e25\u0101 ( \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0641\u064f\u0635\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0649\u0670 ) . Arabic is widely taught in schools and universities and is used to varying degrees in workplaces , government and the media . Arabic , in its standard form , is the official language of 26 states , as well as the liturgical language of the religion of Islam , since the Quran and Hadith were written in Arabic . During the Middle Ages , Arabic was a major vehicle of culture in Europe , especially in science , mathematics and philosophy . As a result , many European languages have also borrowed many words from it . Arabic influence , mainly in vocabulary , is seen in European languages - mainly Spanish and to a lesser extent Portuguese and Catalan - owing to both the proximity of Christian European and Muslim Arab civilizations and almost 800 years of Arabic culture and language presence in the Iberian Peninsula , referred to in Arabic as al-Andalus . Sicilian has about 500 Arabic words , many of which relate to agriculture and related activities , [ full citation needed ] as a legacy of the Emirate of Sicily from the mid-9th to mid-10th centuries , while Maltese language is a Semitic language developed from a dialect of Arabic and written in the Latin alphabet .

With a population of 5,200,000 , Alexandria is the largest city on the Mediterranean , the sixth-largest city in the Arab world and the ninth-largest in Africa . The city extends about 40 km ( 25 mi ) at the northern coast of Egypt along the Mediterranean Sea . Alexandria is a popular tourist destination , and also an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez . Alexandria was founded in c. 331 BC by Alexander the Great , king of Macedon and leader of the Greek League of Corinth , during his conquest of the Achaemenid Empire . An Egyptian village named Rhacotis existed at the location and grew into the Egyptian quarter of Alexandria . Alexandria grew rapidly to become an important center of Hellenistic civilization and remained the capital of Ptolemaic Egypt and Roman and Byzantine Egypt for almost 1,000 years , until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in AD 641 , when a new capital was founded at Fustat ( later absorbed into Cairo ) . Hellenistic Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria ( Pharos ) , one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World ; its Great Library ( the largest in the ancient world ) ; and the Necropolis , one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages . Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural center of the ancient Mediterranean world for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity . It was at one time the largest city in the ancient world before being eventually overtaken by Rome . The city was a major center of early Christianity and was the center of the Patriarchate of Alexandria , which was one of the major centers of Christianity in the Eastern Roman Empire . In the modern world , the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage .",

Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip ( Palestine ) and Israel to the northeast , the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea to the east , Sudan to the south , and Libya to the west . Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan , across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia , and across the Mediterranean lie Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , although none share a land border with Egypt . Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",

It is a global language , the world 's second-most spoken native language , after Mandarin Chinese , and the world 's fourth-most spoken language , after Mandarin Chinese , English and Hindi . Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages , which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century . The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century , and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo , a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile , in the 13th century . Beginning in 1492 , the Spanish language was taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire , most notably to the Americas , as well as territories in Africa , Oceania and the Philippines . A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist Mario Pei , analyzing the degree of difference from a language 's parent ( Latin , in the case of Romance languages ) by comparing phonology , inflection , syntax , vocabulary , and intonation , indicated the following percentages ( the higher the percentage , the greater the distance from Latin ) : In the case of Spanish , it is one of the closest Romance languages to Latin ( 20% distance ) , only behind Sardinian ( 8% distance ) and Italian ( 12% distance ) . Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin , including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek . Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date , having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula . With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin , this language makes up the second greatest vocabulary source after Latin itself . It has also been influenced by Basque , Iberian , Celtiberian , Visigothic , and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages . Additionally , it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages , particularly other Romance languages - French , Italian , Andalusi Romance , Portuguese , Galician , Catalan , Occitan , and Sardinian - as well as from Quechua , Nahuatl , and other indigenous languages of the Americas .

Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands , and features a string of volcanoes and lakes . The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords , inlets , canals , twisting peninsulas , and islands . Spain conquered and colonized the region in the mid-16th century , replacing Inca rule in the north and centre , but failing to conquer the independent Mapuche who inhabited what is now south-central Chile . After declaring its independence from Spain in 1818 , Chile emerged in the 1830s as a relatively stable authoritarian republic . In the 19th century , Chile saw significant economic and territorial growth , ending Mapuche resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in the War of the Pacific ( 1879-83 ) after defeating Peru and Bolivia . In the 1960s and 1970s , the country experienced severe left-right political polarization and turmoil .",

Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",

Due to immigration and language shift in urban areas , around 15-20% of the population of Greenland speak Danish as their first language . Along with the other North Germanic languages , Danish is a descendant of Old Norse , the common language of the Germanic peoples who lived in Scandinavia during the Viking Era . Danish , together with Swedish , derives from the East Norse dialect group , while the Middle Norwegian language before the influence of Danish and Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l are classified as West Norse along with Faroese and Icelandic .

Until the 16th century , Danish was a continuum of dialects spoken from Schleswig to Scania with no standard variety or spelling conventions . With the Protestant Reformation and the introduction of printing , a standard language was developed which was based on the educated Copenhagen dialect . It spread through use in the education system and administration , though German and Latin continued to be the most important written languages well into the 17th century . Following the loss of territory to Germany and Sweden , a nationalist movement adopted the language as a token of Danish identity , and the language experienced a strong surge in use and popularity , with major works of literature produced in the 18th and 19th centuries .

The library is housed in three buildings on Capitol Hill in Washington , D.C. ; it also maintains the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center in Culpeper , Virginia . The library 's functions are overseen by the librarian of Congress , and its buildings are maintained by the architect of the Capitol . The Library of Congress is one of the largest libraries in the world . Its collections are universal , not limited by subject , format , or national boundary , and include research materials from all parts of the world and in more than 450 languages . Congress moved to Washington , D.C. , in 1800 after sitting for 11 years in the temporary national capitals in New York City and Philadelphia . The small Congressional Library was housed in the United States Capitol for most of the 19th century until the early 1890s . Most of the original collection had been destroyed by the British in 1814 during the War of 1812 , and the library sought to restore its collection in 1815 . They bought Thomas Jefferson 's entire personal collection of 6,487 books . After a period of slow growth , another fire struck the library in its Capitol chambers in 1851 , again destroying a large amount of the collection , including many of Jefferson 's books . After the American Civil War , the Library of Congress grew rapidly in both size and importance , which sparked a campaign to purchase replacement copies for volumes that had been burned .",

Founded after the American Revolution as the seat of government of the newly independent country , Washington was named after George Washington , the first president of the United States and a Founding Father . As the seat of the United States federal government and several international organizations , Washington is an important world political capital . The city , located on the Potomac River bordering Maryland and Virginia , is one of the most visited cities in the world , with more than 20 million tourists annually . The signing of the Residence Act on July 16 , 1790 , approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River on the country 's East Coast . The U.S. Constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress , and the District is therefore not a part of any U.S. state . The states of Maryland and Virginia each donated land to form the federal district , which included the pre-existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria . The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital . In 1846 , Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia , including the city of Alexandria ; in 1871 , it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the District . Washington had an estimated population of 702,455 as of July 2018 [ update ] , making it the 20th most populous city in the United States . Commuters from the surrounding Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city 's daytime population to more than one million during the workweek . Washington 's metropolitan area , the country 's sixth largest ( including parts of Maryland , Virginia and West Virginia ) , had a 2017 estimated population of 6.2 million residents .",
  "/wiki/United_States": "The United States of America ( USA ) , commonly known as the United States ( U.S. or US ) or America , is a country consisting of 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . [ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

It is the official and literary standard of Croatia and one of the official languages of the European Union . Croatian is also one of the official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina and a recognized minority language in Serbia and neighboring countries . Standard Croatian is based on the most widespread dialect of Serbo-Croatian , Shtokavian , more specifically on Eastern Herzegovinian , which is also the basis of Standard Serbian , Bosnian , and Montenegrin . In the mid-18th century , the first attempts to provide a Croatian literary standard began on the basis of the Neo-Shtokavian dialect that served as a supraregional lingua franca pushing back regional Chakavian , Kajkavian , and Shtokavian vernaculars . The decisive role was played by Croatian Vukovians , who cemented the usage of Ijekavian Neo-Shtokavian as the literary standard in the late 19th and the beginning of the 20th century , in addition to designing a phonological orthography . Croatian is written in Gaj 's Latin alphabet . Besides the Shtokavian dialect , on which Standard Croatian is based , there are two other main dialects spoken on the territory of Croatia , Chakavian and Kajkavian . These dialects , and the four national standards , are usually subsumed under the term Serbo-Croatian in English , though this term is controversial for native speakers , and paraphrases such as Bosnian-Croatian-Montenegrin-Serbian are therefore sometimes used instead , especially in diplomatic circles .",
