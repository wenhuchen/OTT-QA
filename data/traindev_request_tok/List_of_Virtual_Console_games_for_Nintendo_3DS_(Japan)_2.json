Ancient - a studio founded by composer Yuzo Koshiro for the project - developed the game and Sega published it to promote the handheld Game Gear . The 8-bit Sonic is similar in style to its Genesis predecessor , but reduced in complexity to fit the 8-bit systems . It was released for the Game Gear on December 28 , 1991 , and for the Master System around the same time . It was later released through Sonic game compilations and Nintendo 's Virtual Console .

Gameplay is similar too : Sonic collects rings while avoiding obstacles , but is paced slightly slower as the 8-bit version focuses more on exploration . While some level themes , such as Green Hill Zone , are borrowed from the Genesis game , others are original . It also features a different soundtrack from Koshiro , which consists of rearranged versions of Masato Nakamura 's tracks for the Genesis game and new material . Reviewers acclaimed the 8-bit Sonic for its level variety , visuals , gameplay , and audio . Many believed it was just as good as the original , although some criticism was directed at its low difficulty and short length . Game journalists retrospectively considered it one of the best Game Gear and Master System games ."
