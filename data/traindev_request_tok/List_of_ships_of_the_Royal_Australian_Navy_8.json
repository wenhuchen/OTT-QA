  "/wiki/HMAS_Gascoyne_(K354)": "HMAS Gascoyne ( K354/F354/A276 ) was a River-class frigate that served in the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . Laid down in 1942 and commissioned in 1943 , the frigate served during World War II , before being placed in reserve in 1946 . Reactivated in 1959 , Gascoyne was reclassified as a survey and research ship , a role she fulfilled until she was decommissioned again in 1966 , and sold for scrap in 1972 .",
  "/wiki/River-class_frigate": "The River class was a class of 151 frigates launched between 1941 and 1944 for use as anti-submarine convoy escorts in the North Atlantic . The majority served with the Royal Navy ( RN ) and Royal Canadian Navy ( RCN ) , with some serving in the other Allied navies : the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , the Free French Navy ( FFN ) , the Royal Netherlands Navy and , post-war , the South African Navy ( SAN ) . The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 , and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom , giving name to the class . In Canada , they were named for towns and cities , though they kept the same designation . Originally called a twin-screw corvette , the name frigate was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy . Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941 . The design was too big for the locks on the Lachine Canal so it was not built by the shipyards on the Great Lakes and therefore all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the West Coast or along the St. Lawrence River below Montreal . In all , Canada ordered the construction of 70 frigates , including ten for the Royal Navy , which transferred two to the United States Navy . Twelve were built in Australia for the RAN ( four to a modified design ) . After World War II , they found employment in many other navies the world over ; several RCN ships were sunk as breakwaters . One , HMCS Stormont , was purchased by Aristotle Onassis and converted into the luxury yacht Christina O .",
  "/wiki/HMAS_Gawler_(J188)": "HMAS Gawler ( J188/B241/A115 ) , named for the town of Gawler , South Australia , was one of 60 Bathurst-class corvettes constructed during World War II and one of 20 built for the Admiralty but manned by personnel of and commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . The ship was laid down by Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd in early 1941 , launched later that year , and commissioned in 1942 . After a short assignment to Fremantle as an anti-submarine patrol ship , Gawler was assigned to the British Eastern Fleet as a convoy escort . In April 1943 , she was sent to the Mediterranean for minesweeping duties . The corvette participated in the Allied invasion of Sicily , rescued survivors from the torpedoed troopship Yoma , and on one occasion escorted a convoy in the Atlantic . In October , Gawler rejoined the Eastern Fleet and resumed Indian Ocean convoy escort duties . After a refit at the start of 1945 , Gawler joined the British Pacific Fleet . At the war 's end , the corvette was tasked with mine-clearing and anti=piracy operations around Hong Kong , then sent to the Molucca Islands to inspect former Japanese facilities . Gawler was decommissioned from the RAN in April 1946 . The Admiralty transferred the ship to the Turkish Navy , where she was recommissioned as TCG Ayvalik . The corvette remained in Turkish service until 1963 .",
  "/wiki/Bathurst-class_corvette": "The Bathurst-class corvettes were a class of general purpose vessels produced in Australia during World War II . Originally classified as minesweepers , but widely referred to as corvettes , the Bathurst-class vessels fulfilled a broad anti-submarine , anti-mine , and convoy escort role . Sixty Bathurst-class corvettes were built in eight Australian shipyards to an Australian design . 36 were constructed for the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , 20 were built on British Admiralty orders but manned and commissioned by the RAN , and 4 served in the Royal Indian Navy . Three more were ordered for construction in India , but were cancelled . Although designed for the anti-submarine and anti-mine role , the Bathursts operated as maids-of-all-work during the war ; serving as troop and supply transports , supporting amphibious landings , providing air defence for convoys and disabled ships , participating in shore bombardments , and undertaking hydrographic surveys . Three ships were lost during the war - one to Japanese air attack and two to collisions with friendly merchant ships - while a fourth struck a friendly mine while sweeping the Great Barrier Reef in 1947 and sank . After the war , the Admiralty ships were sold to the Turkish Navy , Royal Netherlands Navy , and civilian operators , while several RAN-owned vessels were transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy , temporarily reactivated to facilitate National Service Training , or sold to civilians . Four of the Netherlands Bathursts were sold onward to the Indonesian Navy , one of which was destroyed in 1956 by rebels opposing the 'Guided Democracy ' political system . The rest of the RAN and Admiralty ships were sold for scrap to help fund other projects . Two vessels are preserved as museum ships .",

  "/wiki/Fremantle-class_patrol_boat": "The Fremantle-class patrol boats were coastal patrol vessels operated by the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) from 1979 to 2007 . Designed by British shipbuilder Brooke Marine and constructed in Australia by North Queensland Engineers and Agents , the Fremantle class were larger , more powerful , and more capable than the preceding Attack class , and the two primary patrol boat bases required infrastructure upgrades to support them . Although up to 30 vessels were planned , fifteen were ordered and constructed , with an unexercised option for five more . Their retirement was announced in 2001 and a decommissioning schedule published in 2004 . From May 2005 they were replaced by the Armidale-class patrol boats with the last two Fremantles decommissioning in May 2007 . Most of the class were scrapped , with two marked for preservation as museum ships . The Fremantle class has also appeared in two drama television series based on the Royal Australian Navy .",

The ship was decommissioned in 1927 and scrapped during 1932 , with the remains scuttled in 1935 .",
  "/wiki/Arabis-class_sloop": "The Arabis class was the third , and largest , of the five sub-classes of minesweeping sloops completed under the Emergency War Programme for the Royal Navy in World War I . They were part of the larger Flower Class shipbuilding project , which were also referred to as the Cabbage Class , or Herbaceous Borders . The ships were also used outside their minesweeping duties as patrol vessels , tugs , and personnel and cargo transports . The design for the Arabis class was made at the end of 1914 . All 36 British vessels were ordered in July 1915 , and were built in three batches , averaging 12 vessels . A further 8 vessels were later built in British shipyards for the French Navy . The design was highly appealing , as most shipyards were capable of building them , and construction could be completed in five months . Like the preceding Acacia and Azalea class sloops , these were single-screw Fleet Sweeping Vessels ( Sloops ) with triple hulls at the bows to give extra protection against loss when working .",
  "/wiki/HMAS_Gladstone_(J324)": "HMAS Gladstone ( J324/M324 ) , named for the city of Gladstone , Queensland , was one of 60 Bathurst class corvettes constructed during World War II , and one of 36 that were initially manned and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . Built by Walkers Limited , the ship was commissioned in 1943 . Gladstone initially operated as a convoy escort between Queensland and New Guinea . On 18 December 1943 , the ship was part of a convoy that ran aground on Bougainville Reef ; the corvette was able to refloat herself and sail back to Brisbane , but remained in port for repairs until January 1944 . She resumed convoy duties , first back in Queensland waters , then she was relocated to Milne Bay in April 1944 . In January 1945 , she was redeployed to Morotai . After World War II , Gladstone was involved in the Japanese surrender of Timor at Koepang , performed surveillance in the Lesser Sunda Islands , and transported Netherlands East Indies soldiers from Darwin to Timor , then spent the next ten years attached to Flinders Naval Depot as a training ship . The corvette was paid off in 1946 , then purchased by the Port Phillip Sea Pilots Association for use as a relief and accommodation ship . She was renamed Akuna ( sometimes referred to as Akuna II ) and registered in Melbourne . Akuna began operations in mid-1958 , but was made redundant in the 1970s by the move to high-powered launches , and was sold to a private owner in 1973 or 1974 . Conflicting reports mark the next few years of the ship 's operation , until she was sold in 1978 to a new owner , who used her to rescue Vietnamese refugees in the South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand under the auspices of Food for the Hungry International . The ship was re-registered as a Panamian-flagged private yacht under the name Akuna II in 1980 , around the time a former United States Air Force pilot began scamming families of personnel missing-in-action after the Vietnam War with claims that he would use the ship to rescue US prisoners-of-war that may still have been interred in Vietnam .",
