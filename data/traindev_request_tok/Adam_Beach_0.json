The Patuxet tribe had lived on the western coast of Cape Cod Bay , but they were wiped out by an epidemic infection . Squanto was kidnapped by English explorer Thomas Hunt who carried him to Spain , where he sold him in the city of M\u00e1laga . He was among a number of captives bought by local monks who focused on their education and evangelization . Squanto eventually traveled to England , then returned to America in 1619 to his native village , only to find that his tribe had been wiped out by an epidemic infection ; Squanto was the last of the Patuxets . The Mayflower landed in Cape Cod Bay in 1620 , and Squanto worked to broker peaceable relations between the Pilgrims and the local Pokanokets . He played a key role in the early meetings in March 1621 , partly because he spoke English . He then lived with the Pilgrims for 20 months , acting as a translator , guide , and advisor . He introduced the settlers to the fur trade and taught them how to sow and fertilize native crops ; this proved vital , because the seeds mostly failed which the Pilgrims had brought from England . As food shortages worsened , Plymouth Colony Governor William Bradford relied on Squanto to pilot a ship of settlers on a trading expedition around Cape Cod and through dangerous shoals .",

United States ( 2001 ) , the United States Supreme Court ruled against the state 's claim of the submerged lands of the lower third of Lake Coeur d'Alene and related waters of the St. Joe River .

This area was designated in 1983 by the Environmental Protection Agency as Bunker Hill Mine and Smelting Complex , the nation 's second-largest Superfund site for cleanup . Concerned at the slow pace of progress , in 1991 the tribe filed suit against mining companies for damages and cleanup costs , joined in 1996 by the United States and in 2011 by the state of Idaho .
