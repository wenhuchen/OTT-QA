  "/wiki/Drumstick_(poultry)": "Poultry ( /\u02c8po\u028altri/ ) are domesticated birds kept by humans for their eggs , their meat or their feathers . These birds are most typically members of the superorder Galloanserae ( fowl ) , especially the order Galliformes ( which includes chickens , quails , and turkeys ) . Poultry also includes other birds that are killed for their meat , such as the young of pigeons ( known as squabs ) but does not include similar wild birds hunted for sport or food and known as game . The word poultry comes from the French/Norman word poule , itself derived from the Latin word pullus , which means small animal . The domestication of poultry took place several thousand years ago . This may have originally been as a result of people hatching and rearing young birds from eggs collected from the wild , but later involved keeping the birds permanently in captivity . Domesticated chickens may have been used for cockfighting at first and quail kept for their songs , but soon it was realised how useful it was having a captive-bred source of food . Selective breeding for fast growth , egg-laying ability , conformation , plumage and docility took place over the centuries , and modern breeds often look very different from their wild ancestors . Although some birds are still kept in small flocks in extensive systems , most birds available in the market today are reared in intensive commercial enterprises . Together with pig meat , poultry is one of the two most widely eaten types of meat globally , with over 70% of the meat supply in 2012 between them ; poultry provides nutritionally beneficial food containing high-quality protein accompanied by a low proportion of fat . All poultry meat should be properly handled and sufficiently cooked in order to reduce the risk of food poisoning . The word poultry comes from the West & English pultrie , from Old French pouletrie , from pouletier , poultry dealer , from poulet , pullet .",

  "/wiki/Egg_plant": "Eggplant ( USA , Australia , New Zealand , anglophone Canada ) , aubergine ( UK , Ireland , France , Quebec ) or brinjal ( South Asia , South Africa ) is a plant species in the nightshade family Solanaceae . Solanum melongena is grown worldwide for its edible fruit . Most commonly purple , the spongy , absorbent fruit is used in several cuisines . Although often considered a vegetable , it is a berry by botanical definition . As a member of the genus Solanum , it is related to tomato and potato . Like the tomato , its skin and seeds can be eaten , but , like the potato , it is usually eaten cooked . Eggplant is nutritionally low in macronutrient and micronutrient content , but the capability of the fruit to absorb oils and flavors into its flesh through cooking expands its use in the culinary arts . It was originally domesticated from the wild nightshade species thorn or bitter apple , S. incanum , probably with two independent domestications : one in South Asia , and one in East Asia .",
  "/wiki/Green_beans": "Green beans are the unripe , young fruit and protective pods of various cultivars of the common bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris ) . Immature or young pods of the runner bean ( Phaseolus coccineus ) , yardlong bean ( Vigna unguiculata subsp . sesquipedalis ) , and hyacinth bean ( Lablab purpureus ) are used in a similar way . Green beans are known by many common names , including French beans , string beans ( for old varieties ; modern varieties are stringless ) , snap beans , snaps , and the French name haricot vert . They are also known as Baguio beans in Philippine English , to distinguish them from yardlong beans . Other locals in the vegetable farming regions of the Philippines refer these as habitchuelas . It is commonly grown in the northern highlands of Benguet , Mountain Province and Nueva Viscaya , and other mid-elevation areas in the country like Bukidnon , Quezon and Laguna . They are distinguished from the many other varieties of beans in that green beans are harvested and consumed with their enclosing pods , before the bean seeds inside have fully matured . An analogous practice is the harvest and consumption of unripened pea pods , as is done with snow peas or sugar snap peas . Historically , green bean pods contained a string , a hard , fibrous strand running the length of both sides of the pod . This string was removed before cooking . Modern , commercially grown green bean varieties are stringless and lack strings , though heirloom varieties may retain this trait ."
