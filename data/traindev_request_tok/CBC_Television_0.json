  "/wiki/Virtual_channel": "In most telecommunications organizations , a virtual channel is a method of remapping the program number as used in H.222 Program Association Tables and Program Mapping Tables to a channel number that can be entered via digits on a receiver 's remote control . Often , virtual channels are implemented in digital television , helping users to find a desired channel easily , or easing the transition from analogue to digital broadcasting in general . The practice of assigning virtual channels is most common in those parts of the world where TV stations were coloquially named after the RF channel they were transmitting on ( channel 6 Springfield ) , as it was common in North America during the analogue TV era . In other parts of the world , such as Europe , virtual channels are rarely used or needed , as TV stations there identify themselves by name , not by RF channel or callsign . A virtual channel was first used for DigiCipher 2 in North America and then later used and referred to as a logical channel number ( LCN ) for private European Digital Video Broadcasting extensions widely used by the NDS Group and NorDig in other markets . Pay television operators were the first to use either of these systems as a method of channel reassignment or rearrangement that suited their need to group multiple channels by their content or origin as well as to a lesser extent to localize advertising to a particular market . Free-to-air ATSC uses the DigiCipher 2 method to maintain the same television frequency channel allocation that the NTSC channel was using when both were simulcasting so the same number could bring up either service . Free-to-air DVB network operators such as DTV Services Ltd. ( d.b.a . Freeview ) and Freeview New Zealand Ltd. use the NorDig method and follow the same practice as pay TV operators . The exception is Freeview Australia Ltd. , which also use the NorDig method and partially follow the ATSC practice of using the same VHF radio frequency channel allocation that the PAL channel is simulcasting on from the metropolitan station 's main transmission point ( i2 , 7 , 9 and 10 ) with the major and minor format emulated by multiplying by ten .",

  "/wiki/Yellowknife": "Yellowknife ( /\u02c8j\u025blo\u028ana\u026af/ ; Dogrib : S\u01eb\u0300mbak ' \u00e8 ) is the capital , only city , and largest community in the Northwest Territories , Canada . It is on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake , about 400 km ( 250 mi ) south of the Arctic Circle , on the west side of Yellowknife Bay near the outlet of the Yellowknife River . Yellowknife and its surrounding water bodies were named after a local Dene tribe at one time known as the Copper Indians or Yellowknife Indians , referred to locally as the Yellowknives Dene First Nation , who traded tools made from copper deposits near the Arctic Coast . Its population , which is ethnically mixed , was 19,569 per the 2016 Canadian Census . Of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories , five are spoken in significant numbers in Yellowknife : Dene Suline , Dogrib , South and North Slavey , English , and French . In the Dogrib language , the city is known as S\u01eb\u0300mbak ' \u00e8 ( Som-ba Kay ) ( where the money is ) . The Yellowknife settlement is considered to have been founded in 1934 , after gold was found in the area , although commercial activity in the present-day waterfront area did not begin until 1936 . Yellowknife quickly became the centre of economic activity in the NWT , and was named the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967 . As gold production began to wane , Yellowknife shifted from being a mining town to a centre of government services in the 1980s . However , with the discovery of diamonds north of the city in 1991 , this shift began to reverse . In recent years , tourism , transportation , and communications have also emerged as significant Yellowknife industries .",
