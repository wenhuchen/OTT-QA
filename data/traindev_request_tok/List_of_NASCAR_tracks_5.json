The state 's largest city is Baltimore , and its capital is Annapolis . Among its occasional nicknames are Old Line State , the Free State , and the Chesapeake Bay State . It is named after the English queen Henrietta Maria , known in England as Queen Mary , who was the wife of King Charles I. Sixteen of Maryland 's twenty-three counties , as well as the city of Baltimore , border the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay estuary and its many tributaries , which combined total more than 4,000 miles of shoreline . Although one of the smallest states in the U.S. , it features a variety of climates and topographical features that have earned it the moniker of America in Miniature . In a similar vein , Maryland 's geography , culture , and history combine elements of the Mid-Atlantic , Northeastern , and South Atlantic regions of the country . Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century , Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans , mostly by the Algonquin , and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux . As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain , Maryland was founded by George Calvert , a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England . In 1632 , Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter , naming the colony after his wife , Queen Mary ( Henrietta Maria of France ) . Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans , who rejected Catholicism in their settlements , Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration . Accordingly , in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion , which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation . Nevertheless , religious strife was common in the early years , and Catholics remained a minority , albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony .",

  "/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York": "Buffalo is the second largest city in the U.S. state of New York and the largest city in Western New York . As of 2018 [ update ] , the population was 256,304 . The city is the county seat of Erie County and a major gateway for commerce and travel across the Canada-United States border , forming part of the bi-national Buffalo Niagara Region . As of the April 1 , 2010 , the metropolitan statistical area ( MSA ) had a population of 1,135,509 ; the combined statistical area ( CSA ) , which adds Cattaraugus County , had a population of 1,215,826 inhabitants . The Buffalo area was inhabited before the 17th century by the Native American Iroquois tribe and later by French colonizers . The city grew significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of immigration , the construction of the Erie Canal and rail transportation , and its close proximity to Lake Erie . This growth provided an abundance of fresh water and an ample trade route to the Midwestern United States while grooming its economy for the grain , steel and automobile industries that dominated the city 's economy in the 20th century . Since the city 's economy relied heavily on manufacturing , deindustrialization in the latter half of the 20th century led to a steady decline in population . While some manufacturing activity remains , Buffalo 's economy has transitioned to service industries with a greater emphasis on healthcare , research and higher education , which emerged following the Great Recession . Buffalo is on the eastern shore of Lake Erie , at the head of the Niagara River , 16 miles ( 26 km ) south of Niagara Falls . Its early embrace of electric power led to the nickname The City of Light . The city is also famous for its urban planning and layout by Joseph Ellicott , an extensive system of parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted , as well as significant architectural works .",
  "/wiki/Buffalo_Bills": "The Buffalo Bills are a professional American football team based in the Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area . The Bills compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) , as a member club of the league 's American Football Conference ( AFC ) East division . The team plays their home games at New Era Field in Orchard Park , New York . The Bills are the only NFL team that plays its home games in the state of New York . The Bills conduct summer training camp at St. John Fisher College in Pittsford , New York , an eastern suburb of Rochester . The Bills began play as an original franchise of the American Football League ( AFL ) in 1960 . The club joined the NFL as a result of the AFL-NFL merger for the 1970 season . The 1964 and 1965 Bills were the only teams representing Buffalo that won major league professional sports championships ( back-to-back American Football League Championships ) . The Bills are the only team to win four consecutive conference championships and are the only NFL team to lose four consecutive Super Bowl games . The team was owned by Ralph Wilson from the team 's founding in 1960 , until his death in 2014 at the age of 95 . After his death , Wilson 's estate reached an agreement to sell the team to Terry and Kim Pegula , which was approved by the other NFL team owners on October 8 , 2014 . The Bills formerly possessed the longest active playoff drought in any of the four major professional sports in North America : they did not qualify to play in the NFL playoffs from 1999 until 2017 and were the last NFL team ( and last team in the major North American professional sports leagues overall ) to qualify for the playoffs for the first time in the 21st century .",
  "/wiki/American_Football_League": "The American Football League ( AFL ) was a major professional American football league that operated for ten seasons from 1960 until 1969 , when it merged with the older National Football League ( NFL ) , and became the American Football Conference . The upstart AFL operated in direct competition with the more established NFL throughout its existence . It was more successful than earlier rivals to the NFL with the same name , the 1926 , 1936 and 1940 leagues , and the later All-America Football Conference ( which existed between 1944 and 1950 but only played between 1946 and 1949 ) . This fourth version of the AFL was the most successful , created by a number of owners who had been refused NFL expansion franchises or had minor shares of NFL franchises . The AFL 's original lineup consisted of an Eastern division of the New York Titans , Boston Patriots , Buffalo Bills , and the Houston Oilers , and a Western division of the Los Angeles Chargers , Denver Broncos , Oakland Raiders , and Dallas Texans . The league first gained attention by signing 75% of the NFL 's first-round draft choices in 1960 , including Houston 's successful signing of college star and Heisman Trophy winner Billy Cannon . While the first years of the AFL saw uneven competition and low attendance , the league was buttressed by a generous television contract with the American Broadcasting Company ( ABC ) ( followed by a contract with the competing National Broadcasting Company ( NBC ) for games starting with the 1965 season ) that broadcast the more offense-oriented football league nationwide . Continuing to attract top talent from colleges and the NFL by the mid-1960s , as well as successful franchise shifts of the Chargers from L.A. south to San Diego and the Texans north to Kansas City ( becoming the Kansas City Chiefs ) , the AFL established a dedicated following . The transformation of the struggling Titans into the New York Jets under new ownership further solidified the league 's reputation among the major media . As fierce competition made player salaries skyrocket in both leagues , especially after a series of raids , the leagues agreed to a merger in 1966 . Among the conditions were a common draft and a championship game played between the two league champions first played in early 1967 , which would eventually become known as the Super Bowl . The AFL and NFL operated as separate leagues until 1970 , with separate regular season and playoff schedules except for the championship game .",

As a result of the California Gold Rush , Sacramento became a major commercial center and distribution point for Northern California , serving as the terminus for the Pony Express and the First Transcontinental Railroad .
