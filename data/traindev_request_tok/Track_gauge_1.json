  "/wiki/Rail_transport_in_Argentina": "The Argentine railway network consisted of a 47,000 km ( 29,204 mi ) network at the end of the Second World War and was , in its time , one of the most extensive and prosperous in the world . However , with the increase in highway construction , there followed a sharp decline in railway profitability , leading to the break-up in 1993 of Ferrocarriles Argentinos ( FA ) , the state railroad corporation . During the period following privatisation , private and provincial railway companies were created and resurrected some of the major passenger routes that FA once operated . Dissatisfied with the private management of the railways , beginning in 2012 and following the Once Tragedy , the national government started to re-nationalise some of the private operators and ceased to renew their contracts . At the same time , Operadora Ferroviaria Sociedad del Estado ( SOFSE ) was formed to manage the lines which were gradually taken over by the government in this period and Argentina 's railways began receiving far greater investment than in previous decades . In 2014 , the government also began replacing the long distance rolling stock and rails and ultimately put forward a proposal in 2015 which revived Ferrocarriles Argentinos as Nuevos Ferrocarriles Argentinos later that year . The railroad network today , with its 36,966 km ( 22,970 mi ) size , is now somewhat smaller than it once was , though still the 8th largest in the world .",

Rail transport played an important role in the opening up and development of the hinterland outside of New Zealand 's predominantly dispersed and coastal settlements . Starting with the Ferrymead Railway in 1863 , most public railway lines were short , built by provincial governments and connected major centres to their nearest seaport ( such as Christchurch and its port at Lyttelton Harbour ) .

Narrow gauge of 3ft 6in ( 1,067mm ) was adopted nationally . Railways became centrally controlled as a government department under the names New Zealand Government Railways or New Zealand Railways Department ( NZR ) , and land transport was heavily regulated from 1931 onwards . NZR eventually expanded into other transport modes , especially with the Railways Road Services , inter-island ferries and Rail Air service . NZR also had an extensive network of workshops .

  "/wiki/Rapid_transit": "Rapid transit or mass rapid transit ( MRT ) , also known as heavy rail , metro , subway , tube , U-Bahn or underground , is a type of high-capacity public transport generally found in urban areas . Unlike buses or trams , rapid transit systems are electric railways that operate on an exclusive right-of-way , which can not be accessed by pedestrians or other vehicles of any sort , and which is often grade separated in tunnels or on elevated railways . Modern service on rapid transit systems are provided on designated lines between stations typically using electric multiple units on rail tracks , although some systems use guided rubber tires , magnetic levitation , or monorail . The stations typically have high platforms , without steps inside the trains , requiring custom-made trains in order to minimize gaps between train and platform . They are typically integrated with other public transport and often operated by the same public transport authorities . However , some rapid transit systems have at-grade intersections between a rapid transit line and a road or between two rapid transit lines . The world 's first rapid transit system was the partially underground Metropolitan Railway which opened as a conventional railway in 1863 , and now forms part of the London Underground . In 1868 , New York opened the elevated West Side and Yonkers Patent Railway , initially a cable-hauled line using static steam engines . China has the largest number of rapid transit systems in the world at 31 , with over 4,500 km of lines and is responsible for most of the world 's rapid transit expansion in the past decade . The world 's longest single-operator rapid transit system by route length is the Shanghai Metro .

A government owned company , Israel Railways , manages the entire heavy rail network . Most of the network is located on the densely populated coastal plain . The only light rail line in Israel is the Jerusalem Light Rail , though another line in Tel Aviv is currently under construction . Many of the rail routes in Israel date back to before the establishment of the state - to the days of the British Mandate for Palestine and earlier .

As of August 2017 , the Spanish AVE system is the longest HSR network in Europe with 3,240 km ( 2,010 mi ) and the second longest in the world , after China 's . AVE trains run on a network of high-speed rail track owned and managed by ADIF ( Administrador de Infraestructuras Ferroviarias ) , where other high-speed ( Avant [ es ] , Alvia , Avlo ) and mid-speed ( Altaria ) services also operate . The first line was opened in 1992 , connecting the cities of Madrid , C\u00f3rdoba and Seville . Unlike the rest of the Iberian broad gauge network , the AVE uses standard gauge . This permits direct connections to outside Spain through the link to the French network at the Perthus tunnel . AVE trains are operated by RENFE , but private companies may be allowed to operate trains in the future using other brands , in accordance with European Union legislation .

  "/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area": "The San Francisco Bay Area , popularly referred to as the Bay Area or simply the Bay , is a populous region surrounding the San Francisco , San Pablo , and Suisun Bay estuaries in Northern California . Although the exact boundaries of the region vary depending on the source , the Bay Area is defined by the Association of Bay Area Governments to include the nine counties that border the aforementioned estuaries : Alameda , Contra Costa , Marin , Napa , San Mateo , Santa Clara , Solano , Sonoma , and San Francisco . Other sources may exclude parts of or even entire counties , or expand the definition to include neighboring counties that do not border the bay such as San Benito , San Joaquin , and Santa Cruz . Home to approximately 7.75 million people , Northern California 's nine-county Bay Area contains many cities , towns , airports , and associated regional , state , and national parks , connected by a complex multimodal transportation network . The larger combined statistical area of the region , which includes fourteen counties , is the second-largest in California ( after the Greater Los Angeles area ) , the fifth-largest in the United States , and the 41st-largest urban area in the world with 9.67 million people . The Bay Area 's population is ethnically diverse : for example , roughly half of the region 's residents are Hispanic , Asian , African American , or Pacific Islander , all of whom have a significant presence throughout the region . The earliest archaeological evidence of human settlements in the Bay Area dates back to 8000-10,000 BC ( from shell mounds in the Coyote Hills ) . In 1769 , the Bay Area was inhabited by the Ohlone people when a Spanish exploration party led by Gaspar de Portol\u00e0 entered the Bay - the first documented European visit to the Bay Area . After Mexico established independence from Spain in 1821 , the region was briefly controlled by the Mexican government until the United States purchased the territory in 1846 during the Mexican-American War . Soon after , discovery of gold in California attracted a flood of treasure seekers , many using ports in the Bay Area as an entry point . During the early years of California 's statehood , state legislative business rotated between three locations in the Bay Area before a permanent state capital was established in Sacramento . A major earthquake leveled the city of San Francisco and environs in 1906 , but the region quickly rebuilt in time to host the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition ."
