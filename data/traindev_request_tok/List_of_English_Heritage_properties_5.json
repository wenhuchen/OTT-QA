It is situated on the cliff top at Ballowall Common , near St Just in Cornwall , England , UK . It is also known as Carn Gluze Barrow . It was first excavated in 1878 by William Copeland Borlase , when it was discovered under mining debris . A report by Sharpe ( 1999 ) states that there are several discrepancies in the accounts of the excavation work , some of the finds were lost and interpretation of the site is difficult . Reconstruction work which was done after the excavation to make the inside more accessible has further complicated the site . The site today is a confused mix of original and reconstructions introduced by Borlase . The finds from excavations are in stored in museums at Truro , Cambridge and the British Museum The barrow is 72 feet ( 22 m ) in diameter . The Cornwall and Scilly Historic Environment Record describes it as a central domed structure , containing cists and with a pit beneath , surrounded by an outer cairn also containing cists . An entrance grave is located in the external side of the outer cairn . The construction of the site is unique in consisting of a combination of Neolithic and Bronze age funerary rituals . A similar site was recorded by Borlase but its location has been lost .",
  "/wiki/Megalithic_tomb": "A megalith is a large stone that has been used to construct a structure or monument , either alone or together with other stones . The adjective megalithic describes structures made of such large stones without the use of mortar [ citation needed ] or concrete , as well as the periods of prehistory characterised by such constructions . There are over 35,000 megaliths in Europe alone , ranging from Sweden to the Mediterranean sea The word was first used in 1849 by the British antiquarian Algernon Herbert in reference to Stonehenge and derives from the Ancient Greek \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 ( transliteration m\u00e9gas , meaning great ) and \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 ( transliteration l\u00edthos meaning stone ) .

  "/wiki/Neolithic": "The Neolithic ( /\u02ccni\u02d0o\u028a\u02c8l\u026a\u03b8\u026ak/ ( listen ) , also known as the New Stone Age ) , the final division of the Stone Age , began about 12,000 years ago when the first developments of farming appeared in the Epipalaeolithic Near East , and later in other parts of the world . The division lasted until the transitional period of the Chalcolithic from about 6,500 years ago ( 4500 BC ) , marked by the development of metallurgy , leading up to the Bronze Age and Iron Age . In Northern Europe , the Neolithic lasted until about 1700 BC , while in China it extended until 1200 BC . Other parts of the world ( including the New World ) remained broadly in the Neolithic stage of development until European contact . The Neolithic comprises a progression of behavioral and cultural characteristics and changes , including the use of wild and domestic crops and of domesticated animals . [ a ] The term Neolithic derives from the Greek \u03bd\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2 n\u00e9os , new and \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 l\u00edthos , stone , literally meaning New Stone Age .

  "/wiki/Carn_Euny": "Carn Euny ( from Cornish : Karn Uni ) is an archaeological site near Sancreed , on the Penwith peninsula in Cornwall , United Kingdom with considerable evidence of both Iron Age and post-Iron Age settlement . Excavations on this site have shown that there was activity at Carn Euny as early as the Neolithic period . There is evidence that shows that the first timber huts there were built about 200 BC , but by the 1st century BC , these had been replaced by stone huts . The remains of these stone huts are still visible today . Carn Euny is best known for the well-preserved state of the large fogou , an underground passageway , which is more than 65 feet ( 20 metres ) long . This fogou runs just below the surface of the ground and is roofed with massive stone slabs . Although the exact purpose of these fogous is still a mystery , possibilities include storage , habitation , or ritual . The site was abandoned late in the Roman period .",

Though villages are often located in rural areas , the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighborhoods . Villages are normally permanent , with fixed dwellings ; however , transient villages can occur . Further , the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another , not scattered broadly over the landscape , as a dispersed settlement .",

Fewer than 15 confirmed fogous have been found .",
  "/wiki/Iron_Age": "The Iron Age is the final epoch of the three-age division of the prehistory and protohistory of humanity . It was preceded by the Stone Age ( Paleolithic , Mesolithic , Neolithic , and Chalcolithic ) and the Bronze Age . The concept has been mostly applied to Europe and the Ancient Near East , and , by analogy , also to other parts of the Old World . The duration of the Iron Age varies depending on the region under consideration . It is defined by archaeological convention , and the mere presence of some cast or wrought iron is not sufficient to represent an Iron Age culture ; rather , the Iron Age begins locally when the production of iron or steel has been brought to the point where iron tools and weapons superior to their bronze equivalents become widespread . For example , Tutankhamun 's meteoric iron dagger comes from the Bronze Age . In the Ancient Near East , this transition takes place in the wake of the so-called Bronze Age collapse , in the 12th century BC . The technology soon spread throughout the Mediterranean Basin region and to South Asia . Its further spread to Central Asia , Eastern Europe , and Central Europe is somewhat delayed , and Northern Europe is reached still later , by about 500 BC . The Iron Age is taken to end , also by convention , with the beginning of the historiographical record . This usually does not represent a clear break in the archaeological record ; for the Ancient Near East the establishment of the Achaemenid Empire c. 550 BC ( considered historical by virtue of the record by Herodotus ) is usually taken as a cut-off date , and in Central and Western Europe the Roman conquests of the 1st century BC serve as marking for the end of the Iron Age . The Germanic Iron Age of Scandinavia is taken to end c. 800 AD , with the beginning of the Viking Age .",

  "/wiki/Water_well": "A well is an excavation or structure created in the ground by digging , driving , or drilling to access liquid resources , usually water . The oldest and most common kind of well is a water well , to access groundwater in underground aquifers . The well water is drawn up by a pump , or using containers , such as buckets , that are raised mechanically or by hand . Water can also be injected back into the aquifer through the well . Wells were first constructed at least eight thousand years ago and historically vary in construction from a simple scoop in the sediment of a dry watercourse to the qanats of Iran , and the stepwells and sakiehs of India . Placing a lining in the well shaft helps create stability , and linings of wood or wickerwork date back at least as far as the Iron Age . Wells have traditionally been sunk by hand digging , as is the case in rural areas of the developing world . These wells are inexpensive and low-tech as they use mostly manual labour , and the structure can be lined with brick or stone as the excavation proceeds . A more modern method called caissoning uses pre-cast reinforced concrete well rings that are lowered into the hole . Driven wells can be created in unconsolidated material with a well hole structure , which consists of a hardened drive point and a screen of perforated pipe , after which a pump is installed to collect the water . Deeper wells can be excavated by hand drilling methods or machine drilling , using a bit in a borehole . Drilled wells are usually cased with a factory-made pipe composed of steel or plastic .",
  "/wiki/Halliggye_Fogou": "Halliggye Fogou is one of many fogous in Cornwall , England , United Kingdom . The site is under the guardianship of English Heritage , and managed by the Trelowarren Estate , where the fogou is located . Entry to the fogou is free but there is a charge to enter the rest of the Trelowarren Estate . The Halliggye Fogou consists of a long narrow tunnel leading to three sectioned chambers , and a window-like entrance which was dug in Victorian times by supposed treasure hunters ( this has since been filled in ) . The complex of passages has a roof and walls of stone , and is the largest and best-preserved of several mysterious tunnels associated with Cornish Iron Age settlements . It was described by Sir Richard Vyvyan in his Account of the fogou or cave at Halligey , Trelowarren , in the Journal of the Royal Institution of Cornwall ( 1885 , viii . 256-58 ) In 1861 , J. T. Blight wrote a comprehensive description and drafted plans of the fogou in conjunction with Sir Richard Vyvyan , the landowner who listed finds as a vase containing ashes and a roughly made cup , both of Celtic manufacture , and animal bones possibly from a deer . In the 1980s , a series of small excavations were carried out by English Heritage mainly to clear debris from the passage to aid examination and repair work after routine ploughing of the field , when the blade of the plough breached the roof of the main chamber : this hole has since been turned into an entrance stairway for visitors . Pottery found during excavations has included local Iron Age cordoned wares and some sherds of Roman Samian ware from southern Gaul . It was used during the Second World War by the Manaccan Auxiliary Unit as an explosives and ammunition store .",

  "/wiki/Stone_circle": "A stone circle is a circular alignment of standing stones . They are commonly found across Northern Europe and Great Britain , and typically date from the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age eras , with most concentrations appearing from 3000 BCE . The best known examples include those at the henge monument at Avebury , the Rollright Stones and elements within the ring of standing stones at Stonehenge . Ancient stone circles appear throughout Europe , with many appearing in the Pyrenees , on the Causse de Blandas in southern France in the Cevennes , in the Alps , Bulgaria , and Poland . Another type is found in the Horn of Africa . Stone circles are usually grouped in terms of the shape and size of the stones , the span of their radius and their population within the local area . Although many theories have been advance to explain their use , usually around providing a setting for ceremony or ritual , there is no consensus among archaeologists as to their intended function . Their construction often involved considerable communal effort , including specialist tasks such as planning , quarrying , transportation , laying the foundation trenches , and final construction .",

  "/wiki/High_cross": "A high cross or standing cross ( Irish : cros ard / ardchros , Scottish Gaelic : crois \u00e0rd / \u00e0rd-chrois , Welsh : croes uchel / croes eglwysig ) is a free-standing Christian cross made of stone and often richly decorated . There was a unique Early Medieval tradition in Ireland and Britain of raising large sculpted stone crosses , usually outdoors . These probably developed from earlier traditions using wood , perhaps with metalwork attachments , and earlier pagan Celtic memorial stones ; the Pictish stones of Scotland may also have influenced the form . The earliest surviving examples seem to come from the territory of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria , which had been converted to Christianity by Irish missionaries ; it remains unclear whether the form first developed in Ireland or Britain . Their relief decoration is a mixture of religious figures and sections of decoration such as knotwork , interlace and in Britain vine-scrolls , all in the styles also found in insular art in other media such as illuminated manuscripts and metalwork . They were probably normally painted , perhaps over a modelled layer of plaster ; with the loss of paint and the effects of weathering the reliefs , in particular scenes crowded with small figures , are often now rather indistinct and hard to read . The earlier crosses were typically up to about two metres or eight feet high , but in Ireland examples up to three times higher appear later , retaining thick massive proportions , giving large surface areas for carving . The tallest of the Irish crosses is the so-called Tall Cross at Monasterboice , County Louth . It stands at seven metres or twenty-two feet high . Anglo-Saxon examples mostly remained slender in comparison , but could be large ; except in earlier Northumbrian examples their decoration is mostly ornamental rather than figures . The crosses often , though not always , feature a stone ring around the intersection , forming a Celtic cross ; this seems clearly an innovation of Celtic Christianity , perhaps at Iona . The term high cross is mainly used in Ireland and Scotland , but the tradition across Britain and Ireland is essentially a single phenomenon , though there are certainly strong regional variations .",
  "/wiki/Launceston_Castle": "Launceston Castle is located in the town of Launceston , Cornwall , England . It was probably built by Robert the Count of Mortain after 1068 , and initially comprised an earthwork and timber castle with a large motte in one corner . Launceston Castle formed the administrative centre of the new earldom of Cornwall , with a large community packed within the walls of its bailey . It was rebuilt in stone in the 12th century and then substantially redeveloped by Richard of Cornwall after 1227 , including a high tower to enable visitors to view his surrounding lands . When Richard 's son , Edmund , inherited the castle , he moved the earldom 's administration to Lostwithiel , triggering the castle 's decline . By 1337 , the castle was increasingly ruinous and used primarily as a gaol and to host judicial assizes . The castle was captured by the rebels during the Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549 , and was garrisoned by the Royalists during the English Civil War in the 17th century . Towards the end of the civil war it was stripped for its building materials and rendered largely uninhabitable . A small gaol was erected in the centre of the bailey , which was also used for executions . The castle eventually became the county gaol for Cornwall , but was heavily criticised for its poor facilities and treatment of inmates . By 1842 , the remaining prisoners had been moved to Bodmin Gaol and the site was closed , the castle being landscaped to form a park by the Duke of Northumberland . During the Second World War , the site was used to host United States Army soldiers and , later , by the Air Ministry for offices .",
  "/wiki/Castle": "A castle is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages predominantly by the nobility or royalty and by military orders . Scholars debate the scope of the word castle , but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble . This is distinct from a palace , which is not fortified ; from a fortress , which was not always a residence for royalty or nobility ; and from a fortified settlement , which was a public defence - though there are many similarities among these types of construction . Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses . Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built , they took on a great many forms with many different features , although some , such as curtain walls , arrowslits , and portcullises , were commonplace . European-style castles originated in the 9th and 10th centuries , after the fall of the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes . These nobles built castles to control the area immediately surrounding them and the castles were both offensive and defensive structures ; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as offered protection from enemies . Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies , the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power . Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes , and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community , such as mills , fertile land , or a water source . Many northern European castles were originally built from earth and timber , but had their defences replaced later by stone . Early castles often exploited natural defences , lacking features such as towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep . In the late 12th and early 13th centuries , a scientific approach to castle defence emerged .",
  "/wiki/Pendennis_Castle": "Pendennis Castle is an artillery fort constructed by Henry VIII near Falmouth , Cornwall , England between 1540 and 1542 . It formed part of the King 's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire , and defended the Carrick Roads waterway at the mouth of the River Fal . The original , circular keep and gun platform was expanded at the end of the century to cope with the increasing Spanish threat , with a ring of extensive stone ramparts and bastions built around the older castle . Pendennis saw service during the English Civil War , when it was held by the Royalists , and was only taken by Parliament after a long siege in 1646 . It survived the interregnum and Charles II renovated the fortress after his restoration to the throne in 1660 . Ongoing concerns about a possible French invasion resulted in Pendennis 's defences being modernised and upgraded in the 1730s and again during the 1790s ; during the Napoleonic Wars , the castle held up to 48 guns . In the 1880s and 1890s an electrically operated minefield was laid across the River Fal , operated from Pendennis and St Mawes , and new , quick-firing guns were installed to support these defences . The castle saw service during both the First and Second World Wars , but in 1956 , by now obsolete , it was decommissioned . It passed into the control of the Ministry of Works , who cleared away many of the more modern military buildings and opened the site to visitors . In the 21st century , the castle is managed by English Heritage as a tourist attraction , receiving 74,230 visitors in 2011-12 .

The castle was built under the direction of Thomas Treffry to a clover leaf design , with a four-storey central tower and three protruding , round bastions that formed gun platforms . It was initially armed with 19 artillery pieces , intended for use against enemy shipping , operating in partnership with its sister castle of Pendennis on the other side of the estuary . During the English Civil War , St Mawes was held by Royalist supporters of King Charles I , but surrendered to a Parliamentary army in 1646 in the final phase of the conflict . The castle continued in use as a fort through the 18th and 19th centuries . In the early 1850s , fears of a fresh conflict with France , combined with changes in military technology , led to the redevelopment of the fortification . The out-dated Henrician castle was turned into a barracks and substantial gun batteries were constructed beneath it , equipped with the latest naval artillery . In the 1880s and 1890s an electronically-operated minefield was laid across the River Fal , operated from St Mawes and Pendennis , and new , quick-firing guns were installed at St Mawes to support these defences .

The site was possibly occupied in the Romano-British period , as an array of artefacts dating to this period have been found on the peninsula , but as yet no Roman-era structure has been proven to have existed there . It was settled during the early medieval period , when it was probably one of the seasonal residences of the regional king of Dumnonia . A castle was built on the site by Richard , 1st Earl of Cornwall in the 13th century , during the later medieval period . It later fell into disrepair and ruin . Archaeological investigation into the site began in the 19th century as it became a tourist attraction , with visitors coming to see the ruins of Richard 's castle . In the 1930s , excavations revealed significant traces of a much earlier high status settlement , which had trading links with the Mediterranean during the Late Roman period . The castle has a long association with legends related to King Arthur . This began in the 12th century when Geoffrey of Monmouth described Tintagel as the place of Arthur 's conception in his fictionalized account of British history , Historia Regum Britanniae . Geoffrey told the story that Arthur 's father , King Uther Pendragon , was disguised by Merlin 's sorcery to look like Gorlois , Duke of Cornwall , the husband of Igraine , Arthur 's mother .
