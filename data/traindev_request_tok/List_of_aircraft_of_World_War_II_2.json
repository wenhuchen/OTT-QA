  "/wiki/Bell_YFM-1_Airacuda": "The Bell YFM-1 Airacuda was an American heavy fighter aircraft , developed by the Bell Aircraft Corporation during the mid-1930s . It was the first military aircraft produced by Bell . Originally designated the Bell Model 1 , the Airacuda first flew on 1 September 1937 . The Airacuda was marked by bold design advances and considerable flaws that eventually grounded the aircraft . The Airacuda was Bell Aircraft 's answer for a bomber destroyer aircraft . Although it did see limited production , and one fully operational squadron was eventually formed , only one prototype and 12 production models were ultimately built , in three slightly different versions .",
  "/wiki/Blackburn_Roc": "The Blackburn B-25 Roc was a British Second World War-era Fleet Air Arm fighter aircraft designed by Blackburn Aircraft Ltd . It took its name from the mythical bird of the tales of the Arabian Nights , the Roc . Derived from the Blackburn Skua and developed in parallel , the Roc had its armament in a turret . The Roc came to be viewed as inferior to existing aircraft such as the Skua and the type had only brief front-line service .",
  "/wiki/Blackburn_Skua": "The Blackburn B-24 Skua was a carrier-based low-wing , two-seater , single-radial engine aircraft operated by the British Fleet Air Arm which combined the functions of a dive bomber and fighter . It was designed in the mid-1930s and saw service in the early part of the Second World War . It took its name from the sea bird .",
  "/wiki/Boulton_Paul_Defiant": "The Boulton Paul Defiant is a British interceptor aircraft that served with the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) during World War II . The Defiant was designed and built by Boulton Paul Aircraft as a turret fighter , without any forward-firing guns , also found in the Blackburn Roc of the Royal Navy . In combat , the Defiant was found to be reasonably effective at destroying bombers but was vulnerable to the Luftwaffe 's more manoeuvrable , single-seat Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters . The lack of forward-firing armament proved to be a great weakness in daylight combat and its potential was realised only when it was converted to night fighting . It was supplanted as a night fighter by the Bristol Beaufighter and de Havilland Mosquito . The Defiant found use in gunnery training , target towing , electronic countermeasures and air-sea rescue . Among RAF pilots it had the nickname Daffy .",
  "/wiki/Bristol_Beaufighter": "The Bristol Type 156 Beaufighter ( often called the Beau ) is a multi-role aircraft developed during the Second World War by the Bristol Aeroplane Company in the UK . It was originally conceived as a heavy fighter variant of the Bristol Beaufort torpedo bomber . The Beaufighter proved to be an effective night fighter , which came into service with the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) during the Battle of Britain , its large size allowing it to carry heavy armament and early airborne interception radar without major performance penalties . The Beaufighter was used in many roles ; receiving the nicknames Rockbeau for its use as a rocket-armed ground attack aircraft and Torbeau as a torpedo bomber against Axis shipping , in which it replaced the Beaufort . In later operations , it served mainly as a maritime strike/ground attack aircraft , RAF Coastal Command having operated the largest number of Beaufighters amongst all other commands at one point . The Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) also made extensive use of the type as an anti-shipping aircraft , such as during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea . The Beaufighter saw extensive service during the war with the RAF ( 59 squadrons ) , Fleet Air Arm ( 15 squadrons ) , RAAF ( seven squadrons ) , Royal Canadian Air Force ( four squadrons ) , United States Army Air Forces ( four squadrons ) , Royal New Zealand Air Force ( two squadrons ) , South African Air Force ( two squadrons ) and Polskie Si\u0142y Powietrzne ( Free Polish Air Force ; one squadron ) . Variants of the Beaufighter were manufactured in Australia by the Department of Aircraft Production ( DAP ) ; such aircraft are sometimes referred to by the name DAP Beaufighter .",
  "/wiki/Bristol_Blenheim": "The Bristol Blenheim is a British light bomber aircraft designed and built by the Bristol Aeroplane Company ( Bristol ) which was used extensively in the first two years and in some cases throughout the Second World War . The aircraft was developed as Type 142 , a civil airliner , in response to a challenge from Lord Rothermere to produce the fastest commercial aircraft in Europe . The Type 142 first flew in April 1935 , and the Air Ministry , impressed by its performance , ordered a modified design as the Type 142M for the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) as a bomber . Deliveries of the newly named Blenheim to RAF squadrons commenced on 10 March 1937 . A development of the Type 142M was the Type 149 which Bristol named the Bolingbroke , retrospectively changed by the Air Ministry to Blenheim Mk IV and the Type 142M to the Blenheim Mk I. Fairchild Canada built the Type 149 under licence as the Bolingbroke . Blenheims Mk I and the Mk IV were adapted as fighters by the addition of a gun pack of four Browning .303 machine guns in the bomb bay . The Mk IV was used as a long range fighter and as a maritime patrol aircraft ; both aircraft were used as bomber/gunnery trainers . The Blenheim was one of the first British aircraft with an all-metal stressed-skin construction , retractable landing gear , flaps , a powered gun turret and variable-pitch propellers . The Mk I was faster than most fighters in the late 1930s but the advance in development of monoplane fighters made all bombers more vulnerable particularly if flown in daylight , though it proved successful as a night fighter . The Blenheim was effective as a bomber but many were shot down . Both Blenheim types were used by overseas operators , being licence built in Yugoslavia and Finland .",
  "/wiki/De_Havilland_Mosquito": "The de Havilland DH.98 Mosquito is a British twin-engined , shoulder-winged multirole combat aircraft , introduced during the Second World War . Unusual in that its frame is constructed mostly of wood , it was nicknamed the Wooden Wonder , or Mossie . Lord Beaverbrook , Minister of Aircraft Production , nicknamed it Freeman 's Folly , alluding to Air Chief Marshal Sir Wilfrid Freeman , who defended Geoffrey de Havilland and his design concept against orders to scrap the project . In 1941 , it was one of the fastest operational aircraft in the world . Originally conceived as an unarmed fast bomber , the Mosquito 's use evolved during the war into many roles , including low- to medium-altitude daytime tactical bomber , high-altitude night bomber , pathfinder , day or night fighter , fighter-bomber , intruder , maritime strike , and photo-reconnaissance aircraft . It was also used by the British Overseas Airways Corporation as a fast transport to carry small , high-value cargo to and from neutral countries through enemy-controlled airspace . The crew of two , pilot and navigator , sat side by side . A single passenger could ride in the aircraft 's bomb bay when necessary . The Mosquito FBVI was often flown in special raids , such as Operation Jericho - an attack on Amiens Prison in early 1944 , and precision attacks against military intelligence , security , and police facilities ( such as Gestapo headquarters ) . On 30 January 1943 , the 10th anniversary of the Nazis ' seizure of power , a morning Mosquito attack knocked out the main Berlin broadcasting station while Hermann G\u00f6ring was speaking , putting his speech off the air . The Mosquito flew with the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) and other air forces in the European , Mediterranean and Italian theatres . The Mosquito was also operated by the RAF in the Southeast Asian theatre and by the Royal Australian Air Force based in the Halmaheras and Borneo during the Pacific War .",
  "/wiki/Dornier_Do_215": "The Dornier Do 215 was a light bomber , aerial reconnaissance aircraft and later a night fighter , produced by Dornier originally for export , but in the event most served in the Luftwaffe . Like its predecessor , the Dornier Do 17 , it inherited the title The Flying Pencil because of its slim fuselage . The successor of the Do 215 was the Do 217 .",
  "/wiki/Dornier_Do_217": "The Dornier Do 217 was a bomber used by the German Luftwaffe during World War II as a more powerful development of the Dornier Do 17 , known as the Fliegender Bleistift ( German : flying pencil ) . Designed in 1937 and 1938 as a heavy bomber but not meant to be capable of the longer-range missions envisioned for the larger Heinkel He 177 , the Do 217 's design was refined during 1939 and production began in late 1940 . It entered service in early 1941 and by the beginning of 1942 was available in significant numbers . The Dornier Do 217 had a much larger bomb load capacity and had much greater range than the Do 17 . In later variants , dive bombing and maritime strike capabilities using glide bombs were experimented with , considerable success being achieved . Early Do 217 variants were more powerful than the contemporary Heinkel He 111 and Junkers Ju 88 , having a greater speed , range and bomb load . Owing to this it was called a heavy bomber rather than a medium bomber . The Do 217 served on all fronts in all roles . On the Eastern Front and Western Front it operated as a strategic bomber , torpedo bomber and reconnaissance aircraft . It also performed tactical operations , either direct ground assault or anti-shipping strikes during the Battle of the Atlantic and Battle of Normandy . The Do 217 was also converted to become a night fighter and saw considerable action in the Defence of the Reich campaign until late in the war . The type also served in anti-shipping units in the Mediterranean , attacking Allied convoys and naval units during the Battle of the Mediterranean .",
  "/wiki/Dornier_Do_335": "The Dornier Do 335 Pfeil ( Arrow ) was a Nazi Germany World War II heavy fighter built by the Dornier company . The two-seater trainer version was called Ameisenb\u00e4r ( anteater ) . The Pfeil 's performance was much better than other twin-engine designs due to its unique push-pull configuration and the lower aerodynamic drag of the in-line alignment of the two engines . It was Nazi Germany 's fastest piston-engined aircraft of World War II . [ page needed ] The Luftwaffe was desperate to get the design into operational use , but delays in engine deliveries meant that only a handful were delivered before the war ended .",
  "/wiki/Douglas_P-70_Havoc": "The Douglas A-20 Havoc ( company designation DB-7 ) is an American medium bomber , attack aircraft , night intruder , night fighter , and reconnaissance aircraft of World War II . It served with several Allied air forces , principally the United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) , the Soviet Air Forces ( VVS ) , Soviet Naval Aviation ( AVMF ) , and the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) of the United Kingdom . A total of 7,478 aircraft were built , of which more than a third served with Soviet units . It was also used by the air forces of Australia , South Africa , France , and the Netherlands during the war , and by Brazil afterwards . In most British Commonwealth air forces , the bomber variants were named Boston , while the night fighter and intruder variants were named Havoc . The exception was the Royal Australian Air Force , which used the name Boston for all variants . The USAAF used the P-70 designation to refer to the night fighter variants .",
  "/wiki/Fairey_Firefly": "The Fairey Firefly was a Second World War-era carrier-borne fighter aircraft and anti-submarine aircraft principally operated by the Fleet Air Arm ( FAA ) . It was developed and built by the British aircraft manufacturer Fairey Aviation Company . Development of the Firefly can be traced back to pair of specifications issued by the British Air Ministry in 1938 , calling for new naval fighter designs . Designed to the contemporary FAA concept of a two-seat fleet reconnaissance/fighter , the pilot and navigator/weapons officer were positioned at separate stations . In flight , the Firefly was superior in terms of both performance and firepower to its predecessor , the Fairey Fulmar . Due to a protracted development , the type only entered operational service towards the end of the conflict , at which point it was no longer competitive as a fighter . The limitations of a single engine in a relatively heavy airframe reduced its performance , but the Firefly proved to be fairly sturdy , long-ranged , and docile aircraft during carrier operations . The Fairey Firefly served in the Second World War as a fleet fighter . During the post-war era , it was soon superseded in the fighter role by the arrival of more modern jet aircraft , thus the Firefly was adapted to perform in other roles , including strike operations and anti-submarine warfare . In these capacities , it remained a mainstay of the FAA until the mid-1950s . Both British and Australian Fireflies routinely performed ground-attack operations from various aircraft carriers during the Korean War . In foreign service , the type was in operation with the naval air arms of Australia , Canada , India and the Netherlands .",
  "/wiki/Fairey_Fulmar": "The Fairey Fulmar was a British carrier-borne reconnaissance aircraft/fighter aircraft developed and manufactured by aircraft company Fairey Aviation . It was named after the northern fulmar , a seabird native to the British Isles . The Fulmar served with the Royal Navy 's Fleet Air Arm ( FAA ) during the Second World War . The design of the Fulmar was based on that of the earlier Fairey P.4/34 , a land-based fighter was developed during 1936 as a replacement for the Fairey Battle light bomber . Fairey had redesigned the aircraft as a navalised observation/fighter aircraft to satisfy the requirements of Specification O.8/38 , for which it was selected . Although its performance ( like that of its Battle antecedent ) was unspectacular , the Fulmar was a reliable , sturdy aircraft with long range and an effective armament of eight machine guns ; the type could also be put into production relatively quickly . On 4 January 1940 , the first production aircraft made its first flight and delivered commenced shortly thereafter , while production of an improved model , the Fulmar Mk II , started during January 1941 . Fairey produced a total of 600 Fulmars at its Stockport factory between January 1940 and December 1942 . During July 1940 , No . 806 Squadron became the first FAA squadron to received the Fulmar . It participated in the pursuit and sinking of the German battleship German battleship Bismarck , having acted as a spotter for the chasing fleet . The Fulmar was heavily used in the North African Campaign , flying convoy protection patrols to and from the island of Malta , and providing air cover for Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers during attacks such as the Battle of Taranto and the Battle of Cape Matapan .",

Although in production prior to World War II , its combat introduction came at a time the Netherlands were overrun by the Germans . The few G.Is that were mustered into service were able to score several victories . Some were captured intact after the Germans had occupied the Netherlands . The remainder of the production run was taken over by the Luftwaffe for use as trainers .",
  "/wiki/Grumman_F7F_Tigercat": "The Grumman F7F Tigercat is a heavy fighter aircraft that served with the United States Navy ( USN ) and United States Marine Corps ( USMC ) from late in World War II until 1954 . It was the first twin-engine fighter to be deployed by the USN . While the Tigercat was delivered too late to see combat in World War II , it saw action as a night fighter and attack aircraft during the Korean War . Designed initially for service on Midway-class aircraft carriers , early production F7Fs were land-based variants . The type was too large to operate from older and smaller carriers , and only a late variant ( F7F-4N ) was certified for carrier service .",
  "/wiki/Heinkel_He_219": "The Heinkel He 219 Uhu ( Eagle-Owl ) was a night fighter that served with the German Luftwaffe in the later stages of World War II . A relatively sophisticated design , the He 219 possessed a variety of innovations , including Lichtenstein SN-2 advanced VHF-band intercept radar , also used on the Ju 88G and Bf 110G night fighters . It was also the first operational military aircraft to be equipped with ejection seats and the first operational German World War II-era aircraft with tricycle landing gear . Had the Uhu been available in quantity , it might have had a significant effect on the strategic night bombing offensive of the Royal Air Force ; however , only 294 of all models were built by the end of the war and these saw only limited service . Ernst-Wilhelm Modrow was the leading night fighter ace on the He 219 . Modrow was credited with 33 of his 34 night air victories on the type .",

  "/wiki/Junkers_Ju_88": "The Junkers Ju 88 was a German World War II Luftwaffe twin-engined multirole combat aircraft . Junkers Aircraft and Motor Works ( JFM ) designed the plane in the mid-1930s as a so-called fast bomber that would be too fast for fighters of its era to intercept . It suffered from technical problems during its development and early operational periods but became one of the most versatile combat aircraft of the war . Like a number of other Luftwaffe bombers , it served as a bomber , dive bomber , night fighter , torpedo bomber , reconnaissance aircraft , heavy fighter and at the end of the war , as a flying bomb . Despite a protracted development , it became one of the Luftwaffe 's most important aircraft . The assembly line ran constantly from 1936 to 1945 and more than 15,000 Ju 88s were built in dozens of variants , more than any other twin-engine German aircraft of the period . Throughout production the basic structure of the aircraft remained unchanged .",
