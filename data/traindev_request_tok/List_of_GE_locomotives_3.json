  "/wiki/AAR_wheel_arrangement": "The AAR wheel arrangement system is a method of classifying locomotive ( or unit ) wheel arrangements that was developed by the Association of American Railroads . It is essentially a simplification of the European UIC classification , and it is widely used in North America to describe diesel and electric locomotives . It is not used for steam locomotives which use the Whyte notation instead . The AAR system counts axles instead of wheels . Letters refer to powered axles , and numbers to unpowered ( or idler ) axles . A refers to one powered axle , B to two powered axles in a row , C to three powered axles in a row , and D to four powered axles in a row . 1 refers to one idler axle , and 2 to two idler axles in a row . A dash ( - ) separates trucks , or wheel assemblies . A plus sign ( + ) refers to articulation , either by connecting bogies with span bolsters or by connecting individual locomotives via solid drawbars instead of couplers .",
  "/wiki/Prime_mover_(locomotive)": "In engineering , a prime mover is an engine that converts fuel to useful work . In locomotives , the prime mover is thus the source of power for its propulsion . In an engine-generator set , the engine is the prime mover , as distinct from the generator .",
  "/wiki/Horsepower": "Horsepower ( hp ) is a unit of measurement of power , or the rate at which work is done , usually in reference to the output of engines or motors . There are many different standards and types of horsepower . Two common definitions being used today are the mechanical horsepower ( or imperial horsepower ) , which is about 745.7 watts , and the metric horsepower , which is approximately 735.5 watts . The term was adopted in the late 18th century by Scottish engineer James Watt to compare the output of steam engines with the power of draft horses . It was later expanded to include the output power of other types of piston engines , as well as turbines , electric motors and other machinery . The definition of the unit varied among geographical regions . Most countries now use the SI unit watt for measurement of power . With the implementation of the EU Directive 80/181/EEC on January 1 , 2010 , the use of horsepower in the EU is permitted only as a supplementary unit .",
  "/wiki/GE_UM12C": "The UM12C is a type of diesel-electric locomotive manufactured by GE for Southeast Asian rail companies . It is currently in service with the State Railway of Thailand . It was also operated by the Manila Railroad Company ( later the Philippine National Railways ) from 1956 until the late 1990s . While the units for both companies feature a shovelnose layout , the MRR locomotives were single-ended and had a cowl unit cab , the SRT locomotives are double-ended cab forward units .",
  "/wiki/Philippine_National_Railways": "The Philippine National Railways also known as ( PNR ) ( Filipino : Pambansang Daambakal ng Pilipinas and Spanish : Ferrocarril Nacional de Filipinas ) is a state-owned railway company in the Philippines , operating a single line of track on Luzon . As of 2016 , it operates one commuter rail service in Metro Manila and local services between Sipocot , Naga City and Legazpi City in the Bicol Region . PNR began operations on November 24 , 1892 as the Ferrocarril de Manila-Dagupan , during the Spanish colonial period , and later becoming the Manila Railroad Company ( MRR ) during the American colonial period . It became the Philippine National Railways on June 20 , 1964 by virtue of Republic Act No . 4156 . The PNR is an agency of the Department of Transportation . PNR used to operate over 1,100 km ( 684 mi ) of route from La Union to the Bicol Region . However , neglect reduced PNR 's service . Persistent problems with informal settlers in the 1990s contributed further to PNR 's decline . In 2006 , Typhoons Milenyo and Reming caused severe damage to the network , resulting in the suspension of the Manila-Bicol services . In 2007 the Philippine government initiated a rehabilitation project aiming to remove informal settlers from the PNR right of way , revitalize commuter services in Metro Manila , and restore the Manila-Bicol route as well as lost services in Northern Luzon . In July 2009 , PNR unveiled a new corporate identity and inaugurated new rolling stock .",

The U26C locomotives were built for 1,000 mm ( 3 ft 3 3\u20448 in ) metre gauge networks in Brazil and Kenya , and 3 ft 6 in ( 1,067 mm ) networks in New Zealand and South Africa . All had a power output of 2,050 kW ( 2,750 hp ) as built , except the locomotives delivered new to Kenya , which were derated to 1,950 kW ( 2,610 hp ) . Some of the New Zealand units were later uprated in power output , and four of the Brazilian units were later regauged to 1,600 mm ( 5 ft 3 in ) broad gauge . Another more powerful version , license-built by Krupp , and referred to as a GE U30C model , was delivered to the 3 ft 6 in ( 1,067 mm ) TAZARA Railway , which links Tanzania with Zambia .",

  "/wiki/GE_U30C": "The GE U30C was one of the earliest successes from General Electric in the diesel locomotive market . With 600 units sold , the U30C proved to be a viable alternative for customers who were unable to purchase SD40s from Electro-Motive Diesel ( EMD ) due to production backlog . Throughout its ten-year production span , the U30C was known for reliability issues concerning its electrical system . However , most railroads were assured of the reliability of the GE Model 752 DC traction motor , and began to place orders for U30Cs starting in 1966 . When production ended , the last U30Cs carried pre-Dash 7 specifications , which would be carried in its replacement , the GE C30-7 . The U30C served customers of all kinds , from mining , to general freights , coal trains , and even as a power source unit for the Department of Transportation 's subway-car test tracks in Pueblo , Colorado before a connection from the commercial electric power grid could be established ( Cudahy 1979 ) . Not to be outdone in the freight sector , GE produced a passenger version of the locomotive , the GE U30CG . The U30CG only sold six units for the Atchison , Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad . When most U30Cs were being retired due to old age and mechanical or electrical problems , General Electric initiated a rebuild program where older Universal Series locomotives would be upgraded with the latest technology and fuel-saving systems . GE would then strip the locomotive down to its frame and engine , and completely rebuild the locomotive with new components . When completed , the unit would receive a new designation : GE C30-S7R ( R for Rebuilt frame of traded-in locomotive ) . In the later years , the rebuild frame was discontinued , and a brand new frame would be used , re-designating the locomotive as GE C30-S7N ( N for New frame ) .",
