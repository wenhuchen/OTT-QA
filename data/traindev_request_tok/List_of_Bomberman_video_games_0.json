  "/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System": "The Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) is an 8-bit third-generation home video game console produced , released , and marketed by Nintendo . It is a remodelled export version of the company 's Family Computer [ a ] ( FC ) platform in Japan , commonly known as the Famicom [ b ] , which was launched on July 15 , 1983 . The NES was launched in a test market of New York City on October 18 , 1985 , followed by Los Angeles as a second test market in February 1986 , followed by Chicago and San Francisco , then other top 12 American markets , followed by a full launch across North America and some countries in Europe in September 1986 , followed by Australia and other countries in Europe in 1987 . Brazil saw only unlicensed clones until the official local release in 1993 . The console 's South Korean release was packaged as the Hyundai Comboy [ c ] and distributed by Hyundai Electronics ( now SK Hynix ) . As one of the best-selling gaming consoles of its time , the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983 . With the NES , Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers , authorizing them to produce and distribute games for Nintendo 's platform . It had been preceded by Nintendo 's first home video game console , the Color TV-Game , and was succeeded by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System ( SNES ) .",
  "/wiki/MSX": "MSX is a standardized home computer architecture , announced by Microsoft and ASCII on June 16 , 1983 . It was conceived and marketed by Kazuhiko Nishi , then vice-president at Microsoft and director at ASCII Corporation . Nishi conceived the project as an attempt to create unified standards among various home computing system manufacturers of the period , in the same fashion as the VHS standard for home video tape machines . MSX systems were popular in Japan and several other countries . It is difficult to determine how many MSX computers were sold worldwide , but eventually 5 million MSX-based units were sold in Japan alone . Despite Microsoft 's involvement , few MSX-based machines were released in the United States . Before the great success of Nintendo 's Family Computer , MSX was the platform for which major Japanese game studios such as Konami and Hudson Soft produced video games . The Metal Gear series , for example , was first written for MSX hardware .",

It runs the original Series 60 platform on Symbian OS v6.1 . N-Gage attempted to lure gamers away from the Game Boy Advance by including telephone functionality . This was unsuccessful , partly because the buttons , designed for a telephone , were not well-suited for gaming . The original N-Gage was described as resembling a taco , which led to its mocking nickname Taco phone . Nokia introduced the N-Gage QD in 2004 as a redesign of the original Classic N-Gage , fixing widely criticized issues and design problems . However , the new model was unable to make an impact , and with only 2 million units sold in its two years , the N-Gage and its QD model were a commercial failure , unable to challenge their Nintendo rival . The N-Gage was discontinued in November 2005 , with Nokia moving its gaming capabilities onto selected Series 60 smartphones . This was announced as the N-Gage platform or N-Gage 2.0 in 2007 , carrying on the N-Gage name .",

The Japanese model was imported and distributed in France in 1989 and United Kingdom and Spain received a version based on the American model known as simply TurboGrafx . It was the first console released in the 16-bit era , although it used a modified 8-bit CPU . In Japan , the system was launched as a competitor to the Famicom but the delayed United States release meant that it ended up competing with the Sega Genesis and later on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System .

  "/wiki/Amiga": "The Amiga is a family of personal computers introduced by Commodore in 1985 . The original model was part of a series of 16/32- and 32-bit computers that featured 256 KB or more of RAM , mouse-based GUIs , and significantly improved graphics and audio over 8-bit systems . This wave included the Atari ST - released the same year - Apple 's Macintosh , and later the Apple IIGS . Based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor , the Amiga differed from its contemporaries through the inclusion of custom hardware to accelerate graphics and sound , including sprites and a blitter , and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS . The Amiga 1000 was released in July 1985 , but a series of production problems kept it from becoming widely available until early 1986 . The best selling model , the Amiga 500 , was introduced in 1987 and became one of the leading home computers of the late 1980s and early 1990s with four to six million sold . The A3000 was introduced in 1990 , followed by the A500+ , and the A600 in March 1992 . Finally , the A1200 and the A4000 were released in late 1992 . The platform became particularly popular for gaming and programming demos . It also found a prominent role in the desktop video , video production , and show control business , leading to video editing systems such as the Video Toaster . The Amiga 's native ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it a popular platform for early tracker music software . The relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory enabled the development of 3D rendering packages , including LightWave 3D , Imagine , Aladdin4D , TurboSilver and Traces , a predecessor to Blender .",
  "/wiki/MS-DOS": "MS-DOS ( /\u02cc\u025bm\u02cc\u025bs\u02c8d\u0252s/ em-es-DOSS ; acronym for Microsoft Disk Operating System ) is an operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft . Collectively , MS-DOS , its rebranding as IBM PC DOS , and some operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS-DOS , are sometimes referred to as DOS ( which is also the generic acronym for disk operating system ) . MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s , from which point it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface ( GUI ) , in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system . IBM licensed and re-released it in 1981 , as PC DOS 1.0 for use in its PCs . Although MS-DOS and PC DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM , the two products diverged after twelve years , in 1993 , with recognizable differences in compatibility , syntax , and capabilities . During its lifetime , several competing products were released for the x86 platform , and MS-DOS went through eight versions , until development ceased in 2000 . Initially , MS-DOS was targeted at Intel 8086 processors running on computer hardware using floppy disks to store and access not only the operating system , but application software and user data as well . Progressive version releases delivered support for other mass storage media in ever greater sizes and formats , along with added feature support for newer processors and rapidly evolving computer architectures . Ultimately , it was the key product in Microsoft 's development from a programming language company to a diverse software development firm , providing the company with essential revenue and marketing resources . It was also the underlying basic operating system on which early versions of Windows ran as a GUI . It is a flexible operating system , and consumes negligible installation space .",

The 1040ST , released in 1986 , is the first personal computer to ship with a megabyte of RAM in the base configuration and also the first with a cost-per-kilobyte of less than US $ 1 . The Atari ST is part of a mid-1980s generation of home computers that have 16 or 32-bit processors , 256 KB or more of RAM , and mouse-controlled graphical user interfaces . This generation includes the Macintosh , Commodore Amiga , Apple IIGS , and , the most advanced true 32bit Acorn Archimedes . ST officially stands for Sixteen/Thirty-two , which refers to the Motorola 68000 's 16-bit external bus and 32-bit internals . The ST was sold with either Atari 's color monitor or the less expensive monochrome monitor . The system 's two color graphics modes are only available on the former while the highest-resolution mode needs the monochrome monitor . In some markets , particularly Germany , the machine gained a strong foothold as a small business machine for CAD and desktop publishing work . Thanks to its built-in MIDI ports , the ST enjoyed success for running music sequencer software and as a controller of musical instruments among amateurs and well-known musicians alike .

The console was pushed to market in an unfinished state in 1995 to focus on Nintendo 64 development . The Virtual Boy was panned by critics and was a commercial failure .",

  "/wiki/Personal_computer": "A personal computer ( PC ) is a multi-purpose computer whose size , capabilities , and price make it feasible for individual use . Personal computers are intended to be operated directly by an end user , rather than by a computer expert or technician . Unlike large costly minicomputers and mainframes , time-sharing by many people at the same time is not used with personal computers . Institutional or corporate computer owners in the 1960s had to write their own programs to do any useful work with the machines . While personal computer users may develop their own applications , usually these systems run commercial software , free-of-charge software ( freeware ) , which is most often proprietary , or free and open-source software , which is provided in ready-to-run , or binary , form . Software for personal computers is typically developed and distributed independently from the hardware or operating system manufacturers . Many personal computer users no longer need to write their own programs to make any use of a personal computer , although end-user programming is still feasible . This contrasts with mobile systems , where software is often only available through a manufacturer-supported channel , and end-user program development may be discouraged by lack of support by the manufacturer . Since the early 1990s , Microsoft operating systems and Intel hardware dominated much of the personal computer market , first with MS-DOS and then with Microsoft Windows . Alternatives to Microsoft 's Windows operating systems occupy a minority share of the industry . These include Apple 's macOS and free and open-source Unix-like operating systems . The advent of personal computers and the concurrent Digital Revolution have significantly affected the lives of people in all countries ."
