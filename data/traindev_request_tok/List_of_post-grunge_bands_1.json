  "/wiki/Audioslave": "Audioslave was an American rock supergroup formed in Glendale , California in 2001 . The four-piece band consisted of Soundgarden 's lead singer and rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell with Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello ( lead guitar ) , Tim Commerford ( bass/backing vocals ) , and Brad Wilk ( drums ) . Critics first described Audioslave as a combination of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine , but by the band 's second album , Out of Exile , it was noted that they had established a separate identity . Their unique sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock and 1990s alternative rock , with musical influences that included 1960s funk , soul and R & B . As with Rage Against the Machine , the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitars , bass , drums , and vocals , with emphasis on Cornell 's wide vocal range and Morello 's unconventional guitar solos . In their six years together , Audioslave released three albums , received three Grammy nominations , sold more than eight million records worldwide and became the first American rock band to perform an open-air concert in Cuba . They disbanded in February 2007 after Cornell issued a statement announcing that he was leaving the band . Later that year , Cornell and Morello released solo albums , and Morello , Commerford , and Wilk reunited with Zack de la Rocha for the Rage Against the Machine Reunion Tour . Since 2015 , both Cornell and Morello expressed interest in the possibility of an Audioslave reunion , and the band reunited to perform at Prophets of Rage 's Anti-Inaugural Ball , which took place on January 20 , 2017 . While Cornell and Morello were hopeful for future Audioslave reunions , Cornell committed suicide after a Soundgarden show in Detroit in May 2017 , ending the possibility of a full-time Audioslave reunion .",
