  "/wiki/Prison": "A prison , [ a ] also known as a correctional facility , jail , [ b ] gaol ( dated , British and Australian English [ c ] ) , penitentiary ( American English ) , detention center ( or centre if outside the US ) , correctional center , [ d ] ( American English ) or remand center , is a facility in which inmates ( or prisoners ) are forcibly confined and denied a variety of freedoms under the authority of the state . Prisons are most commonly used within a criminal justice system : people charged with crimes may be imprisoned until their trial ; those pleading or being found guilty of crimes at trial may be sentenced to a specified period of imprisonment . In simplest terms , a prison can also be described as a building in which people are legally held as a punishment for a crime they have committed . Prisons can also be used as a tool of political repression by authoritarian regimes . Their perceived opponents may be imprisoned for political crimes , often without trial or other legal due process ; this use is illegal under most forms of international law governing fair administration of justice . In times of war , prisoners of war or detainees may be detained in military prisons or prisoner of war camps , and large groups of civilians might be imprisoned in internment camps . In American English , the terms prison and jail have separate definitions , though this is not always followed in casual speech . A prison or penitentiary holds people for longer periods of time , such as many years , and is operated by a state or federal government . A jail holds people for shorter periods of time ( e.g . for shorter sentences or pre-trial detention ) and is usually operated by a local government . Outside of North America , prison and jail have the same meaning . Slang terms for a prison include : the pokey , the slammer , the cage , the can , the clink , the joint , the calaboose , the hoosegow , crowbar hotel and the big house .",

  "/wiki/Contributing_property": "In the law regulating historic districts in the United States , a contributing property or contributing resource is any building , object , or structure which adds to the historical integrity or architectural qualities that make the historic district , listed locally or federally , significant . Government agencies , at the state , national , and local level in the United States , have differing definitions of what constitutes a contributing property but there are common characteristics . Local laws often regulate the changes that can be made to contributing structures within designated historic districts . The first local ordinances dealing with the alteration of buildings within historic districts was in Charleston , South Carolina in 1931 . Properties within a historic district fall into one of two types of property : contributing and non-contributing . A contributing property , such as a 19th-century mansion , helps make a historic district historic , while a non-contributing property , such as a modern medical clinic , does not . The contributing properties are key to a historic district 's historic associations , historic architectural qualities , or archaeological qualities . A property can change from contributing to non-contributing and vice versa if significant alterations take place .",

  "/wiki/Water_tower": "A water tower is an elevated structure supporting a water tank constructed at a height sufficient to pressurize a water distribution system for the distribution of potable water , and to provide emergency storage for fire protection . In some places , the term standpipe is used interchangeably to refer to a water tower . Water towers often operate in conjunction with underground or surface service reservoirs , which store treated water close to where it will be used . Other types of water towers may only store raw ( non-potable ) water for fire protection or industrial purposes , and may not necessarily be connected to a public water supply . Water towers are able to supply water even during power outages , because they rely on hydrostatic pressure produced by elevation of water ( due to gravity ) to push the water into domestic and industrial water distribution systems ; however , they can not supply the water for a long time without power , because a pump is typically required to refill the tower . A water tower also serves as a reservoir to help with water needs during peak usage times . The water level in the tower typically falls during the peak usage hours of the day , and then a pump fills it back up during the night . This process also keeps the water from freezing in cold weather , since the tower is constantly being drained and refilled . [ citation needed ]",

  "/wiki/Skyscraper": "A skyscraper is a continuously habitable high-rise building that has over 40 floors and is taller than approximately 150 m ( 492 ft ) . Historically , the term first referred to buildings with 10 to 20 floors in the 1880s . The definition shifted with advancing construction technology during the 20th century . Skyscrapers may host offices , residential spaces , and retail spaces . For buildings above a height of 300 m ( 984 ft ) , the term supertall skyscrapers can be used , while skyscrapers reaching beyond 600 m ( 1,969 ft ) are classified as megatall skyscrapers . One common feature of skyscrapers is having a steel framework that supports curtain walls . These curtain walls either bear on the framework below or are suspended from the framework above , rather than resting on load-bearing walls of conventional construction . Some early skyscrapers have a steel frame that enables the construction of load-bearing walls taller than of those made of reinforced concrete . Modern skyscrapers ' walls are not load-bearing , and most skyscrapers are characterised by large surface areas of windows made possible by steel frames and curtain walls . However , skyscrapers can have curtain walls that mimic conventional walls with a small surface area of windows . Modern skyscrapers often have a tubular structure , and are designed to act like a hollow cylinder to resist wind , seismic , and other lateral loads . To appear more slender , allow less wind exposure and transmit more daylight to the ground , many skyscrapers have a design with setbacks , which in some cases is also structurally required .",

Most diners have extended hours , and some along highways and areas with significant shift work stay open for 24 hours . Even today [ when ? ] many diners share an archetypal exterior form . Some of the earliest were converted rail cars , retaining their streamlined structure and interior fittings . From the 1920s to the 1940s , diners , by then commonly known as lunch cars , were usually prefabricated in factories , like modern mobile homes , and delivered on site with only the utilities needing to be connected . As a result , many early diners were typically small and narrow in order to fit onto a rail car or truck . This small footprint also allowed them to be fitted into tiny and relatively inexpensive lots that otherwise were unable to support a larger enterprise . Diners were historically small businesses operated by the owner , with some presence of restaurant chains evolving over time . Diners typically serve staples of American cuisine such as hamburgers , french fries , club sandwiches , and other simple , quickly cooked , and inexpensive fare , such as meatloaf .

However , the terms terminal and concourse are sometimes used interchangeably , depending on the configuration of the airport . Smaller airports have one terminal while larger airports have several terminals and/or concourses . At small airports , the single terminal building typically serves all of the functions of a terminal and a concourse . Some larger airports have one terminal that is connected to multiple concourses via walkways , sky-bridges , or tunnels ( such as Denver International Airport , modeled after Atlanta 's , the world 's busiest ) . Some larger airports have more than one terminal , each with one or more concourses ( such as New York 's John F. Kennedy International Airport and Chicago 's O'Hare International Airport ) . Still other larger airports have multiple terminals each of which incorporate the functions of a concourse ( such as Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport ) .
