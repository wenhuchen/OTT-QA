It is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States . Its residents are known as Oklahomans ( or colloquially , Okies ) , and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City . The state 's name is derived from the Choctaw words okla and humma , meaning red people . It is also known informally by its nickname , The Sooner State , in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on land before the official opening date of lands in the western Oklahoma Territory or before the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889 , which increased European-American settlement in the eastern Indian Territory . Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged into the State of Oklahoma when it became the 46th state to enter the union on November 16 , 1907 . With ancient mountain ranges , prairie , mesas , and eastern forests , most of Oklahoma lies in the Great Plains , Cross Timbers , and the U.S . Interior Highlands , all regions prone to severe weather . Oklahoma is on a confluence of three major American cultural regions and historically served as a route for cattle drives , a destination for Southern settlers , and a government-sanctioned territory for Native Americans . More than 25 Native American languages are spoken in Oklahoma . A major producer of natural gas , oil , and agricultural products , Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation , energy , telecommunications , and biotechnology . Both Oklahoma City and Tulsa serve as Oklahoma 's primary economic anchors , with nearly two-thirds of Oklahomans living within their metropolitan statistical areas .",
  "/wiki/Avak_crater": "Avak is an impact crater centered approximately 12 km ( 7.5 mi ) southeast of Utqiagvik , Alaska , United States . Avak is a subcircular structure about 8 km ( 5.0 mi ) in diameter and 1 km ( 0.62 mi ) deep . In the structure , metamorphic basement rocks and regionally flat lying sedimentary rocks are uplifted and intensely deformed . The Avak structure has no surface expression in the swampy , lake-dotted tundra of the Arctic coastal plain . The structure is covered by a thin veneer of permanently frozen Pliocene and Pleistocene rock . This means that the age of the impact took place anywhere between 95 million and 3 million years ago . Palynological data on its ejecta suggest Middle-Late Turonian age of the impact ( about 90 million years ago ) . The Avak structure provides the structural trap for the natural gas in the adjacent South Barrow and East Barrow gas fields . These fields have accumulated about 37 bcf of natural gas in Jurassic sandstones .",

An exclave of the U.S. , it borders the Canadian province of British Columbia and territory of Yukon to the east and southeast has a maritime border with Russia 's Chukotka Autonomous Okrug to the west . To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seas of the Arctic Ocean , while the Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest . Alaska is the largest U.S. state by area and the seventh largest subnational division in the world . It is the third least populous and the most sparsely populated state , but by far the continent 's most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel , with an estimated population of 738,432 as 2015 - more than quadruple the combined populations of Northern Canada and Greenland . Approximately half of Alaska 's residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area . The state capital of Juneau is the second largest city in the United States by area , comprising more territory than the states of Rhode Island and Delaware . Alaska was occupied by various indigenous peoples for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans . The state is considered the entry point for the settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge . The Russians were the first non-native people to settle the area beginning in the 18th century , eventually establishing the colony of Alaska that spanned most of the current state . The expense and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted its sale to the U.S. in 1867 for $ 7.2 million , or approximately two cents per acre ( $ 4.74/km2 ) . The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a territory on May 11 , 1912 .",
  "/wiki/Meteor_Crater": "Meteor Crater is a meteorite impact crater approximately 37 miles ( 60 km ) east of Flagstaff and 18 miles ( 29 km ) west of Winslow in the northern Arizona desert of the United States . Because the United States Board on Geographic Names commonly recognizes names of natural features derived from the nearest post office , the feature acquired the name of Meteor Crater from the nearby post office named Meteor . The site was formerly known as the Canyon Diablo Crater and fragments of the meteorite are officially called the Canyon Diablo Meteorite . Scientists refer to the crater as Barringer Crater in honor of Daniel Barringer , who was first to suggest that it was produced by meteorite impact . The crater is privately owned by the Barringer family through their Barringer Crater Company , which proclaims it to be the best preserved meteorite crater on Earth . Despite its importance as a geological site , the crater is not protected as a national monument , a status that would require federal ownership . It was designated a National Natural Landmark in November 1967 . Meteor Crater lies at an elevation of 5,640 ft ( 1,719 m ) above sea level . It is about 3,900 ft ( 1,200 m ) in diameter , some 560 ft ( 170 m ) deep , and is surrounded by a rim that rises 148 ft ( 45 m ) above the surrounding plains . The center of the crater is filled with 690-790 ft ( 210-240 m ) of rubble lying above crater bedrock . One of the interesting features of the crater is its squared-off outline , believed to be caused by existing regional jointing ( cracks ) in the strata at the impact site .",

A large central hill , highly deformed rim strata , and a breccia lens 40 m ( 130 ft ) in thickness were produced during formation . Over 2 km2 of flat lying Middle and Upper Paleozoic limestone and dolomite were brecciated and mixed to a depth of 200 m ( 660 ft ) , and at least half of the breccia was ejected from the crater . The remaining breccia contains fragments ranging in size from small grains to megabreccia blocks 100 m ( 330 ft ) in length . Undisturbed strata lie 100 m below the original crater floor . In the middle of the crater , a sequence of steeply-dipping , folded , faulted , and brecciated Middle Ordovician limestone and dolomite has been uplifted 100 m ( 330 ft ) to form a large central hill . Knox strata in the central uplift are raised 250 m ( 820 ft ) above their normal position and locally contain shatter cones . In the rim surrounding the crater , Ordovician limestone has been uplifted 10-50 m ( 33-164 ft ) , and is moderately to tightly folded into doubly plunging anticlines and synclines that have axes concentric to the crater walls . In parts of the rim , folds have resulted in radial shortening as great as 35% . Faulting is common in the rim strata and is usually concentric to the crater walls . In the southeastern rim , a large thrust block forms the crater wall and has been moved out from the crater and uplifted about 50 m.

Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison . Kansas was first settled by Americans in 1827 with the establishment of Fort Leavenworth . The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s , in the midst of political wars over the slavery debate . When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the Kansas-Nebraska Act , abolitionist Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a free state or a slave state . Thus , the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided , and was known as Bleeding Kansas .",
  "/wiki/Kentland_crater": "The Kentland structure , also known as the Kentland crater or the Kentland disturbed area , is an impact structure located near the town of Kentland in Newton County , Indiana , United States . It was discovered about 1880 when two farmers began to quarry crushed rock there . The presence of shatter cones and deformed bedrock led geologists to conclude by the late 1960s that the Kentland structure is a deeply eroded impact structure , rather than volcanic in origin . Deformation at the site is so great that vertical contacts between normally horizontal rock formations of different ages are common . The structure itself is a circular dome , about 7.24 km ( 4.50 mi ) in diameter , deeply eroded and buried in glacial debris . Its age is estimated to be less than 97 million years ( Cretaceous or younger ) . The Shakopee dolomite at the center of the structure is about 450 million years old ( Ordovician period ) and is uplifted about 2,000 feet higher than the level of the same rock in the surrounding area . The entire disturbed area is about 13 km ( 8.1 mi ) in diameter . The estimated age is in dispute .",

Indiana is the 38th-largest by area and the 17th-most populous of the 50 United States . Its capital and largest city is Indianapolis . Indiana was admitted to the United States as the 19th U.S. state on December 11 , 1816 . Indiana borders Lake Michigan to the northwest , Michigan to the north , Ohio to the east , Kentucky to the south and southeast , and Illinois to the west . Before becoming a territory , various indigenous peoples and Native Americans inhabited Indiana for thousands of years . Since its founding as a territory , settlement patterns in Indiana have reflected regional cultural segmentation present in the Eastern United States ; the state 's northernmost tier was settled primarily by people from New England and New York , Central Indiana by migrants from the Mid-Atlantic states and from adjacent Ohio , and Southern Indiana by settlers from the Southern states , particularly Kentucky and Tennessee . Indiana has a diverse economy with a gross state product of $ 359.12 billion in 2017 . Indiana has several metropolitan areas with populations greater than 100,000 and a number of smaller industrial cities and towns . Indiana is home to professional sports teams , including the NFL 's Indianapolis Colts and the NBA 's Indiana Pacers , and hosts several notable athletic events , including the Indianapolis 500 .",
  "/wiki/Manson_crater": "The Manson crater is an impact crater near the site of Manson , Iowa where an asteroid or comet nucleus struck the Earth during the Cretaceous Period , approximately 74 Ma ( million years ago ) . It was one of the largest known impact events to have happened in North America .

Located in the South Central region , Texas shares borders with the states of Louisiana to the east , Arkansas to the northeast , Oklahoma to the north , New Mexico to the west , and the Mexican states of Chihuahua , Coahuila , Nuevo Le\u00f3n , and Tamaulipas to the southwest , and has a coastline with the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast . Houston is the most populous city in Texas and the fourth largest in the U.S. , while San Antonio is the second-most populous in the state and seventh largest in the U.S. Dallas-Fort Worth and Greater Houston are the fourth and fifth largest metropolitan statistical areas in the country , respectively . Other major cities include Austin , the second-most populous state capital in the U.S. , and El Paso . Texas is nicknamed the Lone Star State for its former status as an independent republic , and as a reminder of the state 's struggle for independence from Mexico . The Lone Star can be found on the Texas state flag and on the Texas state seal . The origin of Texas 's name is from the word taysha , which means friends in the Caddo language . Due to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault , Texas contains diverse landscapes common to both the U.S. Southern and Southwestern regions . Although Texas is popularly associated with the U.S. southwestern deserts , less than 10% of Texas 's land area is desert . Most of the population centers are in areas of former prairies , grasslands , forests , and the coastline . Traveling from east to west , one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods , to rolling plains and rugged hills , and finally the desert and mountains of the Big Bend . The term six flags over Texas [ note 1 ] refers to several nations that have ruled over the territory .",

In the 21st century , North Dakota 's natural resources have played a major role in its economic performance , particularly with the oil extraction from the Bakken formation , which lies beneath the northwestern part of the state . Such development has led to population growth and reduced unemployment , resulting in North Dakota having the second lowest unemployment rate in the nation , behind only Hawaii . North Dakota contains the tallest man-made structure in the Western Hemisphere , the KVLY-TV mast .",
  "/wiki/Odessa_Meteor_Crater": "The Odessa Meteor Crater is a meteorite crater in the southwestern part of Ector County , southwest of the city of Odessa of West Texas , United States . It is accessible approximately 3 mi ( 5 km ) south of Interstate 20 at Exit 108 ( Moss Road ) . This is one of three impact crater sites found in Texas , the others being the older and much larger Sierra Madera crater and the Marquez crater . The Handbook of Texas Online describes the Odessa meteor crater as the largest of several smaller craters in the immediate area that were formed by the impact of thousands of octahedrites ( an iron metallic type ) that fell in prehistoric times . The web site of the University of Texas of the Permian Basin ( UTPB , Center for Energy and Economic Diversification ) , identifies five craters at the Odessa site and shows a distribution map of the meteorite fragments recovered from the area . The recoveries have generally come from an area to the north and northwest of the main crater site , with only a few found to the south . They indicate that the structure of the main crater , because it was one of the earliest to be recognized and studied , is now used to name similar impact sites on a worldwide basis . Over 1500 meteorites have been recovered from the surrounding area over the years , the largest of which weighed approximately 300 lb ( 136 kg ) , but excavations in the main crater confirm that there is no meteorite mass underground and probably never has been . The site has been designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service , and a small information area and nature trail has been set up on-site for a self-guided tour . It is 550 ft ( 168 m ) in diameter and the age is estimated to be around 63,500 years ( Pleistocene or younger ) . The crater is exposed to the surface , and was originally about 100 ft ( 30 m ) deep . Because of subsequent infilling by soil and debris , the crater is currently 15 ft ( 5 m ) deep at its lowest point , which provides enough relief to be visible over the surrounding plains , but does not offer the dramatic relief found at the more famous Meteor Crater in Arizona ."
