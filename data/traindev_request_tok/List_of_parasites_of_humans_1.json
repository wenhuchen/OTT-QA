  "/wiki/Cestoda": "Cestoda is a class of parasitic worms in the flatworm phylum ( Platyhelminthes ) . Most of the species - and the best-known - are those in the subclass Eucestoda ; they are ribbon-like worms as adults , known as tapeworms . Their bodies consist of many similar units , known as proglottids , which are essentially packages of eggs which are regularly shed into the environment to infect other organisms . Species of the other subclass , Cestodaria , are mainly fish parasites . All cestodes are parasitic ; many have complex life histories , including a stage in a definitive ( main ) host in which the adults grow and reproduce , often for years , and one or two intermediate stages in which the larvae develop in other hosts . Typically the adults live in the digestive tracts of vertebrates , while the larvae often live in the bodies of other animals , either vertebrates or invertebrates . For example , Diphyllobothrium has at least two intermediate hosts , a crustacean and then one or more freshwater fish ; its definitive host is a mammal . Some cestodes are host-specific , while others are parasites of a wide variety of hosts . Some six thousand species have been described ; probably all vertebrates can host at least one species . The adult tapeworm has a scolex , or head , a short neck , and a strobila , or segmented body formed of proglottids . Tapeworms anchor themselves to the inside of the intestine of their host using their scolex , which typically has hooks , suckers , or both . They have no mouth , but absorb nutrients directly from the host 's gut .",

  "/wiki/Diphyllobothrium_latum": "Diphyllobothrium is a genus of tapeworms which can cause diphyllobothriasis in humans through consumption of raw or undercooked fish . The principal species causing diphyllobothriasis is Diphyllobothrium latum , known as the broad or fish tapeworm , or broad fish tapeworm . D. latum is a pseudophyllid cestode that infects fish and mammals . D. latum is native to Scandinavia , western Russia , and the Baltics , though it is now also present in North America , especially the Pacific Northwest . In Far East Russia , D. klebanovskii , having Pacific salmon as its second intermediate host , was identified . Other members of the genus Diphyllobothrium include Diphyllobothrium dendriticum ( the salmon tapeworm ) , which has a much larger range ( the whole northern hemisphere ) , D. pacificum , D. cordatum , D. ursi , D. lanceolatum , D. dalliae , and D. yonagoensis , all of which infect humans only infrequently . In Japan , the most common species in human infection is D. nihonkaiense , which was only identified as a separate species from D. latum in 1986 . More recently , a molecular study found D. nihonkaiense and D. klebanovskii to be a single species .",

Less common forms include polycystic echinococcosis and unicystic echinococcosis . The disease often starts without symptoms and this may last for years . The symptoms and signs that occur depend on the cyst 's location and size . Alveolar disease usually begins in the liver but can spread to other parts of the body , such as the lungs or brain . When the liver is affected the person may have abdominal pain , weight loss , and turn slightly yellow from jaundice . Lung disease may cause pain in the chest , shortness of breath and coughing . The disease is spread when food or water that contains the eggs of the parasite is eaten or by close contact with an infected animal . The eggs are released in the stool of meat-eating animals that are infected by the parasite . Commonly infected animals include dogs , foxes and wolves .

  "/wiki/Echinococcus_granulosus": "Echinococcus granulosus , also called the hydatid worm , hyper tape-worm or dog tapeworm , is a cyclophyllid cestode that dwells in the small intestine of canids as an adult , but which has important intermediate hosts such as livestock and humans , where it causes cystic echinococcosis , also known as hydatid disease . The adult tapeworm ranges in length from 3 mm to 6 mm and has three proglottids ( segments ) when intact - an immature proglottid , mature proglottid and a gravid proglottid . The average number of eggs per gravid proglottid is 823 . Like all cyclophyllideans , E. granulosus has four suckers on its scolex ( head ) , and E. granulosus also has a rostellum with hooks . Several strains of E. granulosus have been identified , and all but two are noted to be infective in humans . The lifecycle of E. granulosus involves dogs and wild carnivores as a definitive host for the adult tapeworm . Definitive hosts are where parasites reach maturity and reproduce . Wild or domesticated ungulates , such as sheep , serve as an intermediate host . Transitions between life stages occur in intermediate hosts . The larval stage results in the formation of echinococcal cysts in intermediate hosts . Echinococcal cysts are slow growing , but can cause clinical symptoms in humans and be life-threatening . Cysts may not initially cause symptoms , in some cases for many years .",

E. multilocularis , along with other members of the Echinococcus genus ( especially E. granulosus ) , produce diseases known as echinococcosis . Unlike E. granulosus , E. multilocularis produces many small cysts ( also referred to as locules ) that spread throughout the internal organs of the infected animal . The resultant disease is called Alveolar echinococcosis , and is caused by ingesting the eggs of E. multilocularis . The parasite is commonly maintained in a wildlife life cycle involving two mammalian hosts . Wild canids , dogs , and less commonly cats act as definitive hosts , harbouring the adult stage of the tape worm . Ingestion of a rodent containing alveolar hydatid cysts by a wild canid can result in a heavy infestation of tapeworms .",

  "/wiki/Carnivore": "A carnivore /\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0rn\u026av\u0254\u02d0r/ , meaning meat eater ( Latin , caro , genitive carnis , meaning meat or flesh and vorare meaning to devour ) , is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue , whether through predation or scavenging . Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called facultative carnivores . Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food , and , apart from the more general definition , there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore . A carnivore at the top of the food chain , not preyed upon by other animals , is termed an apex predator . Carnivore also may refer to the mammalian order Carnivora , but this is somewhat misleading : many , but not all , Carnivora are meat eaters , and even fewer are true obligate carnivores ( see below ) . For example , while the Arctic polar bear eats meat almost exclusively ( more than 90% of its diet is meat ) , most species of bears are omnivorous , and the giant panda is exclusively herbivorous . There are also many carnivorous species that are not members of Carnivora . The correct term for mammals in this group is carnivoran . Outside the animal kingdom , there are several genera containing carnivorous plants ( predominantly insectivores ) and several phyla containing carnivorous fungi ( preying mostly on microscopic invertebrates such as nematodes , amoebae and springtails ) .",

  "/wiki/Sparganosis": "Sparganosis is a parasitic infection caused by the plerocercoid larvae of the genus Spirometra including S. mansoni , S. ranarum , S. mansonoides and S. erinacei . It was first described by Patrick Manson from China in 1882 , and the first human case was reported by Charles Wardell Stiles from Florida in 1908 . The infection is transmitted by ingestion of contaminated water , ingestion of a second intermediate host such as a frog or snake , or contact between a second intermediate host and an open wound or mucous membrane . Humans are the accidental hosts in the life cycle , while dogs , cats , and other mammals are definitive hosts . Copepods ( freshwater crustaceans ) are the first intermediate hosts , and various amphibians and reptiles are second intermediate hosts . Once a human becomes infected , the plerocercoid larvae migrate to a subcutaneous location , where they typically develop into a painful nodule . Migration to the brain results in cerebral sparganosis , while migration to the eyes results in ocular sparganosis . Sparganosis is most prevalent in Eastern Asia , although cases have been described in countries throughout the world . In total , approximately 300 cases have been described in the literature up to 2003 . Diagnosis is typically not made until the sparganum larva has been surgically removed . Praziquantel is the drug of choice , although its efficacy is unknown and surgical removal of the sparganum is generally the best treatment . Public health interventions should focus on water and dietary sanitation , as well as education about the disease in rural areas and discouragement of the use of poultices .",
