  "/wiki/African-American_music": "African-American music is an umbrella term covering a diverse range of music and musical genres largely developed by African Americans . Their origins are in musical forms that arose out of the historical condition of slavery that characterized the lives of African Americans prior to the American Civil War . Following the Civil War , black Americans , through employment as musicians playing European music in military bands , developed a new style of music called ragtime which gradually evolved into jazz . In developing this latter musical form , African Americans contributed knowledge of the sophisticated polyrhythmic structure of the dance and folk music of peoples across western and sub-Saharan Africa . These musical forms had a wide-ranging influence on the development of music within the United States and around the world during the 20th century . The modern genres of blues and ragtime were developed during the late 19th century by fusing West African vocalizations - which employed the natural harmonic series , and blue notes . The earliest jazz and blues recordings were made in the 1920s . African-American musicians developed related styles such as rhythm and blues in the 1940s . In the 1960s , soul performers had a major influence on white US and UK singers . In the mid-1960s , Black musicians developed funk and they were many of the leading figures in late 1960s and 1970s genre of jazz-rock fusion . In the 1970s and 1980s , Black artists developed hip-hop , and in the 1980s introduced the disco-infused dance style known as house music .

  "/wiki/Cross_of_Gold_speech": "The Cross of Gold speech was delivered by William Jennings Bryan , a former United States Representative from Nebraska , at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on July 9 , 1896 . In the address , Bryan supported bimetallism or free silver , which he believed would bring the nation prosperity . He decried the gold standard , concluding the speech , you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold . Bryan 's address helped catapult him to the Democratic Party 's presidential nomination ; it is considered one of the greatest political speeches in American history . For twenty years , Americans had been bitterly divided over the nation 's monetary standard . The gold standard , which the United States had effectively been on since 1873 , limited the money supply but eased trade with other nations , such as the United Kingdom , whose currency was also based on gold . Many Americans , however , believed that bimetallism ( making both gold and silver legal tender ) was necessary for the nation 's economic health . The financial Panic of 1893 intensified the debates , and when Democratic President Grover Cleveland continued to support the gold standard against the will of much of his party , activists became determined to take over the Democratic Party organization and nominate a silver-supporting candidate in 1896 . Bryan had been a dark horse candidate with little support in the convention . His speech , delivered at the close of the debate on the party platform , electrified the convention and is generally credited with getting him the nomination for president . However , he lost the general election to William McKinley , and the United States formally adopted the gold standard in 1900 .",

He also served in the United States House of Representatives and as the United States Secretary of State under Woodrow Wilson . Just before his death , he gained national attention for attacking the teaching of evolution in the Scopes Trial . Because of his faith in the wisdom of the common people , he was often called The Great Commoner . Born and raised in Illinois , Bryan moved to Nebraska in the 1880s . He won election to the House of Representatives in the 1890 elections , serving two terms before making an unsuccessful run for the Senate in 1894 . At the 1896 Democratic National Convention , Bryan delivered his Cross of Gold speech which attacked the gold standard and the eastern moneyed interests and crusaded for inflationary policies built around the expanded coinage of silver coins . In a repudiation of incumbent President Grover Cleveland and his conservative Bourbon Democrats , the Democratic convention nominated Bryan for president , making Bryan the youngest major party presidential nominee in U.S. history . Subsequently , Bryan was also nominated for president by the left-wing Populist Party , and many Populists would eventually follow Bryan into the Democratic Party .

In Louisiana , Acadian and Cajun are often used as broad cultural terms without reference to actual descent from the deported Acadians . Historically , Louisianians of Acadian descent were also considered to be Louisiana Creoles , although Cajun and Creole are often portrayed as separate identities today . The Cajuns make up a significant portion of south Louisiana 's population and have had an enormous impact on the state 's culture . While Lower Louisiana had been settled by French colonists since the late 17th century , the Cajuns trace their roots to the influx of Acadian settlers after the Great Expulsion from their homeland during the French and British hostilities prior to the Seven Years ' War ( 1756 to 1763 ) . The Acadia region to which modern Cajuns trace their origin consisted largely of what are now Nova Scotia , New Brunswick , Prince Edward Island plus parts of eastern Quebec and northern Maine . Since their establishment in Louisiana , the Cajuns have become famous for their unique French dialect , Louisiana French ( also called Cajun French , although the dialect predates the Acadians ' arrival in Louisiana ) , and have developed a vibrant culture including folkways , music , and cuisine . The Acadiana region is heavily associated with them .",
  "/wiki/Louisiana_Creole_people": "Louisiana Creole people ( French : Cr\u00e9oles de la Louisiane , Spanish : Criollos de Luisiana ) , are persons descended from the inhabitants of colonial Louisiana during the period of both French and Spanish rule . Louisiana Creoles share cultural ties such as the traditional use of the French , Spanish and Louisiana Creole languages [ note 1 ] and predominant practice of Catholicism . The term cr\u00e9ole was originally used by French settlers to distinguish persons born in Louisiana from those born in the mother country or elsewhere . As in many other colonial societies around the world , creole was a term used to mean those who were native-born , especially native-born Europeans such as the French and Spanish . It also came to be applied to African-descended slaves and Native Americans who were born in Louisiana . The word is not a racial or ethnic label , and people of fully European descent , fully African descent , or of any mixture therein ( including Native American admixture ) may identify as Creoles . Starting with the native-born children of the French Ratatat sauvage , as well as native-born African slaves , 'Creole ' came to be used to describe Louisiana-born people to differentiate them from European immigrants and imported slaves . People of any race or ethnicity can and have identified as Creoles , and it is a misconception that cr\u00e9olit\u00e9 - the quality of being Creole - implies mixed racial origins . In the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries , the class of free people of color in Louisiana became associated with the term Creole , and further identification with mixed race took place during the interwar period in the 20th century . One historian has described this period as the Americanization of Creoles , including an acceptance of the American binary racial system that divided Creoles into those who identified as mostly white and others as mostly black . ( See Creoles of color . ) Cr\u00e9ole was used casually as an identity in the 1700s in Louisiana .",

As the political leader of Louisiana , he commanded wide networks of supporters and was willing to take forceful and dictatorial action . He established the long-term political dominance and dynasty of the Long family . During Long 's years in power , large expansions were made in infrastructure , education and health care . Long was notable among southern politicians for avoiding race baiting and white supremacy , and he sought to improve the conditions of impoverished blacks as well as impoverished whites . Under Long 's leadership , hospitals and educational institutions were expanded , a system of charity hospitals was set up that provided health care for the poor , and massive highway construction and free bridges brought an end to rural isolation . A Democrat and an outspoken left-leaning populist , Long denounced the wealthy urban Baton Rouge and D.C. elites , oligarchs and the banks . Initially a supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt during his first 100 days in office , Long eventually came to believe that Roosevelt 's New Deal policies were an insufficient compromise and did not do enough to alleviate the issues of the poor or tackle the Depression . As a result , he developed his own solution called the Share Our Wealth program , which would establish a net asset tax , the earnings of which would be redistributed so as to curb the poverty and homelessness epidemic nationwide during the Great Depression . Long 's Share Our Wealth plan was established on February 23 , 1934 , with the motto Every Man a King . To stimulate the economy , Long advocated extensive federal spending on public works , schools and colleges , and old age pensions . Long argued that his plan would enable everyone to have at least a car , a radio , and a home worth $ 5,000 .",

  "/wiki/Robert_Johnson": "Robert Leroy Johnson ( May 8 , 1911 - August 16 , 1938 ) was an American blues singer , songwriter and musician . His landmark recordings in 1936 and 1937 display a combination of singing , guitar skills , and songwriting talent that has influenced later generations of musicians . Johnson 's poorly documented life and death have given rise to much legend . The one most closely associated with his life is that he sold his soul to the devil at a local crossroads to achieve musical success . He is now recognized as a master of the blues , particularly the Delta blues style . As an itinerant performer who played mostly on street corners , in juke joints , and at Saturday night dances , Johnson had little commercial success or public recognition in his lifetime . He participated in only two recording sessions , one in San Antonio in 1936 , and one in Dallas in 1937 , that produced 29 distinct songs ( with 13 surviving alternate takes ) recorded by famed Country Music Hall of Fame producer Don Law . These songs , recorded at low fidelity in improvised studios , were the totality of his recorded output . Most were released as 10-inch , 78 rpm singles from 1937-1938 , with a few released after his death . Other than these recordings , very little was known of him during his life outside of the small musical circuit in the Mississippi Delta where he spent most of his life ; much of his story has been reconstructed after his death by researchers . His music had a small , but influential , following during his life and in the two decades after his death .

He was also a musician himself , as well as a folklorist , archivist , writer , scholar , political activist , oral historian , and film-maker . Lomax produced recordings , concerts , and radio shows in the US and in England , which played an important role in preserving folk music traditions in both countries , and helped start both the American and British folk revivals of the 1940s , 1950s and early 1960s . He collected material first with his father , folklorist and collector John A. Lomax , and later alone and with others , Lomax recorded thousands of songs and interviews for the Archive of American Folk Song , of which he was the director , at the Library of Congress on aluminum and acetate discs . After 1942 , when Congress cut off the Library of Congress 's funding for folk song collecting , Lomax continued to collect independently in Britain , Ireland , the Caribbean , Italy , and Spain , as well as the United States , using the latest recording technology , assembling an enormous collection of American and international culture . In March 2004 the material captured and produced without Library of Congress funding was acquired by the Library , which brings the entire seventy years of Alan Lomax 's work together under one roof at the Library of Congress , where it has found a permanent home . With the start of the Cold War , Lomax continued to speak out for a public role for folklore , even as academic folklorists turned inward . He devoted much of the latter part of his life to advocating what he called Cultural Equity , which he sought to put on a solid theoretical foundation through to his Cantometrics research ( which included a prototype Cantometrics-based educational program , the Global Jukebox ) . In the 1970s and 1980s Lomax advised the Smithsonian Institution 's Folklife Festival and produced a series of films about folk music , American Patchwork , which aired on PBS in 1991 . In his late seventies , Lomax completed a long-deferred memoir , The Land Where the Blues Began ( 1995 ) , linking the birth of the blues to debt peonage , segregation , and forced labor in the American South . Lomax 's greatest legacy is in preserving and publishing recordings of musicians in many folk and blues traditions around the US and Europe .

  "/wiki/Bob_Wills": "James Robert Wills ( March 6 , 1905 - May 13 , 1975 ) was an American Western swing musician , songwriter , and bandleader . Considered by music authorities as the co-founder of Western swing , he was known widely as the King of Western Swing ( although Spade Cooley self-promoted the moniker King of Western Swing from 1942 to 1969 ) . Wills formed several bands and played radio stations around the South and West until he formed the Texas Playboys in 1934 with Wills on fiddle , Tommy Duncan on piano and vocals , rhythm guitarist June Whalin , tenor banjoist Johnnie Lee Wills , and Kermit Whalin , who played steel guitar and bass . The band played regularly on Tulsa , Oklahoma radio station KVOO and added Leon McAuliffe on steel guitar , pianist Al Stricklin , drummer Smokey Dacus , and a horn section that expanded the band 's sound . Wills favored jazz-like arrangements and the band found national popularity into the 1940s with such hits as Steel Guitar Rag , New San Antonio Rose , Smoke On The Water , Stars And Stripes On Iwo Jima , and New Spanish Two Step . Wills and the Texas Playboys recorded with several publishers and companies , including Vocalion , Okeh , Columbia , and MGM , frequently moving . In 1950 , he had two top 10 hits , Ida Red Likes the Boogie and Faded Love , which were his last hits for a decade . Throughout the 1950s , he struggled with poor health and tenuous finances , but continued to perform frequently despite the decline in popularity of his earlier music as rock and roll took over . Wills had a heart attack in 1962 and a second one the next year , which forced him to disband the Playboys , although Wills continued to perform solo . The Country Music Hall of Fame inducted Wills in 1968 and the Texas State Legislature honored him for his contribution to American music . In 1972 , Wills accepted a citation from the American Society of Composers , Authors and Publishers in Nashville . He was recording an album with fan Merle Haggard in 1973 when a stroke left him comatose until his death in 1975 .",
  "/wiki/Porgy_and_Bess": "Porgy and Bess ( /\u02c8p\u0254\u02d0r\u0261i/ ) is an English-language opera by the American composer George Gershwin , with a libretto written by author DuBose Heyward and lyricist Ira Gershwin . It was adapted from Dorothy Heyward and DuBose Heyward 's play Porgy , itself an adaptation of DuBose Heyward 's 1925 novel of the same name . Porgy and Bess was first performed in Boston on September 30 , 1935 , before it moved to Broadway in New York City . It featured a cast of classically trained African-American singers - a daring artistic choice at the time . After an initially unpopular public reception , a 1976 Houston Grand Opera production gained it new popularity , and it is now one of the best-known and most frequently performed operas . The libretto of Porgy and Bess tells the story of Porgy , a disabled black street-beggar living in the slums of Charleston . It deals with his attempts to rescue Bess from the clutches of Crown , her violent and possessive lover , and Sportin ' Life , her drug dealer . The opera plot generally follows the stage play . In the years following Gershwin 's death , Porgy and Bess was adapted for smaller scale performances . It was adapted as a film in 1959 . Some of the songs in the opera , such as Summertime , became popular and are frequently recorded . In the late 20th and early 21st centuries , the trend has been toward productions with greater fidelity to Gershwin 's original intentions .",

Gershwin studied piano under Charles Hambitzer and composition with Rubin Goldmark , Henry Cowell , and Joseph Brody . He began his career as a song plugger but soon started composing Broadway theater works with his brother Ira Gershwin and with Buddy DeSylva . He moved to Paris intending to study with Nadia Boulanger , but she refused him . He subsequently composed An American in Paris , returned to New York City and wrote Porgy and Bess with Ira and DuBose Heyward .
