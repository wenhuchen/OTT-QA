The character 's original 1960s animated appearances left a lasting impression , making Aquaman widely recognized in popular culture and one of the world 's most recognized superheroes . Jokes about his wholesome , weak portrayal in Super Friends and perceived feeble powers and abilities have been staples of comedy programs and stand-up routines , leading DC at several times to attempt to make the character edgier or more powerful in comic books . Modern comic book depictions have attempted to reconcile these various aspects of his public perception , with many versions often casting Aquaman as serious and brooding , saddled with an ill reputation , and struggling to find a true role and purpose beyond his public side as a deposed king and a fallen hero . Aquaman has been featured in several adaptations , first appearing in animated form in the 1967 The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure and then in the related Super Friends program .

  "/wiki/Spider-Man": "Spider-Man is a fictional superhero created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko . He first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy # 15 ( August 1962 ) in the Silver Age of Comic Books . He appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics , as well as in a number of movies , television shows , and video game adaptations set in the Marvel Universe . In the stories , Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker , an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker were killed in a plane crash . Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues , and accompanied him with many supporting characters , such as J. Jonah Jameson , Harry Osborn , Max Modell , romantic interests Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane Watson , and foes such as Doctor Octopus , Green Goblin and Venom . His origin story has him acquiring spider-related abilities after a bite from a radioactive spider ; these include clinging to surfaces , shooting spider-webs from wrist-mounted devices , and detecting danger with his spider-sense . When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s , teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist . The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker , a high school student from Queens behind Spider-Man 's secret identity and with whose self-obsessions with rejection , inadequacy , and loneliness young readers could relate . While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick , unlike previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin , Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman ; he thus had to learn for himself that with great power there must also come great responsibility - a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian , the late Uncle Ben . Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series , the first and longest-lasting of which is The Amazing Spider-Man . Over the years , the Peter Parker character developed from a shy , nerdy New York City high school student to troubled but outgoing college student , to married high school teacher to , in the late 2000s , a single freelance photographer . In the 2010s , he joins the Avengers , Marvel 's flagship superhero team .",
