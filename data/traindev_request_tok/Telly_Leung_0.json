  "/wiki/Flower_Drum_Song": "Flower Drum Song was the eighth musical by the team of Rodgers and Hammerstein . It is based on the 1957 novel , The Flower Drum Song , by Chinese-American author C. Y. Lee . It premiered on Broadway in 1958 and was then performed in the West End and on tour . It was adapted for a 1961 musical film . After their extraordinary early successes , beginning with Oklahoma ! in 1943 , Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II had written two musicals in the 1950s that did not do well and sought a new hit to revive their fortunes . Lee 's novel focuses on a father , Wang Chi-yang , a wealthy refugee from China , who clings to traditional values in San Francisco 's Chinatown . Rodgers and Hammerstein shifted the focus of the musical to his son , Wang Ta , who is torn between his Chinese roots and assimilation into American culture . The team hired Gene Kelly to make his debut as a stage director with the musical and scoured the country for a suitable Asian - or at least , plausibly Asian-looking - cast . The musical , much lighter-hearted than Lee 's novel , was profitable on Broadway and was followed by a national tour . After the release of the 1961 film version , the musical was rarely produced , as it presented casting issues and fears that Asian-Americans would take offense at how they are portrayed . When it was put on the stage , lines and songs that might be offensive were often cut .",

  "/wiki/Pacific_Overtures": "Pacific Overtures is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim , and a book by John Weidman . The show is set in Japan beginning in 1853 and follows the difficult westernization of Japan , told from the point of view of the Japanese . In particular , the story focuses on the lives of two friends caught in the change . Sondheim wrote the score in a quasi-Japanese style of parallel 4ths and no leading tone . He did not use the pentatonic scale ; the 4th degree of the major scale is represented from the opening number through the finale , as Sondheim found just five pitches too limiting . The music contrasts Japanese contemplation ( There is No Other Way ) with Western ingenuousness ( Please Hello ) while over the course of the 127 years , Western harmonies , tonality and even lyrics are infused into the score . The score is generally considered to be one of Sondheim 's most ambitious and sophisticated efforts . The original Broadway production of Pacific Overtures in 1976 was staged in Kabuki style , with men playing women 's parts and set changes made in full view of the audience by black-clad stagehands . It opened to mixed reviews and closed after six months , despite being nominated for ten Tony Awards . Given its unusual casting and production demands , Pacific Overtures remains one of Stephen Sondheim 's least-performed musicals . The show is occasionally staged by opera companies . The cast requires an abundance of gifted male Asian actors who must play male and female parts .",
