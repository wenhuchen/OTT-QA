They existed during most of the Mesozoic : from the late Triassic to the end of the Cretaceous ( 228 to 66 million years ago ) . Pterosaurs are the earliest vertebrates known to have evolved powered flight . Their wings were formed by a membrane of skin , muscle , and other tissues stretching from the ankles to a dramatically lengthened fourth finger . There were two major types of pterosaurs . Basal pterosaurs ( also called 'non-pterodactyloid pterosaurs ' or rhamphorhynchoids ) were smaller animals with fully toothed jaws and , typically , long tails . Their wide wing membranes probably included and connected the hind legs . On the ground , they would have had an awkward sprawling posture , but their joint anatomy and strong claws would have made them effective climbers , and they may have lived in trees . Basal pterosaurs were insectivores or predators on small vertebrates . Later pterosaurs ( pterodactyloids ) evolved many sizes , shapes , and lifestyles . Pterodactlyoids had narrower wings with free hind limbs , highly reduced tails , and long necks with large heads . On the ground , pterodactyloids walked well on all four limbs with an upright posture , standing plantigrade on the hind feet and folding the wing finger upward to walk on the three-fingered hand .",
