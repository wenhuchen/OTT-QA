  "/wiki/Ranking": "A ranking is a relationship between a set of items such that , for any two items , the first is either 'ranked higher than ' , 'ranked lower than ' or 'ranked equal to ' the second . In mathematics , this is known as a weak order or total preorder of objects . It is not necessarily a total order of objects because two different objects can have the same ranking . The rankings themselves are totally ordered . For example , materials are totally preordered by hardness , while degrees of hardness are totally ordered . If two items are the same in rank it is considered a tie . By reducing detailed measures to a sequence of ordinal numbers , rankings make it possible to evaluate complex information according to certain criteria . Thus , for example , an Internet search engine may rank the pages it finds according to an estimation of their relevance , making it possible for the user quickly to select the pages they are likely to want to see . Analysis of data obtained by ranking commonly requires non-parametric statistics .",
  "/wiki/Summit_(topography)": "A summit is a point on a surface that is higher in elevation than all points immediately adjacent to it . The topographic terms acme , apex , peak ( mountain peak ) , and zenith are synonymous . The term top ( mountain top ) is generally used only for a mountain peak that is located at some distance from the nearest point of higher elevation . For example , a big massive rock then to the main summit of a mountain is not considered a summit . Summits near a higher peak , with some prominence or isolation , but not reaching a certain cutoff value for the quantities , are often considered subsummits ( or subpeaks ) of the higher peak , and are considered part of the same mountain . A pyramidal peak is an exaggerated form produced by ice erosion of a mountain top . Summit may also refer to the highest point along a line , trail , or route . The highest summit in the world is Mount Everest with a height of 8844.43 m above sea level ( 29,029 ft ) . The first official ascent was made by Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary . They reached the mountain 's peak in 1953 . Whether a highest point is classified as a summit , a sub peak or a separate mountain is subjective . The UIAA definition of a peak is that it has a prominence of 30 metres ( 98 ft ) or more ; it is a mountain summit if it has a prominence of at least 300 metres ( 980 ft ) .",
  "/wiki/Municipality": "A municipality is usually a single administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and regional laws to which it is subordinate . It is to be distinguished ( usually ) from the county , which may encompass rural territory or numerous small communities such as towns , villages and hamlets . The term municipality may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality . A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision , as opposed to a special-purpose district . The term is derived from French municipalit\u00e9 and Latin municipalis . The English word municipality derives from the Latin social contract municipium ( derived from a word meaning duty holders ) , referring to the Latin communities that supplied Rome with troops in exchange for their own incorporation into the Roman state ( granting Roman citizenship to the inhabitants ) while permitting the communities to retain their own local governments ( a limited autonomy ) . A municipality can be any political jurisdiction from a sovereign state , such as the Principality of Monaco , to a small village , such as West Hampton Dunes , New York . The territory over which a municipality has jurisdiction may encompass",
  "/wiki/Topographic_elevation": "The elevation of a geographic location is its height above or below a fixed reference point , most commonly a reference geoid , a mathematical model of the Earth 's sea level as an equipotential gravitational surface ( see Geodetic datum \u00a7 Vertical datum ) . The term elevation is mainly used when referring to points on the Earth 's surface , while altitude or geopotential height is used for points above the surface , such as an aircraft in flight or a spacecraft in orbit , and depth is used for points below the surface . Elevation is not to be confused with the distance from the center of the Earth . Due to the equatorial bulge , the summits of Mount Everest and Chimborazo have , respectively , the largest elevation and the largest geocentric distance .",
