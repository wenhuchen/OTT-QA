Mann about the pre-Columbian Americas . It was the 2006 winner of the National Academies Communication Award for best creative work that helps the public understanding of topics in science , engineering or medicine . The book presents recent research findings in different fields that suggest human populations in the Western Hemisphere - that is , the indigenous peoples of the Americas - were more numerous , had arrived earlier , were more sophisticated culturally , and controlled and shaped the natural landscape to a greater extent than scholars had previously thought . The author notes that , according to these findings , two of the first six independent centers of civilization arose in the Americas : the first , Norte Chico or Caral-Supe , in present-day northern Peru ; and that of Formative-era Mesoamerica in what is now southern Mexico .",

  "/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number": "The International Standard Book Number ( ISBN ) is a numeric commercial book identifier which is intended to be unique . [ a ] [ b ] Publishers purchase ISBNs from an affiliate of the International ISBN Agency . An ISBN is assigned to each separate edition and variation ( except reprintings ) of a publication . For example , an e-book , a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book will each have a different ISBN . The ISBN is ten digits long if assigned before 2007 , and thirteen digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007 . The method of assigning an ISBN is nation-specific and varies between countries , often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country . The initial ISBN identification format was devised in 1967 , based upon the 9-digit Standard Book Numbering ( SBN ) created in 1966 . The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108 ( the 9-digit SBN code can be converted to a 10-digit ISBN by prefixing it with a zero digit ' 0 ' ) . Privately published books sometimes appear without an ISBN . The International ISBN Agency sometimes assigns such books ISBNs on its own initiative . Another identifier , the International Standard Serial Number ( ISSN ) , identifies periodical publications such as magazines and newspapers .

  "/wiki/Agricultural_Involution:_The_Processes_of_Ecological_Change_in_Indonesia": "Agricultural Involution : The Processes of Ecological Change in Indonesia is one of the most famous of the early works of Clifford Geertz . It principal thesis is that many centuries of intensifying wet-rice cultivation in Indonesia had produced greater social complexity without significant technological or political change , a process Geertz terms involution . Written for a particular US-funded project on the local developments and following the modernisation theory of Walt Whitman Rostow , Geertz examines in this book the agricultural system in Indonesia . The two dominant forms of agriculture are swidden and sawah . Swidden is also known as slash and burn and sawah is irrigated rice paddy . The geographical location of these different types is important . Sawah is the dominant form in both Java and Bali where nearly three quarters of Indonesia 's population live and swidden more common in the less central regions . Having looked at the agricultural system the book turns to an examination of the systems historical development . Of particular note is Geertz 's discussion of what he famously describes as the process of agricultural involution . This is his description of the process in Java where both the external economic demands of the Dutch rulers and the internal pressures due to population growth led to intensification rather than change . What this amounted was increasing the labour intensity in the paddies , increasing output per area but not increasing output per head . This was politically the most controversial text of Geertz as the Modjokuto project was a CIA funded project for CENIS at MIT .",

  "/wiki/Wildfire": "A wildfire , wildland fire or rural fire is an uncontrolled fire in an area of combustible vegetation occurring in rural areas . Depending on the type of vegetation present , a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire , bushfire ( in Australia ) , desert fire , forest fire , grass fire , hill fire , peat fire , vegetation fire , or veld fire . Many organizations consider wildfire to mean an unplanned and unwanted fire , while wildland fire is a broader term that includes prescribed fire as well as wildland fire use ( WFU ; these are also called monitored response fires ) . Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago . Wildfire 's occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems ' flora and fauna . Earth is an intrinsically flammable planet owing to its cover of carbon-rich vegetation , seasonally dry climates , atmospheric oxygen , and widespread lightning and volcanic ignitions . Wildfires can be characterized in terms of the cause of ignition , their physical properties , the combustible material present , and the effect of weather on the fire . Wildfires can cause damage to property and human life , although naturally occurring wildfires may have beneficial effects on native vegetation , animals , and ecosystems that have evolved with fire . High-severity wildfire creates complex early seral forest habitat ( also called snag forest habitat ) , which often has higher species richness and diversity than unburned old forest . Many plant species depend on the effects of fire for growth and reproduction . Wildfires in ecosystems where wildfire is uncommon or where non-native vegetation has encroached may have strongly negative ecological effects . Wildfire behavior and severity result from a combination of factors such as available fuels , physical setting , and weather .",
