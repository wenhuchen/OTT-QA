In December 1829 , a group formed as the New York Athenaeum led by Albert Gallatin and Rev . James Mathews , and including representatives of the clergy , the commercial occupations , law , and medicine , met at the home of Reverend Matthews . Backers of a new college also included several disaffected Columbia University trustees and faculty . This gathering resulted in the call for a public meeting for the design and establishment of New York University . At the public meeting , held at the New York Historical Society in January 1830 , Jonathan M. Wainwright of Grace Episcopal Church , echoing the thinking of the group , proposed a curriculum based on useful instruction . Rev . James M. Mathews was first Chancellor of New York University largely due to the confidence that Albert Gallatin had in him .

  "/wiki/U.S._Senator": "The United States Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress , which , along with the United States House of Representatives - the lower chamber - constitutes the legislature of the United States . The Senate chamber is located in the north wing of the Capitol Building , in Washington , D.C . The composition and powers of the Senate are established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The Senate is composed of senators , each of whom represents a single state in its entirety . Each state , regardless of its population size , is equally represented by two senators who serve staggered terms of six years . There being at present 50 states in the Union , there are currently 100 senators . From 1789 to 1913 , senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented ; they are now elected by popular vote , following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913 . As the upper chamber of Congress , the Senate has several powers of advice and consent which are unique to it . These include the approval of treaties , and the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries , Supreme Court justices , federal judges , flag officers , regulatory officials , ambassadors , other federal executive officials and other federal uniformed officers . In addition to these , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for vice president , the duty falls to the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office . Furthermore , the Senate has the responsibility of conducting the trials of those impeached by the House . The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms , smaller size , and statewide constituencies , which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere .",
