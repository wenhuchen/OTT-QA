About 25 Patent-Motorwagen were built between 1886 and 1893 .",
  "/wiki/Stephenson's_Rocket": "Stephenson 's Rocket was an early steam locomotive of 0-2-2 wheel arrangement . It was built for , and won , the Rainhill Trials held by the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in October 1829 for demonstration of improved steam locomotive designs able to demonstrate fixed stationary engines would not be required . Rocket was designed by Robert Stephenson in 1829 , and built at the Forth Street Works of his company in Newcastle upon Tyne . Though Rocket was not the first steam locomotive , it was the first to bring together several innovations to produce the most advanced locomotive of its day . It is the most famous example of an evolving design of locomotives by Stephenson that became the template for most steam engines in the following 150 years . The locomotive was preserved and displayed in the Science Museum in London until 2018 . It was loaned to Newcastle Discovery Museum between 22 June and 9 September 2018 , to the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester from 25 September 2018 to 8 September 2019 , and moved to the National Railway Museum in York later in 2019 .",

  "/wiki/Steam_locomotive": "A steam locomotive is a type of railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine . These locomotives are fueled by burning combustible material - usually coal , wood , or oil - to produce steam in a boiler . The steam moves reciprocating pistons which are mechanically connected to the locomotive 's main wheels ( drivers ) . Both fuel and water supplies are carried with the locomotive , either on the locomotive itself or in wagons ( tenders ) pulled behind . Steam locomotives were first developed in the United Kingdom during the early 19th century and used for railway transport until the middle of the 20th century . Richard Trevithick built the first steam locomotive in 1802 . The first commercially successful steam locomotive was built in 1812-13 by John Blenkinsop. , the Salamanca ( locomotive ) , the Locomotion No . 1 , built by George Stephenson and his son Robert 's company Robert Stephenson and Company , was the first steam locomotive to haul passengers on a public railway , the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825 . In 1830 , George Stephenson opened the first public inter-city railway , the Liverpool and Manchester Railway . Robert Stephenson and Company was the pre-eminent builder of steam locomotives for railways in the United Kingdom , the United States , and much of Europe in the first decades of steam . In the 20th century , Chief Mechanical Engineer of the London and North Eastern Railway ( LNER ) Nigel Gresley designed some of the most famous locomotives , including the Flying Scotsman , the first steam locomotive officially recorded over 100 mph in passenger service , and a LNER Class A4 , 4468 Mallard , which still holds the record for being the fastest steam locomotive in the world ( 126 mph ) . From the early 1900s , steam locomotives were gradually superseded by electric and diesel locomotives , with railways fully converting to electric and diesel power beginning in the late 1930s .",
  "/wiki/Tender_(rail)": "A tender or coal-car is a special rail vehicle hauled by a steam locomotive containing its fuel ( wood , coal , or oil ) and water . Steam locomotives consume large quantities of water compared to the quantity of fuel , so their tenders are necessary to keep them running over long distances . A locomotive that pulls a tender is called a tender locomotive . Locomotives that do not have tenders and carry all their fuel and water on board the locomotive ( itself ) instead are called tank locomotives . A brake tender is a tender that is heavy and used ( primarily ) to provide greater braking efficiency .",

  "/wiki/Pioneer_Zephyr": "The Pioneer Zephyr is a diesel-powered trainset built by the Budd Company in 1934 for the Chicago , Burlington and Quincy Railroad ( CB & Q ) , commonly known as the Burlington Route . The trainset was the second internal combustion powered streamliner built for mainline service in the United States , the first such train powered by a diesel engine , and the first to enter revenue service . The trainset consists of one power/RPO car , one baggage/buffet/coach car , and one coach/observation car . The cars are made of stainless steel , permanently articulated together with Jacobs bogies . The construction incorporated recent advances such as shotwelding ( a specialized type of spot welding ) to join the stainless steel , and unibody construction and articulation to reduce weight . It was the first of nine similarly built trainsets made for Burlington and its technologies were pivotal in the subsequent dieselization of passenger rail service . Its operating economy , speed , and public appeal demonstrated the potential for diesel-electric powered trains to revitalize and restore profitability to passenger rail service that had suffered a catastrophic loss of business with the Great Depression . Originally named the Burlington Zephyr during its demonstration period , it became the Pioneer Zephyr as Burlington expanded its fleet of Zephyr trainsets . On May 26 , 1934 , it set a speed record for travel between Denver , Colorado , and Chicago , Illinois , when it made a 1,015.4-mile ( 1,633 km ) non-stop Dawn-to-Dusk dash in 13 hours 5 minutes at an average speed of almost 78 mph ( 124 km/h ) . For one section of the run it reached a speed of 112.5 mph ( 181 km/h ) . The historic dash inspired a 1934 film and the train 's nickname , The Silver Streak . The train entered regular revenue service on November 11 , 1934 , between Kansas City , Missouri , Omaha , Nebraska , and Lincoln , Nebraska .",
  "/wiki/Streamliner": "A streamliner is a vehicle incorporating streamlining in a shape providing reduced air resistance . The term is applied to high-speed railway trainsets of the 1930s to 1950s , and to their successor bullet trains . Less commonly , the term is applied to fully faired recumbent bicycles . As part of the Streamline Moderne trend , the term was applied to passenger cars , trucks , and other types of light- , medium- , or heavy-duty vehicles , but now vehicle streamlining is so prevalent that it is not an outstanding characteristic . In land speed racing , it is a term applied to the long , slender , custom built , high-speed vehicles with enclosed wheels .",
  "/wiki/Diesel_locomotive": "A diesel locomotive is a type of railway locomotive in which the prime mover is a diesel engine . Several types of diesel locomotive have been developed , differing mainly in the means by which mechanical power is conveyed to the driving wheels . Early internal combustion locomotives and railcars used kerosene and gasoline as their fuel . Rudolf Diesel patented his first compression ignition engine in 1898 , and steady improvements to the design of diesel engines reduced their physical size and improved their power-to-weight ratios to a point where one could be mounted in a locomotive . Internal combustion engines only operate efficiently within a limited torque range , and while low power gasoline engines could be coupled to mechanical transmissions , the more powerful diesel engines required the development of new forms of transmission . This is because clutches would need to be very large at these power levels and would not fit in a standard 2.5 m ( 8 ft 2 in ) -wide locomotive frame , or wear too quickly to be useful . The first successful diesel engines used diesel-electric transmissions , and by 1925 a small number of diesel locomotives of 600 hp ( 450 kW ) were in service in the United States . In 1930 , Armstrong Whitworth of the United Kingdom delivered two 1,200 hp ( 890 kW ) locomotives using Sulzer-designed engines to Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway of Argentina . In 1933 , diesel-electric technology developed by Maybach was used to propel the DRG Class SVT 877 , a high-speed intercity two-car set , and went into series production with other streamlined car sets in Germany starting in 1935 . In the United States , diesel-electric propulsion was brought to high-speed mainline passenger service in late 1934 , largely through the research and development efforts of General Motors dating back to the late 1920s and advances in lightweight car body design by the Budd Company . The economic recovery from World War II caused the widespread adoption of diesel locomotives in many countries . They offered greater flexibility and performance than steam locomotives , as well as substantially lower operating and maintenance costs .",
  "/wiki/Railroad_car": "A railroad car or railcar ( American and Canadian English ) , [ a ] railway wagon , trucks , or railway carriage ( British English and UIC ) , also called a train car or train wagon , is a vehicle used for the carrying of cargo or passengers on a rail transport system ( a railroad/railway ) . Such cars , when coupled together and hauled by one or more locomotives , form a train . Alternatively , some passenger cars are self-propelled in which case they may be either single railcars or make up multiple units . The term car is commonly used by itself in American English when a rail context is implicit . Indian English sometimes uses bogie in the same manner , though the term has other meanings in other variants of English . In American English , railcar is a generic term for a railway vehicle ; in other countries railcar refers specifically to a self-propelled , powered , railway vehicle . Although some cars exist for the railroad 's own use - for track maintenance purposes , for example - most carry a revenue-earning load of passengers or freight , and may be classified accordingly as passenger cars or coaches on the one hand or freight cars ( or wagons ) on the other .",

  "/wiki/Hydrogen": "Hydrogen is the chemical element with the symbol H and atomic number 1 . With a standard atomic weight of 1.008 , hydrogen is the lightest element in the periodic table . Hydrogen is the most abundant chemical substance in the Universe , constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass . [ note 1 ] Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state . The most common isotope of hydrogen , termed protium ( name rarely used , symbol 1H ) , has one proton and no neutrons . The universal emergence of atomic hydrogen first occurred during the recombination epoch ( Big Bang ) . At standard temperature and pressure , hydrogen is a colorless , odorless , tasteless , non-toxic , nonmetallic , highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2 . Since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most nonmetallic elements , most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water or organic compounds . Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid-base reactions because most acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules . In ionic compounds , hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge ( i.e. , anion ) when it is known as a hydride , or as a positively charged ( i.e. , cation ) species denoted by the symbol H+ . The hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton , but in reality , hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex . As the only neutral atom for which the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be solved analytically , study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics .",

  "/wiki/British_Rail_Class_43_(HST)": "The British Rail Class 43 ( HST ) is the TOPS classification used for the InterCity 125 High Speed Train ( formerly classes 253 and 254 ) power cars , built by British Rail Engineering Limited from 1975 to 1982 , and in service in the UK since 1976 . The class is officially the fastest diesel locomotive in the world , with an absolute maximum speed of 148 mph ( 238 km/h ) , and a regular service speed of 125 mph ( 201 km/h ) . The record run was led by 43102 and trailed by 43159 .",
  "/wiki/Diesel_electric_locomotive": "A diesel locomotive is a type of railway locomotive in which the prime mover is a diesel engine . Several types of diesel locomotive have been developed , differing mainly in the means by which mechanical power is conveyed to the driving wheels . Early internal combustion locomotives and railcars used kerosene and gasoline as their fuel . Rudolf Diesel patented his first compression ignition engine in 1898 , and steady improvements to the design of diesel engines reduced their physical size and improved their power-to-weight ratios to a point where one could be mounted in a locomotive . Internal combustion engines only operate efficiently within a limited torque range , and while low power gasoline engines could be coupled to mechanical transmissions , the more powerful diesel engines required the development of new forms of transmission . This is because clutches would need to be very large at these power levels and would not fit in a standard 2.5 m ( 8 ft 2 in ) -wide locomotive frame , or wear too quickly to be useful . The first successful diesel engines used diesel-electric transmissions , and by 1925 a small number of diesel locomotives of 600 hp ( 450 kW ) were in service in the United States . In 1930 , Armstrong Whitworth of the United Kingdom delivered two 1,200 hp ( 890 kW ) locomotives using Sulzer-designed engines to Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway of Argentina . In 1933 , diesel-electric technology developed by Maybach was used to propel the DRG Class SVT 877 , a high-speed intercity two-car set , and went into series production with other streamlined car sets in Germany starting in 1935 . In the United States , diesel-electric propulsion was brought to high-speed mainline passenger service in late 1934 , largely through the research and development efforts of General Motors dating back to the late 1920s and advances in lightweight car body design by the Budd Company . The economic recovery from World War II caused the widespread adoption of diesel locomotives in many countries . They offered greater flexibility and performance than steam locomotives , as well as substantially lower operating and maintenance costs .",

  "/wiki/British_Rail_Class_55": "The British Rail Class 55 is a class of diesel locomotive built in 1961 and 1962 by English Electric for British Rail . They were designed for the high-speed express passenger services on the East Coast Main Line ( ECML ) between Edinburgh and London King 's Cross . They gained the name Deltic from the prototype locomotive , DP1 Deltic ( the running number DP1 was never carried ) , which in turn was named after its Napier Deltic power units . Twenty-two locomotives were built , which dominated express passenger services on the ECML , particularly from London to Leeds and Edinburgh , until 1978 when Class 43 High Speed Trains ( HSTs ) were introduced . They were subsequently relegated to semi-fast services on the Kings Cross to York , Edinburgh and Hull routes and continued on sleeper services along the ECML . Other occasional destinations , although with no officially diagrammed work , included Cleethorpes , Stockport , Liverpool Lime Street and Aberdeen . They rarely worked to Skegness and Scarborough . Other very unusual destinations included Bridlington , Leicester and a BR Merrymaker trip to Fort William . They could be found on diversionary routes such as Newcastle to Edinburgh via Carlisle and Doncaster to Peterborough via Lincoln and Spalding , rarely Cambridge although arriving at Kings Cross via Hertford was not unusual . During the latter years , organised Railtours took them further afield to Worcester , Cardiff , Bognor Regis , Dover , Norwich and Exeter . All were withdrawn from service between January 1980 and December 1981 . Three were retained for a few days , until 2 January 1982 , to work the farewell special , all being withdrawn immediately on arrival back at York .",

  "/wiki/Ford_Model_T": "The Ford Model T ( colloquially known as the Tin Lizzie , Leaping Lena , jitney or flivver ) is an automobile produced by Ford Motor Company from October 1 , 1908 , to May 26 , 1927 . It is generally regarded as the first affordable automobile , that made car travel available to middle-class Americans . The relatively low price was partly the result of Ford 's efficient fabrication , including assembly line production instead of individual hand crafting . The Ford Model T was named the most influential car of the 20th century in the 1999 Car of the Century competition , ahead of the BMC Mini , Citro\u00ebn DS , and Volkswagen Type 1 . Ford 's Model T was successful not only because it provided inexpensive transportation on a massive scale , but also because the car signified innovation for the rising middle class and became a powerful symbol of the United States age of modernization . With 16.5 million sold , it stood eighth on the top ten list of most sold cars of all time , as of 2012 [ update ] . Although automobiles had been produced from the 1880s , until the Model T was introduced in 1908 , they were mostly scarce , expensive , and often unreliable . Positioned as reliable , easily maintained , mass-market transportation , it was a runaway success . In a matter of days after the release , 15,000 orders had been placed . The first production Model T was built on August 12 , 1908 and left the factory on September 27 , 1908 , at the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant in Detroit , Michigan . On May 26 , 1927 , Henry Ford watched the 15 millionth Model T Ford roll off the assembly line at his factory in Highland Park , Michigan . Henry Ford conceived a series of cars between the founding of the company in 1903 and the introduction of the Model T. Ford named his first car the Model A and proceeded through the alphabet up through the Model T , twenty models in all .",
  "/wiki/Flexible_fuel_vehicle": "A flexible-fuel vehicle ( FFV ) or dual-fuel vehicle ( colloquially called a flex-fuel vehicle ) is an alternative fuel vehicle with an internal combustion engine designed to run on more than one fuel , usually gasoline blended with either ethanol or methanol fuel , and both fuels are stored in the same common tank . Modern flex-fuel engines are capable of burning any proportion of the resulting blend in the combustion chamber as fuel injection and spark timing are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor . Flex-fuel vehicles are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles , where two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time , for example , compressed natural gas ( CNG ) , liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) , or hydrogen . The most common commercially available FFV in the world market is the ethanol flexible-fuel vehicle , with about 60 million automobiles , motorcycles and light duty trucks manufactured and sold worldwide by March 2018 , and concentrated in four markets , Brazil ( 30.5 million light-duty vehicles and over 6 million motorcycles ) , the United States ( 20 million by the end of 2016 ) , Canada ( 1.6 million by 2014 ) , and Europe , led by Sweden ( 243,100 ) . In addition to flex-fuel vehicles running with ethanol , in Europe and the US , mainly in California , there have been successful test programs with methanol flex-fuel vehicles , known as M85 flex-fuel vehicles . There have been also successful tests using P-series fuels with E85 flex fuel vehicles , but as of June 2008 , this fuel is not yet available to the general public . These successful tests with P-series fuels were conducted on Ford Taurus and Dodge Caravan flexible-fuel vehicles . Though technology exists to allow ethanol FFVs to run on any mixture of gasoline and ethanol , from pure gasoline up to 100% ethanol ( E100 ) , North American and European flex-fuel vehicles are optimized to run on E85 , a blend of 85% anhydrous ethanol fuel with 15% gasoline . This upper limit in the ethanol content is set to reduce ethanol emissions at low temperatures and to avoid cold starting problems during cold weather , at temperatures lower than 11 \u00b0C ( 52 \u00b0F ) . The alcohol content is reduced during the winter in regions where temperatures fall below 0 \u00b0C ( 32 \u00b0F ) to a winter blend of E70 in the U.S. or to E75 in Sweden from November until March . Brazilian flex fuel vehicles are optimized to run on any mix of E20-E25 gasoline and up to 100% hydrous ethanol fuel ( E100 ) . The Brazilian flex vehicles are built-in with a small gasoline reservoir for cold starting the engine when temperatures drop below 15 \u00b0C ( 59 \u00b0F ) .",

  "/wiki/Gas_turbine-electric_locomotive": "A gas turbine locomotive is a type of railway locomotive in which the prime mover is a gas turbine . Several types of gas turbine locomotive have been developed , differing mainly in the means by which mechanical power is conveyed to the driving wheels ( drivers ) . A gas turbine train typically consists of two power cars ( one at each end of the train ) , and one or more intermediate passenger cars . A gas turbine offers some advantages over a piston engine . There are few moving parts , decreasing the need for lubrication and potentially reducing maintenance costs , and the power-to-weight ratio is much higher . A turbine of a given power output is also physically smaller than an equally powerful piston engine , so that a locomotive can be extremely powerful without needing to be inordinately large . However , a gas turbine 's power output and efficiency both drop dramatically with rotational speed , unlike a piston engine , which has a comparatively flat power curve . This makes GTEL systems useful primarily for long-distance high-speed runs . Additional problems with gas turbine-electric locomotives include the fact that they are very noisy and produce such extremely hot exhaust gasses that , if the locomotive were parked under an overpass paved with asphalt , it could melt the asphalt . Unlike steam engines , internal combustion engines require a transmission to power the wheels . The engine must be allowed to continue running when the locomotive is stopped .",
