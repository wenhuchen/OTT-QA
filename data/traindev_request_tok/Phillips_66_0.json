  "/wiki/Nelson_complexity_index": "The Nelson complexity index ( NCI ) is a measure to compare the secondary conversion capacity of a petroleum refinery with the primary distillation capacity . The index provides an easy metric for quantifying and ranking the complexity of various refineries and units . To calculate the index , it is necessary to use complexity factors , which compare the cost of upgrading units to the cost of crude distillation unit .",
  "/wiki/Barrel_(unit)": "A barrel is one of several units of volume applied in various contexts ; there are dry barrels , fluid barrels ( such as the U.K. beer barrel and U.S. beer barrel ) , oil barrels and so forth . For historical reasons the volumes of some barrel units are roughly double the volumes of others ; volumes in common usage range approximately from 100 to 200 litres ( 22 to 44 imp gal ; 26 to 53 US gal ) . In many connections the term drum is used almost interchangeably with barrel . Since medieval times the term barrel as a unit of measure has had various meanings throughout Europe , ranging from about 100 litres to about 1000 litres . The name was derived in medieval times from the French baril , of unknown origin , but still in use , both in French and as derivations in many other languages such as Italian , Polish and Spanish . In most countries such usage is obsolescent , increasingly superseded by SI units . As a result , the meaning of corresponding words and related concepts ( vat , cask , keg etc . ) in other languages often refers to a physical container rather than a known measure . In the international oil market context , however , prices in United States dollars per barrel are commonly used , and the term is variously translated , often to derivations of the Latin/Teutonic root fat ( for example vat or Fass ) . In other commercial connections , barrel sizes such as beer keg volumes also are standardised in many countries .",
  "/wiki/Wood_River_Refinery": "The Wood River Refinery is an oil refinery located in Roxana , Illinois , approximately 15 miles ( 24 km ) north of St. Louis , Missouri , on the east side of the Mississippi River . The refinery is currently owned by Phillips 66 and Cenovus Energy and operated by the joint-venture company WRB Refining , LLC ( WRB ) . WRB was formed on 1 July 2007 , with Encana taking a 49% interest in Wood River and also Phillips 66 's Borger refinery . Encana subsequently spun off oil sands producer Cenovus and ConocoPhillips spun off Phillips 66 . In return for a 49% stake in the refinery , ConocoPhillips gained a joint interest in two Alberta oil sands ( bitumen ) heavy oil projects : Christina Lake ( Alberta ) and Foster Creek . ConocoPhillips interest was sold to Cenovus in May 2017 , leaving Cenovus the sole owner and operator of the assets . Cenovus uses SAGD ( steam-assisted gravity drainage ) technology at those sites . The complex is capable of refining 380,000 barrels ( 60,000 m3 ) of crude oil per day and is the largest refinery operated by Phillips 66 . Oil is supplied from the Gulf of Mexico , Canada , and domestic sources through pipelines . The facility produces 165,000 barrels per day ( 26,200 m3/d ) of gasoline , 90,000 barrels per day ( 14,000 m3/d ) of diesel and jet fuels , as well as other products including asphalt , propane , and chemical feedstocks . A new four-drum coker , part of Wood River Refinery 's Coker and Refinery Expansion ( CORE ) was completed in November 2011 . The new coker has a capacity of 75,000 barrels per day and is expected to expand the capacity to handle the bitumen from the Alberta oil sands by nearly 700% .",
