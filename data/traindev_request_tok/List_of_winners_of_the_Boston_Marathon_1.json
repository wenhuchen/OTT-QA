Gibbs run in 1966 challenged prevalent prejudices and misconceptions about women 's athletic capabilities . In 1967 , she finished nearly an hour ahead of Kathrine Switzer , who had obtained an invalid number in the Men 's Division Race , which threatened the accreditation of the race and angered officials , who tried to remove the number .
