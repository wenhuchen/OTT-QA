  "/wiki/Agecroft_Cemetery": "Agecroft Cemetery and Crematorium is a public cemetery in Pendlebury , Salford , Greater Manchester . Agecroft Cemetery was opened as Salford Northern Cemetery by Salford County Borough Council on 2 July 1903 on 45 acres ( 18.2 hectares ) of ground because the existing cemetery at Weaste was near to capacity . The new cemetery , which lies in the Irwell Valley alongside the river bounded by Agecroft Road ( A6044 ) and Langley Road in Pendlebury , was initially outside the Salford county borough boundary , but has lain within the city since Pendlebury was incorporated into the City of Salford in 1974 . Since the cemetery was opened more than 53,700 interments have been carried out . The original non-conformist chapel was converted to a crematorium in January 1957 which since then has handled nearly 60,000 cremation services . The crematorium chapel can hold up to 60 mourners . In the grounds is a large disused mortuary chapel with a clock tower . It is now derelict and hidden by trees . It is listed as a heritage building at risk by the Victorian Society . At the very opposite side of the cemetery to what was the original non-conformist chapel ( and now the crematorium ) , there stood a Roman Catholic chapel surrounded largely by Catholic graves . This was pulled down many years ago and all that remains is a grassed/shrubbery roundabout . Near the entrance is a stone memorial to the seven-man crew of Lancaster bomber PB304 which crashed in Regatta Street , off Langley Road , Agecroft , Pendlebury very close to the then boundary between Pendleton , Salford and Pendlebury on 30 July 1944 carrying a full bomb load .",

The wider City of Salford local government district is administered from Swinton . The former County Borough of Salford , which included Broughton , Pendleton and Kersal , was granted city status in 1926 . In 2011 , Salford had a population of 103,886 , and the City of Salford 233,933 . Historically in Lancashire , Salford was the judicial seat of the ancient hundred of Salfordshire . It was granted a charter by Ranulf de Blondeville , 6th Earl of Chester , in about 1230 , making Salford a free borough of greater cultural and commercial importance than its neighbour Manchester , although since the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th and early 19th centuries that position has been reversed . Salford became a major cotton and silk spinning and weaving factory town and inland port on the Manchester Ship Canal in the 18th and 19th centuries . Industries declined in the 20th century , causing economic depression , and Salford became a place of contrasts , with regenerated inner-city areas like Salford Quays next to some of the most socially deprived and violent areas in England . Salford is home to the University of Salford , and has seen several firsts , including the world 's first free public library , and the first street to be lit by gas . Salford 's MediaCityUK became the headquarters of CBBC and BBC Sport in 2011 , joined by ITV Granada in 2013 .",

Greater Manchester was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972 , and designated a functional city region on 1 April 2011 . Greater Manchester spans 493 square miles ( 1,277 km2 ) , which roughly covers the territory of the Greater Manchester Built-up Area , the second most populous urban area in the UK . It is landlocked and borders Cheshire ( to the south-west and south ) , Derbyshire ( to the south-east ) , West Yorkshire ( to the north-east ) , Lancashire ( to the north ) and Merseyside ( to the west ) . There is a mix of high-density urban areas , suburbs , semi-rural and rural locations in Greater Manchester , but land use is mostly urban - the product of concentric urbanisation and industrialisation which occurred mostly during the 19th century when the region flourished as the global centre of the cotton industry . It has a focused central business district , formed by Manchester city centre and the adjoining parts of Salford and Trafford , but Greater Manchester is also a polycentric county with ten metropolitan districts , each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs . Greater Manchester is governed by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority ( GMCA ) , which consists of political leaders from each of the ten metropolitan borough councils , plus a directly elected mayor , with responsibility for economic development , regeneration and transport . Andy Burnham is the inaugural Mayor of Greater Manchester , elected in 2017 . For the 12 years following 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government ; district councils shared power with the Greater Manchester County Council . The county council was abolished in 1986 , and so its districts ( the metropolitan boroughs ) effectively became unitary authority areas .

Historically in County Durham , there were three original settlements by the mouth of the River Wear on the site of modern-day Sunderland . On the north side of the river , Monkwearmouth was settled in 674 when King Ecgfrith of Northumbria granted land to Benedict Biscop to found Monkwearmouth Monastery . In 685 , Ecgfrith further granted Biscop the land adjacent to the monastery on the south side of the river . As the river separated this land from the monastic community , it was henceforth referred to as the sunder-land , and would grow as a fishing settlement before being granted a charter in 1179 . West of the medieval village of Sunderland on the south bank , Bishopwearmouth was founded in 930 . Sunderland grew as a port , trading coal and salt . Ships began to be built on the river in the 14th century . By the 19th century , the port of Sunderland had absorbed Bishopwearmouth and Monkwearmouth , owing to the growing economic importance of the shipbuilding docks . Following the decline of the city 's traditional industries in the late 20th century , the area grew into a commercial centre for the automotive industry , science and technology and the service sector . Bede , sometimes called the father of English history , began his monastic career at Monkwearmouth monastery in Sunderland , before moving to the newly founded Jarrow monastery in 685 ( these monasteries together formed the dual Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey ) .

By 1791 it was being hailed as the first manufacturing town in the world . Birmingham 's distinctive economic profile , with thousands of small workshops practising a wide variety of specialised and highly skilled trades , encouraged exceptional levels of creativity and innovation and provided an economic base for prosperity that was to last into the final quarter of the 20th century . The Watt steam engine was invented in Birmingham . The resulting high level of social mobility also fostered a culture of political radicalism which , under leaders from Thomas Attwood to Joseph Chamberlain , was to give it a political influence unparalleled in Britain outside London , and a pivotal role in the development of British democracy .

It came into existence as a metropolitan county in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972 , formed from parts of Staffordshire , Worcestershire and Warwickshire . The county itself is a NUTS 2 region within the wider NUTS 1 region of the same name . The county consists of seven metropolitan boroughs : the City of Birmingham , the City of Coventry and the City of Wolverhampton , as well as the boroughs of Dudley , Sandwell , Solihull and Walsall . The metropolitan county exists in law and as a geographic frame of reference , and as a ceremonial county it has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff . Between 1974 and 1986 , the West Midlands County Council was the administrative body covering the county ; this was abolished on 31 March 1986 , and the constituent metropolitan boroughs effectively became unitary authorities . A new administrative body for the county ( and some of the district surrounding it as Non-Constituent members ) , the West Midlands Combined Authority , was created in June 2016 . Since May 2017 , the authority has been headed by a directly elected Mayor of the West Midlands , a position currently held by Andy Street of the Conservative Party . Other county-wide bodies include the West Midlands Police , the West Midlands Fire Service and Transport for West Midlands . The county is sometimes described as the West Midlands metropolitan area or the West Midlands conurbation or Greater Birmingham , although these have different , and less clearly defined , boundaries . The main conurbation , or urban area , does not include Coventry for example . The name West Midlands is also used for the much larger West Midlands region , which sometimes causes confusion , not surprising perhaps when geographically it is on the eastern side of the region , the western side comprising Shropshire and Herefordshire the southern side comprising Worcestershire and most of Warwickshire .",
