  "/wiki/Time_Trial": "In many racing sports an athlete ( or occasionally a team of athletes ) will compete in a time trial against the clock to secure the fastest time . In cycling , for example , a time trial ( TT ) can be a single track cycling event , or an individual or team time trial on the road , and either or both of the latter may form components of multi-day stage races . In contrast to other types of races , athletes race alone since they are sent out in intervals ( interval starts ) , as opposed to a mass start . In cross country skiing and biathlon competitions , skiers are sent out in 30 to 60 second intervals . In rowing , time trial races , where the boats are sent out at 10 to 20 second intervals , are usually called head races . In many forms of motorsport , a similar format is used in qualifying to determine the starting order for the main event , though multiple attempts to set the fastest time are often allowed . In rallying , the special stages are run in a time-trial format . A similar race against the clock or time attack is often part of racing video games .",
