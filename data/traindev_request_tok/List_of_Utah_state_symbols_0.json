  "/wiki/Rocky_Mountain_elk": "The Rocky Mountain elk ( Cervus canadensis nelsoni ) is a subspecies of elk found in the Rocky Mountains and adjacent ranges of Western North America . The winter ranges are most common in open forests and floodplain marshes in the lower elevations . In the summer it migrates to the subalpine forests and alpine basins . Elk have a diverse habitat range that they can reside in but are most often found in forest and forest edge habitat and in mountain regions they often stay in higher elevations during warmer months and migrate down lower in the winter . They may even come down the mountain and leave the forest into some grassland for part of the day but head back into the timber in the evening . The total wild population is about one million individuals . The Rocky Mountain elk was reintroduced in 1913 to Colorado from Wyoming after the near-extinction of the regional herds . While overhunting is a significant contributing factor , the elks near-extinction is mainly attributed to human encroachment and destruction of their natural habitats and migratory corridors . A year later , twenty-one elk from Jackson Hole , Wyoming were reintroduced to South Dakota 's Wind Cave National Park for population increase . Conservation efforts also brought the elk populations in New Mexico from near zero numbers in the late 1800s and early 1900s , to healthy populations in the 1930s in Northern New Mexico . Population numbers of elk in Nebraska continued to increase through the 1970s and 1980s , to a level in which complaints from landowners in the Pine Ridge region led to the implementation of relatively liberal hunting seasons in the late 1980s . Elk numbers continued to increase through the 1990s to the present .",
  "/wiki/Rocky_Mountain": "The Rocky Mountains , also known as the Rockies , are a major mountain range located in western North America . The Rocky Mountains stretch 3,000 km ( 1,900 mi ) in straight-line distance from the northernmost part of British Columbia , in western Canada , to New Mexico in the Southwestern United States . The northern terminus is near the Liard River , while the southernmost point is near Albuquerque , adjacent the Sandia-Manzano Mountains . Located within the North American Cordillera , the Rockies are distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges , Cascade Range , and the Sierra Nevada , which all lie farther to the west . The Rocky Mountains formed 80 million to 55 million years ago during the Laramide orogeny , in which a number of plates began sliding underneath the North American plate . The angle of subduction was shallow , resulting in a broad belt of mountains running down western North America . Since then , further tectonic activity and erosion by glaciers have sculpted the Rockies into dramatic peaks and valleys . At the end of the last ice age , humans began inhabiting the mountain range . After Europeans , such as Sir Alexander Mackenzie , and Americans , such as the Lewis and Clark expedition , began exploring the range , minerals and furs drove the initial economic exploitation of the mountains , although the range itself never experienced a dense population . Of the 100 highest peaks in the Rocky Mountains , 78 ( including the 30 highest ) are located in Colorado , ten in Wyoming , six in New Mexico , and three in Montana . Public parks and forest lands protect much of the mountain range , and they are popular tourist destinations , especially for hiking , camping , mountaineering , fishing , hunting , mountain biking , skiing , and snowboarding .",

It uses mathematics , physics , and chemistry in order to explain their origin and evolution . Objects of interest include planets , moons , stars , nebulae , galaxies , and comets . Relevant phenomena include supernova explosions , gamma ray bursts , quasars , blazars , pulsars , and cosmic microwave background radiation . More generally , astronomy studies everything that originates outside Earth 's atmosphere . Cosmology is a branch of astronomy . It studies the Universe as a whole . Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences . The early civilizations in recorded history made methodical observations of the night sky . These include the Babylonians , Greeks , Indians , Egyptians , Nubians , Iranians , Chinese , Maya , and many ancient indigenous peoples of the Americas . In the past , astronomy included disciplines as diverse as astrometry , celestial navigation , observational astronomy , and the making of calendars . Nowadays , professional astronomy is often said to be the same as astrophysics .",
  "/wiki/Beehive_Cluster": "The Beehive Cluster ( also known as Praesepe ( Latin for manger ) , M44 , NGC 2632 , or Cr 189 ) , is an open cluster in the constellation Cancer . It is one of the nearest open clusters to Earth , containing a larger population of stars than other nearby bright open clusters . Under dark skies , the Beehive Cluster looks like a small nebulous object to the naked eye ; as known since ancient times . Classical astronomer Ptolemy described it as nebulous mass in the breast of Cancer , and it was among the first objects that Galileo studied with his telescope . Age and proper motion coincide with those of the Hyades , suggesting they may share similar origins . Both clusters also contain red giants and white dwarfs , which represent later stages of stellar evolution , along with many main sequence stars . Distance to M44 is often cited to be between 160 and 187 parsecs ( 520-610 light years ) . , but the revised Hipparcos parallaxes ( 2009 ) for Praesepe members and the latest infrared color-magnitude diagram favors an analogous distance of 182 pc . There are better age estimates of around 600 million years , equivalent to about 625 million years , for the Hyades . The diameter of the bright inner cluster core is about 7.0 parsecs ( 23 light years ) . Observationally , the Beehive is easily visible to the naked eye as a small nebulous cloud when Cancer culminates in the early evening sky each year from February to May . At 1.5\u00b0 across , the cluster easily fits within the field of view of binoculars or low-powered small telescopes .",
  "/wiki/Open_cluster": "An open cluster is a group of up to a few thousand stars that were formed from the same giant molecular cloud and have roughly the same age . More than 1,100 open clusters have been discovered within the Milky Way Galaxy , and many more are thought to exist . They are loosely bound by mutual gravitational attraction and become disrupted by close encounters with other clusters and clouds of gas as they orbit the galactic center . This can result in a migration to the main body of the galaxy and a loss of cluster members through internal close encounters . Open clusters generally survive for a few hundred million years , with the most massive ones surviving for a few billion years . In contrast , the more massive globular clusters of stars exert a stronger gravitational attraction on their members , and can survive for longer . Open clusters have been found only in spiral and irregular galaxies , in which active star formation is occurring . Young open clusters may be contained within the molecular cloud from which they formed , illuminating it to create an H II region . Over time , radiation pressure from the cluster will disperse the molecular cloud . Typically , about 10% of the mass of a gas cloud will coalesce into stars before radiation pressure drives the rest of the gas away . Open clusters are key objects in the study of stellar evolution . Because the cluster members are of similar age and chemical composition , their properties ( such as distance , age , metallicity , extinction , and velocity ) are more easily determined than they are for isolated stars .",

The first crop was planted in 1847 just a few days after they entered the valley , which was very late in the growing season and produced a meager but utilizable harvest . The following spring , using seed from the first harvest , they planted their second crop , only to watch in dismay as the crickets attacked . Less than two years prior in October 1846 many of them were saved by quail that flew into their camp , on their trek to the Great Salt Lake and made available as food .",

At the time of the planning of the exodus in 1846 , the territory was owned by the Republic of Mexico , which soon after went to war with the United States over the annexation of Texas . Salt Lake Valley became American territory as a result of this war . The journey was taken by about 70,000 people beginning with advance parties sent out by church leaders in March 1846 after the 1844 martyrdom of the church 's leader Joseph Smith made it clear that the group could not remain in Nauvoo , Illinois - which the church had recently purchased , improved , renamed , and developed because of the Missouri Mormon War , setting off the Illinois Mormon War . The well-organized wagon train migration began in earnest in April 1847 , and the period ( including the flight from Missouri in 1838 to Nauvoo ) , known as the Mormon Exodus is , by convention among social scientists , traditionally assumed to have ended with the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 .

It was first published in March 1830 by Joseph Smith as The Book of Mormon : An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi . According to Smith 's account and the book 's narrative , the Book of Mormon was originally written in otherwise unknown characters referred to as reformed Egyptian engraved on golden plates . Smith said that the last prophet to contribute to the book , a man named Moroni , buried it in the Hill Cumorah in present-day Manchester , New York before his death , and then returned to Earth in 1827 as an angel , revealing the location of the plates to Smith , and instructing him to translate the plates into English for use in the restoration of Christ 's true church in the latter days . Critics claim that it was authored by Smith , drawing on material and ideas from contemporary 19th-century works rather than translating an ancient record . The Book of Mormon has a number of original and distinctive doctrinal discussions on subjects such as the fall of Adam and Eve , the nature of the Christian atonement , eschatology , redemption from physical and spiritual death , and the organization of the latter-day church . The pivotal event of the book is an appearance of Jesus Christ in the Americas shortly after his resurrection . The Book of Mormon is the earliest of the unique writings of the Latter-day Saint movement , the denominations of which typically regard the text primarily as scripture , and secondarily as a historical record of God 's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas . The archaeological , historical , and scientific communities do not accept the Book of Mormon as an ancient record of actual historical events . The Book of Mormon is divided into smaller books , titled after the individuals named as primary authors and , in most versions , divided into chapters and verses . It is written in English very similar to the Early Modern English linguistic style of the King James Version of the Bible , and has since been fully or partially translated into 111 languages .

Freshwater forms that have been introduced into the Great Lakes and migrate into tributaries to spawn are also called steelhead . Adult freshwater stream rainbow trout average between 1 and 5 lb ( 0.5 and 2.3 kg ) , while lake-dwelling and anadromous forms may reach 20 lb ( 9 kg ) . Coloration varies widely based on subspecies , forms and habitat . Adult fish are distinguished by a broad reddish stripe along the lateral line , from gills to the tail , which is most vivid in breeding males . Wild-caught and hatchery-reared forms of this species have been transplanted and introduced for food or sport in at least 45 countries and every continent except Antarctica . Introductions to locations outside their native range in the United States ( U.S. ) , Southern Europe , Australia , New Zealand and South America have damaged native fish species . Introduced populations may affect native species by preying on them , out-competing them , transmitting contagious diseases ( such as whirling disease ) , or hybridizing with closely related species and subspecies , thus reducing genetic purity . The rainbow trout is included in the list of the top 100 globally invasive species . Nonetheless , other introductions into waters previously devoid of any fish species or with severely depleted stocks of native fish have created sport fisheries such as the Great Lakes and Wyoming 's Firehole River .

The ancestors of living Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago , possibly much earlier , from Asia via Beringia . A vast variety of peoples , societies and cultures subsequently developed . Native Americans were greatly affected by the European colonization of the Americas , which began in 1492 , and their population declined precipitously overwhelmingly due to introduced diseases as well as warfare , including biological warfare , territorial confiscation and slavery . After its creation , the United States , as part of its policy of settler colonialism , waged war and perpetrated massacres against many Native American peoples , removed them from their ancestral lands , and subjected them to one-sided treaties and to discriminatory government policies into the 20th century . Since the 1960s , Native American self-determination movements have resulted in changes to the lives of Native Americans , though there are still many contemporary issues faced by Native Americans . Today , there are over five million Native Americans in the United States , 78% of whom live outside reservations . When the United States was created , established Native American tribes were generally considered semi-independent nations , as they generally lived in communities separate from British settlers .

  "/wiki/Square_dance": "A square dance is a dance for four couples ( eight dancers in total ) arranged in a square , with one couple on each side , facing the middle of the square . Square dances were first documented in 16th-century England but were also quite common in France and throughout Europe . They came to North America with the European settlers and have undergone considerable development there . In some countries and regions , through preservation and repetition , square dances have attained the status of a folk dance . The Western American square dance may be the most widely known form worldwide , possibly due to its association in the 20th century with the romanticized image of the American cowboy . Square dancing is , therefore , strongly associated with the United States . Nineteen U.S. states have designated it as their official state dance . The various square dance movements are based on the steps and figures used in traditional folk dances and social dances from many countries . Some of these traditional dances include English country dance , Caledonians and the quadrille . In most American forms of square dance , the dancers are prompted or cued through a sequence of steps ( square dance choreography ) by a caller to the beat ( and , in some traditions , the phrasing ) of music . In some forms of traditional square dancing , the caller may be one of the dancers or musicians , but in modern Western square dancing the caller will be on stage , giving full attention to directing the dancers . Modern Western square dances are not learned as complete routines ; the dancers learn basic movements , each with its own distinctive call , but do not know in what order they will be called .",

  "/wiki/M1911_pistol": "The M1911 , also known as the Colt Government or Government , is a single-action , semi-automatic , magazine-fed , recoil-operated pistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge . It served as the standard-issue sidearm for the United States Armed Forces from 1911 to 1986 . It was widely used in World War I , World War II , the Korean War , and the Vietnam War . The pistol 's formal designation as of 1940 was Automatic Pistol , Caliber .45 , M1911 for the original model of 1911 or Automatic Pistol , Caliber .45 , M1911A1 for the M1911A1 , adopted in 1924 . The designation changed to Pistol , Caliber .45 , Automatic , M1911A1 in the Vietnam War era . The U.S. procured around 2.7 million M1911 and M1911A1 pistols in military contracts during its service life . The M1911 was replaced by the 9 mm Beretta M9 pistol as the standard U.S. sidearm in October 1986 , but due to its popularity among users , it has not been completely phased out . Modernized derivative variants of the M1911 are still in use by some units of the U.S. Army Special Forces and the U.S. Navy . Designed by John Browning , the M1911 is the best-known of his designs to use the short recoil principle in its basic design . The pistol was widely copied , and this operating system rose to become the preeminent type of the 20th century and of nearly all modern centerfire pistols . It is popular with civilian shooters in competitive events such as USPSA , IDPA , International Practical Shooting Confederation , and Bullseye shooting . Compact variants are popular civilian concealed carry weapons in the U.S. because of the design 's relatively slim width and the stopping power of the .45 ACP cartridge .",
  "/wiki/John_Browning": "John Moses Browning ( January 23 , 1855 - November 26 , 1926 ) was an American firearms designer who developed many varieties of military and civilian firearms , cartridges , and gun mechanisms - many of which are still in use around the world . He made his first firearm at age 13 in his father 's gun shop , and was awarded the first of his 128 firearm patents on October 7 , 1879 , at the age of 24 . He is regarded as one of the most successful firearms designers of the 19th and 20th centuries , and pioneered the development of modern automatic and semi-automatic firearms . Browning influenced nearly all categories of firearms design . He invented , or made significant improvements to , single-shot , lever-action , and pump-action rifles and shotguns . Arguably , his most significant contributions were in the area of autoloading firearms . He developed the first reliable and compact autoloading pistols by inventing the telescoping bolt , then integrating the bolt and barrel shroud into what is known as the pistol slide . Browning 's telescoping bolt design is now found on nearly every modern semi-automatic pistol , as well as several modern fully automatic weapons . He also developed the first gas-operated firearm , the Colt-Browning Model 1895 machine gun - a system that surpassed mechanical recoil operation to become the standard for most high-power self-loading firearm designs worldwide . He also made significant contributions to automatic cannon development . Browning 's most successful designs include the M1911 pistol , the water-cooled M1917 , the air-cooled M1919 , and heavy M2 machine guns , the Browning Automatic Rifle , and the Browning Auto-5 - the first semi-automatic shotgun . Some of these arms are still manufactured , often with only minor changes in detail and cosmetics to those assembled by Browning or his licensees .",

  "/wiki/Allosaurus": "Allosaurus ( /\u02cc\u00e6l\u0259\u02c8s\u0254\u02d0r\u0259s/ ) is a genus of carnivorous theropod dinosaur that lived 155 to 145 million years ago during the late Jurassic period ( Kimmeridgian to late Tithonian ) . The name Allosaurus means different lizard alluding to its unique concave vertebrae ( at the time of its discovery ) . It is derived from the Greek \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 ( allos ) ( different , other ) and \u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ( sauros ) ( lizard / generic reptile ) . The first fossil remains that could definitively be ascribed to this genus were described in 1877 by paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh . As one of the first well-known theropod dinosaurs , it has long attracted attention outside of paleontological circles . Allosaurus was a large bipedal predator . Its skull was large and equipped with dozens of sharp , serrated teeth . It averaged 9.5 metres ( 31 ft ) in length , though fragmentary remains suggest it could have reached over 12 m ( 39 ft ) . Relative to the large and powerful hindlimbs , its three-fingered forelimbs were small , and the body was balanced by a long and heavily muscled tail . It is classified as an allosaurid , a type of carnosaurian theropod dinosaur . The genus has a complicated taxonomy , and includes 5-6 valid species ( later whittled down to three valid species as of 2020 ) , the best known of which is A. fragilis . The bulk of Allosaurus remains have come from North America 's Morrison Formation , with material also known from Portugal .",

They are generally classed as a group of saurischian dinosaurs . Theropods were ancestrally carnivorous , although a number of theropod groups evolved to become herbivores , omnivores , piscivores , and insectivores . Theropods first appeared during the Carnian age of the late Triassic period 231.4 million years ago ( Ma ) and included the sole large terrestrial carnivores from the Early Jurassic until at least the close of the Cretaceous , about 66 Ma . In the Jurassic , birds evolved from small specialized coelurosaurian theropods , and are today represented by about 10,500 living species .",

[ note 1 ] The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era , also known as the Age of Reptiles . The start of the period was marked by the major Triassic-Jurassic extinction event . Two other extinction events occurred during the period : the Pliensbachian-Toarcian extinction in the Early Jurassic , and the Tithonian event at the end ; neither event ranks among the Big Five mass extinctions , however . The Jurassic period is divided into three epochs : Early , Middle , and Late . Similarly , in stratigraphy , the Jurassic is divided into the Lower Jurassic , Middle Jurassic , and Upper Jurassic series of rock formations . The Jurassic is named after the Jura Mountains within the European Alps , where limestone strata from the period were first identified . By the beginning of the Jurassic , the supercontinent Pangaea had begun rifting into two landmasses : Laurasia to the north , and Gondwana to the south . This created more coastlines and shifted the continental climate from dry to humid , and many of the arid deserts of the Triassic were replaced by lush rainforests . On land , the fauna transitioned from the Triassic fauna , dominated by both dinosauromorph and crocodylomorph archosaurs , to one dominated by dinosaurs alone . The first birds also appeared during the Jurassic , having evolved from a branch of theropod dinosaurs . Other major events include the appearance of the earliest lizards , and the evolution of therian mammals , including primitive placentals .",

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese .

Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD .

It is a member of group 14 in the periodic table : carbon is above it ; and germanium , tin , and lead are below it . It is relatively unreactive . Because of its high chemical affinity for oxygen , it was not until 1823 that J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius was first able to prepare it and characterize it in pure form . Its melting and boiling points of 1414 \u00b0C and 3265 \u00b0C respectively are the second-highest among all the metalloids and nonmetals , being only surpassed by boron . Silicon is the eighth most common element in the universe by mass , but very rarely occurs as the pure element in the Earth 's crust . It is most widely distributed in dusts , sands , planetoids , and planets as various forms of silicon dioxide ( silica ) or silicates . More than 90% of the Earth 's crust is composed of silicate minerals , making silicon the second most abundant element in the Earth 's crust ( about 28% by mass ) after oxygen . Most silicon is used commercially without being separated , and often with little processing of the natural minerals . Such use includes industrial construction with clays , silica sand , and stone .

Occurrence of aluminium decreases in the Earth 's mantle below , however . The chief ore of aluminium is bauxite . Aluminium metal is highly reactive , such that native specimens are rare and limited to extreme reducing environments . Instead , it is found combined in over 270 different minerals . Aluminium is remarkable for its low density and its ability to resist corrosion through the phenomenon of passivation . Aluminium and its alloys are vital to the aerospace industry and important in transportation and building industries , such as building facades and window frames . The oxides and sulfates are the most useful compounds of aluminium .

  "/wiki/Fluorine": "Fluorine is a chemical element with the symbol F and atomic number 9 . It is the lightest halogen and exists as a highly toxic pale yellow diatomic gas at standard conditions . As the most electronegative element , it is extremely reactive , as it reacts with all other elements , except for argon , neon , and helium . Among the elements , fluorine ranks 24th in universal abundance and 13th in terrestrial abundance . Fluorite , the primary mineral source of fluorine which gave the element its name , was first described in 1529 ; as it was added to metal ores to lower their melting points for smelting , the Latin verb fluo meaning flow gave the mineral its name . Proposed as an element in 1810 , fluorine proved difficult and dangerous to separate from its compounds , and several early experimenters died or sustained injuries from their attempts . Only in 1886 did French chemist Henri Moissan isolate elemental fluorine using low-temperature electrolysis , a process still employed for modern production . Industrial production of fluorine gas for uranium enrichment , its largest application , began during the Manhattan Project in World War II . Owing to the expense of refining pure fluorine , most commercial applications use fluorine compounds , with about half of mined fluorite used in steelmaking . The rest of the fluorite is converted into corrosive hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides , or into cryolite , which plays a key role in aluminium refining . Molecules containing a carbon-fluorine bond often have very high chemical and thermal stability ; their major uses are as refrigerants , electrical insulation and cookware , the last as PTFE ( Teflon ) .

  "/wiki/Perennial_plant": "A perennial plant or simply perennial is a plant that lives more than two years . Some sources cite perennial plants being plants that live more than three years . The term ( per- + -ennial , through the years ) is often used to differentiate a plant from shorter-lived annuals and biennials . The term is also widely used to distinguish plants with little or no woody growth from trees and shrubs , which are also technically perennials . Perennials - especially small flowering plants - that grow and bloom over the spring and summer , die back every autumn and winter , and then return in the spring from their rootstock , are known as herbaceous perennials . However , depending on the rigors of local climate , a plant that is a perennial in its native habitat , or in a milder garden , may be treated by a gardener as an annual and planted out every year , from seed , from cuttings or from divisions . Tomato vines , for example , live several years in their natural tropical/subtropical habitat but are grown as annuals in temperate regions because they do n't survive the winter . There is also a class of evergreen , or non-herbaceous , perennials , including plants like Bergenia which retain a mantle of leaves throughout the year . An intermediate class of plants is known as subshrubs , which retain a vestigial woody structure in winter , e.g . Penstemon . The local climate may dictate whether plants are treated as shrubs or perennials . For instance , many varieties of Fuchsia are shrubs in warm regions , but in colder temperate climates may be cut to the ground every year as a result of winter frosts .",

They usually grow as singular plants in clumps , tufts , hummocks , or bunches , rather than forming a sod or lawn , in meadows , grasslands , and prairies . As perennial plants , most species live more than one season . Tussock grasses are often found as forage in pastures and ornamental grasses in gardens . Many species have long roots that may reach 2 meters ( 6.6 ft ) or more into the soil , which can aid slope stabilization , erosion control , and soil porosity for precipitation absorption . Also , their roots can reach moisture more deeply than other grasses and annual plants during seasonal or climatic droughts . The plants provide habitat and food for insects ( including Lepidoptera ) , birds , small animals and larger herbivores , and support beneficial soil mycorrhiza . The leaves supply material , such as for basket weaving , for indigenous peoples and contemporary artists . Tussock and bunch grasses occur in almost any habitat where other grasses are found , including : grasslands , savannas and prairies , wetlands and estuaries , riparian zones , shrublands and scrublands , woodlands and forests , montane and alpine zones , tundra and dunes , and deserts .",

The genus name Apis is Latin for bee , and mellifera is the Latin for honey-bearing , referring to the species ' production of honey . Like all honey bee species , the western honey bee is eusocial , creating colonies with a single fertile female ( or queen ) , many normally non-reproductive females or workers , and a small proportion of fertile males or drones . Individual colonies can house tens of thousands of bees . Colony activities are organized by complex communication between individuals , through both pheromones and the dance language . The western honey bee was one of the first domesticated insects , and it is the primary species maintained by beekeepers to this day for both its honey production and pollination activities . With human assistance , the western honey bee now occupies every continent except Antarctica . Because of its wide cultivation , this species is the single most important pollinator for agriculture globally [ citation needed ] . Western honey bees are threatened by pests and diseases , especially the Varroa mite and colony collapse disorder . As of 2019 , the western honey bee is listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List , as numerous studies indicate that the species has undergone significant declines in Europe ; however , it is not clear if they refer to population reduction of wild or managed colonies . Further research is required to enable differentiation between wild and non-wild colonies in order to determine the conservation status of the species in the wild . Western honey bees are an important model organism in scientific studies , particularly in the fields of social evolution , learning , and memory ; they are also used in studies of pesticide toxicity , to assess non-target impacts of commercial pesticides .",

  "/wiki/English_language": "English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and eventually became a global lingua franca . It is named after the Angles , one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name , as England . Both names derive from Anglia , a peninsula in the Baltic Sea . The language is closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon , and its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages , particularly Norse ( a North Germanic language ) , and to a greater extent by Latin and French . English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years . The earliest forms of English , a group of West Germanic ( Ingvaeonic ) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century , are collectively called Old English . Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England ; this was a period in which the language was influenced by French . Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London , the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift . Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States . Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries , English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science , navigation and law . English is the largest language by number of speakers , and the third most-spoken native language in the world , after Standard Chinese and Spanish . It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states .",
  "/wiki/Copper": "Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu ( from Latin : cuprum ) and atomic number 29 . It is a soft , malleable , and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity . A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish-orange color . Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity , as a building material , and as a constituent of various metal alloys , such as sterling silver used in jewelry , cupronickel used to make marine hardware and coins , and constantan used in strain gauges and thermocouples for temperature measurement . Copper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable metallic form ( native metals ) . This led to very early human use in several regions , from c. 8000 BC . Thousands of years later , it was the first metal to be smelted from sulfide ores , c. 5000 BC , the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold , c. 4000 BC and the first metal to be purposefully alloyed with another metal , tin , to create bronze , c. 3500 BC . In the Roman era , copper was principally mined on Cyprus , the origin of the name of the metal , from aes \u0441yprium ( metal of Cyprus ) , later corrupted to \u0441uprum ( Latin ) , whence coper ( Old English ) and copper , first used around 1530 . Commonly encountered compounds are copper ( II ) salts , which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite , malachite , and turquoise , and have been used widely and historically as pigments . Copper used in buildings , usually for roofing , oxidizes to form a green verdigris ( or patina ) . Copper is sometimes used in decorative art , both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments . Copper compounds are used as bacteriostatic agents , fungicides , and wood preservatives .",
  "/wiki/Bingham_Canyon_Mine": "The Bingham Canyon Mine , more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine among locals , is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City , Utah , in the Oquirrh Mountains . The mine is the largest man-made excavation in the world and is considered to have produced more copper than any other mine in history - more than 19 million tons . The mine is owned by Rio Tinto Group , a British-Australian multinational corporation . The copper operations at Bingham Canyon Mine are managed through Kennecott Utah Copper Corporation which operates the mine , a concentrator plant , a smelter , and a refinery . The mine has been in production since 1906 , and has resulted in the creation of a pit over 0.6 miles ( 970 m ) deep , 2.5 miles ( 4 km ) wide , and covering 1,900 acres ( 3.0 sq mi ; 7.7 km2 ) . It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966 under the name Bingham Canyon Open Pit Copper Mine . The mine experienced a massive landslide in April 2013 and a smaller slide in September 2013 .",
  "/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_mottos": "All of the United States ' 50 states have a state motto , as do the District of Columbia , and 3 U.S. territories . A motto is a phrase intended to formally describe the general motivation or intention of an organization . State mottos can sometimes be found on state seals or state flags . Some states have officially designated a state motto by an act of the state legislature , whereas other states have the motto only as an element of their seals . The motto of the United States itself is In God We Trust , proclaimed by Congress and signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on July 30 , 1956 . The motto E Pluribus Unum ( Latin for One from many ) was approved for use on the Great Seal of the United States in 1782 , but was never adopted as the national motto through legislative action . South Carolina has two official mottos , both of which are in Latin . Kentucky , North Dakota , and Vermont also have two mottos , one in Latin and the other in English . All other states and territories have only one motto , except for Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands , which do not have any mottos . English and Latin are the most-used languages for state mottos , each used by 25 states and territories . Seven states and territories use another language , of which each language is only used once . Eight states and two territories have their mottos on their state quarter ; thirty-eight states and four territories have their mottos on their state seals .",
  "/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_reptiles": "Twenty-seven U.S. states have named an official state reptile . As with other state symbols , states compare admirable aspects of the reptile and of the state , within designating statutes . Schoolchildren often start campaigns promoting their favorite reptile to encourage state legislators to enact it as a state symbol . Many secretaries of state maintain educational web pages that describe the state reptile . Oklahoma was the first state to name an official reptile , the common collared lizard , in 1969 . Only two states followed in the 1970s , but the ensuing decades saw nominations at a rate of almost one per year . State birds are more common , with all fifty states naming one , and they were adopted earlier , with the first one selected in 1927 . Before their formal designation as state reptiles , Florida 's alligator , Maryland 's terrapin , and Texas 's horned lizard were all mascots of a major in-state university . West Virginia 's timber rattlesnake was an early American flag element dating back to 1775 . Because of their cold-blooded nature , reptiles are more common in warmer climates , and nineteen of the twenty-seven state reptiles represent southern states . Six states chose a species named after the state . A turtle was chosen by more than half of the states .",
  "/wiki/Gila_monster": "The Gila monster ( Heloderma suspectum , /\u02c8hi\u02d0l\u0259/ HEE-l\u0259 ) is a species of venomous lizard native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexican state of Sonora . A heavy , typically slow-moving lizard , up to 60 cm ( 2.0 ft ) long , the Gila monster is the only venomous lizard native to the United States and one of only two known species of venomous lizards in North America , the other being its close relative , the Mexican beaded lizard ( H. horridum ) . Although the Gila monster is venomous , its sluggish nature means it represents little threat to humans . However , it has acquired a fearsome reputation , and is sometimes killed despite being protected by state law in Arizona . In 2019 , the state of Utah made the Gila monster its official state reptile , despite the very small range of the Gila monster in the state ."
