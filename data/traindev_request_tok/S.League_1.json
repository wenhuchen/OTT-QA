  "/wiki/1996_S.League": "The 1996 S.League was the 1st season of the S.League , the top professional football league in Singapore . The S.League came into existence as a result of a fragmenting of relations between Singapore and Malaysian football associations . A dispute over the division of gate receipts for the Singapore representative in the Malaysian Premier League saw Singapore withdraw from the competition in 1995 , ending a footballing connection between the two nations that stretched back to 1921 , with the first participation of a Singapore team in the Malaya Cup . The semi-professional FAS Premier League was founded in 1988 , but had failed to find support amongst the local communities and media . The S.League was therefore created to fill the need to have a fully professional football league within Singapore . The Football Association of Singapore invited applications for clubs to compete in the newly formed league . Eight successful applications were made , these eight teams took part in a two-stage league season , with the winner of each stage qualifying for the end of season championship decider . The first half of the season was known as the Tiger Beer Series and the second half was known as the Pioneer Series . Geylang United defeated Singapore Armed Forces FC in the end of season Championship Playoff to be crowned the 1st S.League champions .",
