  "/wiki/Soviet_Union": "The Soviet Union , [ b ] officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR or \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 ) , [ c ] was a federal sovereign state in northern Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991 . Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas .",

  "/wiki/Extra-vehicular_activity": "Extravehicular activity ( EVA ) is any activity done by an astronaut or cosmonaut outside a spacecraft beyond the Earth 's appreciable atmosphere . The term most commonly applies to a spacewalk made outside a craft orbiting Earth ( such as the International Space Station ) . On March 18 , 1965 , Alexei Leonov became the first human to perform a spacewalk , exiting the capsule during the Voskhod 2 mission for 12 minutes and 9 seconds . The term also applied to lunar surface exploration ( commonly known as moonwalks ) performed by six pairs of American astronauts in the Apollo program from 1969 to 1972 . On July 21 , 1969 , Neil Armstrong became the first human to perform a moonwalk , outside his lunar lander on Apollo 11 for 2 hours and 31 minutes . On the last three Moon missions astronauts also performed deep-space EVAs on the return to Earth , to retrieve film canisters from the outside of the spacecraft . Astronauts Pete Conrad , Joseph Kerwin , and Paul Weitz also used EVA in 1973 to repair launch damage to Skylab , the United States ' first space station . A Stand-up EVA ( SEVA ) is when an astronaut does not fully leave a spacecraft , but is completely reliant on the spacesuit for environmental support . Its name derives from the astronaut standing up in the open hatch , usually to record or assist a spacewalking astronaut . EVAs may be either tethered ( the astronaut is connected to the spacecraft ; oxygen and electrical power can be supplied through an umbilical cable ; no propulsion is needed to return to the spacecraft ) , or untethered . Untethered spacewalks were only performed on three missions in 1984 using the Manned Maneuvering Unit ( MMU ) , and on a flight test in 1994 of the Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue ( SAFER ) , a safety device worn on tethered U.S. EVAs . The Soviet Union/Russia , the United States , and China have conducted EVAs .",

It was the first mission to Salyut 7 , but more than one spacecraft could be docked to S7 at a time , which is why the later missions could overlap with Soyuz T-5 .

Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States .

The Shuttle delivered a relief crew of two cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyev and Nikolai Budarin to the station and recovered Increment astronaut Norman Thagard . Atlantis returned to Earth on 7 July with a crew of eight . It was the first of seven straight missions to Mir flown by Atlantis . For the five days the Shuttle was docked to Mir they were the largest spacecraft in orbit at the time . STS-71 marked the first docking of a Space Shuttle to a space station , the first time a Shuttle crew switched members with the crew of a station , and the 100th crewed space launch by the United States . The mission carried Spacelab and included a logistical resupply of Mir . Together the Shuttle and station crews conducted various on-orbit joint US/Russian life science investigations with Spacelab along with the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment-II ( SAREX-II ) experiment .",

The shuttle was launched from Kennedy Space Center , Florida , on 26 November 1985 . During STS-61-B , the shuttle crew deployed three communications satellites , and tested techniques of constructing structures in orbit . Atlantis landed at Edwards Air Force Base , California , at 16:33 EST on 3 December 1985 , after 6 days and 21 hours in orbit . STS-61-B marked the quickest turnaround of a Shuttle orbiter from launch to launch in history - just 54 days elapsed between Atlantis ' launch on STS-51-J and launch on STS-61-B . The mission was also notable for carrying the first and only Mexican astronaut , Rodolfo Neri Vela . This was also Atlantis ' second and final mission to launch before the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986 , which would ground the shuttle fleet for two and a half years ; Atlantis would not fly again until STS-27 , which launched on December 2 , 1988 , roughly three years later .",

  "/wiki/STS-61": "STS-61 was the first Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission , and the fifth flight of the Space Shuttle Endeavour . The mission launched on 2 December 1993 from Kennedy Space Center in Florida . The mission restored the spaceborne observatory 's vision , marred by spherical aberration , with the installation of a new main camera and a corrective optics package . This correction occurred more than three and a half years after the Hubble was launched aboard STS-31 in April 1990 . The flight also brought instrument upgrades and new solar arrays to the telescope . With its very heavy workload , the STS-61 mission was one of the most complex in the Shuttle 's history . It lasted almost 11 days , and crew members made five spacewalks ( EVAs ) , an all-time record . Even the re-positioning of Intelsat VI on STS-49 in May 1992 required only four . The flight plan allowed for two additional EVAs , which could have raised the total number to seven . The final two contingency EVAs were not made . In order to complete the mission without too much fatigue , the five extravehicular working sessions were shared between two pairs of different astronauts alternating their shifts . During the flight , mission specialist Jeff Hoffman also spun a driedel for the holiday of Chanukah to a live audience watching via satellite .",

Canada 's capital is Ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . As a whole , Canada is sparsely populated , with most of its land area dominated by forest and tundra . Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",
