The college was founded in 1592 by Queen Elizabeth I as the mother of a university that was modeled after the collegiate universities of Oxford and Cambridge , but unlike these institutions , only one college was ever established ; as such , the designations Trinity College and University of Dublin are usually synonymous for practical purposes . The college is legally incorporated by the Provost , Fellows , Foundation Scholars and other members of the Board as outlined by its founding charter . It is one of the seven ancient universities of Britain and Ireland , as well as Ireland 's oldest surviving university . Trinity College is widely considered the most prestigious university in Ireland , in part due to its extensive history . It is consistently ranked as one of the top universities in Europe , and is particularly acclaimed in the fields of Law , Literature and Humanities . In accordance with the formula of ad eundem gradum , a form of recognition that exists among the three universities , a graduate of Oxford , Cambridge , or Dublin can be conferred with the equivalent degree at either of the other two universities without further examination . Trinity College , Dublin is a sister college to St John 's College , Cambridge and Oriel College , Oxford . Originally Trinity was established outside the city walls of Dublin in the buildings of the outlawed Catholic Augustinian Priory of All Hallows . Trinity College was set up in part to consolidate the rule of the Tudor monarchy in Ireland , and as a result was the university of the Protestant Ascendancy for much of its history . While Catholics were admitted from 1793 , certain restrictions on membership of the college remained , as professorships , fellowships and scholarships were reserved for Protestants . These restrictions were lifted by Act of Parliament in 1873 .",

The ground continued to host first-class fixtures until 1961 , the year in which the 28th and final first-class fixture to date to be held there between Ireland and the Marylebone Cricket Club was played .
