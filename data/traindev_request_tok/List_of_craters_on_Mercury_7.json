  "/wiki/Impact_crater": "An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet , moon , or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere , formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body . In contrast to volcanic craters , which result from explosion or internal collapse , impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain . Impact craters range from small , simple , bowl-shaped depressions to large , complex , multi-ringed impact basins . Meteor Crater is a well-known example of a small impact crater on Earth . Impact craters are the dominant geographic features on many solid Solar System objects including the Moon , Mercury , Callisto , Ganymede and most small moons and asteroids . On other planets and moons that experience more active surface geological processes , such as Earth , Venus , Mars , Europa , Io and Titan , visible impact craters are less common because they become eroded , buried or transformed by tectonics over time . Where such processes have destroyed most of the original crater topography , the terms impact structure or astrobleme are more commonly used . In early literature , before the significance of impact cratering was widely recognised , the terms cryptoexplosion or cryptovolcanic structure were often used to describe what are now recognised as impact-related features on Earth . The cratering records of very old surfaces , such as Mercury , the Moon , and the southern highlands of Mars , record a period of intense early bombardment in the inner Solar System around 3.9 billion years ago . The rate of crater production on Earth has since been considerably lower , but it is appreciable nonetheless ; Earth experiences from one to three impacts large enough to produce a 20-kilometre-diameter ( 12 mi ) crater about once every million years on average . This indicates that there should be far more relatively young craters on the planet than have been discovered so far . The cratering rate in the inner solar system fluctuates as a consequence of collisions in the asteroid belt that create a family of fragments that are often sent cascading into the inner solar system .",
  "/wiki/Diameter": "In geometry , a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle . It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle . Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere . In more modern usage , the length of a diameter is also called the diameter . In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter ( which refers to the line segment itself ) , because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length , this being twice the radius r .",

He was a Sufi Muslim . His collected works are regarded [ by whom ? ] as a pinnacle of Persian literature and are often found in the homes of people in the Persian-speaking world , who learn his poems by heart and still use them as proverbs and sayings . His life and poems have become the subjects of much analysis , commentary and interpretation , influencing post-14th century Persian writing more than any other author . Hafez is best known for his poems that can be described as antinomian and with the medieval use of the term theosophical ; the term theosophy in the 13th and 14th centuries was used to indicate mystical work by authors only inspired by the holy books ( as distinguished from theology ) . Hafez primarily wrote in the literary genre of lyric poetry , or ghazals , that is the ideal style for expressing the ecstasy of divine inspiration in the mystical form of love poems . Themes of his ghazals include the beloved , faith , and exposing hypocrisy . In his ghazals he deals with love , wine and taverns , all presenting ecstasy and freedom from restraint , whether in actual worldly release or in the voice of the lover speaking of divine love . [ self-published source ] His influence on Persian speakers appears in divination by his poems ( f\u0101l-e h\u0101fez , Persian : \u0641\u0627\u0644 \u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638 , somewhat similar to the Roman tradition of sortes vergilianae ) and in the frequent use of his poems in Persian traditional music , visual art , and Persian calligraphy .

Handel received important training in Halle and worked as a composer in Hamburg and Italy before settling in London in 1712 ; he became a naturalised British subject in 1727 . He was strongly influenced both by the great composers of the Italian Baroque and by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition . Within fifteen years , Handel had started three commercial opera companies to supply the English nobility with Italian opera . Musicologist Winton Dean writes that his operas show that Handel was not only a great composer ; he was a dramatic genius of the first order . As Alexander 's Feast ( 1736 ) was well received , Handel made a transition to English choral works . After his success with Messiah ( 1742 ) he never composed an Italian opera again . Almost blind , and having lived in England for nearly fifty years , he died in 1759 , a respected and rich man . His funeral was given full state honours , and he was buried in Westminster Abbey in London .

Hiroshige is best known for his horizontal-format landscape series The Fifty-three Stations of the T\u014dkaid\u014d and for his vertical-format landscape series One Hundred Famous Views of Edo . The subjects of his work were atypical of the ukiyo-e genre , whose typical focus was on beautiful women , popular actors , and other scenes of the urban pleasure districts of Japan 's Edo period ( 1603-1868 ) . The popular series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji by Hokusai was a strong influence on Hiroshige 's choice of subject , though Hiroshige 's approach was more poetic and ambient than Hokusai 's bolder , more formal prints . Subtle use of color was essential in Hiroshige 's prints , often printed with multiple impressions in the same area and with extensive use of bokashi ( color gradation ) , both of which were rather labor-intensive techniques . For scholars and collectors , Hiroshige 's death marked the beginning of a rapid decline in the ukiyo-e genre , especially in the face of the westernization that followed the Meiji Restoration of 1868 . Hiroshige 's work came to have a marked influence on Western painting towards the close of the 19th century as a part of the trend in Japonism . Western artists , such as Manet and Monet , collected and closely studied Hiroshige 's compositions .

The crater was initially known as feature B . Its appearance was so dissimilar to other impact craters that it was once thought to be a shield volcano . However improved radar images by the Arecibo Observatory obtained later in 2000-2005 clearly showed that feature B is an impact crater with an extensive ray system . The bright appearance of rays in the radio images indicates that the crater is geologically young ; fresh impact ejecta has a rough surface , which leads to strong scattering of radio waves . Hokusai is named after Katsushika Hokusai ( 1760-1849 ) , a Japanese artist and printmaker of the Edo period . The name Hokusai was suggested by radar astronomer John K. Harmon .

He also painted an occasional portrait , making his international mark with portraits of humanist Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam . When the Reformation reached Basel , Holbein worked for reformist clients while continuing to serve traditional religious patrons . His Late Gothic style was enriched by artistic trends in Italy , France , and the Netherlands , as well as by Renaissance humanism . The result was a combined aesthetic uniquely his own . Holbein travelled to England in 1526 in search of work , with a recommendation from Erasmus . He was welcomed into the humanist circle of Thomas More , where he quickly built a high reputation .

He hoped to become a pianist but was prevented by neuritis in his right arm . Despite his father 's reservations , he pursued a career as a composer , studying at the Royal College of Music under Charles Villiers Stanford . Unable to support himself by his compositions , he played the trombone professionally and later became a teacher - a great one , according to his colleague Ralph Vaughan Williams . Among other teaching activities , he built up a strong tradition of performance at Morley College , where he served as musical director from 1907 until 1924 and pioneered music education for women at St Paul 's Girls ' School , where he taught from 1905 until his death in 1934 . He was the founder of a series of Whitsun music festivals , which ran from 1916 for the remainder of his life . Holst 's works were played frequently in the early years of the 20th century , but it was not until the international success of The Planets in the years immediately after the First World War that he became a well-known figure . A shy man , he did not welcome this fame and preferred to be left in peace to compose and teach .",
  "/wiki/Homer_(crater)": "Homer is a crater on Mercury . It is one of many Peak-ring basins on Mercury . Deposits of material in and around this crater suggest the possibility of explosive volcanic eruptions at some point in the planet 's history . The crater name was approved by the IAU in 1976 . The naming of Stark Y crater on the moon , located northwest of Stark , as Homer , was not approved by the IAU .",
  "/wiki/Homer": "Homer ( /\u02c8ho\u028am\u0259r/ ; Ancient Greek : \u1f4d\u03bc\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 Greek pronunciation : [ h\u00f3m\u025b\u02d0ros ] , H\u00f3m\u0113ros ) is the legendary author of the Iliad and the Odyssey , two epic poems that are the central works of ancient Greek literature . The Iliad is set during the Trojan War , the ten-year siege of the city of Troy by a coalition of Greek kingdoms . It focuses on a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles lasting a few weeks during the last year of the war . The Odyssey focuses on the ten-year journey home of Odysseus , king of Ithaca , after the fall of Troy . Many accounts of Homer 's life circulated in classical antiquity , the most widespread being that he was a blind bard from Ionia , a region of central coastal Anatolia in present-day Turkey . Modern scholars consider these accounts legendary . The Homeric Question - concerning by whom , when , where and under what circumstances the Iliad and Odyssey were composed - continues to be debated . Broadly speaking , modern scholarly opinion falls into two groups . One holds that most of the Iliad and ( according to some ) the Odyssey are the works of a single poet of genius . The other considers the Homeric poems to be the result of a process of working and reworking by many contributors , and that Homer is best seen as a label for an entire tradition . It is generally accepted that the poems were composed at some point around the late eighth or early seventh century BC . The poems are in Homeric Greek , also known as Epic Greek , a literary language which shows a mixture of features of the Ionic and Aeolic dialects from different centuries ; the predominant influence is Eastern Ionic ."
