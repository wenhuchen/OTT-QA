  "/wiki/United_States": "The United States of America ( USA ) , commonly known as the United States ( U.S. or US ) or America , is a country consisting of 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . [ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

  "/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland": "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was a sovereign state established by the Acts of Union 1800 , which merged the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland . The United Kingdom , having financed the European coalition that defeated France during the Napoleonic Wars , developed a large Royal Navy that enabled the British Empire to become the foremost world power for the next century . The Crimean War with Russia was a relatively small operation in a century where Britain was largely at peace with the Great Powers . Rapid industrialisation that began in the decades prior to the state 's formation continued up until the mid-19th century . The Great Irish Famine , exacerbated by government inaction in the mid-19th century , led to demographic collapse in much of Ireland and increased calls for Irish land reform . The 19th century was an era of rapid economic modernisation and growth of industry , trade and finance , in which Britain largely dominated the world economy . Outward migration was heavy to the principal British overseas possessions and to the United States . The empire was expanded into most parts of Africa and much of South Asia . The Colonial Office and India Office ruled through a small number of administrators who managed the units of the empire locally , while democratic institutions began to develop . British India , by far the most important overseas possession , saw a short-lived revolt in 1857 . In overseas policy , the central policy was free trade , which enabled British and Irish financiers and merchants to operate successfully in many otherwise independent countries , as in South America . London formed no permanent military alliances until the early 20th century , when it began to cooperate with Japan , France and Russia , and moved closer to the United States .",

Norway has an extensive coastline , facing the North Atlantic Ocean and the Barents Sea . The maritime influence also dominates Norway 's climate with mild lowland temperatures on the sea coasts , whereas the interior , while colder , is also a lot milder than areas elsewhere in the world on such northerly latitudes . Even during polar night in the north , temperatures above freezing are commonplace on the coastline . The maritime influence brings high rainfall and snowfall to some areas of the country .
