Gamera first appeared in Noriaki Yuasa 's 1965 film Gamera , the Giant Monster , produced by Daiei Film . The character and the first film were intended to compete with the success of Toho 's Godzilla film series . Since then , Gamera has become a Japanese icon in his own right , appearing in a total of 12 films produced by Daiei Film and later Kadokawa Daiei Studio , as well as in comic books , manga , anime and video games . Gamera has been given various nicknames throughout the history of the franchise , including the Friend of All Children and the Guardian of the Universe . Gamera is depicted a massive , fire-breathing , prehistoric monster resembling a turtle , mutated by exposure to nuclear weapons . In the first film , Gamera is portrayed as aggressive and destructive , though he also saves the life of a young Japanese boy . As the film series progressed , Gamera took on a more benevolent role , becoming a protecter of humanity , and especially of human children , from extraterrestrial races and other giant monsters . In the United States , Gamera attained prominence during the 1970s due to the burgeoning popularity of UHF television stations featuring Saturday afternoon matin\u00e9e showcases like Creature Double Feature , and later in the 1990s when five Gamera films were featured on the television series Mystery Science Theater 3000 .",
