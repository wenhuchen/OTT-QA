  "/wiki/Formula_One": "Formula One ( also known as Formula 1 or F1 ) is the highest class of single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile ( FIA ) and owned by the Formula One Group . The World Drivers ' Championship , which became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981 , has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950 . The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants ' cars must conform . A Formula One season consists of a series of races , known as Grands Prix ( French for 'grand prizes ' or 'great prizes ' ) , which take place worldwide on purpose-built circuits and on public roads . The results of each race are evaluated using a points system to determine two annual World Championships : one for drivers , the other for constructors . Drivers must hold valid Super Licences , the highest class of racing licence issued by the FIA . The races must run on tracks graded 1 ( formerly A ) , the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA . Most events occur in rural locations on purpose-built tracks , but several events take place on city streets . Formula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world , owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce . The cars underwent major changes in 2017 , allowing wider front and rear wings , and wider tyres , resulting in peak cornering forces near 6.5 lateral g and top speeds of up to approximately 350 km/h ( 215 mph ) . As of 2019 [ update ] the hybrid engines are limited in performance to a maximum of 15,000 rpm , the cars are very dependent on electronics and aerodynamics , suspension and tyres . Traction control and other driving aids have been banned since 2008 .",
  "/wiki/American_football": "American football , referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron , [ nb 1 ] is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end . The offense , the team with possession of the oval-shaped football , attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it , while the defense , the team without possession of the ball , aims to stop the offense 's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves . The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays ; if they fail , they turn over the football to the defense , but if they succeed , they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive . Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins . American football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of soccer and rugby . The first American football match was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the Father of American Football , established the snap , the line of scrimmage , eleven-player teams , and the concept of downs . Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game ( although their rules were developed independently from that of Camp 's ) . Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football . The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football .",

The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season . After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings , a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966 . Following an agreement to merge the NFL with the American Football League ( AFL ) , the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 to determine a champion between the best teams from the two leagues and has remained as the final game of each NFL season since the merger was completed in 1970 . Today , the NFL has the highest average attendance ( 67,591 ) of any professional sports league in the world and is the most popular sports league in the United States . The Super Bowl is also among the biggest club sporting events in the world , with the individual games accounting for many of the most watched television programs in American history and all occupying the Nielsen 's Top 5 tally of the all-time most watched U.S. television broadcasts by 2015 .

  "/wiki/Baseball": "Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding . The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team , called the pitcher , throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat . The objective of the offensive team ( batting team ) is to hit the ball into the field of play , allowing its players to run the bases , having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called runs . The objective of the defensive team ( fielding team ) is to prevent batters from becoming runners , and to prevent runners ' advance around the bases . A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate ( the place where the player started as a batter ) . The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner . The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely . A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called out can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner , either immediately or during teammates ' turns batting . The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners out , which forces them out of the field of play . Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team 's players out . The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding ; the batting team 's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs .

  "/wiki/National_Hockey_League": "The National Hockey League ( NHL ; French : Ligue nationale de hockey - LNH ) is a professional ice hockey league in North America , currently comprising 31 teams : 24 in the United States and 7 in Canada . The NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world , and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada . The Stanley Cup , the oldest professional sports trophy in North America , is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season . The National Hockey League was organized on November 26 , 1917 , at the Windsor Hotel in Montreal after the suspension of operations of its predecessor organization , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) , which had been founded in 1909 in Renfrew , Ontario . The NHL immediately took the NHA 's place as one of the leagues that contested for the Stanley Cup in an annual interleague competition before a series of league mergers and foldings left the NHL as the only league left competing for the Stanley Cup in 1926 . At its inception , the NHL had four teams - all in Canada , thus the adjective National in the league 's name . The league expanded to the United States in 1924 , when the Boston Bruins joined , and has since consisted of American and Canadian teams . From 1942 to 1967 , the league had only six teams , collectively ( if not contemporaneously ) nicknamed the Original Six . The NHL added six new teams to double its size at the 1967 NHL expansion . The league then increased to 18 teams by 1974 and 21 teams in 1979 . Between 1991 and 2000 , the NHL further expanded to 30 teams . It added its 31st team in 2017 and has approved the addition of a 32nd team in 2021 .",
  "/wiki/Rugby_league": "Rugby league is a full-contact sport played by two teams of thirteen players on a rectangular field measuring 68 m wide and 112-122 m long . One of the two codes of rugby football , it originated in Northern England in 1895 as a split from the Rugby Football Union over the issue of payments to players . Its rules progressively changed with the aim of producing a faster , more entertaining game for spectators . In rugby league , points are scored by carrying the ball and touching it to the ground beyond the opposing team 's goal line ; this is called a try , and is the primary method of scoring . The opposing team attempts to stop the attacking side scoring points by tackling the player carrying the ball . In addition to tries , points can be scored by kicking goals . Field goals can be attempted at any time , and following a successful try , the scoring team gains a free kick to try at goal with a conversion for further points . Kicks at goal may also be awarded for penalties . The Super League and the National Rugby League ( NRL ) are the premier club competitions . Rugby league is played internationally , predominantly by European , Australasian and Pacific Island countries , and is governed by the International Rugby League ( IRL ) .

  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",

  "/wiki/Arena_football": "Arena football is a variety of eight-man gridiron football . The game is played indoors on a smaller field than American or Canadian football , designed to fit in the same surface area as a standard North American ice hockey rink , resulting in a faster and higher-scoring game that can be played on the floors of indoor arenas . The sport was invented in 1981 , and patented in 1987 , by Jim Foster , a former executive of the National Football League and the United States Football League . The name is trademarked by Gridiron Enterprises and had a proprietary format until its patent expired in 2007 . Three leagues have played under arena football rules : the Arena Football League , which played 32 seasons in two separate runs from 1987 to 2008 and 2010 to 2019 ; arenafootball2 , the AFL 's erstwhile developmental league , which played 10 seasons from 2000 through 2009 ; and the China Arena Football League , which began play in 2016 but is not directly affiliated with the AFL . The CAFL , which operates on a heavily abbreviated schedule solely in China , is the only currently active league playing by arena rules . Through the late 1990s , the Arena Football League was the only league playing any variant of the sport designed for indoor play . A clarification limiting the scope of its patent allowed for competing indoor American football leagues to use the same size field and most other aspects of the game . Arena football is distinguished from the other indoor leagues by its use of large rebound nets attached to the side of each goalpost , which keep any missed field goal or overthrown ball in the field of play and allow the ball to remain live ; the rebound nets were the only part of the patent that was upheld until it expired .",

The AFL played a proprietary code known as arena football , a form of indoor American football played on a 66-by-28 yard field ( about a quarter of the surface area of an NFL field ) , with rules encouraging offensive performance , resulting in a faster-paced and higher-scoring game . The sport was invented in the early 1980s and patented by Foster , a former executive of the United States Football League ( USFL ) and the NFL . From 2000 to 2009 , the AFL had its own developmental league , the af2 . The AFL played 22 seasons from 1987 to 2008 ; internal issues caused the league to cancel its 2009 season , though the af2 did play . Later that year both the AFL and af2 were dissolved and reorganized as a new corporation comprising teams from both leagues , and the AFL returned in 2010 . The league 's average game attendance after returning in 2010 was approximately 9,500 . The league historically had a nationwide footprint , and was recognized as the most prominent professional indoor football league in North America , offering higher payment , more widespread media exposure , and a longer history than competing leagues .

  "/wiki/Indoor_soccer": "Indoor soccer or arena soccer ( known internationally as indoor football , minifootball , fast football , floorball or showball ) , is a game derived from association football adapted for play in a walled indoor arena . Indoor soccer , as it is most often known in the United States and Canada , was originally developed in these two countries as a way to play soccer during the winter months , when snow would make outdoor play difficult . In those countries , gymnasiums are adapted for indoor soccer play . In other countries the game is played in either indoor or outdoor arenas surrounded by walls , and is referred to by different names ( such as fast football ( futbol rapido ) in Mexico , showbol in South America , and indoor football ( futbol indoor ) in Spain ) . Indoor soccer has different regulations from other versions of association football designed for indoor play , such as futsal and five-a-side football . Unlike futsal , which is played on wooden or ceramic surfaces , indoor soccer is played on synthetic turf ( or , in the case of the British Masters Football variety , synthetic carpet ) . Indoor soccer courts are either delimited by walls or lines , and there are no player throw-ins . FIFA , the international body that oversees international association football competitions , does not sanction the synthetic turf version of indoor soccer , having developed its own code of indoor football ( which they refer to as futsal ) . Indoor soccer is most popular in the United States , Canada , and Mexico , with several amateur , collegiate and professional leagues functioning . While internationally less popular than futsal , indoor soccer is also played at the league level in many countries outside North America . The World Minifootball Federation ( WMF ) is the governing body of indoor soccer at the international level , having replaced the International Fast Football Federation ( FIFRA ) . The term minifootball , which was originally coined in Europe , has been adopted by the WMF as a standard international name for the sport .",

  "/wiki/Handball": "Handball ( also known as team handball , European handball or Olympic handball ) is a team sport in which two teams of seven players each ( six outcourt players and a goalkeeper ) pass a ball using their hands with the aim of throwing it into the goal of the other team . A standard match consists of two periods of 30 minutes , and the team that scores more goals wins . Modern handball is played on a court of 40 by 20 metres ( 131 by 66 ft ) , with a goal in the middle of each end . The goals are surrounded by a 6-meter ( 20 ft ) zone where only the defending goalkeeper is allowed ; goals must be scored by throwing the ball from outside the zone or while diving into it . The sport is usually played indoors , but outdoor variants exist in the forms of field handball , Czech handball ( which were more common in the past ) and beach handball . The game is fast and high-scoring : professional teams now typically score between 20 and 35 goals each , though lower scores were not uncommon until a few decades ago . Some players may score hat tricks . Body contact is permitted : the defenders trying to stop the attackers from approaching the goal . No protective equipment is mandated , but players may wear soft protective bands , pads and mouth guards . The game was codified at the end of the 19th century in Denmark . The modern set of rules was published in 1917 in Germany , and had several revisions since . The first international games were played under these rules for men in 1925 and for women in 1930 .",

The sport originated among Native Americans , and the modern rules of field lacrosse were initially codified by Canadian William George Beers in 1867 . Field lacrosse is one of three major versions of lacrosse played internationally . The other versions , women 's lacrosse ( established in the 1890s ) and box lacrosse ( originated in the 1930s ) , are played under significantly different rules . The object of the game is to use a lacrosse stick , or crosse , to catch , carry , and pass a solid rubber ball in an effort to score by shooting the ball into the opponent 's goal . The triangular head of the lacrosse stick has a loose net strung into it that allows the player to hold the lacrosse ball . In addition to the lacrosse stick , players are required to wear a certain amount of protective equipment . Defensively the object is to keep the opposing team from scoring and to dispossess them of the ball through the use of stick checking and body contact . The rules limit the number of players in each part of the field . It is sometimes referred to as the fastest sport on two feet . Lacrosse is governed internationally by the 62-member World Lacrosse , which sponsors the World Lacrosse Championships once every four years . A former Olympic sport , attempts to reinstate it to the Olympics have been hampered by insufficient international participation and the lack of standard rules between the men 's and women 's games .",

The sport is considered a form of hockey and has a common background with ice hockey and field hockey . Bandy has also been influenced by the rules of association football : both games are normally played in halves of 45 minutes , there are 11 players on each team , and the fields in both games are about the same size . Bandy is played , like ice hockey , on ice but players use bowed sticks and a small ball , as in field hockey . A variant of bandy , rink bandy , is played to the same rules but on a field the size of an ice hockey rink , with ice hockey goal cages and with six players on each team , or five in USA Rink Bandy League . Traditional eleven-a-side bandy and rink bandy are recognized by the International Olympic Committee . More informal varieties also exist , like seven-a-side bandy with normally sized goal cages but without corner strokes . Those rules were applied at Davos Cup in 2016 . Rink bandy has in turn led to the creation of the sport rinkball . Bandy is also the predecessor of floorball , which was invented when people started playing with plastic bandy-shaped sticks and lightweight balls when running on the floors of indoor gym halls . Based on the number of participating athletes , bandy is the world 's second-most participated winter sport after ice hockey .
