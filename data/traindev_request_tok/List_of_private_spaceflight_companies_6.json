  "/wiki/Colloid_thruster": "A colloid thruster ( or electrospray thruster ) is a type of low thrust electric propulsion rocket engine that uses electrostatic acceleration of charged liquid droplets for propulsion . In a colloid thruster , charged liquid droplets are produced by an electrospray process and then accelerated by a static electric field . The liquid used for this application tends to be a low-volatility ionic liquid . Like other ion thrusters , its benefits include high efficiency , thrust density , and specific impulse ; however it has very low total thrust , on the order of micronewtons . It provides very fine attitude control or efficient acceleration of small spacecraft over long periods of time .",

  "/wiki/Plasma_propulsion_engine": "A plasma propulsion engine is a type of electric propulsion that generates thrust from a quasi-neutral plasma . This is in contrast to ion thruster engines , which generate thrust through extracting an ion current from the plasma source , which is then accelerated to high velocities using grids/anodes . These exist in many forms ( see electric propulsion ) . Plasma thrusters do not typically use high voltage grids or anodes/cathodes to accelerate the charged particles in the plasma , but rather uses currents and potentials which are generated internally in the plasma to accelerate the plasma ions . While this results in a lower exhaust velocity by virtue of the lack of high accelerating voltages , this type of thruster has a number of advantages . The lack of high voltage grids of anodes removes a possible limiting element as a result of grid ion erosion . The plasma exhaust is 'quasi-neutral ' , which means that ions and electrons exist in equal number , which allows simple ion-electron recombination in the exhaust to neutralize the exhaust plume , removing the need for an electron gun ( hollow cathode ) . This type of thruster often generates the source plasma using radio frequency or microwave energy , using an external antenna . This fact , combined with the absence of hollow cathodes ( which are very sensitive to all but the few noble gases ) allows the intriguing possibility of being able to use this type of thruster on a huge range of propellants , from argon , to carbon dioxide , air mixtures , to astronaut urine . Plasma engines are better suited for long-distance interplanetary space travel missions . In recent years , many agencies have developed several forms of plasma-fueled engines , including the European Space Agency , Iranian Space Agency and Australian National University , which have co-developed a more advanced type described as a double layer thruster . However , this form of plasma engine is only one of many types .",

  "/wiki/Electrothermal_propulsion": "An electrically-powered spacecraft propulsion system uses electrical , and possibly also magnetic fields , to change the velocity of a spacecraft . Most of these kinds of spacecraft propulsion systems work by electrically expelling propellant ( reaction mass ) at high speed . Electric thrusters typically use much less propellant than chemical rockets because they have a higher exhaust speed ( operate at a higher specific impulse ) than chemical rockets . Due to limited electric power the thrust is much weaker compared to chemical rockets , but electric propulsion can provide a small thrust for a long duration of time . Electric propulsion can achieve high speeds over long periods and thus can work better than chemical rockets for some deep space missions . Electric propulsion is now a mature and widely used technology on spacecraft . Russian satellites have used electric propulsion for decades and it is predicted that by 2020 , half of all new satellites will carry full electric propulsion . As of 2019 [ update ] , over 500 spacecraft operated throughout the Solar System use electric propulsion for station keeping , orbit raising , or primary propulsion . In the future , the most advanced electric thrusters may be able to impart a Delta-v of 100 km/s , which is enough to take a spacecraft to the outer planets of the Solar System ( with nuclear power ) , but is insufficient for interstellar travel . An electric rocket with an external power source ( transmissible through laser on the photovoltaic panels ) has a theoretical possibility for interstellar flight .

  "/wiki/Reaction_Engines_SABRE": "SABRE ( Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine ) is a concept under development by Reaction Engines Limited for a hypersonic precooled hybrid air-breathing rocket engine . The engine is being designed to achieve single-stage-to-orbit capability , propelling the proposed Skylon spaceplane to low Earth orbit . SABRE is an evolution of Alan Bond 's series of liquid air cycle engine ( LACE ) and LACE-like designs that started in the early/mid-1980s for the HOTOL project . The design comprises a single combined cycle rocket engine with two modes of operation . The air-breathing mode combines a turbo-compressor with a lightweight air precooler positioned just behind the inlet cone . At high speeds this precooler cools the hot , ram-compressed air , which would otherwise reach a temperature that the engine could not withstand , leading to a very high pressure ratio within the engine . The compressed air is subsequently fed into the rocket combustion chamber where it is ignited along with stored liquid hydrogen . The high pressure ratio allows the engine to provide high thrust at very high speeds and altitudes . The low temperature of the air permits light alloy construction to be employed and allow a very lightweight engine - essential for reaching orbit . In addition , unlike the LACE concept , SABRE 's precooler does not liquefy the air , letting it run more efficiently . After shutting the inlet cone off at Mach 5.14 , and at an altitude of 28.5 km , the system continues as a closed-cycle high-performance rocket engine burning liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen from on-board fuel tanks , potentially allowing a hybrid spaceplane concept like Skylon to reach orbital velocity after leaving the atmosphere on a steep climb . An engine derived from the SABRE concept called Scimitar has been designed for the company 's A2 hypersonic passenger jet proposal for the European Union-funded LAPCAT study .",
  "/wiki/Precooled_jet_engine": "The precooled jet engine is a concept that enables jet engines with turbomachinery , as opposed to ramjets , to be used at high speeds . Precooling restores some or all of the performance degradation of the engine compressor ( by preventing rotating stall/choking/reduced flow ) , as well as that of the complete gas generator ( by maintaining a significant combustor temperature rise within a fixed turbine temperature limit ) , which would otherwise prevent flight with high ram temperatures . For higher flight speeds precooling may feature a cryogenic fuel-cooled heat exchanger before the air enters the compressor . After gaining heat and vapourising in the heat exchanger , the fuel ( e.g . H2 ) burns in the combustor . Precooling using a heat exchanger has not been used in flight , but is predicted to have significantly high thrust and efficiency at speeds up to Mach 5.5 . Precooled jet engine cycles were analyzed by Robert P. Carmichael in 1955.:138 Pre-cooled engines avoid the need for an air condenser because , unlike liquid air cycle engines ( LACE ) , pre-cooled engines cool the air without liquefying it . For lower flight speeds precooling can be done with mass injection , known as WIPCC ( water injection precompressor cooling ) This method has been used for short duration ( due to limited coolant capacity ) increases to an aircraft 's normal maximum speed . Operation Skyburner , which gained a world speed record with a McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II , and the Mikoyan Ye-266 ( Mig 25 ) .

  "/wiki/SpaceX": "Space Exploration Technologies Corp. , trading as SpaceX , is a private American aerospace manufacturer and space transportation services company headquartered in Hawthorne , California . It was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the goal of reducing space transportation costs to enable the colonization of Mars . SpaceX has developed several launch vehicles and the Dragon spacecraft . SpaceX 's achievements include the first privately funded liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit ( Falcon 1 in 2008 ) , the first private company to successfully launch , orbit , and recover a spacecraft ( Dragon in 2010 ) , the first private company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station ( Dragon in 2012 ) , the first propulsive landing for an orbital rocket ( Falcon 9 in 2015 ) , the first reuse of an orbital rocket ( Falcon 9 in 2017 ) , and the first private company to launch an object into orbit around the sun ( Falcon Heavy 's payload of a Tesla Roadster in 2018 ) . SpaceX has flown 18 resupply missions to the International Space Station ( ISS ) under a partnership with NASA . NASA also awarded SpaceX a further development contract in 2011 to develop and demonstrate a human-rated Dragon , which would be used to transport astronauts to the ISS and return them safely to Earth . SpaceX conducted the maiden launch of its Dragon 2 spacecraft on a NASA-required demonstration flight ( Crew Dragon Demo-1 ) on March 2 , 2019 and is set to launch its first crewed Dragon 2 in March 2020 . In December 2015 , a Falcon 9 accomplished a propulsive vertical landing . This was the first such achievement by a rocket for orbital spaceflight . In April 2016 , with the launch of CRS-8 , SpaceX successfully vertically landed the first stage on an ocean drone ship landing platform . In May 2016 , in another first , SpaceX again landed the first stage , but during a significantly more energetic geostationary transfer orbit mission . In March 2017 , SpaceX became the first to successfully re-launch and land the first stage of an orbital rocket .",
  "/wiki/Kestrel_(rocket_engine)": "The SpaceX Kestrel was an LOX/RP-1 pressure-fed rocket engine . The Kestrel engine was developed in the 2000s by SpaceX for upper stage use on the Falcon 1 rocket . Kestrel is no longer being manufactured ; the last flight of Falcon 1 was in 2009 . Kestrel was built around the same pintle architecture as the SpaceX Merlin engine but does not have a turbo-pump and is fed only by tank pressure . Kestrel is ablatively cooled in the chamber and throat and radiatively cooled in the nozzle , which is fabricated from a high strength niobium alloy . As a metal , niobium is highly resistant to cracking compared to carbon-carbon . According to SpaceX , an impact from orbital debris or during stage separation might dent the metal but have no meaningful effect on engine performance . Helium pressurant efficiency is substantially increased via a titanium heat exchanger on the ablative/niobium boundary . Thrust vector control is provided by electro-mechanical actuators on the engine dome for pitch and yaw . Roll control ( and attitude control during coast phases ) is provided by helium cold gas thrusters . A TEA-TEB pyrophoric ignition system is used to provide multiple restart capability on the upper stage . In a multi-manifested mission , this design would allow for drop off at different altitudes and inclinations .",
  "/wiki/Falcon_1": "The Falcon 1 was an expendable launch system privately developed and manufactured by SpaceX during 2006-2009 . On 28 September 2008 , Falcon 1 became the first privately-developed liquid-fuel launch vehicle to go into orbit around the Earth . :203 The two-stage-to-orbit rocket used LOX/RP-1 for both stages , the first powered by a single Merlin engine and the second powered by a single Kestrel engine . It was designed by SpaceX from the ground up . The vehicle was launched a total of five times . Falcon 1 achieved orbit on its fourth attempt , in September 2008 with a mass simulator as a payload . On 14 July 2009 , Falcon 1 made its final flight and successfully delivered the Malaysian RazakSAT satellite to orbit on SpaceX 's first commercial launch ( fifth launch overall ) . Following its fifth launch , the Falcon 1 was retired and succeeded by Falcon 9 . SpaceX had announced an enhanced variant , the Falcon 1e , but development was stopped in favor of Falcon 9 .",
  "/wiki/Merlin_1D": "The SpaceX Merlin is a family of rocket engines developed by SpaceX for use on its Falcon 1 , Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles . Merlin engines use RP-1 and liquid oxygen as rocket propellants in a gas-generator power cycle . The Merlin engine was originally designed for sea recovery and reuse . The injector at the heart of Merlin is of the pintle type that was first used in the Apollo Lunar Module landing engine ( LMDE ) . Propellants are fed via a single shaft , dual impeller turbopump . The turbopump also provides high-pressure fluid for the hydraulic actuators , which then recycles into the low-pressure inlet . This eliminates the need for a separate hydraulic drive system and means that thrust vectoring control failure by running out of hydraulic fluid is not possible .",
  "/wiki/Falcon_9": "Falcon 9 is a partially reusable two-stage-to-orbit medium lift launch vehicle designed and manufactured by SpaceX in the United States . It is powered by Merlin engines , also developed by SpaceX , burning cryogenic liquid oxygen and rocket-grade kerosene ( RP-1 ) as propellants . Its name is derived from the Millennium Falcon and the nine engines of the rocket 's first stage . The rocket evolved with versions v1.0 ( 2010-2013 ) , v1.1 ( 2013-2016 ) , v1.2 Full Thrust ( 2015-present ) , including the Block 5 Full Thrust variant , flying since May 2018 . Unlike most rockets , which are expendable launch systems , since the introduction of the Full Thrust version , Falcon 9 is partially reusable , with the first stage capable of re-entering the atmosphere and landing back vertically after separating from the second stage . This feat was achieved for the first time on flight 20 with the v1.2 version in December 2015 . Falcon 9 can lift payloads of up to 22,800 kilograms ( 50,300 lb ) to low Earth orbit , 8,300 kg ( 18,300 lb ) to geostationary transfer orbit ( GTO ) when expended , and 5,500 kg ( 12,100 lb ) to GTO when the first stage is recovered . The heaviest GTO payloads flown have been Intelsat 35e with 6,761 kg ( 14,905 lb ) , and Telstar 19V with 7,075 kg ( 15,598 lb ) , although the latter was launched into a lower-energy GTO orbit achieving an apogee well below the geostationary altitude . In 2008 , SpaceX won a Commercial Resupply Services ( CRS ) contract in NASA 's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services ( COTS ) program to deliver cargo to the International Space Station ( ISS ) using the Falcon 9 and Dragon capsule . The first mission under this contract launched on October 8 , 2012 . SpaceX intends to certify the Falcon 9 to be human-rated for transporting NASA astronauts to the ISS as part of the NASA Commercial Crew Development program . Currently , Falcon 9 has been certified for the National Security Space Launch program and NASA Launch Services Program as Category 3 , which can launch the priciest , most important , and most complex NASA missions .",
  "/wiki/Falcon_Heavy": "The Falcon Heavy is a partially reusable heavy-lift launch vehicle designed and manufactured by SpaceX . It is derived from the Falcon 9 vehicle and consists of a strengthened Falcon 9 first stage as the center core with two additional first stages as strap-on boosters . The Falcon Heavy has the highest payload capacity of any currently operational launch vehicle , the second-highest capacity of any rocket ever to reach orbit , trailing the Saturn V , and the third-highest capacity of any orbital-class rocket ever launched ( behind the Saturn V and Energia ) . SpaceX conducted the Falcon Heavy 's maiden launch on February 6 , 2018 , at 3:45 p.m. EST ( 20:45 UTC ) . The rocket carried a Tesla Roadster belonging to SpaceX founder Elon Musk , as a dummy payload . The second Falcon Heavy launch occurred on April 11 , 2019 and all three booster rockets successfully returned to earth . The third Falcon Heavy launch successfully occurred on June 25 , 2019 . Since then , the Falcon Heavy has been certified for the National Security Space Launch program . The Falcon Heavy was designed to be able to carry humans into space beyond low Earth orbit , although as of February 2018 [ update ] , SpaceX does not plan to transport people on the Falcon Heavy , nor pursue the human-rating certification process to transport NASA astronauts . The Falcon Heavy and Falcon 9 will be replaced by the Starship launch system .",

  "/wiki/Raptor_(rocket_engine_family)": "The SpaceX Raptor is a full-flow , staged-combustion , methane-fueled rocket engine manufactured by SpaceX . The engine is powered by cryogenic liquid methane and liquid oxygen ( LOX ) , rather than the RP-1 kerosene and LOX used in SpaceX 's prior Merlin and Kestrel rocket engines . The earliest concepts for Raptor considered liquid hydrogen ( LH2 ) as fuel rather than methane . The Raptor engine has about two times the thrust of the Merlin 1D engine that powers the current Falcon 9 launch vehicle . Raptor will be used in both stages of the two-stage-to-orbit , super heavy-lift launch vehicle Starship . The Raptor engine is a highly reusable methalox staged-combustion engine that will power the next generation of SpaceX launch vehicles designed to replace all existing SpaceX vehicles , including the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles and the Dragon 2 . Raptor engines are expected to be used in various applications , including existing Earth-orbit satellite delivery market , the exploration and colonization of Mars . Raptor engines began flight testing on the Starhopper in July 2019 and became the first full-flow staged-combustion rocket engine ever flown .",
  "/wiki/SpaceX_Mars_transportation_infrastructure": "Elon Musk and SpaceX have proposed the development of Mars transportation infrastructure in order to facilitate the eventual colonization of Mars . The mission architecture includes fully reusable launch vehicles , human-rated spacecraft , on-orbit propellant tankers , rapid-turnaround launch/landing mounts , and local production of rocket fuel on Mars via in situ resource utilization ( ISRU ) . SpaceX 's aspirational goal is to land the first humans on Mars by 2024 . The key element of the infrastructure is supposed to be the SpaceX Starship , a fully reusable space vehicle . To achieve a large payload , the spacecraft would first enter Earth orbit , where it is expected to be refueled before it departs to Mars . After landing on Mars , the spacecraft would be loaded with locally-produced propellants to return to Earth . The expected payload of Super Heavy is for the Starship upper stage to inject between 100-150 tonnes ( 220,000-330,000 lb ) to Mars . SpaceX intends to concentrate its resources on the transportation part of the Mars colonization project , including the design of a propellant plant based on the Sabatier process that will be deployed on Mars to synthesize methane and liquid oxygen as rocket propellants from the local supply of atmospheric carbon dioxide and ground-accessible water ice . However , Musk advocates a larger set of long-term Mars settlement objectives , going far beyond what SpaceX projects to build ; a successful colonization would ultimately involve many more economic actors - whether individuals , companies , or governments - to facilitate the growth of the human presence on Mars over many decades .",

  "/wiki/Virgin_Galactic": "Virgin Galactic is a spaceflight company within the Virgin Group . It is developing commercial spacecraft and aims to provide suborbital spaceflights to space tourists and suborbital launches for space science missions . SpaceShipTwo , Virgin Galactic 's suborbital spacecraft , is air launched from beneath a carrier airplane known as White Knight Two . Virgin Galactic 's founder , Richard Branson , had initially suggested that he hoped to see a maiden flight by the end of 2009 , but this date has been delayed on a number of occasions , most seriously by the October 2014 in-flight loss of SpaceShipTwo VSS Enterprise . Branson stated that Virgin Galactic was in the best position in the world to provide rocket-powered , point-to-point 3000 mph air travel on Earth . While Branson suggested , in October 2017 , that he could travel to space aboard a SpaceShipTwo within six months , it was not until 13 December 2018 that VSS Unity achieved the project 's first suborbital space flight , reaching an altitude of 82.7 kilometres ( 51.4 mi ) , officially entering outer space by US standards .

  "/wiki/RocketMotorTwo": "RocketMotorTwo ( RM2 ) is a family of hybrid rocket engines that are being developed for the Scaled Composites SpaceShipTwo suborbital spaceplane . The first-generation engine was developed by Sierra Nevada Corporation ( SNC ) , from the late 2000s to May 2014 . It was first ignited in flight during a SpaceShipTwo test launch in April 2013 . This engine design was subsequently flown in only two additional flight tests during 2013 and January 2014 . SNC was a subcontractor to Scaled Composites through May 2014 when their involvement in the program ended after Virgin Galactic elected to replace SNC 's version of RocketMotorTwo powered by HTPB rubber fuel , with its own internally developed hybrid motor for SpaceShipTwo . The second-generation RocketMotorTwo engine is a variant of the earlier SNC basic design , but is fueled by polyamide plastic fuel , while continuing to use the same nitrous oxide oxidizer . The second-generation engine is now made in-house by Virgin Galactic rather than by SNC .",

SpaceShipTwo is carried to its launch altitude by a Scaled Composites White Knight Two , before being released to fly on into the upper atmosphere powered by its rocket engine . It then glides back to Earth and performs a conventional runway landing . The spaceship was officially unveiled to the public on 7 December 2009 at the Mojave Air and Space Port in California . On 29 April 2013 , after nearly three years of unpowered testing , the first one constructed successfully performed its first powered test flight . Virgin Galactic plans to operate a fleet of five SpaceShipTwo spaceplanes in a private passenger-carrying service and has been taking bookings for some time , with a suborbital flight carrying an updated ticket price of US $ 250,000 . The spaceplane could also be used to carry scientific payloads for NASA and other organizations . On 31 October 2014 , during a test flight , the first SpaceShipTwo VSS Enterprise broke up in flight and crashed in the Mojave desert . A preliminary investigation suggested that the craft 's descent device deployed too early . One pilot , Michael Alsbury , was killed ; the other was treated for a serious shoulder injury after parachuting from the stricken spacecraft . The second SpaceShipTwo spacecraft , VSS Unity , was unveiled on 19 February 2016 ."
