  "/wiki/Louis_Nirenberg": "Louis Nirenberg ( 28 February 1925 - 26 January 2020 ) was a Canadian-American mathematician , considered one of the most outstanding mathematicians of the 20th century . He made fundamental contributions to linear and nonlinear partial differential equations ( PDEs ) and their application to complex analysis and geometry . His contributions include the Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation inequality , which is important in the solution of the elliptic partial differential equations that arise in many areas of mathematics , and the formalization of the bounded mean oscillation known as John-Nirenberg space , which is used to study the behavior of both elastic materials and games of chance known as martingales . His other achievements include the solution to long-standing problems of Weyl and Minkowski , relating to the embedding of a 2-sphere and curvature , respectively ; the theory of pseudo-differential operators initiated along with Joseph J. Kohn , the Newlander-Nirenberg theorem of complex structures , Vanishing Mean Oscillation ( VMO ) , the symmetries of solutions of PDEs along with Gidas and Ni , among many others . Nirenberg 's work on PDEs has been described as about the best that 's been done ( as of 2002 ) towards solving the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness problem of fluid mechanics , which is a Millennium Prize Problem .",

At the time of his resignation , Swartz was quoted in the New York Times as stating that an internal investigation had shown that improper finance and accounting activities occurred while he was chairman . Symbol agreed to settle the case with the Securities and Exchange Commission in June 2004 , paying a $ 37 million penalty . Currently , he is the Chairman of The Swartz Foundation for Computational Neuroscience . Established in 1994 , it has grown to support research in 11 centers ( Brandeis University , California Institute of Technology , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory , Columbia University , Harvard University , New York University , Princeton University , Salk Institute , University of California , San Diego , University of California , San Francisco and Yale University ) .

  "/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming": "William Edwards Deming ( October 14 , 1900 - December 20 , 1993 ) was an American engineer , statistician , professor , author , lecturer , and management consultant . Educated initially as an electrical engineer and later specializing in mathematical physics , he helped develop the sampling techniques still used by the U.S. Department of the Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics . In his book The New Economics for Industry , Government , and Education Deming championed the work of Walter Shewhart , including statistical process control , operational definitions , and what Deming called the Shewhart Cycle , which had evolved into Plan-Do-Study-Act ( PDSA ) . That was in response to the growing popularity of PDCA , which Deming viewed as tampering with the meaning of Shewhart 's original work . Deming is best known for his work in Japan after WWII , particularly his work with the leaders of Japanese industry . That work began in July and August 1950 , in Tokyo and at the Hakone Convention Center , when Deming delivered speeches on what he called Statistical Product Quality Administration . Many in Japan credit Deming as one of the inspirations for what has become known as the Japanese post-war economic miracle of 1950 to 1960 , when Japan rose from the ashes of war on the road to becoming the second-largest economy in the world through processes partially influenced by the ideas Deming taught :",

  "/wiki/Rebecca_Goldstein": "Rebecca Newberger Goldstein ( born February 23 , 1950 ) is an American philosopher , novelist and public intellectual . She has written ten books , both fiction and nonfiction . She holds a Ph.D. in philosophy of science from Princeton University and is sometimes grouped with novelists , such as Richard Powers and Alan Lightman , who create fiction that is knowledgeable of , and sympathetic toward , science . In her three nonfiction works she has shown an affinity for philosophical rationalism , as well as a conviction that philosophy , like science , makes progress and that scientific progress is itself supported by philosophical arguments . She has also stressed the role that secular philosophical reason has made in moral advances . Increasingly , in her talks and interviews , she has been exploring what she has called mattering theory as an alternative to traditional utilitarianism . This theory is a continuation of her idea of the mattering map , first suggested in her novel The Mind-Body Problem . The concept of the mattering map has been widely adopted in contexts as diverse as cultural criticism , psychology , and behavioral economics . Goldstein is a MacArthur Fellow and has received the National Humanities Medal , the National Jewish Book Award , and numerous other honors .",
