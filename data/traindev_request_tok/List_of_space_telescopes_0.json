Kosmicheskaya programma v SSSR ) , best known as the Soviet space program , was the national space program of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR ) active from 1930s until disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991 . The Soviet Union 's space program was mainly based on the cosmonautic exploration of space and the development of the expandable launch vehicles , which had been split between many design bureaus competing against each other . Over its 60-years of history , the Russian program was responsible for a number of pioneering feats and accomplishments in the human space flight , including the first intercontinental ballistic missile ( R-7 ) , first satellite ( Sputnik 1 ) , first animal in Earth orbit ( the dog Laika on Sputnik 2 ) , first human in space and Earth orbit ( cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin on Vostok 1 ) , first woman in space and Earth orbit ( cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova on Vostok 6 ) , first spacewalk ( cosmonaut Alexei Leonov on Voskhod 2 ) , first Moon impact ( Luna 2 ) , first image of the far side of the Moon ( Luna 3 ) and uncrewed lunar soft landing ( Luna 9 ) , first space rover ( Lunokhod 1 ) , first sample of lunar soil automatically extracted and brought to Earth ( Luna 16 ) , and first space station ( Salyut 1 ) . Further notable records included the first interplanetary probes : Venera 1 and Mars 1 to fly by Venus and Mars , respectively , Venera 3 and Mars 2 to impact the respective planet surface , and Venera 7 and Mars 3 to make soft landings on these planets . The rocket and space program of the USSR , initially boosted by the assistance of captured scientists from the advanced German rocket program , was performed mainly by Soviet engineers and scientists after 1955 , and was based on some unique Soviet and Imperial Russian theoretical developments , many derived by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky , sometimes known as the father of theoretical astronautics . Sergey Korolev ( also transliterated as Korolyov ) was the head of the principal design group ; his official title was chief designer ( a standard title for similar positions in the USSR ) . Unlike its American competitor in the Space Race , which had NASA as a single coordinating agency , the USSR 's program was split among several competing design bureaus led by S.P.Korolev , Kerim Kerimov , Mikhail Yangel , Valentin Glushko , Vladimir Chelomei , Viktor Makeyev , Mikhail Reshetnev . Because of the program 's classified status , and for propaganda value , announcements of the outcomes of missions were delayed until success was certain , and failures were sometimes kept secret . Ultimately , as a result of Mikhail Gorbachev 's policy of glasnost in the 1980s , many facts about the space program were declassified . Notable setbacks included the deaths of Korolev , Vladimir Komarov ( in the Soyuz 1 crash ) , Yuri Gagarin ( on a routine fighter jet mission ) and the Soyuz 11 crew between 1966 and 1971 , and development failure of the huge N-1 rocket ( 1968-1973 ) intended to power a crewed lunar landing , which exploded shortly after lift-off on four uncrewed tests . With the collapse of the Soviet Union , Russia and Ukraine inherited the program .",

The instrumentation consisted principally of a guard scintillation detector , an upper and a lower spark chamber , and a charged particle telescope . SAS-2 was launched from the San Marco platform off the coast of Malindi , Kenya , into a nearly equatorial orbit . The orbiting spacecraft was in the shape of a cylinder approximately 59 cm in diameter and 135 cm in length . Four solar paddles were used to recharge the 6 amp-h nickel-cadmium battery and provide power to the spacecraft and telescope experiment . The spacecraft was spin stabilized , and a magnetically torqued commandable control system was used to point the spin axis of the spacecraft to any position in space within approximately 1 degree . The experiment axis lay along this axis allowing the telescope to look at any selected region of the sky with its plus or minus 30 degree acceptance aperture . The nominal spin rate was 1/12 rpm .",
