  "/wiki/Frances_Pomeroy_Naismith_Award": "The Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award was an annual college basketball award in the United States intended to honor shorter-than-average players who excelled on the court despite their size . The award , named in honor of James Naismith 's daughter-in-law , was established for men in 1969 and for women in 1984 . The men 's award was presented to the nation 's most outstanding senior who is 6 ft 0 in ( 1.83 m ) or shorter , while the women 's award was presented to the top senior who is 5 ft 8 in ( 1.73 m ) or shorter . Early in the women 's award 's history , the cut-off height was 5 ft 6 in ( 1.68 m ) . The men 's award was selected by a panel from the National Association of Basketball Coaches ( NABC ) , while the women 's was selected by the Women 's Basketball Coaches Association ( WBCA ) . The award was discontinued following the 2013-14 season . The Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award was restricted to players who competed in NCAA Division I competition , but in the past it was open to all NCAA levels . For the men 's winners , John Rinka from Kenyon College ( 1970 ) , Mike Scheib from Susquehanna University ( 1978 ) and Jerry Johnson from Florida Southern College were winners from NCAA Division II , Division III , and Division II , respectively . For the women 's winners , Julie Dabrowski of New Hampshire College ( now Southern New Hampshire University ) ( 1990 ) and Amy Dodrill ( 1995 ) and Angie Arnold ( 1998 ) , both from Johns Hopkins University , were also winners from Division III . Only three schools from the list of men 's winners ( Louisville , St. John 's and UCLA ) and six schools from the list of women 's winners ( Baylor , Connecticut , Gonzaga , Johns Hopkins , Notre Dame , and Penn State ) had multiple award winners . Of these programs , the only one with winners in consecutive seasons is the Louisville men 's program ( Peyton Siva in 2013 and Russ Smith in 2014 ) . Six other schools have had winners of both the men 's and women 's awards : California , Eastern Michigan , NC State , Purdue , Virginia , and Wake Forest .",
  "/wiki/James_Naismith": "James Naismith ( November 6 , 1861 - November 28 , 1939 ) was a Canadian-American physical educator , physician , Christian chaplain , sports coach , and innovator . The same year he left Canada for Springfield , Massachusetts , he invented the game of basketball . He wrote the original basketball rule book and founded the University of Kansas basketball program . Naismith lived to see basketball adopted as an Olympic demonstration sport in 1904 and as an official event at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin , as well as the birth of the National Invitation Tournament ( 1938 ) and the NCAA Tournament ( 1939 ) . Born and raised on a farm near Almonte , Ontario , Naismith studied and taught physical education at Montreals McGill University before moving to the United States , where he designed the game of basketball in late 1891 while teaching at the International YMCA Training School in Springfield , Massachusetts . Seven years after inventing basketball , Naismith received his medical degree in Denver in 1898 . He then arrived at the University of Kansas , later becoming the Kansas Jayhawks ' athletic director and coach . While a coach at Kansas , Naismith coached Phog Allen , who later became the coach at Kansas for 39 seasons , beginning a lengthy and prestigious coaching tree . Allen then went on to coach legends including Adolph Rupp and Dean Smith , among others , who themselves coached many notable players and future coaches . Despite coaching his final season in 1907 , Naismith is still the only coach in Kansas men 's basketball history with a losing record .",
  "/wiki/NCAA_Division_I": "NCAA Division I ( D-I ) is the highest level of intercollegiate athletics sanctioned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) in the United States . D-I schools include the major collegiate athletic powers , with larger budgets , more elaborate facilities and more athletic scholarships than Divisions II and III as well as many smaller schools committed to the highest level of intercollegiate competition . This level was once called the University Division of the NCAA , in contrast to the lower level College Division ; these terms were replaced with numeric divisions in 1973 . The University Division was renamed Division I , while the College Division was split in two ; the College Division members that offered scholarships or wanted to compete against those who did became Division II , while those who did not want to offer scholarships became Division III . For college football only , D-I schools are further divided into the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) , the Football Championship Subdivision ( FCS ) , and those institutions that do not have any football program . FBS teams have higher game attendance requirements and more players receiving athletic scholarships than FCS teams . The FBS is named for its series of postseason bowl games , with various polls ranking teams after the conclusion of these games , while the FCS national champion is determined by a multi-team bracket tournament . For the 2014-15 school year , Division I contained 345 of the NCAA 's 1,066 member institutions , with 125 in the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) , 125 in the Football Championship Subdivision ( FCS ) , and 95 non-football schools , with six additional schools in the transition from Division II to Division I . There was a moratorium on any additional movement up to D-I until 2012 , after which any school that wants to move to D-I must be accepted for membership by a conference and show the NCAA it has the financial ability to support a D-I program .",

  "/wiki/High_school_basketball": "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams , most commonly of five players each , opposing one another on a rectangular court , compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball ( approximately 9.4 inches ( 24 cm ) in diameter ) through the defender 's hoop ( a basket 18 inches ( 46 cm ) in diameter mounted 10 feet ( 3.048 m ) high to a backboard at each end of the court ) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop . A field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three-point line , when it is worth three . After a foul , timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws . The team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated . Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running ( dribbling ) or by passing it to a teammate , both of which require considerable skill . On offense , players may use a variety of shots - the lay-up , the jump shot , or a dunk ; on defense , they may steal the ball from a dribbler , intercept passes , or block shots ; either offense or defense may collect a rebound , that is , a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard . It is a violation to lift or drag one 's pivot foot without dribbling the ball , to carry it , or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling . The five players on each side at a time fall into five playing positions the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach 's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) . Informally , players may play three-on-three , two-on-two , and one-on-one . Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield , Massachusetts , United States , basketball has evolved to become one of the world 's most popular and widely viewed sports . The National Basketball Association ( NBA ) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity , salaries , talent , and level of competition .

[ a ] She was described by Pavel Alexandrov , Albert Einstein , Jean Dieudonn\u00e9 , Hermann Weyl and Norbert Wiener as the most important woman in the history of mathematics . As one of the leading mathematicians of her time , she developed the theories of rings , fields , and algebras . In physics , Noether 's theorem explains the connection between symmetry and conservation laws . Noether was born to a Jewish family in the Franconian town of Erlangen ; her father was a mathematician , Max Noether . She originally planned to teach French and English after passing the required examinations , but instead studied mathematics at the University of Erlangen , where her father lectured . After completing her dissertation in 1907 under the supervision of Paul Gordan , she worked at the Mathematical Institute of Erlangen without pay for seven years . At the time , women were largely excluded from academic positions . In 1915 , she was invited by David Hilbert and Felix Klein to join the mathematics department at the University of G\u00f6ttingen , a world-renowned center of mathematical research . The philosophical faculty objected , however , and she spent four years lecturing under Hilbert 's name . Her habilitation was approved in 1919 , allowing her to obtain the rank of Privatdozent .",

  "/wiki/Isaac_Newton": "Sir Isaac Newton PRS ( 25 December 1642 - 20 March 1726/27 [ a ] ) was an English mathematician , physicist , astronomer , theologian , and author ( described in his own day as a natural philosopher ) who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and as a key figure in the scientific revolution . His book Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica ( Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy ) , first published in 1687 , laid the foundations of classical mechanics . Newton also made seminal contributions to optics , and shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus . In Principia , Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint until it was superseded by the theory of relativity . Newton used his mathematical description of gravity to prove Kepler 's laws of planetary motion , account for tides , the trajectories of comets , the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena , eradicating doubt about the Solar System 's heliocentricity . He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles . Newton 's inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis , La Condamine , and others , convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems . Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum . His work on light was collected in his highly influential book Opticks , published in 1704 . He also formulated an empirical law of cooling , made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound , and introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid . In addition to his work on calculus , as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series , generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents , developed a method for approximating the roots of a function , and classified most of the cubic plane curves . Newton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge .",
