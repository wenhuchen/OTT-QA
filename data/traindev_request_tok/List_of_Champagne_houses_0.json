  "/wiki/Charles_Heidsieck_(Champagne)": "Charles Heidsieck was born in 1822 into an eminent Reims family whose wine-making traditions date back to Florens-Louis Heidsieck ( see Heidsieck & Co ) . In 1851 , at age 29 , he founded a wine house ( Maison ) bearing his own name . He began to sell his champagne abroad , starting in Belgium and in England , and in 1852 he travelled to the United States , becoming the first merchant to market his own champagne there . He was a larger than life dandy and became something of a social sensation , one New York newspaper describing him as Champagne Charlie . He visited on three further occasions until the American Civil War disrupted trade . He returned to New York in an unsuccessful effort to recover debts owed by his agents and on visiting the south he became trapped by the conflict . In July 1862 , Charles Heidsieck was arrested as a spy while travelling to New Orleans trying to flee back to France . He was sent to the infamous Fort Jackson in Louisiana . After many pleas , and the intercession of President Lincoln himself , Charles was released in November 1862 , but he returned to France sick and bankrupt . His business was subsequently saved because a debt was repaid in deeds to land in Coronado where , shortly afterwards , there was a silver boom which turned the obscure village of Denver into valuable estate . Charles Heidsieck focused on selecting , blending and ageing wines to produce higher quality champagnes , buying grapes from individual growers . In 1867 he purchased several old chalk quarries , called cray\u00e8res which dated from the Gallo-Roman era , in order to create optimal conditions for wine maturation .",
