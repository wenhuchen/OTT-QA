His improvisational style was characterized by the use of wide intervals , in addition to using an array of extended techniques to emulate the sounds of human voices and animals . Although Dolphy 's work is sometimes classified as free jazz , his compositions and solos were often rooted in conventional ( if highly abstracted ) tonal bebop harmony and melodic lines that suggest the influences of modern classical composers such as B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k and Igor Stravinsky .

  "/wiki/Duke_Ellington": "Edward Kennedy Duke Ellington ( April 29 , 1899 - May 24 , 1974 ) was an American composer , pianist , and leader of a jazz orchestra , which he led from 1923 until his death over a career spanning more than six decades . Born in Washington , D.C. , Ellington was based in New York City from the mid-1920s onward and gained a national profile through his orchestra 's appearances at the Cotton Club in Harlem . In the 1930s , his orchestra toured in Europe . Although widely considered to have been a pivotal figure in the history of jazz , Ellington embraced the phrase beyond category as a liberating principle and referred to his music as part of the more general category of American Music rather than to a musical genre such as jazz . Some of the jazz musicians who were members of Ellington 's orchestra , such as saxophonist Johnny Hodges , are considered to be among the best players in the idiom . Ellington melded them into the best-known orchestral unit in the history of jazz . Some members stayed with the orchestra for several decades . A master at writing miniatures for the three-minute 78 rpm recording format , Ellington wrote more than one thousand compositions ; his extensive body of work is the largest recorded personal jazz legacy , with many of his pieces having become standards . Ellington also recorded songs written by his bandsmen , for example Juan Tizol 's Caravan , and Perdido , which brought a Spanish tinge to big band jazz . In the early 1940s , Ellington began a nearly thirty-year collaboration with composer-arranger-pianist Billy Strayhorn , whom he called his writing and arranging companion . With Strayhorn , he composed many extended compositions , or suites , as well as additional short pieces . Following an appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival , in July 1956 , Ellington and his orchestra enjoyed a major revival and embarked on world tours .",
