  "/wiki/NY_30": "New York State Route 30 ( NY 30 ) is a state highway in the central part of New York in the United States . It extends for 300.71 miles ( 483.95 km ) from an interchange with NY 17 ( Future Interstate 86 ) in the Southern Tier to the US-Canada border in the state 's North Country , where it continues into Quebec as Route 138 . On a regional level , the route serves to connect the Catskill Park to the Adirondack Park . In the latter , NY 30 is known as the Adirondack Trail . Aside from the state parks , the route serves the city of Amsterdam ( where it meets the New York State Thruway ) and several villages . NY 30 was assigned in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to most of its modern routing south of Wells , replacing a series of designations that had been assigned to the highway in the 1920s . The portion of what is now NY 30 north of Speculator was initially part of NY 10 . When that route was truncated to Arietta c. 1960 , NY 30 was extended northward over NY 10 's former alignment by way of an overlap with NY 8 .",

  "/wiki/NY_10": "New York State Route 10 ( NY 10 ) is a north-south state highway in the Central New York and North Country regions of New York in the United States .

NY 10 formally began concurrent with NY 8 , until NY 8 was truncated to end at the northern end of the overlap by 2017 . While NY 8 follows a more westerly alignment between Deposit and Higgins Bay via Utica , NY 10 veers to the east , serving Delhi , Cobleskill , and Canajoharie . Along the way , the road intersects Interstate 88 ( I-88 ) near Cobleskill and U.S. Route 20 ( US 20 ) in Sharon Springs . NY 10 was assigned in 1924 ; however , it initially followed a completely different alignment than it does today . At the time , it began at the New Jersey state line in Rockland County and followed modern US 9W north to Albany . From here , it continued to Saranac Lake via Schenectady , Saratoga Springs , Lake George , Chestertown , North Creek , Long Lake , and Tupper Lake . It was extended northeast to Plattsburgh by 1926 but truncated to Schenectady in 1927 . In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , all of NY 10 south of Long Lake and north of Lake Clear Junction was moved onto a new , more westerly alignment through the state . The route was cut back to its current northern terminus in Arietta c. 1960 .",
