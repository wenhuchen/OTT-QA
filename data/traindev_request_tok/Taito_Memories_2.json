It is a clone of the game Breakout , where the player must use the rotary knob to control a paddle and hit the ball into the red , yellow and blue helmets on the screen . Each time a row of helmets is cleared out , a new row will appear in its place . If the player hits the orange area towards the top of the screen , it will decrease the size of the player 's paddle . Sometimes a football player will appear , and if the ball hits him , the player will earn bonus points .",
  "/wiki/Breakout_clone": "A Breakout clone ( also known as a Breakout-style game , block-breaking game , brick buster , or brick smash , brick break , brick destroyer/destruction , or ball-and-paddle game ) is a sub-class of the bat-and-ball genre . The genre is named for the dynamics of the player-controlled block , called a bat or a paddle , upon which the game is based , which hits a ball towards another player 's bat or different objects such as colored tiles ( called a brick ) . The term brick buster , coined in the early 2000s , mostly refers to more modern games . [ citation needed ] Breakout-style games are characterized by the addition of a wall of blocks or similar objects that the player chips away at with the ball as part of the main gameplay . Since the release of the original Breakout arcade game in 1976 , and Super Breakout two years later , there have been many clones and updates for various platforms . The profusion and notability of such games has been enough for them to also be referred to by some as a genre in their own right . Among the cloners was Breakout designer Steve Wozniak , who wrote Little Brick Out , a software version for the Apple II of his own hardware game . In 1986 Arkanoid revitalized the concept by adding power-ups and a feel of depth to the visuals . Many Breakout clones since then have been styled after Arkanoid . In 1991 , Atari Games released a remake of Breakout called Off the Wall . It modeled spin on the ball . While the original Breakout has the paddles laid out horizontally , a number of clones have changed this concept : Krakout on the Commodore 64 has the paddles vertically , with most of the gameplay happening in a horizontal layout , while TRAZ offers levels ( complete with a level editor ) that can have both paddles that move horizontally and paddles that move vertically .",

  "/wiki/Shoot-em-up": "Shoot 'em up ( also known as shmup or STG ) is a subgenre of video games within the shooter subgenre in the action genre . There is no consensus as to which design elements compose a shoot 'em up .

Shoot 'em ups were popular throughout the 1980s and early 1990s .

  "/wiki/Fighting_game": "A fighting game is a video game genre based around close combat between a limited number of characters , in a stage in which the boundaries are fixed . The characters fight each others until they defeat their opponents or the time expires . The matches typically consist of several rounds , in an arena , with each player character having different abilities but each is relatively viable to choose . Players must master techniques such as blocking , counter-attacking , and chaining attacks together into combos . Starting in the early 1990s , most fighting games allowed the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations . The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups , which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player . The first game to feature fist fighting was Heavyweight Champ in 1976 , but it was Karate Champ which popularized one-on-one martial arts games in arcades in 1984 . The following year , Yie Ar Kung-Fu featured antagonists with differing fighting styles , while The Way of the Exploding Fist further popularized the genre on home systems . In 1987 , Street Fighter introduced hidden special attacks . In 1991 , Capcom 's highly successful Street Fighter II refined and popularized many of the conventions of the genre . The fighting game subsequently became the preeminent genre for competitive video gaming in the early to mid-1990s , particularly in arcades . This period spawned dozens of other popular fighting games , including franchises like Street Fighter , Super Smash Bros. , Tekken , and Virtua Fighter .",

  "/wiki/Platform_game": "Platform games , or platformers , are a video game genre and subgenre of action game . In a platformer , the player controlled character must jump and climb between suspended platforms while avoiding obstacles . Environments often feature uneven terrain of varying height that must be traversed . The player often has some control over the height and distance of jumps to avoid letting their character fall to their death or miss necessary jumps . The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button , but now there are other alternatives like swiping a touchscreen . Other acrobatic maneuvers may factor into the gameplay as well , such as swinging from objects such as vines or grappling hooks , as in Ristar or Bionic Commando , or bouncing from springboards or trampolines , as in Alpha Waves . These mechanics , even in the context of other genres , are commonly called platforming , a verbification of platform . Games where jumping is automated completely , such as 3D games in The Legend of Zelda series , fall outside of the genre . Platform games originated in the early 1980s , which were often about climbing ladders as much as jumping , with 3D successors popularized in the mid-1990s . The term describes games where jumping on platforms is an integral part of the gameplay and came into use after the genre had been established , no later than 1983 . The genre is frequently combined with elements of other genres , such as the shooter elements in Contra , Beat 'em up elements of Viewtiful Joe , adventure elements of Flashback , or role-playing game elements of Castlevania : Symphony of the Night . While commonly associated with console gaming , there have been many important platform games released to video arcades , as well as for handheld game consoles and home computers .",
