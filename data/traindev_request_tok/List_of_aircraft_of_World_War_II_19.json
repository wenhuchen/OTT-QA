  "/wiki/Airspeed_Oxford": "The Airspeed AS.10 Oxford was a twin-engine monoplane aircraft developed and manufactured by Airspeed . It saw widespread use for training British Commonwealth aircrews in navigation , radio-operating , bombing and gunnery roles throughout the Second World War . The Oxford was developed by Airspeed during the 1930s in response to a requirement for a capable trainer aircraft that conformed with Specification T.23/36 , which had been issued by the British Air Ministry . Its basic design is derived from the company 's earlier AS.6 Envoy , a commercial passenger aircraft . Performing its maiden flight on 19 June 1937 , it was quickly put into production as part of a rapid expansion of the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) in anticipation of a large-scale conflict . As a consequence of the outbreak of war , many thousands of Oxfords would be ordered by Britain and its allies , including Australia , Canada , France , New Zealand , Poland , and the United States . Following the end of the conflict , the Oxford continued to achieve export sales for some time , equipping the newly formed air forces of Egypt , India , Israel , and Yugoslavia . It was considered to be a capable trainer aircraft throughout the conflict , as well as being used a general-purpose type . A large number of Oxfords have been preserved on static display .",
  "/wiki/Avro_Anson": "The Avro Anson is a British twin-engined , multi-role aircraft built by the aircraft manufacturer Avro . Large numbers of the type served in a variety of roles for the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) , Fleet Air Arm ( FAA ) , Royal Canadian Air Force ( RCAF ) and numerous other air forces before , during , and after the Second World War . Initially known as the Avro 652A , the Anson was developed during the mid-1930s from the earlier Avro 652 airliner in response to a request for tenders issued by the British Air Ministry for a maritime reconnaissance aircraft . Having suitably impressed the Ministry , a single prototype was ordered , which conducted its maiden flight on 24 March 1935 . Following an evaluation in which the Type 652A bettered the competing de Havilland DH.89 , it was selected as the winner , leading to Air Ministry Specification 18/35 being written around the type and an initial order for 174 aircraft being ordered in July 1935 . The Type 652A was promptly named after British Admiral George Anson . The type was placed into service with the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) and was initially used in the envisioned maritime reconnaissance operation alongside the larger flying boats . After the outbreak of the Second World War the Anson was soon found to have become obsolete in front line combat roles . Large numbers of the type were instead put to use as a multi-engined aircrew trainer , having been found to be suitable for the role , and became the mainstay of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan . The type continued to be used in this role throughout and after the conflict , remaining in RAF service as a trainer and communications aircraft until 28 June 1968 . During the post-war climate , the Anson was increasingly produced for the civil market , being used as a light transport and executive aircraft . By the end of production in 1952 , a total of 8,138 Ansons had been constructed by Avro in nine variants ; in addition , a further 2,882 aircraft were manufactured by Federal Aircraft Ltd in Canada from 1941 .",

  "/wiki/De_Havilland_Dominie": "During summer 1933 , the de Havilland aircraft company commenced work upon an aircraft to meet an Australian requirement , producing a four-engined faster passenger aircraft capable of seating ten passengers , the DH.86 Dragon Express . An important feature of the DH.86 was the newly developed and powerful Gipsy Six engine , a six-cylinder variant of the four cylinder Gipsy Major engine . The DH.86 would serve as the a key starting point for the later DH.89 . During late 1933 , a team at de Havilland , led by aircraft designer Arthur Ernest Hagg , began working on a new design , intended to be a faster and more comfortable successor to the earlier DH.84 Dragon . The new aircraft was , in effect , a twin-engined , scaled-down version of the four-engined DH.86 Express . It shared many common features with the earlier DH.86 Express , including its tapered wings , streamlined fairings and fuselage , as well as the same Gipsy Six engines . However , the DH.89 demonstrated none of the operational vices of the Express . On 17 April 1934 , the prototype conducted its maiden flight at Hatfield Aerodrome , Hertfordshire . Flown by senior de Havilland test pilot H.S . Broad , it was powered by a pair of 200 horsepower ( 150 kW ) Gypsy Six engines . Even prior to the prototype 's first flight , plans to proceed with serial production of DH.89 had already received the go-ahead from management . During May 1934 , airworthiness trials commenced at RAF Martlesham Heath using the prototype ; during one such flight , upon attaining a speed of roughly 175 miles per hour ( 282 km/h ) , the tip of the aircraft 's nose buckled .",

  "/wiki/Fairey_Battle": "The Fairey Battle was a British single-engine light bomber designed and manufactured by the Fairey Aviation Company . It was developed during the mid-1930s for the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) as a monoplane successor to the Hawker Hart and Hind biplanes . The Battle was powered by the same high-performance Rolls-Royce Merlin piston engine that powered various contemporary British fighters like the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire . The Battle was much heavier , with its three-man crew and bomb load . Though a great improvement over the aircraft that preceded it , the Battle was relatively slow and limited in range . With only two .303 in machine guns as defensive armament , it was found to be highly vulnerable to enemy fighters and anti-aircraft fire . The Fairey Battle was used on operations early in the Second World War . During the Phoney War the type achieved the distinction of attaining the first aerial victory of an RAF aircraft in the conflict . In May 1940 , the Battles of the Advanced Air Striking Force suffered many losses , frequently in excess of 50 percent of aircraft sorties per mission . By the end of 1940 the type had been withdrawn from front-line service and relegated to training units overseas . As an aircraft that had been considered to hold great promise in the pre-war era , the Battle proved to be one of the most disappointing aircraft in RAF service .",
