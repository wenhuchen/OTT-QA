  "/wiki/Bamse": "Bamse - V\u00e4rldens starkaste bj\u00f6rn ( Swedish for The world 's strongest bear ) is a Swedish cartoon created by Rune Andr\u00e9asson . The highly popular children 's cartoon first emerged as a series of television short films as well as a weekly half-page Sunday strip in 1966 , before being published periodically in its own comic magazine since 1973 . Andr\u00e9asson did all the artwork himself until 1975 and wrote all the comics until 1990 . Francisco Tora did all the illustrations from 1976 until he was joined by Bo Michanek in 1983 . Several new writers and illustrators were hired in the early 1990s , including Claes Reimerthi , Anna Friberger and Tony Cronstam . Andr\u00e9asson continued to do the magazine cover illustrations until 1992 . The series somewhat changed direction when Bamse had children , specifically triplets , in 1982 . He had a fourth child in 1986 , and his friend Lille Skutt had one at the same time ; this saw the series focus more on family , while also discussing other values such as gender equality . In 1989 , the character Skalman noticed that Bamse 's fourth child Brumma had some intellectual disability , later defined as Asperger 's syndrome , which again brought up the subject of equality . The children did develop in real time within the magazine , but seem to have been fixed in age since around 1990 . They are now around nine years old , in a narratively advantageous eternal state as third-graders . Both the early Sunday strips and the early magazines have since been reprinted as glossy hardbound volumes .",

It is one of only two extant species in the family Hippopotamidae , the other being the pygmy hippopotamus ( Choeropsis liberiensis or Hexaprotodon liberiensis ) . The name comes from the ancient Greek for river horse ( \u1f31\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) . After the elephant and rhinoceros , both of which are found in Africa , the hippopotamus is the third-largest type of land mammal and the heaviest extant artiodactyl . Despite its physical resemblance to pigs and other terrestrial even-toed ungulates , the closest living relatives of the Hippopotamidae are cetaceans ( whales , dolphins , porpoises , etc . ) from which they diverged about 55 million years ago . The hippopotamus is recognisable by its barrel-shaped torso , wide-opening mouth revealing large canine tusks , nearly hairless body , columnar legs and large size ; adults average 1,500 kg ( 3,310 lb ) and 1,300 kg ( 2,870 lb ) for bulls and cows respectively . Despite its stocky shape and short legs , it is capable of running 30 km/h ( 19 mph ) over short distances . The hippopotamus inhabits rivers , lakes and mangrove swamps , where territorial bulls preside over a stretch of river and groups of five to thirty cows and young . During the day , they remain cool by staying in the water or mud ; reproduction and childbirth both occur in water . They emerge at dusk to graze on grasses .
