Light 's design , now listed as national heritage , set out the city centre in a grid layout , interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares , and entirely surrounded by parklands .

Section 125 of the new Australian Constitution provided that land , situated in New South Wales and at least 100 miles ( 160 km ) from Sydney , would be ceded to the new federal government . Following discussion and exploration of various areas within New South Wales , the Seat of Government Act 1908 was passed in 1908 which specified a capital in the Yass-Canberra region . The land was transferred to the Commonwealth by New South Wales in 1911 , creating the Australian Capital Territory , two years prior to the capital city being founded and formally named as Canberra in 1913 . It is unusual among Australian cities , being an entirely planned city outside of any state , similar to Washington , D.C. in the United States or Bras\u00edlia in Brazil . Following an international contest for the city 's design , a blueprint by American architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin was selected and construction commenced in 1913 .

It gained city status ( currently vested in the smaller City of Perth ) in 1856 and was promoted to the status of a Lord Mayorality in 1929 . The city inherited its name due to the influence of Sir George Murray , then Member of Parliament for Perthshire and Secretary of State for War and the Colonies . The city 's population increased substantially as a result of the Western Australian gold rushes in the late 19th century . During Australia 's involvement in World War II , Fremantle served as a base for submarines operating in the Pacific Theatre , and a US Navy Catalina flying boat fleet was based at Matilda Bay . An influx of immigrants after the war , predominantly from Britain , Italy , Greece , and Yugoslavia , led to rapid population growth . This was followed by a surge in economic activity flowing from several mining booms in the late 20th and early 21st centuries that saw Perth become the regional headquarters for several large mining operations .
