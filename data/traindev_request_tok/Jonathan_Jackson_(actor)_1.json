Many of the scenes were shot near the battleship USS North Carolina and on the University of North Carolina Wilmington campus . The first four seasons of the show focus on the main characters ' lives through their high school years .

The opening credits were originally accompanied by the song I Do n't Want to Be by Gavin DeGraw . The theme was removed from the opening in the fifth season ; Schwahn said that this was to lower production costs , to add more time for the storyline , and because he felt that the song was more representative of the core characters ' adolescent past than their present maturity . The credits then consisted only of the title written on a black background . The theme was restored for season 8 , in response to audience demand , and was sung by different artists each week . The series premiered to 2.5 million viewers and rose to 3.3 million in its second week , becoming one of only three shows to rise in their second episode during the 2003-2004 television season .",
