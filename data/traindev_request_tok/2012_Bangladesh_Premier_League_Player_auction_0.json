  "/wiki/Herschelle_Gibbs": "Herschelle Herman Gibbs ( born 23 February 1974 ) is a South African former cricketer , who played all formats of the game for fourteen years . A right-handed batsman , mostly opened the batting , Gibbs became the first player to hit six consecutive sixes in one over in One Day International ( ODI ) cricket , doing so against the Netherlands in the 2007 Cricket World Cup . Regarded as one of the most naturally talented cricketers South Africa have ever produced , Gibbs was also known as an excellent fielder , like his compatriot Jonty Rhodes , with former Australian captain Ricky Ponting noting that in his opinion Gibbs is better than Rhodes in his ability to hit the stumps , with a report prepared by Cricinfo in late 2005 showing that since the 1999 Cricket World Cup , he had effected the eighth highest number of run-outs in ODI cricket of any fieldsman , with the tenth highest success rate . He was the fifth international franchise player signed to the Caribbean Premier League and the first South African player to be named to the new Twenty20 tournament .",
