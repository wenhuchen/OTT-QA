  "/wiki/1904_United_States_presidential_election": "The 1904 United States presidential election was the 30th quadrennial presidential election , held on Tuesday , November 8 , 1904 . Incumbent Republican President Theodore Roosevelt defeated the Democratic nominee , Alton B. Parker . Roosevelt 's victory made him the first president to win a term in his own right after having ascended to the presidency upon the death of his predecessor , William McKinley . Roosevelt took office in September 1901 following the assassination of his predecessor . After the February 1904 death of McKinley 's ally , Senator Mark Hanna , Roosevelt faced little opposition at the 1904 Republican National Convention . The conservative Bourbon Democrat allies of former President Grover Cleveland temporarily regained control of the Democratic Party from the followers of William Jennings Bryan , and the 1904 Democratic National Convention nominated Alton B. Parker , Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals . Parker triumphed on the second ballot of the convention , defeating newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst . As there was little difference between the candidates ' positions , the race was largely based on their personalities ; the Democrats argued the Roosevelt presidency was arbitrary and erratic . Republicans emphasized Roosevelt 's success in foreign affairs and his record of firmness against monopolies . Roosevelt easily defeated Parker , sweeping every region in the nation except the South . Two third-party candidates , Eugene V. Debs of the Socialist Party and Silas C. Swallow of the Prohibition Party , each took over 1% of the popular vote . Roosevelt 's popular vote margin of 18.8% was the largest since James Monroe 's victory in the 1820 presidential election .",

This was the first election in which fifty states participated and the last in which the District of Columbia did not .

It is also the last election where the losing candidate won Ohio . Nixon faced little opposition in the Republican race to succeed popular incumbent Dwight D. Eisenhower . Kennedy , a U.S .

He defeated Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson on the first presidential ballot of the 1960 Democratic National Convention , and asked Johnson to serve as his running mate . The issue of the Cold War dominated the election , as tensions were high between the United States and the Soviet Union . Kennedy won a 303 to 219 Electoral College victory and is generally considered to have won the national popular vote by 112,827 , a margin of 0.17 percent , though some argue that Nixon should be credited with the popular vote victory , as the issue of the popular vote was complicated by the presence of several unpledged electors in the Deep South .",

The history of the CPUSA is closely related to the American labor movement and communist parties worldwide . Initially operating underground due to the Palmer Raids starting in the First Red Scare , the party was influential in American politics in the first half of the 20th century and played a prominent role in the labor movement from the 1920s through the 1940s , becoming known for opposing racism and racial segregation after sponsoring the defense for the Scottsboro Boys in 1931 . Its membership increased during the Great Depression , and they played a key role in the Congress of Industrial Organizations . The CPUSA subsequently declined due to events such as the beginning of the Cold War , the second Red Scare , and the influence of McCarthyism . Its opposition to the Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine were unpopular , with its endorsed candidate Henry A. Wallace under-performing in the 1948 presidential election . Its support for the Soviet Union increasingly alienated it from the rest of the left in the United States in the 1960s . The CPUSA received significant funding from the Soviet Union and crafted its public positions to match those of Moscow . The CPUSA also used a covert apparatus to assist the Soviets with their intelligence activities in the United States and utilized a network of front organizations to shape public opinion . The CPUSA opposed glasnost and perestroika in the Soviet Union and as a result major funding from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ended in 1989 . The party remains committed to Marxism-Leninism .",

  "/wiki/1988_United_States_presidential_election": "The 1988 United States presidential election was the 51st quadrennial presidential election . It was held on Tuesday , November 8 , 1988 . Incumbent Vice President George H. W. Bush , the Republican nominee , defeated Democratic Governor Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts . The 1988 election is the only election since 1948 in which either major party won a third straight presidential election . Incumbent President Ronald Reagan was ineligible to seek a third term , due to term limits established by the 22nd Amendment to the United States Constitution . Bush entered the 1988 Republican primaries as the front-runner . He defeated Senator Bob Dole and televangelist Pat Robertson to win the nomination , and selected Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana as his running mate . Dukakis won the 1988 Democratic primaries after Democratic leaders such as Gary Hart and Ted Kennedy withdrew or declined to run . He selected Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas - who had defeated Bush in a U.S. Senate race 18 years earlier - as his running mate . Running an aggressive campaign , Bush concentrated on the economy and continuing Reagan 's policies . He attacked Dukakis as an elitist Massachusetts liberal , and Dukakis appeared to fail to respond effectively to Bush 's criticism . Despite Dukakis 's initial lead , Bush pulled ahead in opinion polling conducted in September and won by a substantial margin in both the popular and electoral vote .",

  "/wiki/1992_United_States_presidential_election": "The 1992 United States presidential election was the 52nd quadrennial presidential election . It was held on Tuesday , November 3 , 1992 . Democratic Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas defeated incumbent Republican President George H. W. Bush , independent businessman Ross Perot of Texas , and a number of minor candidates . Bush had alienated many of the conservatives in his party by breaking his 1988 campaign pledge against raising taxes , but he fended off a primary challenge from conservative commentator Pat Buchanan . Bush 's popularity after his success in the Gulf War dissuaded high-profile Democratic candidates like Mario Cuomo from entering the 1992 Democratic primaries . Clinton , a leader of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council , established himself as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination by sweeping the Super Tuesday primaries . He defeated former and future Governor of California Jerry Brown , former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas , and other candidates to win his party 's nomination , and chose Senator Al Gore as his running mate . Billionaire Ross Perot launched an independent campaign , emphasizing his opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement and his plan to reduce the national debt . The economy was in recession and Bush 's greatest strength , foreign policy , was regarded as much less important following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War and the relatively peaceful climate in the Middle East after the Gulf War . Perot led in several polls taken in June 1992 , but severely damaged his candidacy by temporarily dropping out of the race in July . The Bush campaign criticized Clinton 's character and emphasized Bush 's foreign policy successes , while Clinton focused on the economy . Clinton won a plurality in the popular vote and a majority of the electoral vote , breaking a streak of three straight Republican victories .",
