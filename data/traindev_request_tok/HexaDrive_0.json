  "/wiki/Rail_shooter": "Shoot 'em up ( also known as shmup or STG ) is a subgenre of video games within the shooter subgenre in the action genre . There is no consensus as to which design elements compose a shoot 'em up . Some restrict the definition to games featuring spacecraft and certain types of character movement ; others allow a broader definition including characters on foot and a variety of perspectives . The genre 's roots can be traced back to Spacewar ! , one of the earliest computer games , developed in 1962 . The shoot 'em up genre was later established by the hit arcade game Space Invaders , which popularised and set the general template for the genre in 1978 , and the genre was then further developed by arcade hits such as Asteroids and Galaxian in 1979 . Shoot 'em ups were popular throughout the 1980s and early 1990s . In the mid-1990s , shoot 'em ups became a niche genre based on design conventions established in the 1980s , and increasingly catered to specialist enthusiasts , particularly in Japan . Bullet hell games are a subgenre that features overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles , often in visually impressive formations .",

Music video games may take a variety of forms and are often grouped with puzzle games due to their common use of rhythmically generated puzzles . Music video games are distinct from purely audio games ( e.g . the 1997 Sega Saturn release Real Sound : Kaze no Regret ) in that they feature a visual feedback , to lead the player through the game 's soundtrack , although eidetic music games can fall under both categories .

  "/wiki/Survival_horror": "Survival horror is a subgenre of video games inspired by horror fiction that focuses on survival of the character as the game tries to frighten players with either horror graphics or scary ambience . Although combat can be part of the gameplay , the player is made to feel less in control than in typical action games through limited ammunition , health , speed and vision , or through various obstructions of the player 's interaction with the game mechanics . The player is also challenged to find items that unlock the path to new areas and solve puzzles to proceed in the game . Games make use of strong horror themes , like dark mazelike environments and unexpected attacks from enemies . The term survival horror was first used for the original Japanese release of Resident Evil in 1996 , which was influenced by earlier games with a horror theme such as 1989 's Sweet Home and 1992 's Alone in the Dark . The name has been used since then for games with similar gameplay , and has been retroactively applied to earlier titles . Starting with the release of Resident Evil 4 in 2005 , the genre began to incorporate more features from action games and more traditional first person and third-person shooter games . This has led game journalists to question whether long-standing survival horror franchises and more recent franchises have abandoned the genre and moved into a distinct genre often referred to as action horror .",

  "/wiki/Action-adventure_game": "Action-adventure is a video game genre that combines core elements from both the action game and adventure game genres . With the decline of the adventure game genre from mainstream popularity in the early 2000s , the use of the term ( and the hybrid term action-adventure ) has been more liberal . It is not uncommon for gamers to apply the term adventure or action to describe the genre of fiction to which a game belongs , and not the gameplay itself . Action-adventure is a hybrid genre , and thus the definition is very inclusive , leading it to be perhaps the broadest genre of video games , and can include many games which might better be categorized under narrow genres . Typically , pure adventure games have situational problems for the player to solve , with very little or no action . If there is action , it is generally confined to isolated minigames . Pure action games have gameplay based on real-time interactions that challenge the reflexes .

Certain dance-based games require the player to physically dance on a mat , with pressure-sensitive pads acting as the input device . The 1996 title PaRappa the Rapper has been deemed the first influential rhythm game , whose basic template formed the core of subsequent games in the genre . In 1997 , Konami 's Beatmania sparked an emergent market for rhythm games in Japan . The company 's music division , Bemani , released a series of music-based games over the next several years . The most successful of these was the 1998 dance mat game Dance Dance Revolution , which was the only Bemani title to achieve large-scale success outside Japan , and would see numerous imitations of the game from other publishers . Other Japanese games , particularly Guitar Freaks , led to development of Guitar Hero and Rock Band series that used instrument-shaped controllers to mimic the playing of actual instruments . Spurred by the inclusion of popular rock music , the two series revitalized the rhythm genre in the Western Market , significantly expanded the console video game market and its demographics .

Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative , either through literal acting , or through a process of structured decision-making regarding character development . Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines . There are several forms of role-playing games . The original form , sometimes called the tabletop role-playing game ( TRPG ) , is conducted through discussion , whereas in live action role-playing ( LARP ) , players physically perform their characters ' actions . In both of these forms , an arranger called a game master ( GM ) usually decides on the rules and setting to be used , while acting as the referee ; each of the other players takes on the role of a single character . Several varieties of RPG also exist in electronic media , such as multiplayer text-based Multi-User Dungeons ( MUDs ) and their graphics-based successors , massively multiplayer online role-playing games ( MMORPGs ) . Role-playing games also include single-player role-playing video games in which players control a character , or team of characters , who undertake ( s ) quests , and may include player capabilities that advance using statistical mechanics .

  "/wiki/First-person_shooter": "First-person shooter ( FPS ) is a video game genre centered on gun and other weapon-based combat in a first-person perspective ; that is , the player experiences the action through the eyes of the protagonist . The genre shares common traits with other shooter games , which in turn makes it fall under the heading action game . Since the genre 's inception , advanced 3D and pseudo-3D graphics have challenged hardware development , and multiplayer gaming has been integral . The first-person shooter genre has been traced as far back as Maze War , development of which began in 1973 , and 1974 's Spasim . Later , and after more playful titles like MIDI Maze in 1987 , the genre coalesced into a more violent form with 1992 's Wolfenstein 3D , which has been credited with creating the genre 's basic archetype upon which subsequent titles were based . One such title , and the progenitor of the genre 's wider mainstream acceptance and popularity , was Doom , one of the most influential games in this genre ; for some years , the term Doom clone was used to designate this genre due to Doom 's influence . Corridor shooter was another common name for the genre in its early years , since processing limitations of the era 's hardware meant that most of the action in the games had to take place in enclosed areas , such as in cramped spaces like corridors and tunnels . 1998 's Half-Life - along with its 2004 sequel Half-Life 2 - enhanced the narrative and puzzle elements . In 1999 , the Half-Life mod Counter-Strike was released and , together with Doom , is perhaps one of the most influential first-person shooters . GoldenEye 007 , released in 1997 , was a landmark first-person shooter for home consoles , while the Halo series heightened the console 's commercial and critical appeal as a platform for first-person shooter titles . In the 21st century , the first-person shooter is the most commercially viable video game genre , and in 2016 , shooters accounted for over 27% of all video game sales . Several first-person shooters have been popular games for esports and competitive gaming competitions as well .",
