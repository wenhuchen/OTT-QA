  "/wiki/Post_town": "A post town is a required part of all postal addresses in the United Kingdom and Ireland , and a basic unit of the postal delivery system . Including the correct post town in the address increases the chance of a letter or parcel being delivered on time . Post towns in general originated as the location of delivery offices . As of 2004 [ update ] , their main function is to distinguish between localities or street names in addresses not including a postcode .",
  "/wiki/PO_box": "A post office box ( commonly abbreviated as P.O . box , or also known as a postal box ) is a uniquely addressable lockable box located on the premises of a post office station . In some regions , particularly in Africa , there is no door to door delivery of mail ; for example , in Kenya . Consequently , renting a PO box has traditionally been the only way to receive mail in such countries . However , some countries , like Egypt , have introduced mail home delivery . Generally , post office boxes are rented from the post office either by individuals or by businesses on a basis ranging from monthly to annual , and the cost of rent varies depending on the box size . Central business district ( CBD ) PO boxes are usually more expensive than rural PO boxes . In the United States , the rental rate used to be [ when ? ] uniform across the country . Now , however , a postal facility can be in any of seven fee groups by location ; in addition , certain customers qualify for free box rental , usually because the Postal Service does not offer carrier-route delivery to their physical addresses . In the United Kingdom , Royal Mail PO boxes are often little more than pigeon-holes in the secure section of a sorting office and are accessible only by staff . In such cases , the renter of the PO box will be issued with a card showing the PO box number and delivery office name and must produce this to the desk staff when collecting mail .",
  "/wiki/Non-geographic_postcode": "Postal codes used in the United Kingdom are known as postcodes ( originally , postal codes ) . They are alphanumeric and were adopted nationally between 11 October 1959 and 1974 , having been devised by the General Post Office ( Royal Mail ) . A full postcode is known as a postcode unit and designates an area with a number of addresses or a single major delivery point . The structure of a postcode is two alphanumeric codes , the first having between two and four characters and the second , three characters . First , one or two letters indicate the postcode area , followed by one or two digits signifying a district within that area . This is followed by a space and then a number denoting a sector within said district , and finally by two letters which are allocated to streets or sides of a street . Postcode areas are often named for a major town or city ( such as B for Birmingham ) but may also be geographic in nature ( such as HS for Outer Hebrides ) . Each postcode area contains a number of post towns which are not themselves alphabetically denoted however each will generally constitute one ( or more ) postcode districts . ( Example : a sizeable part of Southern England is covered by the GU postcode area , named for the town of Guildford . Guildford comprises postal districts GU1 and GU2 . Nearby Woking , a major commuter town 6 miles distant , is a post town within postal district GU22 . ) The central part of the town or city the postcode area is named after will have the number one e.g .",

  "/wiki/City_of_Westminster": "The City of Westminster is an Inner London borough that also holds city status . It occupies much of the central area of Greater London including most of the West End . Historically in Middlesex , it is to the west of the ancient City of London , directly to the east of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea , and its southern boundary is the River Thames . The London borough was created with the 1965 establishment of Greater London . Upon its creation , it inherited the city status previously held by the smaller Metropolitan Borough of Westminster from 1900 , which was first awarded to Westminster in 1540 . Aside from numerous large parks and open spaces , the population density of the district is high . Many sites commonly associated with London are in the borough , including St James 's Palace , Buckingham Palace , the Palace of Westminster ( Houses of Parliament ) and 10 Downing Street . The borough is divided into a number of localities including the ancient political district of Westminster ; the shopping areas around Oxford Street , Regent Street , Piccadilly and Bond Street ; and the night-time entertainment district of Soho . Much of the borough is residential , and in 2008 it was estimated to have a population of 236,000 . The local government body is Westminster City Council . A study in 2017 by Trust for London and The New Policy Institute found that Westminster has the third-highest pay inequality of the 32 London boroughs .

It is designated as part of the A40 , a major road between London and Fishguard , though it is not signed as such , and traffic is regularly restricted to buses and taxis . The road was originally part of the Via Trinobantina , a Roman road between Essex and Hampshire via London . It was known as Tyburn Road through the Middle Ages when it was notorious for public hangings of prisoners at Tyburn Gallows . It became known as Oxford Road and then Oxford Street in the 18th century , and began to change from residential to commercial and retail use by the late 19th century , attracting street traders , confidence tricksters and prostitution . The first department stores in the UK opened in the early 20th century , including Selfridges , John Lewis & Partners and HMV . Unlike nearby shopping streets such as Bond Street , it has retained an element of downmarket trading alongside more prestigious retail stores . The street suffered heavy bombing during World War II , and several longstanding stores including John Lewis were completely destroyed and rebuilt from scratch . Despite competition from other shopping centres such as Westfield Stratford City and the Brent Cross Shopping Centre , Oxford Street remains in high demand as a retail location , with several chains having their flagship stores on the street , and has a number of listed buildings . The annual switching on of Christmas lights by a celebrity has been a popular event since 1959 .

  "/wiki/Soho": "Soho is an area of the City of Westminster , part of the West End of London . Originally a fashionable district for the aristocracy , it has been one of the main entertainment districts in the capital since the 19th century . The area was developed from farmland by Henry VIII in 1536 , when it became a royal park . It became a parish in its own right in the late 17th century , when buildings started to be developed for the upper class , including the laying out of Soho Square in the 1680s . St Anne 's Church was established during the late 17th century , and remains a significant local landmark ; other churches are the Church of our Lady of the Assumption and Saint Gregory and St Patrick 's Church in Soho Square . The aristocracy had mostly moved away by the mid-19th century , when Soho was particularly badly hit by an outbreak of cholera in 1854 . For much of the 20th century Soho had a reputation as a base for the sex industry in addition to its night life and its location for the headquarters of leading film companies . Since the 1980s , the area has undergone considerable gentrification . It is now predominantly a fashionable district of upmarket restaurants and media offices , with only a small remnant of sex industry venues . London 's gay community is centred on Old Compton Street in Soho . Soho 's reputation as a major entertainment district of London stems from theatres such as the Windmill Theatre on Great Windmill Street and the Raymond Revuebar owned by entrepreneur Paul Raymond , and music clubs such as the 2i 's Coffee Bar and the Marquee Club . Trident Studios was based in Soho , and the nearby Denmark Street has hosted numerous music publishing houses and instrument shops from the 20th century onwards .",

It became well known for the annual May Fair that took place from 1686 to 1764 in what is now Shepherd Market . Over the years , the fair grew increasingly downmarket and unpleasant , and it became a public nuisance . The Grosvenor family ( who became Dukes of Westminster ) acquired the land through marriage and began to develop it under the direction of Thomas Barlow . The work included Hanover Square , Berkeley Square and Grosvenor Square , which were surrounded by high-quality houses , and St George 's Hanover Square Church . By the end of the 18th century , most of Mayfair was built on with upper-class housing ; unlike some nearby areas of London , it has never lost its affluent status . The decline of the British aristocracy in the early 20th century led to the area becoming more commercial , with many houses converted into offices for corporate headquarters and various embassies .

The street has been a main thoroughfare since at least medieval times , and in the Middle Ages was known as the road to Reading or the way from Colnbrook . Around 1611 or 1612 , a Robert Baker acquired land in the area , and prospered by making and selling piccadills . [ nb 1 ] Shortly after purchasing the land , he enclosed it and erected several dwellings , including his home , Pikadilly Hall . What is now Piccadilly was named Portugal Street in 1663 after Catherine of Braganza , wife of Charles II , and grew in importance after the road from Charing Cross to Hyde Park Corner was closed to allow the creation of Green Park in 1668 . Some of the most notable stately homes in London were built on the northern side of the street during this period , including Clarendon House and Burlington House in 1664 . Berkeley House , constructed around the same time as Clarendon House , was destroyed by a fire in 1733 and rebuilt as Devonshire House in 1737 by William Cavendish , 3rd Duke of Devonshire .

Originally named Savile Street , it was built between 1731 and 1735 as part of the development of the Burlington Estate . It was designed under the influence of Burlington 's interpretation of Palladian architecture , known as Burlingtonian . Henry Flitcroft , under the supervision of Daniel Garrett , appears to have been the main architect - though 1 and 22-23 Savile Row were designed by William Kent . Initially , the street was occupied mainly by military officers and their wives ; later William Pitt the Younger and Irish-born playwright and MP Richard Brinsley Sheridan were residents . Tailors started doing business in the area in the late 18th century ; first in Cork Street , about 1790 , then by 1803 in Savile Row itself .
