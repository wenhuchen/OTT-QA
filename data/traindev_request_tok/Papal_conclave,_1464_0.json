The practice of creating cardinal-nephews originated in the Middle Ages , and reached its apex during the 16th and 17th centuries . The last cardinal-nephew was named in 1689 and the practice was extinguished in 1692 . The word nepotism originally referred specifically to this practice , when it appeared in the English language about 1669 . From the middle of the Avignon Papacy ( 1309-1377 ) until Pope Innocent XII 's anti-nepotism bull ( a papal charter ) , Romanum decet pontificem ( 1692 ) , a pope without a cardinal-nephew was the exception to the rule . Every Renaissance pope who created cardinals appointed a relative to the College of Cardinals , and the nephew was the most common choice , although one of Alexander VI 's creations was his own son . The institution of the cardinal-nephew evolved over seven centuries , tracking developments in the history of the papacy and the styles of individual Popes . From 1566 until 1692 , a cardinal-nephew held the curial office of the Superintendent of the Ecclesiastical State , known as the Cardinal Nephew , and thus the terms are sometimes used interchangeably . The curial office of the Cardinal Nephew as well as the institution of the cardinal-nephew declined as the power of the Cardinal Secretary of State increased and the temporal power of popes decreased in the 17th and 18th centuries . The list of cardinal-nephews includes at least fifteen , and possibly as many as nineteen popes ( Gregory IX , Alexander IV , Adrian V , Gregory XI , Boniface IX , Innocent VII , Eugene IV , Paul II , Alexander VI , Pius III , Julius II , Leo X , Clement VII , Benedict XIII , and Pius VII ; perhaps also John XIX and Benedict IX , if they were really promoted cardinals ; as well as Innocent III and Benedict XII , if in fact they were related to their elevators ) ; one antipope ( John XXIII ) ; and two or three saints ( Charles Borromeo , Guarinus of Palestrina , and perhaps Anselm of Lucca , if he was really a cardinal ) .",

Pope Eugene made him a cardinal in 1446 after successful trips to Italy and Germany , and when Eugene died the next year Parentucelli was elected in his place . He took his name Nicholas in memory of his obligations to Niccol\u00f2 Albergati . The Pontificate of Nicholas saw the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks and the end of the Hundred Years War . He responded by calling a crusade against the Ottomans , which never materialized . By the Concordat of Vienna he secured the recognition of papal rights over bishoprics and benefices . He also brought about the submission of the last of the antipopes , Felix V , and the dissolution of the Synod of Basel . A key figure in the Roman Renaissance , Nicholas sought to make Rome the home of literature and art . He strengthened fortifications , restored aqueducts , and rebuilt many churches . He ordered design plans for what would eventually be the Basilica of St. Peter .",

  "/wiki/Papal_States": "The Papal States ( Italian : Stato Pontificio ) , officially the State of the Church ( Italian : Stato della Chiesa , Italian pronunciation : [ \u02c8sta\u02d0to della \u02c8kj\u025b\u02d0za ; \u02c8kje\u02d0- ] ; Latin : Status Ecclesiasticus ; also Dicio Pontificia ) were a series of territories in the Italian Peninsula under the direct sovereign rule of the Pope , from the 8th century until 1870 . They were among the major states of Italy from roughly the 8th century until the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia successfully unified the Italian Peninsula by conquest in a campaign virtually concluded in 1861 and definitively in 1870 . At their zenith , the Papal States covered most of the modern Italian regions of Lazio ( which includes Rome ) , Marche , Umbria and Romagna , and portions of Emilia . These holdings were considered to be a manifestation of the temporal power of the pope , as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy . By 1861 , much of the Papal States ' territory had been conquered by the Kingdom of Italy . Only Lazio , including Rome , remained under the Pope 's temporal control . In 1870 , the Pope lost Lazio and Rome and had no physical territory at all , except the Basilica of St Peter and the papal residence and related buildings around the Vatican quarter of Rome , which the new Italian state did not occupy militarily . In 1929 the head of the Italian government , at the time the Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini , ended the crisis between unified Italy and the Holy See by negotiating the Lateran Treaty , signed by the two parties . This recognized the sovereignty of the Holy See over a newly created international territorial entity , the Vatican City State , limited to a token territory .",

In 2007 , Mantua 's centro storico ( old town ) and Sabbioneta were declared by UNESCO to be a World Heritage Site . Mantua 's historic power and influence under the Gonzaga family has made it one of the main artistic , cultural , and especially musical hubs of Northern Italy and the country as a whole . Mantua is noted for its significant role in the history of opera ; the city is also known for its architectural treasures and artifacts , elegant palaces , and the medieval and Renaissance cityscape . It is the place where the composer Monteverdi premiered his opera L'Orfeo and where Romeo was banished in Shakespeare 's play Romeo and Juliet . It is the nearest town to the birthplace of the Roman poet Virgil , who was commemorated by a statue at the lakeside park Piazza Virgiliana . Mantua is surrounded on three sides by artificial lakes , created during the 12th century as the city 's defence system . These lakes receive water from the Mincio River , a tributary of the Po River which descends from Lake Garda . The three lakes are called Lago Superiore , Lago di Mezzo , and Lago Inferiore ( Upper , Middle , and Lower Lakes , respectively ) . A fourth lake , Lake Pajolo , which once served as a defensive water ring around the city , dried up at the end of the 18th century .",
