  "/wiki/Glenn_Miller_Orchestra": "Glenn Miller and His Orchestra was an American swing dance band formed by Glenn Miller in 1938 . Arranged around a clarinet and tenor saxophone playing melody , and three other saxophones playing harmony , the band became the most popular and commercially successful dance orchestra of the Swing era and one of the greatest singles charting acts of the 20th century . Miller began professionally recording in New York City as a sideman in the Hot jazz era of the late 1920s . With the arrival of virtuoso trombonists Jack Teagarden and Tommy Dorsey , Miller focused more on developing his arrangement skills . Writing for contemporaries and future stars such as Artie Shaw , and Benny Goodman , Miller gained prowess as an arranger by working in a variety of settings . Later , Miller largely improved his arranging and writing skills by studying under music theorist Joseph Schillinger . In February 1937 , Miller started an orchestra that briefly made records for Decca . With this group , Miller used an arrangement he wrote for British bandleader Ray Noble 's American band in an attempt to form a clarinet-reed sound . This style developed over time , and eventually became known as the Glenn Miller sound . Frustrated with his agency over playing inconsistent bookings and lacking broad radio exposure , Miller gave the band notice in December 1937 . Less than three months later , he was looking for members and forming a new band . Miller began a partnership with Eli Oberstein , which led directly to a contract with Victor subsidiary Bluebird Records .",

Big bands originated during the early 1910s and dominated jazz in the early 1940s when swing was most popular . The term big band is also used to describe a genre of music , although this was not the only style of music played by big bands . Big bands started as accompaniment for dancing . In contrast to the typical jazz emphasis on improvisation , big bands relied on written compositions and arrangements . They gave a greater role to bandleaders , arrangers , and sections of instruments rather than soloists .",

The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom .

It was produced by B-movie king Sam Katzman ( who would produce several Elvis Presley films in the 1960s ) and directed by Fred F. Sears . The film was shot over a short period of time in January 1956 and released in March 1956 to capitalize on Haley 's success and the popularity of his multimillion-selling recording Rock Around the Clock that debuted in the 1955 teen flick Blackboard Jungle , and is considered the first major rock and roll musical film . Haley 's 1954 recording was previously played over the opening credits of Blackboard Jungle and the same recording was used for the opening of Rock Around the Clock , marking a rare occasion where the same recording opened films released in such a short interval ( the recording would be used once again to open the 1973 film American Graffiti ) .",

  "/wiki/Bill_Haley_and_his_Comets": "Bill Haley & His Comets were an American rock and roll band , founded in 1952 and continued until Haley 's death in 1981 . The band was also known as Bill Haley and the Comets and Bill Haley 's Comets ( and variations thereof ) . From late 1954 to late 1956 , the group placed nine singles in the Top 20 , one of those a number one and three more in the Top Ten . The single Rock Around the Clock became the biggest selling rock and roll single in the history of the genre . Bandleader Bill Haley had previously been a country music performer ; after recording a country and western-styled version of Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats Rocket 88 , a rhythm and blues song , he changed musical direction to a new sound which came to be called rock and roll . Although several members of the Comets became famous , Bill Haley remained the star . With his spit curl and the band 's matching plaid dinner jackets and energetic stage behavior , many fans consider them to be as revolutionary in their time as the Beatles were a decade later . Following Haley 's death , no fewer than seven different groups have existed under the Comets name , all claiming ( with varying degrees of authority ) to be the continuation of Haley 's group .

  "/wiki/Rock_and_roll": "Rock and roll ( often written as rock & roll , rock ' n ' roll or rock ' n roll ) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s from musical styles such as gospel , jump blues , jazz , boogie woogie , rhythm and blues , and country music . While elements of what was to become rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s , the genre did not acquire its name until 1954 . According to Greg Kot , rock and roll refers to a style of popular music originating in the U.S. in the 1950s prior to its development by the mid-1960s into the more encompassing international style known as rock music , though the latter also continued to be known as rock and roll . For the purpose of differentiation , this article deals with the first definition . In the earliest rock and roll styles , either the piano or saxophone was typically the lead instrument , but these instruments were generally replaced or supplemented by guitar in the middle to late 1950s . The beat is essentially a dance rhythm with an accentuated backbeat , which is almost always provided by a snare drum . Classic rock and roll is usually played with one or two electric guitars ( one lead , one rhythm ) , a double bass or string bass or ( after the mid-1950s ) an electric bass guitar , and a drum kit . Beyond simply a musical style , rock and roll , as seen in movies , in fan magazines , and on television , influenced lifestyles , fashion , attitudes , and language . In addition , rock and roll may have contributed to the civil rights movement because both African-American and white American teenagers enjoyed the music . It went on to spawn various genres , often without the initially characteristic backbeat , that are now more commonly called rock music or simply rock .",

  "/wiki/Rock_Around_the_Clock": "Rock Around the Clock is a rock and roll song in the 12-bar blues format written by Max C. Freedman and James E. Myers ( the latter being under the pseudonym Jimmy De Knight ) in 1952 . The best-known and most successful rendition was recorded by Bill Haley & His Comets in 1954 for American Decca . It was a number one single on both the United States and United Kingdom charts and also reentered the UK Singles Chart in the 1960s and 1970s . It was not the first rock and roll record , nor was it the first successful record of the genre ( Bill Haley had American chart success with Crazy Man , Crazy in 1953 , and in 1954 , Shake , Rattle and Roll sung by Big Joe Turner reached No . 1 on the Billboard R & B chart ) . Haley 's recording nevertheless became an anthem for rebellious 1950s youth and is widely considered to be the song that , more than any other , brought rock and roll into mainstream culture around the world . The song is ranked No . 158 on the Rolling Stone magazine 's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time . Although it was first recorded by Italian-American band Sonny Dae and His Knights on March 20 , 1954 , Myers claimed the song had been written specifically for Haley but , for various reasons , Haley was unable to record it himself until April 12 , 1954 . The original full title of the song was We 're Gon na Rock Around the Clock Tonight ! . This was later shortened to ( We 're Gon na ) Rock Around the Clock , though this form is generally only used on releases of the 1954 Bill Haley Decca Records recording ; most other recordings of this song by Haley and others ( including Sonny Dae ) shorten this title further to Rock Around the Clock .

With a line-up comprising John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison and Ringo Starr , they are regarded as the most influential band of all time . The group were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music 's recognition as an art form . Rooted in skiffle , beat and 1950s rock and roll , their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways ; the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock . As pioneers in recording , songwriting and artistic presentation , the group revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era 's youth and sociocultural movements . Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney , the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960 , initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass . The core trio of Lennon , McCartney and Harrison , together since 1958 , went through a succession of drummers , including Pete Best , before asking Starr to join them in 1962 . Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings , greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit , Love Me Do , in late 1962 . As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed Beatlemania , the band acquired the nickname the Fab Four , with Epstein , Martin and other members of the band 's entourage sometimes given the informal title of fifth Beatle . By early 1964 , the Beatles were international stars , leading the British Invasion of the United States pop market and breaking numerous sales records . They soon made their film debut with A Hard Day 's Night ( 1964 ) . From 1965 onwards , they produced increasingly innovative recordings , including the albums Rubber Soul ( 1965 ) , Revolver ( 1966 ) and Sgt .",
  "/wiki/Charlie_Is_My_Darling_(film)": "Charlie Is My Darling , directed by Peter Whitehead and produced by the Rolling Stones ' manager Andrew Loog Oldham , was the first documentary film about the Rolling Stones . It was intended as a screen test for the band , to see how their musical charisma would translate into film . The footage was shot during the band 's second tour of Ireland that year , on 3 and 4 September 1965 , and was finished in the spring of 1966 . It was given its premiere at the Mannheim Film Festival in October 1966 . But the film was never officially released , due to the legal fights between the Rolling Stones and Allen Klein and a burglary in Andrew Loog Oldham 's office , which saw all prints disappear . Nearly fifty years later , in 2012 , a new film using restored footage and entitled Charlie Is My Darling - Ireland 1965 was released by Allen Klein 's ABKCO Records , which owns the rights to all older Stones material . Charlie Is My Darling - Ireland 1965 came about when director Michael ( Mick ) Gochanour discovered additional unprocessed footage of the 1965 Rolling Stones screen test . Gochanour spent two years editing and remixing the 60 's material , adding a story line and synching music to Rolling Stones concert footage that had originally been filmed without sound . The result was Charlie Is My Darling - 1965 directed by Peter Whitehead and Michael Gochanour . One of Gochanour 's objectives in making the film was to show The Rolling Stones in a way the world had never seen them before ; as a band just coming into their own - raw , visceral , innocent and with purpose . The 64-minute documentary , Charlie Is My Darling - Ireland 1965 , follows the group from their car trip out of London to Heathrow Airport , and from there to Dublin where they had two concerts at the Adelphi Theatre on 3 September . The next day they take a train up to Belfast for two concerts at the ABC Theatre , before returning to London by plane the following day.Besides stage shots from the concerts ( where the second Dublin concert ends in total chaos as fans storm the stage ) , the film contains scenes from a hotel room in Dublin ( where Keith and Mick for fun do a few Beatles songs as well as a couple of their own ) , scenes from their train trip to Belfast , another impromptu song session by a piano ( with both Keith and Andrew Oldham playing the piano while Mick impersonates Elvis Presley and sings Fats Domino 's version of Blueberry Hill ) , and finally their flight back to London .",

The filmed rehearsals were marked by ill-feeling , leading to George Harrison 's temporary departure from the group . As a condition of his return , the members reconvened at their own Apple Studio with guest keyboardist Billy Preston . The project then yielded a single public concert , held impromptu on the studio 's rooftop on 30 January , from which three of the album 's tracks were drawn .

It stars John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd as Joliet Jake and Elwood Blues , characters developed from The Blues Brothers recurring musical sketch on the NBC variety series Saturday Night Live . The film is set in and around Chicago , Illinois , where it was filmed . The film 's screenplay was written by Aykroyd and Landis . It features musical numbers by rhythm and blues ( R & B ) , soul , and blues singers James Brown , Cab Calloway , Aretha Franklin , Ray Charles , and John Lee Hooker . It features non-musical supporting performances by Carrie Fisher , Henry Gibson , Charles Napier and John Candy . The story is a tale of redemption for paroled convict Jake and his blood brother Elwood , who set out on a mission from God to save from foreclosure the Catholic orphanage in which they were raised . To do so , they must reunite their R & B band and organize a performance to earn $ 5,000 needed to pay the orphanage 's property tax bill . Along the way , they are targeted by a homicidal mystery woman , Neo-Nazis , and a country and western band - all while being relentlessly pursued by the police . Universal Studios , which had won the bidding war for the film , was hoping to take advantage of Belushi 's popularity in the wake of Saturday Night Live , Animal House , and the Blues Brothers ' musical success ; it soon found itself unable to control production costs . The start of filming was delayed when Aykroyd , new to film screenwriting , took six months to deliver a long and unconventional script that Landis had to rewrite before production , which began without a final budget . On location in Chicago , Belushi 's partying and drug use caused lengthy and costly delays that , along with the destructive car chases depicted onscreen , made the final film one of the most expensive comedies ever produced .",

Punk embraces a DIY ethic ; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through independent record labels . The term punk rock was first used by American rock critics in the early 1970s to describe 1960s garage bands and certain subsequent acts they perceived as stylistic inheritors . When the movement now bearing the name developed from 1974 to 1976 , acts such as Television , Patti Smith , and the Ramones in New York City ; the Sex Pistols , the Clash , and the Damned in London ; and the Saints in Brisbane formed its vanguard . As 1977 approached , punk became a major cultural phenomenon in the UK . It spawned a punk subculture expressing youthful rebellion through distinctive styles of clothing and adornment ( such as deliberately offensive T-shirts , leather jackets , studded or spiked bands and jewelry , safety pins , and bondage and S & M clothes ) and a variety of anti-authoritarian ideologies .

It is the second-closest of the Channel Islands to France , after Alderney . Jersey was part of the Duchy of Normandy , whose dukes went on to become kings of England from 1066 . After Normandy was lost by the kings of England in the 13th century , and the ducal title surrendered to France , Jersey and the other Channel Islands remained attached to the English crown .

  "/wiki/Heavy_metal_music": "Heavy metal ( or simply metal ) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s , largely in the United Kingdom and the United States . With roots in blues rock , psychedelic rock , and acid rock , the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick , massive sound , characterized by highly amplified distortion , extended guitar solos , emphatic beats , and overall loudness . The genre 's lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo . In 1968 , three of the genre 's most famous pioneers , Led Zeppelin , Black Sabbath and Deep Purple were founded . Though they came to attract wide audiences , they were often derided by critics . Following the blueprint laid down by Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath , several American bands modified heavy metal into more accessible forms during the 1970s : the raw , sleazy sound and outrageous stage shows of Alice Cooper and Kiss ; the blues-rooted rock of Aerosmith ; and the flashy guitar leads and wild party rock of Van Halen . During the mid-1970s , Judas Priest helped spur the genre 's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence ; Mot\u00f6rhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed . Beginning in the late 1970s , bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Def Leppard followed in a similar vein . Before the end of the decade , heavy metal fans became known as metalheads or headbangers . During the 1980s , glam metal became popular with groups such as Bon Jovi and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce . Underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles : thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica , Slayer , Megadeth , and Anthrax , while other extreme subgenres of heavy metal such as death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena .

He achieved prominence as a member of the punk rock band the Sex Pistols , replacing Glen Matlock , who had fallen out of favour with the other members of the group . Due to intravenous drug use , Vicious was hospitalised with hepatitis during the recording of the Sex Pistols ' only studio album , Never Mind the Bollocks , Here 's the Sex Pistols ; his bass is only partially featured on one song - Bodies . Vicious later appeared as a lead vocalist , performing three songs , on the soundtrack to The Great Rock ' n ' Roll Swindle ( 1980 ) , a largely fictionalised documentary about the Sex Pistols . As the Sex Pistols were gaining attention , Vicious met Nancy Spungen , and the couple began a relationship which culminated in Spungen 's death from an apparent stab wound while staying in New York City 's Hotel Chelsea with Vicious . Under suspicion of murder , Vicious was released on bail ; he was arrested again for assaulting Todd Smith , brother of Patti Smith , at a nightclub , and underwent drug rehabilitation on Rikers Island .

  "/wiki/Sex_Pistols": "The Sex Pistols were an English punk rock band that formed in London in 1975 . They were responsible for initiating the punk movement in the United Kingdom and inspiring many later punk and alternative rock musicians . Although their initial career lasted just two and a half years and produced only four singles and one studio album , Never Mind the Bollocks , Here 's the Sex Pistols , they are regarded as one of the most influential acts in the history of popular music . The Sex Pistols originally comprised vocalist Johnny Rotten ( John Lydon ) , guitarist Steve Jones , drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock . Matlock was replaced by Sid Vicious in early 1977 . Under the management of Malcolm McLaren , the band attracted controversies that both captivated and appalled Britain . Through an obscenity-laced television interview in December 1976 and their May 1977 single God Save the Queen , attacking Britons ' social conformity and deference to the Crown , they precipitated the punk rock movement . In January 1978 , at the end of an over-hyped and turbulent tour of the United States , Rotten announced the band 's break-up . Over the next few months , the three remaining band members recorded songs for McLaren 's film version of the Sex Pistols ' story , The Great Rock ' n ' Roll Swindle . Vicious died of a heroin overdose in February 1979 , following his arrest for the alleged murder of his girlfriend . Rotten , Jones , Cook and Matlock briefly reunited for a concert tour in 1996 . On 24 February 2006 , the Sex Pistols - the four original members plus Vicious - were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , but they refused to attend the ceremony , calling the museum a piss stain .",
