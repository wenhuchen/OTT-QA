  "/wiki/Anderl_Molterer": "Andreas Anderl Molterer ( born 8 October 1931 in Kitzb\u00fchel ) is an Austrian former alpine skier . The White Blitz from Kitz ( in contrast to Toni Sailer , who was the Black Blitz from Kitz ) , as he was known , was one of the best skiers of the 1950s , though labouring in Toni Sailer 's shadow . At the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo , Italy he won silver in the giant slalom , and bronze in the downhill competition . In 1953 , 1955 , 1958 , and 1959 he won the Hahnenkamm Race in Kitzb\u00fchel . He was absolutely dominant on the pro circuit in the early 1960s . Leading up to the 1968 Olympics , there was much speculation that Jean-Claude Killy might win all 3 skiing events . One writer ( ca n't remember who ) said it was not likely that anyone could do that , since the slalom and downhill favor different physical characteristics . He noted that the only time it had been done was 12 years before , in 1956 , and that Toni Sailer won the giant slalom only because the great Anderl Molterer fell during a run so overpowering that he still came in second , as noted above .",
