  "/wiki/Breton_language": "Breton ( /\u02c8br\u025bt\u0259n/ , French : [ b\u0281\u0259t\u0254\u0303 ] ; brezhoneg [ b\u0281e\u02c8z\u00f5\u02d0n\u025bk ] ( listen ) or [ br\u0259h\u00f5\u02c8nek ] in Morbihan ) is a Southwestern Brittonic language of the Celtic language family spoken in Brittany . Breton was brought from Great Britain to Armorica ( the ancient name for the coastal region that includes the Brittany peninsula ) by migrating Britons during the Early Middle Ages ; it is thus an Insular Celtic language , though closely related to the Continental Celtic Gaulish language which had been spoken in pre-Roman Gaul . Breton is most closely related to Cornish , both being Southwestern Brittonic languages . Welsh and the extinct Cumbric are the more distantly related Western Brittonic languages . The other regional language of Brittany , Gallo , is a Romance language descended from Latin ( unlike the similarly named Gaulish ) . As a langue d'o\u00efl , Gallo is a close relative of standard French . Having declined from more than a million speakers around 1950 to about 200,000 in the first decade of the 21st century , Breton is classified as severely endangered by the UNESCO Atlas of the World 's Languages in Danger . However , the number of children attending bilingual classes has risen 33% between 2006 and 2012 to 14,709 .",
