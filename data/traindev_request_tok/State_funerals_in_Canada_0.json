The young McGee was a Catholic Irishman who opposed British rule of Ireland , and worked for a peasant revolution to overthrow British rule and secure Irish independence . He escaped arrest and fled to the United States in 1848 , where he reversed his political beliefs . He became disgusted with American republicanism and democracy , and became intensely conservative in his politics and in his religious support for the Pope . He moved to Canada in 1857 and worked hard to convince the Irish Catholics to cooperate with the Protestant British ( members of the church ) in forming a Confederation that would make for a strong Canada in close alliance with Britain . His passion for Confederation garnered him the title : 'Canada 's first nationalist ' . He fought the Fenians in Canada , who were Irish Catholics that opposed the British and resembled his younger self politically . McGee succeeded in helping create the Canadian Confederation in 1867 , but was assassinated by Patrick J. Whelan in 1868 .",

Macdonald was the leading figure in the subsequent discussions and conferences , which resulted in the British North America Act , 1867 and the birth of Canada as a nation on 1 July 1867 . Macdonald was the first Prime Minister of the new nation , and served 19 years ; only William Lyon Mackenzie King served longer . In 1873 , he resigned from office over a scandal in which his party took bribes from businessmen seeking the contract to build the Canadian Pacific Railway . However , he was re-elected in 1878 , continuing until he died in office in 1891 .

As of July 2016 the city has a population of 531,902 , and the metropolitan area had a population of 800,296 . It is the eleventh largest city and the seventh largest metropolitan area in Canada . The Algonquian people had originally named the area K\u00e9bec , an Algonquin [ note 1 ] word meaning where the river narrows , because the Saint Lawrence River narrows proximate to the promontory of Quebec and its Cape Diamant . Explorer Samuel de Champlain founded a French settlement here in 1608 , and adopted the Algonquin name . Quebec City is one of the oldest European cities in North America . The ramparts surrounding Old Quebec ( Vieux-Qu\u00e9bec ) are the only fortified city walls remaining in the Americas north of Mexico . This area was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985 as the Historic District of Old Qu\u00e9bec . The city 's landmarks include the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac hotel that dominates the skyline and the Citadelle of Quebec , an intact fortress that forms the centrepiece of the ramparts surrounding the old city and includes a secondary royal residence . The National Assembly of Quebec ( provincial legislature ) , the Mus\u00e9e national des beaux-arts du Qu\u00e9bec ( National Museum of Fine Arts of Quebec ) , and the Mus\u00e9e de la civilisation ( Museum of Civilization ) are found within or near Vieux-Qu\u00e9bec .",

He served as the tenth prime minister of Canada in 1921-1926 , 1926-1930 and 1935-1948 . He is best known for his leadership of Canada throughout the Second World War ( 1939-1945 ) when he mobilized Canadian money , supplies and volunteers to support Britain while boosting the economy and maintaining morale on the home front . A Liberal with 21 years and 154 days in office , he was the longest-serving prime minister in Canadian history . Trained in law and social work , he was keenly interested in the human condition ( as a boy , his motto was Help those that can not help themselves ) , and played a major role in laying the foundations of the Canadian welfare state . King acceded to the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1919 . Taking the helm of a party bitterly torn apart during the First World War , he reconciled factions , unifying the Liberal Party and leading it to victory in the 1921 election . His party was out of office during the harshest days of the Great Depression in Canada , 1930-35 ; he returned when the economy was on an upswing . He personally handled complex relations with the Prairie Provinces , while his top aides Ernest Lapointe and Louis St. Laurent skillfully met the demands of French Canadians . During the Second World War , he carefully avoided the battles over conscription , patriotism and ethnicity that had divided Canada so deeply in the First World War . Though few major policy innovations took place during his premiership , he was able to synthesize and pass a number of measures that had reached a level of broad national support . Scholars attribute King 's long tenure as party leader to his wide range of skills that were appropriate to Canada 's needs .",

In the 1925 election , the Conservatives won a plurality of seats , just eight short of a majority government , but Mackenzie King decided to hold onto power with the support of the Progressives . Meighen 's brief second term as Prime Minister came about as the result of the King-Byng Affair , being invited to form a ministry after Mackenzie King was refused an election request and resigned . He soon lost a no-confidence motion , however , and faced another federal election .",
  "/wiki/St._Andrew's_United_Church": "St. Andrew 's United Church is an historic congregation of the United Church of Canada in Toronto , Ontario , Canada . Located in the city 's downtown core near the intersection of Yonge and Bloor it is a combination of five other downtown Toronto congregations . The church originated from St. Andrew 's Church , founded in 1830 as the first Church of Scotland congregation in what was then the town of York . The original St. Andrew 's was located at the corner of Adelaide and Church Streets . By the 1870s it had become clear that a new church was needed . The downtown core had moved westward , and most of the congregation wanted to shift in that direction as well , but a minority staunchly opposed the idea . With the congregation thus split , the majority moved to a new structure at King and Simcoe in 1876 that still exists today as St. Andrew 's Church . The smaller part of the congregation stayed in the eastern part of town and became known as Old St. Andrew 's and this church gave rise to the current St. Andrew 's United . In 1878 the Old St. Andrew 's congregation built a new church at the corner of Jarvis and Carlton Streets . With the formation of the United Church of Canada in 1925 Old St. Andrew 's elected to join the new union , while St. Andrew 's on King remained Presbyterian . Over the next decades the number of United Church supporters in the downtown area decreased dramatically and a number of congregations were consolidated . St. Andrew 's is today the descendant of four other congregations .",
