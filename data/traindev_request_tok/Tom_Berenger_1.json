He led a rear action against a Confederate supply train in the Battle of Glorieta Pass , and was then appointed a colonel of cavalry during the Colorado War . Chivington gained infamy for leading a 700-man force of Colorado Territory militia during the massacre at Sand Creek in November 1864 . An estimated 70-163 peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho - about two-thirds of whom were women , children , and infants - were killed and mutilated by his troops . Chivington and his men took scalps and other body parts as battle trophies , including human fetuses and male and female genitalia . The Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War conducted an investigation of the massacre , but while they condemned Chivington 's and his soldiers ' conduct in the strongest possible terms , no criminal charges were brought against him or them . The closest thing to a punishment Chivington suffered was the effective end of his political aspirations . Three years prior to Sand Creek , on August 2 , 1861 , he became the first Grand Master of Masons of Colorado . Several Freemasons , some of whom were present at the Sand Creek Massacre , objected to Chivington 's actions and publicly denounced them , while others supported him . Officially , the Masons in Colorado suspended Chivington until the report from Congress , after which his membership was reinstated .
