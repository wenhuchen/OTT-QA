The New York State Constitution standardized the names and functions of these statewide. [ where ? ] [ when ? ] The State is divided into boroughs , counties , cities , townships , called towns , and villages . ( The only boroughs , the five boroughs of New York City , except for the Bronx have the same boundaries as their predecessor counties . ) They are municipal corporations , chartered ( created ) by the New York State Legislature , under the New York State Constitution the only body that can create governmental units in the state . All of them have their own governments , sometimes with no paid employees , that provide local services . Centers of population that are not incorporated and have no government or local services are designated hamlets . Whether a municipality is defined as a borough , city , town , or village is determined not by population or land area , but rather on the form of government selected by the residents and approved by the New York Legislature . Each type of local government is granted specific home rule powers by the New York State Constitution . There are still occasional changes as a village becomes a city , or a village dissolves ( stops existing ) , each of which requires legislative action . New York also has various corporate entities that provide local services and have their own administrative structures ( governments ) , such as school and fire districts . These are not found in all counties .",

The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England . In 1997 , a Scottish Parliament was re-established , in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members , having authority over many areas of domestic policy .

Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world 's oldest cities , with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years and its earliest human presence started somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennium BC .

A center for the arts , learning and philosophy , home of Plato 's Academy and Aristotle 's Lyceum , it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy , largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent , and in particular the Romans .

In what is widely regarded as the greatest victory achieved by Napoleon , the Grande Arm\u00e9e of France defeated a larger Russian and Austrian army led by Emperor Alexander I and Holy Roman Emperor Francis II . The battle occurred near the town of Austerlitz in the Austrian Empire ( modern-day Slavkov u Brna in the Czech Republic ) . Austerlitz brought the War of the Third Coalition to a rapid end , with the Treaty of Pressburg signed by the Austrians later in the month . The battle is often cited as a tactical masterpiece , in the same league as other historic engagements like Cannae or Gaugamela . After eliminating an Austrian army during the Ulm Campaign , French forces seized Vienna in November 1805 . The Austrians avoided further conflict until the arrival of the Russians bolstered Allied numbers . Napoleon sent his army north in pursuit of the Allies , but then ordered his forces to retreat so he could feign a grave weakness . Desperate to lure the Allies into battle , Napoleon gave every indication in the days preceding the engagement that the French army was in a pitiful state , even abandoning the dominant Pratzen Heights near Austerlitz . He deployed the French army below the Pratzen Heights and deliberately weakened his right flank , enticing the Allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling up the whole French line . A forced march from Vienna by Marshal Davout and his III Corps plugged the gap left by Napoleon just in time . Meanwhile , the heavy Allied deployment against the French right weakened the allied center on the Pratzen Heights , which was viciously attacked by the IV Corps of Marshal Soult .",

The duchy was located in what is now northwestern Germany . Its name came from the two largest cities in the territory : Brunswick and L\u00fcneburg . The dukedom emerged in 1235 from the allodial lands of the House of Welf in Saxony and was granted as an imperial fief to Otto the Child , a grandson of Henry the Lion . The duchy was divided several times during the High Middle Ages amongst various lines of the House of Welf , but each ruler was styled Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg in addition to his own particular title . By 1692 , the territories had consolidated to two : the Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg ( Hanover ) and the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel . In 1714 , the Hanoverian branch of the family succeeded to the throne of Great Britain , which they would rule in personal union with Hanover until 1837 .

Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",
