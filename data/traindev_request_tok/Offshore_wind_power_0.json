  "/wiki/Project_commissioning": "Project commissioning is the process of assuring that all systems and components of a building or industrial plant are designed , installed , tested , operated , and maintained according to the operational requirements of the owner or final client . A commissioning process may be applied not only to new projects but also to existing units and systems subject to expansion , renovation or revamping . In practice , the commissioning process is the integrated application of a set of engineering techniques and procedures to check , inspect and test every operational component of the project : from individual functions ( such as instruments and equipment ) up to complex amalgamations ( such as modules , subsystems and systems ) . Commissioning activities in the broader sense are applicable to all phases of the project from the basic and detailed design , procurement , construction and assembly until the final handover of the unit to the owner , sometimes including an assisted operation phase .",
