  "/wiki/Battle_of_Wester_Kinghorn": "The Battle of Kinghorn , was a skirmish fought on 6 August 1332 at Wester Kinghorn ( now Burntisland ) , Fife , Scotland . A privately financed invasion fleet had sailed a week previously from several ports on the Humber estuary with the aim of pressing the claim of Edward Baliol to the Scottish throne . The invaders had begun their disembarkation when they were confronted by a force of Bruce loyalists led by Duncan , Earl of Fife and Robert Bruce , Lord of Liddesdale . The leaders of the defenders appear to have been confused and indecisive about tactics . When a body of men-at-arms suddenly charged towards the invaders they were cut down by longbow fire . Alexander Seton the younger was killed . On seeing this , the defending host then fled in disarray . Different chroniclers number the Scottish losses as 90 , 900 or 1,000 . The invaders were then able to resume their disembarkation unhindered before marching unopposed to Dunfermline .",

  "/wiki/Scotland": "Scotland ( Scots : Scotland , Scottish Gaelic : Alba [ \u02c8al\u032a\u02e0ap\u0259 ] ( listen ) ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain , with a border with England to the southeast , and is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west , the North Sea to the northeast , the Irish Sea to the south , and more than 790 islands , including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides . The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England . In 1997 , a Scottish Parliament was re-established , in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members , having authority over many areas of domestic policy . The head of the Scottish Government is the first minister of Scotland , who is supported by the deputy first minister of Scotland .",

  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_England": "The Kingdom of England ( Anglo-Norman : Realme d'Engleterre , French : Royaume d'Angleterre ) was a sovereign state on the island of Great Britain from 927 , when it emerged from various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms until 1707 , when it united with Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain . On 12 July 927 , the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were united by \u00c6thelstan ( r. 927-939 ) to form the Kingdom of England . In 1016 , the kingdom became part of the North Sea Empire of Cnut the Great , a personal union between England , Denmark and Norway . The Norman conquest of England in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at Winchester to Westminster , and the City of London quickly established itself as England 's largest and principal commercial centre . Histories of the kingdom of England from the Norman conquest of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties : Norman 1066-1154 , Plantagenet 1154-1485 , Tudor 1485-1603 and Stuart 1603-1707 ( interrupted by the Interregnum of 1649-1660 ) . Dynastically , all English monarchs after 1066 ultimately claim descent from the Normans ; the distinction of the Plantagenets is merely conventional , beginning with Henry II ( reigned 1154-1189 ) as from that time , the Angevin kings became more English in nature ; the houses of Lancaster and York are both Plantagenet cadet branches , the Tudor dynasty claimed descent from Edward III via John Beaufort and James VI and I of the House of Stuart claimed descent from Henry VII via Margaret Tudor . The completion of the conquest of Wales by Edward I in 1284 put Wales under the control of the English crown . Edward III ( reigned 1327-1377 ) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe ; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and government - in particular the evolution of the English parliament . From the 1340s the kings of England also laid claim to the crown of France , but after the Hundred Years ' War and the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in 1455 , the English were no longer in any position to pursue their French claims and lost all their land on the continent , except for Calais . After the turmoils of the Wars of the Roses , the Tudor dynasty ruled during the English Renaissance and again extended English monarchical power beyond England proper , achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542 . Henry VIII oversaw the English Reformation , and his daughter Elizabeth I ( reigned 1558-1603 ) the Elizabethan Religious Settlement , meanwhile establishing England as a great power and laying the foundations of the British Empire by claiming possessions in the New World . From the accession of James VI and I in 1603 , the Stuart dynasty ruled England in personal union with Scotland and Ireland .",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Neville's_Cross": "The Battle of Neville 's Cross took place during the Second War of Scottish Independence on 17 October 1346 , half a mile ( 800 m ) to the west of Durham , England . An invading Scottish army of 12,000 led by King David II was defeated with heavy loss by an English army of approximately 6,000-7,000 men led by Ralph Neville , Lord Neville . The battle was named after an Anglo-Saxon stone cross that stood on the hill where the Scots made their stand . After the victory , Neville paid to have a new cross erected to commemorate the day . The battle was the result of the invasion of France by England during the Hundred Years ' War . King Philip VI of France ( r. 1328-1350 ) called on the Scots to fulfil their obligation under the terms of the Auld Alliance and invade England . David II obliged , and after ravaging much of northern England was taken by surprise by the English defenders . The ensuing battle ended with the rout of the Scots , the capture of their king and the death or capture of most of their leadership . Strategically this freed significant English resources for the war against France , and the English border counties were able to guard against the remaining Scottish threat from their own resources . The eventual ransoming of the Scottish king resulted in a truce that brought peace to the border for forty years .",

The historic county 's boundaries stretch between the rivers Tyne and Tees , thus including places such as Gateshead , Jarrow , South Shields and Sunderland , but do not include the part of the modern county south of the Tees . During the Middle Ages , the county was an ecclesiastical centre , due largely to the presence of St Cuthbert 's shrine in Durham Cathedral , and the extensive powers granted to the Bishop of Durham as ruler of the County Palatine of Durham . The county has a mixture of mining , farming and heavy railway heritage , with the latter especially noteworthy in the southeast of the county , in Darlington , Shildon and Stockton .
