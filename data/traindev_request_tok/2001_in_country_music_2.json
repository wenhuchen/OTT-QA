He popularized the instrument across several genres of music . Scruggs ' career began at age 21 when he was hired to play in Bill Monroe 's band , The Blue Grass Boys .

Despite considerable success with Monroe , performing on the Grand Ole Opry and recording classic hits like Blue Moon of Kentucky , Scruggs resigned from the group in 1946 due to their exhausting touring schedule . Fellow band member Lester Flatt resigned as well , and he and Scruggs later paired up in a new group they called Flatt and Scruggs and the Foggy Mountain Boys . Scruggs ' banjo instrumental called Foggy Mountain Breakdown , released in 1949 , became an enduring hit , and had a rebirth of popularity to a younger generation when it was featured in the 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde . The song won two Grammy Awards and , in 2005 , was selected for the Library of Congress ' National Recording Registry of works of unusual merit .
