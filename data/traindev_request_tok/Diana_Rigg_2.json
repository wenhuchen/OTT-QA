  "/wiki/The_Caucasian_Chalk_Circle": "The Caucasian Chalk Circle ( German : Der kaukasische Kreidekreis ) is a play by the German modernist playwright Bertolt Brecht . An example of Brecht 's epic theatre , the play is a parable about a peasant girl who rescues a baby and becomes a better mother than its wealthy natural parents . The play was written in 1944 while Brecht was living in the United States . It was translated into English by Brecht 's friend and admirer Eric Bentley and its world premiere was a student production at Carleton College , Northfield , Minnesota , in 1948 . Its first professional production was at the Hedgerow Theatre , Philadelphia , directed by Bentley . Its German premiere by the Berliner Ensemble was on October 7 , 1954 , at the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm in Berlin . The Caucasian Chalk Circle is one of Brecht 's most celebrated works and one of the most regularly performed 'German ' plays .

  "/wiki/King_Lear": "King Lear is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare . It tells the tale of a king who bequeaths his power and land to two of his three daughters , after they declare their love for him in an extremely fawning and obsequious manner . His third daughter gets nothing , because she will not flatter him as her sisters had done . When he feels disrespected by the two daughters who now have his wealth and power , he becomes furious to the point of madness . He eventually becomes tenderly reconciled to his third daughter , just before tragedy strikes her and then the king . Derived from the legend of Leir of Britain , a mythological pre-Roman Celtic king , the play has been widely adapted for the stage and motion pictures , with the title role coveted by many of the world 's most accomplished actors . The first attribution to Shakespeare of this play , originally drafted in 1605 or 1606 at the latest with its first known performance on St. Stephen 's Day in 1606 , was a 1608 publication in a quarto of uncertain provenance , in which the play is listed as a history ; it may be an early draft or simply reflect the first performance text . The Tragedy of King Lear , a revised version that is better tailored for performance , was included in the 1623 First Folio . Modern editors usually conflate the two , though some insist that each version has its own individual integrity that should be preserved . After the English Restoration , the play was often revised with a happy ending for audiences who disliked its dark and depressing tone , but since the 19th century Shakespeare 's original version has been regarded as one of his supreme achievements . The tragedy is noted for its probing observations on the nature of human suffering and kinship . George Bernard Shaw wrote No man will ever write a better tragedy than Lear .",

  "/wiki/Macbeth": "Macbeth ( /m\u0259k\u02c8b\u025b\u03b8/ ; full title The Tragedy of Macbeth ) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare ; it is thought to have been first performed in 1606 . [ a ] It dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake . Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I , who was patron of Shakespeare 's acting company , Macbeth most clearly reflects the playwright 's relationship with his sovereign . It was first published in the Folio of 1623 , possibly from a prompt book , and is Shakespeare 's shortest tragedy . A brave Scottish general named Macbeth receives a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland . Consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife , Macbeth murders King Duncan and takes the Scottish throne for himself . He is then wracked with guilt and paranoia . Forced to commit more and more murders to protect himself from enmity and suspicion , he soon becomes a tyrannical ruler . The bloodbath and consequent civil war swiftly take Macbeth and Lady Macbeth into the realms of madness and death . Shakespeare 's source for the story is the account of Macbeth , King of Scotland , Macduff , and Duncan in Holinshed 's Chronicles ( 1587 ) , a history of England , Scotland , and Ireland familiar to Shakespeare and his contemporaries , although the events in the play differ extensively from the history of the real Macbeth . The events of the tragedy are usually associated with the execution of Henry Garnet for complicity in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 . In the backstage world of theatre , some believe that the play is cursed , and will not mention its title aloud , referring to it instead as The Scottish Play .",
  "/wiki/Old_Vic_Theatre": "The Old Vic is a 1,000-seat , not-for-profit producing theatre , located just south-east of Waterloo station on the corner of the Cut and Waterloo Road in Lambeth , London , England . Established in 1818 as the Royal Coburg Theatre , and renamed in 1833 the Royal Victoria Theatre , in 1871 it was rebuilt and reopened as the Royal Victoria Palace . It was taken over by Emma Cons in 1880 and formally named the Royal Victoria Hall , although by that time it was already known as the Old Vic . In 1898 , a niece of Cons ' , Lilian Baylis , assumed management and began a series of Shakespeare productions in 1914 . The building was damaged in 1940 during air raids and it became a Grade II* listed building in 1951 after it reopened . The Old Vic is the crucible of many of the performing arts companies and theatres in London today . It was the name of a repertory company that was based at the theatre and formed ( along with the Chichester Festival Theatre ) the core of the National Theatre of Great Britain on its formation in 1963 , under Laurence Olivier . The National Theatre remained at the Old Vic until new premises were constructed on the South Bank , opening in 1976 . The Old Vic then became the home of Prospect Theatre Company , at that time a highly successful touring company which staged such acclaimed productions as Derek Jacobi 's Hamlet . However , with the withdrawal of funding for the company by the Arts Council of Great Britain in 1980 for breaching its touring obligations , Prospect disbanded in 1981 . The theatre underwent complete refurbishment in 1985 . In 2003 , Kevin Spacey was appointed artistic director , which received considerable media attention .",
  "/wiki/Jumpers": "Jumpers is a play by Tom Stoppard which was first performed in 1972 . It explores and satirises the field of academic philosophy , likening it to a less-than skilful competitive gymnastics display . Jumpers raises questions such as What do we know ? and Where do values come from ? It is set in an alternative reality where some British astronauts have landed on the moon and Radical Liberals ( read pragmatists and relativists ) have taken over the British government ( the play seems to suggest that pragmatists and relativists would be immoral : Archie says that murder is not wrong , merely antisocial ) . It was inspired by the notion that a manned moon landing would ruin the moon as a poetic trope and possibly lead to a collapse of moral values . It is often listed among Stoppards strongest plays .",
  "/wiki/The_Misanthrope": "The Misanthrope , or the Cantankerous Lover ( French : Le Misanthrope ou l'Atrabilaire amoureux ; French pronunciation : \u200b [ l\u0259 miz\u0251\u0303t\u0281\u0254p u lat\u0281abil\u025b\u02d0\u0281 amu\u0281\u00f8 ] ) is a 17th-century comedy of manners in verse written by Moli\u00e8re . It was first performed on 4 June 1666 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Palais-Royal , Paris by the King 's Players . The play satirizes the hypocrisies of French aristocratic society , but it also engages a more serious tone when pointing out the flaws that all humans possess . The play differs from other farces at the time by employing dynamic characters like Alceste and C\u00e9lim\u00e8ne as opposed to the traditionally flat characters used by most satirists to criticize problems in society . It also differs from most of Moli\u00e8re 's other works by focusing more on character development and nuances than on plot progression . The play , though not a commercial success in its time , survives as Moli\u00e8re 's best known work today . Because both Tartuffe and Don Juan , two of Moli\u00e8re 's previous plays , had already been banned by the French government , Moli\u00e8re may have subdued his actual ideas to make his play more socially acceptable . As a result , there is much uncertainty about whether the main character , Alceste , is supposed to be perceived as a hero for his strong standards of honesty or whether he is supposed to be perceived as a fool for having such idealistic and unrealistic views about society . Moli\u00e8re has received much criticism for The Misanthrope . The French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau claimed in his Letter to M. D'Alembert on Spectacles that it was Moli\u00e8re 's best work but hated the fact that Alceste was depicted as a fool onstage . He believed that the audience should be supporting Alceste and his views about society rather than disregarding his idealistic notions and belittling him as a character .",
  "/wiki/Pygmalion_(play)": "Pygmalion is a play by George Bernard Shaw , named after a Greek mythological figure . It was first presented on stage to the public in 1913 . In ancient Greek mythology , Pygmalion fell in love with one of his sculptures , which then came to life . The general idea of that myth was a popular subject for Victorian era English playwrights , including one of Shaw 's influences , W. S. Gilbert , who wrote a successful play based on the story called Pygmalion and Galatea that was first presented in 1871 . Shaw would also have been familiar with the burlesque version , Galatea , or Pygmalion Reversed . Shaw 's play has been adapted numerous times , most notably as the musical My Fair Lady and its film version . Shaw mentioned that the character of Professor Henry Higgins was inspired by several British professors of phonetics : Alexander Melville Bell , Alexander J.

  "/wiki/Night_and_Day_(play)": "Night and Day is a 1978 play by Tom Stoppard . The sets and costumes were designed by Carl Toms and it ran for two years at the Phoenix Theatre in central London , UK . The lead roles of Richard Wagner and Ruth Carson were created by John Thaw and Diana Rigg , respectively . The play is post-colonial in nature , a satire on the British news media , and an exploration of its discourse . Stoppard employs yet another sub-text in Night and Day by commenting on the very form of language through his remarks on journalism ( Stoppard is a former journalist himself ) . There is a consistent use of pun and innuendo sprinkled in the dialogues of each character . This kind of linguistic play with words and meaning , has marked the playwright for his interest and most keen observations on the aesthetics of language . Night and Day throws up themes of colonization , journalism , language , and alternate or multiple realities . The plot narrative unfolds through the silent or subconscious thoughts of Ruth Carson , who is a by-stander to the main events taking place around her . She is regularly shown to express conflicting ideas between what she is saying , and what she is actually thinking . The narrative technique merges the forms of fiction and non-fiction , where Stoppard has created an imaginary country called Kambawi , located in Africa , and situated in a post-colonial timespace . The story of the play unveils the politics under which the British media approach the coverage of the impending internal war in this country , through the paradigms of objectivity , factual reportage and the inevitable realities of linguistic manipulation and double meaning .",

  "/wiki/Antony_and_Cleopatra": "Antony and Cleopatra ( First Folio title : The Tragedie of Anthonie , and Cleopatra ) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare . The play was first performed , by the King 's Men , at either the Blackfriars Theatre or the Globe Theatre in around 1607 ; its first appearance in print was in the Folio of 1623 . The plot is based on Thomas North 's 1579 English translation of Plutarch 's Lives ( in Ancient Greek ) and follows the relationship between Cleopatra and Mark Antony from the time of the Sicilian revolt to Cleopatra 's suicide during the Final War of the Roman Republic . The major antagonist is Octavius Caesar , one of Antony 's fellow triumvirs of the Second Triumvirate and the first emperor of the Roman Empire . The tragedy is mainly set in the Roman Republic and Ptolemaic Egypt and is characterized by swift shifts in geographical location and linguistic register as it alternates between sensual , imaginative Alexandria and a more pragmatic , austere Rome . Many consider Shakespeare 's Cleopatra , whom Enobarbus describes as having infinite variety , as one of the most complex and fully developed female characters in the playwright 's body of work . : p.45 She is frequently vain and histrionic enough to provoke an audience almost to scorn ; at the same time , Shakespeare invests her and Antony with tragic grandeur . These contradictory features have led to famously divided critical responses . It is difficult to classify Antony and Cleopatra as belonging to a single genre . It can be described as a history play ( though it does not completely adhere to historical accounts ) , as a tragedy ( though not completely in Aristotelian terms ) , as a comedy , as a romance , and according to some critics , such as McCarter , a problem play . All that can be said with certainty is that it is a Roman play , and perhaps even a sequel to another of Shakespeare 's tragedies , Julius Caesar .",

[ note 5 ] As a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty , she was a descendant of its founder Ptolemy I Soter , a Macedonian Greek general and companion of Alexander the Great . [ note 6 ] After the death of Cleopatra , Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire , marking the end of the Hellenistic period that had lasted since the reign of Alexander ( 336-323 BC ) . [ note 7 ] Her native language was Koine Greek , and she was the first Ptolemaic ruler to learn the Egyptian language . [ note 8 ] In 58 BC , Cleopatra presumably accompanied her father Ptolemy XII during his exile to Rome after a revolt in Egypt , a Roman client state , allowed his daughter Berenice IV to claim the throne . Berenice was killed in 55 BC when the king returned to Egypt with Roman military assistance . When he died in 51 BC , the joint reign of Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy XIII began . A falling-out between them led to open civil war . After losing the 48 BC Battle of Pharsalus in Greece against his rival Julius Caesar ( a Roman dictator and consul ) in Caesar 's Civil War , the Roman statesman Pompey fled to Egypt , where Ptolemy had him killed while Caesar occupied Alexandria . Caesar had attempted to reconcile the siblings , but Ptolemy 's chief adviser Potheinos viewed Caesar 's terms as favoring Cleopatra , so his forces besieged her and Caesar at the palace . Shortly after the siege was lifted by reinforcements , Ptolemy died in the 47 BC Battle of the Nile . His sister Arsinoe IV was eventually exiled to Ephesus for her role in carrying out the siege .",

  "/wiki/Follies": "Follies is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book by James Goldman . The story concerns a reunion in a crumbling Broadway theatre , scheduled for demolition , of the past performers of the Weismann 's Follies , a musical revue ( based on the Ziegfeld Follies ) , that played in that theatre between the World Wars . It focuses on two couples , Buddy and Sally Durant Plummer and Benjamin and Phyllis Rogers Stone , who are attending the reunion . Sally and Phyllis were showgirls in the Follies . Both couples are deeply unhappy with their marriages . Buddy , a traveling salesman , is having an affair with a girl on the road ; Sally is still as much in love with Ben as she was years ago ; and Ben is so self-absorbed that Phyllis feels emotionally abandoned . Several of the former showgirls perform their old numbers , sometimes accompanied by the ghosts of their former selves . The musical numbers in the show have been interpreted as pastiches of the styles of the leading Broadway composers of the 1920s and '30s , and sometimes as parodies of specific songs . The Broadway production opened on April 4 , 1971 , directed by Harold Prince and Michael Bennett , and with choreography by Bennett . The musical was nominated for eleven Tony Awards and won seven . The original production , the second-most costly performed on Broadway to that date , ran for over 500 performances but ultimately lost its entire investment .
