Founded in 1847 , and formerly self-styled as the World 's Greatest Newspaper ( a slogan for which WGN radio and television are named ) , it remains the most-read daily newspaper of the Chicago metropolitan area and the Great Lakes region . It had the 6th highest circulation for American newspapers in 2017 . In the 1850s , under Joseph Medill , the Chicago Tribune became closely associated with Illinois ' favorite son , Abraham Lincoln , and with the Republican Party . In the 20th century under Medill 's grandson , Robert R. McCormick , it achieved a reputation as a crusading paper with a decidedly American conservative anti-New Deal outlook , and its writing reached other markets through family and corporate relationships at the New York Daily News and the Washington Times-Herald . The 1960s saw its corporate parent owner , Tribune Company , reach into new markets . In 2008 , for the first time in its over century-and-a-half history , its editorial page endorsed a Democrat , Illinoisan Barack Obama , for U.S. president . Originally published solely as a broadsheet , on January 13 , 2009 , the Tribune announced it would continue publishing as a broadsheet for home delivery , but would publish in tabloid format for newsstand , news box , and commuter station sales . This change , however , proved to be unpopular with readers and in August 2011 , the Tribune discontinued the tabloid edition , returning to its established broadsheet format through all distribution channels . In December 2019 , Alden Global Capital , a New York City-based hedge fund , acquired a 32% stake in shares of Tribune Publishing Company . The Tribune 's masthead displays the American flag , in reference to the paper 's former motto , An American Paper for Americans . The motto is no longer displayed on the masthead , where it was placed below the flag .",

The tribe 's name ( natively kk\u0105 : ze ) is often said to mean people of the ( south ) wind although this was probably not the term 's original meaning . For thousands of years , what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes . Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys . Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison . Kansas was first settled by Americans in 1827 with the establishment of Fort Leavenworth . The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s , in the midst of political wars over the slavery debate . When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the Kansas-Nebraska Act , abolitionist Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a free state or a slave state . Thus , the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided , and was known as Bleeding Kansas .",

  "/wiki/Maryland": "Maryland ( US : /\u02c8m\u025br\u0259l\u0259nd/ ( listen ) MERR-\u0259-l\u0259nd ) [ a ] is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the eastern United States , bordering Virginia , West Virginia , and the District of Columbia to its south and west ; Pennsylvania to its north ; and Delaware and the Atlantic Ocean to its east . The state 's largest city is Baltimore , and its capital is Annapolis . Among its occasional nicknames are Old Line State , the Free State , and the Chesapeake Bay State . It is named after the English queen Henrietta Maria , known in England as Queen Mary , who was the wife of King Charles I. Sixteen of Maryland 's twenty-three counties , as well as the city of Baltimore , border the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay estuary and its many tributaries , which combined total more than 4,000 miles of shoreline . Although one of the smallest states in the U.S. , it features a variety of climates and topographical features that have earned it the moniker of America in Miniature . In a similar vein , Maryland 's geography , culture , and history combine elements of the Mid-Atlantic , Northeastern , and South Atlantic regions of the country . Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century , Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans , mostly by the Algonquin , and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux . As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain , Maryland was founded by George Calvert , a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England . In 1632 , Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter , naming the colony after his wife , Queen Mary ( Henrietta Maria of France ) . Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans , who rejected Catholicism in their settlements , Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration . Accordingly , in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion , which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation . Nevertheless , religious strife was common in the early years , and Catholics remained a minority , albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony .",
