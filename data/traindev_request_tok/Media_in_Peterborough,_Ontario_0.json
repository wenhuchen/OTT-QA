  "/wiki/Christianity": "Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth . Its adherents , known as Christians , believe that Jesus is the Christ , whose coming as the messiah was prophesied in the Hebrew Bible , called the Old Testament in Christianity , and chronicled in the New Testament . It is the world 's largest religion with about 2.4 billion followers . Christianity began as a Second Temple Judaic sect in the 1st century in the Roman province of Judea . Jesus ' apostles and their followers spread around Syria , the Levant , Europe , Anatolia , Mesopotamia , Transcaucasia , Egypt , and Ethiopia , despite initial persecution . It soon attracted gentile God-fearers , which led to a departure from Jewish customs , and , after the Fall of Jerusalem , AD 70 which ended the Temple-based Judaism , Christianity slowly separated from Judaism . Emperor Constantine the Great converted to Christianity before his death ( 337 ) , and was baptized by bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia ; Constantine decriminalized Christianity in the Roman Empire by the Edict of Milan ( 313 ) , later convening the Council of Nicaea ( 325 ) where Early Christianity was consolidated into what would become the State church of the Roman Empire ( 380 ) . The early history of Christianity 's united church before major schisms is sometimes referred to as the Great Church . The Church of the East split after the Council of Ephesus ( 431 ) and Oriental Orthodoxy split after the Council of Chalcedon ( 451 ) over differences in Christology , while the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church separated in the East-West Schism ( 1054 ) , especially over the authority of the bishop of Rome . Similarly , Protestantism split in numerous denominations from the Latin Catholic Church in the Reformation era ( 16th century ) over theological and ecclesiological disputes , most predominantly on the issue of justification and the primacy of the bishop of Rome . Following the Age of Discovery ( 15th-17th century ) , Christianity was spread into the Americas , Oceania , sub-Saharan Africa , and the rest of the world via missionary work . Christianity remains culturally diverse in its Western and Eastern branches , as well as in its doctrines concerning justification and the nature of salvation , ecclesiology , ordination , and Christology .",
  "/wiki/Talk_radio": "Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues and consisting entirely or almost entirely of original spoken word content rather than outside music . Most shows are regularly hosted by a single individual , and often feature interviews with a number of different guests . Talk radio typically includes an element of listener participation , usually by broadcasting live conversations between the host and listeners who call in ( usually via telephone ) to the show . Listener contributions are usually screened by a show 's producers in order to maximize audience interest and , in the case of commercial talk radio , to attract advertisers . Generally , the shows are organized into segments , each separated by a pause for advertisements ; however , in public or non-commercial radio , music is sometimes played in place of commercials to separate the program segments . Variations of talk radio include conservative talk , hot talk , liberal talk ( increasingly known as progressive talk ) and sports talk . While talk radio has historically been associated with broadcast radio , starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of live Internet website streaming and podcasts . Now , it is possible for an individual to use a variety of services to host an Internet-based talk-radio show without carriage by a traditional radio station . In addition , TV programming from talk and news outlets such as BBC , CNN , Bloomberg and Fox is now often available expanding the world of talk radio further . Talk radio listening is enjoyed not only on radios , but a wide variety of other devices and services including PCs using iTunes , station directories such as TuneIn , show directory smartphones with apps such as Stitcher and time-shifting services like DAR.fm .",

Barrie is situated approximately 86.6 kilometres ( 53.8 mi ) from the Toronto Pearson International Airport and 109 kilometres ( 68 mi ) from Downtown Toronto , representing the city 's highly centralized and historically strategic geographical orientation and its ease of access to major centres and airports across the region . The Barrie area was first settled during the War of 1812 as a key supply depot for British forces . It would be named twenty years later for Sir Robert Barrie , who consistently commanded forces through the region . Throughout the 1980s and 1990s , Barrie 's emergence as a bedroom community for the city of Toronto grew in prominence , and its economy would be wrapped around the education , healthcare , information technology and service sectors .

  "/wiki/Adult_contemporary_music": "In North American music , adult contemporary music ( AC ) is a form of radio-played popular music , ranging from 1960s vocal and 1970s soft rock music to predominantly ballad-heavy music of the present day , with varying degrees of easy listening , pop , soul , rhythm and blues , quiet storm , and rock influence . Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music . Adult contemporary tends to have lush , soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated . It is usually melodic enough to get a listener 's attention , and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music . Like most of pop music , its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse-chorus structure . The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments ( though bass guitar is usually used ) such as acoustic guitars , pianos , saxophones , and sometimes an orchestral set . The electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched . However , recent adult contemporary music may feature synthesizers ( and other electronics , such as drum machines ) . An AC radio station may play mainstream music , but it excludes hip hop , dance tracks , hard rock , and some forms of teen pop , as these are less popular among adults , the target demographic . AC radio often targets the 25-44 age group , the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s . A common practice in recent years of adult contemporary stations is to play less newer music and more hits of the past . This de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart .",

Only the provinces of Quebec and Ontario are served by more than one Premi\u00e8re originating station . In all other provinces , the whole province is served by a single station with multiple transmitters . The network does , however , reach 90 percent of all Canadian francophones . Each originating station outside Montreal airs a national schedule , taken from flagship station CBF-FM , complete with opted-out local/regional shows at peak times , depending on each market . News bulletins are aired live , irrespective of location . The network may broadcast on either the AM or FM bands , depending on the market . A national version is available across North America on Sirius XM Canada channel 170 . Premi\u00e8re was available in Europe , North Africa and the Middle East live via the Hot Bird satellite .

  "/wiki/French_language": "French ( le fran\u00e7ais [ l\u0259 f\u0281\u0251\u0303s\u025b ] or la langue fran\u00e7aise [ la l\u0251\u0303\u0261 f\u0281\u0251\u0303s\u025b\u02d0z ] ) is a Romance language of the Indo-European family . It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire , as did all Romance languages . French evolved from Gallo-Romance , the spoken Latin in Gaul , and more specifically in Northern Gaul . Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders . Today , owing to France 's past overseas expansion , there are numerous French-based creole languages , most notably Haitian Creole . A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French . French is an official language in 29 countries across multiple continents , most of which are members of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie ( OIF ) , the community of 84 countries which share the official use or teaching of French . It is spoken as a first language ( in descending order of the number of speakers ) in France , the Canadian provinces of Quebec , Ontario and New Brunswick as well as other Francophone regions , Belgium ( Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region ) , western Switzerland ( cantons of Bern , Fribourg , Geneva , Jura , Neuch\u00e2tel , Vaud , Valais ) , Monaco , partly in Luxembourg , the states of Louisiana , Maine , New Hampshire and Vermont in the United States , and in northwestern Italy ( region of Aosta Valley ) , and by various communities elsewhere . In 2015 , approximately 40% of the francophone population ( including L2 and partial speakers ) lived in Europe , 35% in sub-Saharan Africa , 15% in North Africa and the Middle East , 8% in the Americas , and 1% in Asia and Oceania . French is the fourth most widely spoken mother tongue in the European Union . Of Europeans who speak other languages natively , approximately one-fifth are able to speak French as a second language .",

  "/wiki/Classic_rock": "Classic rock is a radio format which developed from the album-oriented rock ( AOR ) format in the early 1980s . In the United States , the classic rock format features rock music ranging generally from the mid-1960s to the 1980s , primarily focusing on commercially successful blues rock and hard rock popularized in the 1970s AOR format . The radio format became increasingly popular with the baby boomer demographic by the end of the 1990s . Although classic rock has mostly appealed to adult listeners , music associated with this format received more exposure with younger generations of listeners with the presence of the Internet and digital downloading . Some classic rock stations also play a limited number of current releases which are stylistically consistent with the station 's sound , or by heritage acts that are still active and producing new music . Conceptually , classic rock has been analyzed by academics as an effort by critics , media , and music establishments to canonize rock music and commodify 1960s Western culture for audiences living in a post-baby boomer economy . The music predominantly selected for the format has been identified as commercially successful songs by white male acts from the Anglosphere , expressing values of Romanticism , self-aggrandizement , and politically undemanding ideologies ."
