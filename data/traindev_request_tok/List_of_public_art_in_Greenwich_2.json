  "/wiki/George_II_of_Great_Britain": "George II ( George Augustus ; German : Georg II . August ; 30 October / 9 November 1683O.S./N.S . - 25 October 1760 ) was King of Great Britain and Ireland , Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg ( Hanover ) and a prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire from 11 June 1727 ( O.S . ) until his death in 1760 . George is the most recent British monarch born outside Great Britain : he was born and brought up in northern Germany . The Act of Settlement 1701 and the Acts of Union 1707 positioned his grandmother , Sophia of Hanover , and her Protestant descendants to inherit the British throne . After the deaths of Sophia and Anne , Queen of Great Britain , in 1714 , his father , the Elector of Hanover , became George I of Great Britain . In the first years of his father 's reign as king , George was associated with opposition politicians , until they rejoined the governing party in 1720 . As king from 1727 , George exercised little control over British domestic policy , which was largely controlled by the Parliament of Great Britain . As elector , he spent twelve summers in Hanover , where he had more direct control over government policy . He had a difficult relationship with his eldest son , Frederick , who supported the parliamentary opposition . During the War of the Austrian Succession , George participated at the Battle of Dettingen in 1743 , and thus became the last British monarch to lead an army in battle .",

  "/wiki/Horatio_Nelson,_1st_Viscount_Nelson": "Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson , 1st Viscount Nelson , 1st Duke of Bront\u00e9 , KB ( 29 September 1758 - 21 October 1805 ) was a British flag officer in the Royal Navy . His inspirational leadership , grasp of strategy , and unconventional tactics brought about a number of decisive British naval victories , particularly during the Napoleonic Wars . He was wounded in combat , losing sight in one eye in Corsica at the age of 36 , and most of one arm in the unsuccessful attempt to conquer Santa Cruz de Tenerife when he was 40 . He was fatally shot during his victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 . Nelson was born into a moderately prosperous Norfolk family and joined the navy through the influence of his uncle , Maurice Suckling , a high-ranking naval officer . Nelson rose rapidly through the ranks and served with leading naval commanders of the period before obtaining his own command at the age of 20 in 1778 . He developed a reputation for personal valour and firm grasp of tactics , but suffered periods of illness and unemployment after the end of the American War of Independence . The outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars allowed Nelson to return to service , where he was particularly active in the Mediterranean . He fought in several minor engagements off Toulon and was important in the capture of Corsica and subsequent diplomatic duties with the Italian states . In 1797 , he distinguished himself while in command of HMS Captain at the Battle of Cape St Vincent . Shortly after that battle , Nelson took part in the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife , where the attack was defeated and he was badly wounded , losing his right arm , and was forced to return to England to recuperate . The following year he won a decisive victory over the French at the Battle of the Nile and remained in the Mediterranean to support the Kingdom of Naples against a French invasion .",

  "/wiki/Queen's_House": "Queen 's House is a former royal residence built between 1616 and 1635 in Greenwich , a few miles down-river from the then City of London and now a London Borough . Its architect was Inigo Jones , for whom it was a crucial early commission , for Anne of Denmark , the queen of King James I . Queen 's House is one of the most important buildings in British architectural history , being the first consciously classical building to have been constructed in the country . It was Jones 's first major commission after returning from his 1613-1615 grand tour of Roman , Renaissance , and Palladian architecture in Italy . Some earlier English buildings , such as Longleat and Burghley House , had made borrowings from the classical style , but these were restricted to small details not applied in a systematic way , or the building may be a mix of different styles . Furthermore , the form of these buildings was not informed by an understanding of classical precedents . Queen 's House would have appeared revolutionary to English eyes in its day . Jones is credited with the introduction of Palladianism with the construction of Queen 's House , although it diverges from the mathematical constraints of Palladio , and it is likely that the immediate precedent for the H-shaped plan straddling a road is the Villa Medici at Poggio a Caiano by Giuliano da Sangallo . Today the building is both a Grade I listed building and a scheduled ancient monument , a status that includes the 115-foot-wide ( 35 m ) , axial vista to the River Thames . The house now forms part of the National Maritime Museum and is used to display parts of their substantial collection of maritime paintings and portraits . It was used as a VIP centre during the 2012 Olympic Games .",

The third son of George III , William succeeded his elder brother George IV , becoming the last king and penultimate monarch of Britain 's House of Hanover . William served in the Royal Navy in his youth , spending time in North America and the Caribbean , and was later nicknamed the Sailor King . In 1789 , he was created Duke of Clarence and St Andrews . In 1827 , he was appointed as Britain 's first Lord High Admiral since 1709 . As his two older brothers died without leaving legitimate issue , he inherited the throne when he was 64 years old . His reign saw several reforms : the poor law was updated , child labour restricted , slavery abolished in nearly all of the British Empire , and the British electoral system refashioned by the Reform Act 1832 . Although William did not engage in politics as much as his brother or his father , he was the last monarch to appoint a British prime minister contrary to the will of Parliament . He granted his German kingdom a short-lived liberal constitution . At the time of his death , William had no surviving legitimate children , but he was survived by eight of the ten illegitimate children he had by the actress Dorothea Jordan , with whom he cohabited for twenty years . Late in life , he married and apparently remained faithful to the young princess who would become Queen Adelaide .

  "/wiki/Invasion_of_Waikato": "The Invasion of the Waikato was the biggest and most important campaign of the 19th century New Zealand Wars , fought in the North Island of New Zealand between the military forces of the colonial government and a federation of M\u0101ori tribes known as the Kingitanga Movement . The Waikato is a territorial region with a northern boundary somewhat south of the city of Auckland . Hostilities lasted for nine months , from July 1863 to April 1864 . The invasion was aimed at crushing Kingite power , which was seen as a threat to British authority , and also at driving Waikato M\u0101ori from their territory in readiness for occupation and settlement by Europeans . The campaign was fought by a peak of about 14,000 Imperial and colonial troops and about 4,000 M\u0101ori warriors drawn from more than half the major North Island tribal groups . Plans for the invasion were drawn up at the close of the First Taranaki War in 1861 but were opposed by the Colonial Office and New Zealand General Assembly and suspended by incoming Governor Sir George Grey in December of that year . Grey reactivated the invasion plans in June 1863 amid mounting tension between Kingites and the colonial government and fears of a violent raid on Auckland by Kingite M\u0101ori . Grey used as the trigger for the invasion Kingite rejection of his ultimatum on 9 July 1863 that all M\u0101ori living between Auckland and the Waikato take an oath of allegiance to Queen Victoria or be expelled south of the Waikato River . Troops crossed into Waikato territory three days later and launched their first attack on 17 July at Koheroa , but were unable to advance for another 14 weeks . The subsequent war included the Battle of Rangiriri - which cost both sides more men than any other engagement of the New Zealand Wars - and the three-day-long Battle of \u014cr\u0101kau , probably the best-known engagement of the New Zealand Wars and which inspired two films called Rewi 's Last Stand . The campaign ended with the retreat of the Kingitanga M\u0101ori into the rugged interior of the North Island and the confiscation of about 12,000 km2 of M\u0101ori land . The defeat and confiscations left the King Movement tribes with a legacy of poverty and bitterness that was partly assuaged in 1995 when the government conceded that the 1863 invasion and confiscation was wrongful and apologised for its actions .",
  "/wiki/James_Wolfe": "James Wolfe ( 2 January 1727 - 13 September 1759 ) was a British Army officer known for his training reforms and remembered chiefly for his victory in 1759 over the French at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in Quebec as a major general . The son of a distinguished general , Edward Wolfe , he received his first commission at a young age and saw extensive service in Europe where he fought during the War of the Austrian Succession . His service in Flanders and in Scotland , where he took part in the suppression of the Jacobite Rebellion , brought him to the attention of his superiors . The advancement of his career was halted by the Peace Treaty of 1748 and he spent much of the next eight years on garrison duty in the Scottish Highlands . Already a brigade major at the age of 18 , he was a lieutenant-colonel by 23 . The outbreak of the Seven Years ' War in 1756 offered Wolfe fresh opportunities for advancement . His part in the aborted raid on Rochefort in 1757 led William Pitt to appoint him second-in-command of an expedition to capture the Fortress of Louisbourg . Following the success of the Siege of Louisbourg he was made commander of a force which sailed up the Saint Lawrence River to capture Quebec City . After a long siege Wolfe defeated a French force under the Marquis de Montcalm , allowing British forces to capture the city . Wolfe was killed at the height of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham due to injuries from three musket balls . Wolfe 's part in the taking of Quebec in 1759 earned him lasting fame , and he became an icon of Britain 's victory in the Seven Years ' War and subsequent territorial expansion . He was depicted in the painting The Death of General Wolfe , which became famous around the world .",

  "/wiki/Large_Standing_Figure_(Knife_Edge)": "Standing Figure : Knife Edge is a bronze sculpture by the English artist Henry Moore . It was cast in two full-size versions : Standing Figure : Knife Edge ( LH 482 ) in 1961 , and a larger Large Standing Figure : Knife Edge ( LH 482a ) in 1976 . The sculpture also is sometimes known as Standing Figure ( Bone ) or Winged Figure . Moore first conceived the work in 1961 . It is based on a fragment of a bird 's breastbone , to which a base and a head were added with plasticine . A rounded protrusion forms the head , and the figure has a diagonal line at its waist . The resulting composition resembles a human torso , similar to the Winged Victory of Samothrace . It had been described as the end point of Moore 's investigation of upright figures , which started with Standing Figure ( 1950 ) ( LH 290 ) . He used a similar process , starting with bone fragments , for his 1962 work , Knife Edge Two Piece . The sculpture was enlarged in three stages . First , Moore made a 162.5 centimetres ( 5 ft 4.0 in ) high working model ( LH 481 ) in 1961 . The Henry Moore Foundation at Perry Green , Hertfordshire , has two versions , one in plaster and another in fibreglass , and other examples are held by the Hakone Open-Air Museum in Japan , and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington DC .",
  "/wiki/Henry_Moore": "Henry Spencer Moore OM CH FBA ( 30 July 1898 - 31 August 1986 ) was an English artist . He is best known for his semi-abstract monumental bronze sculptures which are located around the world as public works of art . As well as sculpture , Moore produced many drawings , including a series depicting Londoners sheltering from the Blitz during the Second World War , along with other graphic works on paper . His forms are usually abstractions of the human figure , typically depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures . Moore 's works are usually suggestive of the female body , apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups . His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces . Many interpreters liken the undulating form of his reclining figures to the landscape and hills of his Yorkshire birthplace . Moore became well known through his carved marble and larger-scale abstract cast bronze sculptures , and was instrumental in introducing a particular form of modernism to the United Kingdom . His ability in later life to fulfil large-scale commissions made him exceptionally wealthy . Despite this , he lived frugally ; most of the money he earned went towards endowing the Henry Moore Foundation , which continues to support education and promotion of the arts .",
  "/wiki/Royal_Observatory,_Greenwich": "The Royal Observatory , Greenwich ( ROG ; known as the Old Royal Observatory from 1957 to 1998 , when the working Royal Greenwich Observatory , RGO , moved from Greenwich to Herstmonceux ) is an observatory situated on a hill in Greenwich Park , overlooking the River Thames . It played a major role in the history of astronomy and navigation , and because the prime meridian passes through it , it gave its name to Greenwich Mean Time . The ROG has the IAU observatory code of 000 , the first in the list . ROG , the National Maritime Museum , the Queen 's House and Cutty Sark are collectively designated Royal Museums Greenwich . The observatory was commissioned in 1675 by King Charles II , with the foundation stone being laid on 10 August . The site was chosen by Sir Christopher Wren . At that time the king also created the position of Astronomer Royal , to serve as the director of the observatory and to apply himself with the most exact care and diligence to the rectifying of the tables of the motions of the heavens , and the places of the fixed stars , so as to find out the so much desired longitude of places for the perfecting of the art of navigation . He appointed John Flamsteed as the first Astronomer Royal . The building was completed in the summer of 1676 . The building was often called Flamsteed House , in reference to its first occupant . The scientific work of the observatory was relocated elsewhere in stages in the first half of the 20th century , and the Greenwich site is now maintained almost exclusively as a museum , although the AMAT telescope became operational for astronomical research in 2018 .",

  "/wiki/James_Cook": "James Cook FRS ( 7 November 1728 [ NB 1 ] - 14 February 1779 ) was a British explorer , navigator , cartographer , and captain in the British Royal Navy . He made detailed maps of Newfoundland prior to making three voyages to the Pacific Ocean , during which he achieved the first recorded European contact with the eastern coastline of Australia and the Hawaiian Islands , and the first recorded circumnavigation of New Zealand . Cook joined the British merchant navy as a teenager and joined the Royal Navy in 1755 . He saw action in the Seven Years ' War and subsequently surveyed and mapped much of the entrance to the Saint Lawrence River during the siege of Quebec , which brought him to the attention of the Admiralty and Royal Society . This acclaim came at a crucial moment in his career and the direction of British overseas exploration , and led to his commission in 1766 as commander of HM Bark Endeavour for the first of three Pacific voyages . In these voyages , Cook sailed thousands of miles across largely uncharted areas of the globe . He mapped lands from New Zealand to Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean in greater detail and on a scale not previously charted by Western explorers . He surveyed and named features , and recorded islands and coastlines on European maps for the first time . He displayed a combination of seamanship , superior surveying and cartographic skills , physical courage , and an ability to lead men in adverse conditions . Cook was attacked and killed in 1779 during his third exploratory voyage in the Pacific while attempting to kidnap the Island of Hawaii 's monarch , Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu , in order to reclaim a cutter stolen from one of his ships .

It is within the Royal Borough of Greenwich , to which it lends its name . Historically it was in the county of Kent for hundreds of years , then the County of London from 1889 to 1965 . Greenwich is notable for its maritime history and for giving its name to the Greenwich Meridian ( 0\u00b0 longitude ) and Greenwich Mean Time . The town became the site of a royal palace , the Palace of Placentia from the 15th century , and was the birthplace of many Tudors , including Henry VIII and Elizabeth I . The palace fell into disrepair during the English Civil War and was demolished to be replaced by the Royal Naval Hospital for Sailors , designed by Sir Christopher Wren and his assistant Nicholas Hawksmoor . These buildings became the Royal Naval College in 1873 , and they remained a military education establishment until 1998 when they passed into the hands of the Greenwich Foundation . The historic rooms within these buildings remain open to the public ; other buildings are used by University of Greenwich and Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance . The town became a popular resort in the 18th century and many grand houses were built there , such as Vanbrugh Castle ( 1717 ) established on Maze Hill , next to the park . From the Georgian period estates of houses were constructed above the town centre . The maritime connections of Greenwich were celebrated in the 20th century , with the siting of the Cutty Sark and Gipsy Moth IV next to the river front , and the National Maritime Museum in the former buildings of the Royal Hospital School in 1934 ."
