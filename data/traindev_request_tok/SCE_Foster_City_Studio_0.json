Development of Spider-Man , the first licensed game by Insomniac in its then-22-year history , began in 2014 and took approximately four years . Insomniac was given the choice of using any character from Marvel 's catalog to work on ; Spider-Man was chosen both for his appeal to the employees and the similarities in traversal gameplay to their previous game Sunset Overdrive ( 2014 ) . The game design took inspiration from the history of Spider-Man across all media but Marvel Comics and Insomniac wanted to tell an original story that was not linked to an existing property , creating a unique universe ( known as Earth-1048 ) that has since appeared in novels , merchandise , and comics . Spider-Man was released for the PlayStation 4 on September 7 , 2018 ."
