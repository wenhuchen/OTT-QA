  "/wiki/Scheduled_Castes_and_Scheduled_Tribes": "The Scheduled Caste ( SCs ) and Scheduled Tribes ( STs ) are officially designated groups of people in India . The terms are recognised in the Constitution of India and the groups are designated in one or other of the categories . For much of the period of British rule in the Indian subcontinent , they were known as the Depressed Classes . In modern literature , the Scheduled Castes are sometimes referred to as Dalit , meaning broken/scattered in Sanskrit , having been popularised by B. R. Ambedkar ( 1891-1956 ) , the economist , reformer , father of the Indian Constitution , and Dalit leader during the independence struggle , himself a Dalit . Ambedkar preferred the term Dalit to Gandhi 's term , Harijan , meaning person of Hari/Vishnu ( or Man of God ) . In September 2018 , the government issued an advisory to all private satellite channels asking them to 'refrain ' from using the nomenclature 'Dalit ' , though rights groups and intellectuals have come out against any shift from 'Dalit ' in popular usage . The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes comprise about 16.6% and 8.6% , respectively , of India 's population ( according to the 2011 census ) . The Constitution ( Scheduled Castes ) Order , 1950 lists 1,108 castes across 29 states in its First Schedule , and the Constitution ( Scheduled Tribes ) Order , 1950 lists 744 tribes across 22 states in its First Schedule . Since the independence of India , the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were given Reservation status , guaranteeing political representation . The Constitution lays down the general principles of positive discrimination for SCs and STs .",
