  "/wiki/Divine_Intervention_(film)": "Divine Intervention ( Arabic : \u064a\u062f \u0625\u0644\u0647\u064a\u0629 ) is a 2002 film by Palestinian director Elia Suleiman , which may be described as a surreal black comedy . The film consists largely of a series of brief interconnected sketches , but for the most part records a day in the life of a Palestinian living in Nazareth , whose girlfriend lives several checkpoints away in the West Bank city of Ramallah . One lyrical section features a beautiful sunglasses-clad Palestinian woman ( played by Manal Khader ) whose passing by not only distracts all eyes , but whose gaze causes Israeli military checkpoint towers to crumble . The director features prominently as the film 's silent , expressionless protagonist in a performance that has been compared to the work of Buster Keaton , Jim Jarmusch and Jacques Tati . The film is noted for its minimal use of dialogue , its slow pace and repetition in behavior by its characters .",
