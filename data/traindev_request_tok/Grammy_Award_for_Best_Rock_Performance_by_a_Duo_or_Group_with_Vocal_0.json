The album is mostly composed of studio outtakes recorded during the 1970s , and contains one of the band 's most well-known songs , Start Me Up , which hit number two on the United States 's Billboard singles charts . A combination of touring obligations and personal feuding between band members made it difficult to arrange dedicated recording sessions for the band 's follow-up to 1980 's Emotional Rescue . As a result , the band 's production team combed through unused recordings from prior sessions , some dating back almost a decade . While a few of the songs were used essentially as-is in their original form , most of these earlier recordings were not complete , consisting of song fragments that needed a lot of work . Studio time was booked throughout 1980 and 1981 and band members came in when available to finish off the tracks . The credited members of the Rolling Stones for the album were vocalist Mick Jagger , guitarists Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood , bassist Bill Wyman , and drummer Charlie Watts , though many songs featured contributions from session musicians , earlier members of the band ( such as guitarist Mick Taylor ) , as well as keyboardists Nicky Hopkins , Billy Preston , and Ian Stewart , who contributed to many Stones recordings . The album proved to be both a critical and commercial success upon release , reaching the top of the Billboard charts . It was also the final Rolling Stones album to reach the top position of the US charts , thus concluding the band 's string of number-one albums there , dating back to 1971 's Sticky Fingers .",

He began writing classical music in high school , while at the same time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands , later switching to electric guitar .

He continued this eclectic and experimental approach , irrespective of whether the fundamental format was rock , jazz or classical . Zappa 's output is unified by a conceptual continuity he termed Project/Object , with numerous musical phrases , ideas , and characters reappearing across his albums .

  "/wiki/Achtung_Baby": "Achtung Baby ( /\u02c8\u00e6kt\u028a\u014b/ ) is the seventh studio album by Irish rock band U2 . It was produced by Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno , and was released on 18 November 1991 on Island Records . Stung by criticism of their 1988 release , Rattle and Hum , U2 shifted their musical direction to incorporate influences from alternative rock , industrial music , and electronic dance music into their sound . Thematically , Achtung Baby is darker , more introspective , and at times more flippant than their previous work . The album and the subsequent multimedia-intensive Zoo TV Tour were central to the group 's 1990s reinvention , by which they abandoned their earnest public image for a more lighthearted and self-deprecating one . Seeking inspiration from German reunification , U2 began recording Achtung Baby at Berlin 's Hansa Studios in October 1990 . The sessions were fraught with conflict , as the band argued over their musical direction and the quality of their material . After tension and slow progress nearly prompted the group to disband , they made a breakthrough with the improvised writing of the song One . Morale and productivity improved during subsequent recording sessions in Dublin , where the album was completed in 1991 . To confound the public 's expectations of the band and their music , U2 chose the record 's facetious title and colourful multi-image sleeve . Achtung Baby is one of U2 's most successful records ; it received favourable reviews and debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 Top Albums , while topping the charts in many other countries . Five songs were released as commercial singles , all of which were chart successes , including One , Mysterious Ways , and The Fly .",

  "/wiki/Bob_Dylan": "Bob Dylan ( born Robert Allen Zimmerman ; May 24 , 1941 ) is an American singer-songwriter , author , and visual artist who has been a major figure in popular culture for more than fifty years . Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s , when songs such as Blowin ' in the Wind ( 1963 ) and The Times They Are a-Changin ' ( 1964 ) became anthems for the civil rights movement and anti-war movement . His lyrics during this period incorporated a wide range of political , social , philosophical , and literary influences , defied pop-music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture . Following his self-titled debut album in 1962 , which mainly comprised traditional folk songs , Dylan made his breakthrough as a songwriter with the release of The Freewheelin ' Bob Dylan the following year . The album featured Blowin ' in the Wind and the thematically complex A Hard Rain 's a- Gon na Fall . For many of these songs , he adapted the tunes and phraseology of older folk songs . He went on to release the politically charged The Times They Are a-Changin ' and the more lyrically abstract and introspective Another Side of Bob Dylan in 1964 . In 1965 and 1966 , Dylan encountered controversy when he adopted electrically amplified rock instrumentation , and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most important and influential rock albums of the 1960s : Bringing It All Back Home ( 1965 ) , Highway 61 Revisited ( 1965 ) and Blonde on Blonde ( 1966 ) . Commenting on the six-minute single Like a Rolling Stone ( 1965 ) , Rolling Stone wrote : No other pop song has so thoroughly challenged and transformed the commercial laws and artistic conventions of its time , for all time . In July 1966 , Dylan withdrew from touring after being injured in a motorcycle accident . During this period , he recorded a large body of songs with members of The Band , who had previously backed him on tour . These recordings were released as the collaborative album The Basement Tapes in 1975 .",

His songs for the group included Taxman , Within You Without You , While My Guitar Gently Weeps , Here Comes the Sun and Something . Harrison 's earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt ; Carl Perkins , Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry were subsequent influences . By 1965 , he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds , and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on Norwegian Wood ( This Bird Has Flown ) . Having initiated the band 's embracing of Transcendental Meditation in 1967 , he subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna movement . After the band 's break-up in 1970 , Harrison released the triple album All Things Must Pass , a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single , My Sweet Lord , and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist , the slide guitar . He also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar , a precursor to later benefit concerts such as Live Aid .

It was released on 23 September 1977 as the lead single from his 12th studio album of the same name , backed with the song V-2 Schneider . A product of Bowie 's Berlin period , the track was not a huge hit in the United Kingdom or United States after its release , but it has since become one of his signature songs . In January 2016 , following Bowie 's death , the song reached a new peak of number 12 in the UK Singles Chart . 'Heroes ' has been cited as Bowie 's second-most covered song after Rebel Rebel . Inspired by the sight of Bowie 's producer-engineer Tony Visconti embracing his lover by the Berlin Wall , the song tells the story of two lovers , one from East and one from West Berlin . Bowie 's performance of 'Heroes ' on June 6 , 1987 , at the German Reichstag in West Berlin has been considered a catalyst to the later fall of the Berlin Wall . Following his death in January 2016 , the German government thanked Bowie for helping to bring down the Wall , adding you are now among Heroes . 'Heroes ' has received numerous accolades since its release , as seen with its inclusion on lists ranking the greatest songs of all time compiled by the music publications ; Rolling Stone named the song the 46th greatest ever , and NME named it the 15th greatest . Bowie scholar David Buckley has written that 'Heroes ' is perhaps pop 's definitive statement of the potential triumph of the human spirit over adversity ."
