Bangladesh shares land borders with India to the west , north , and east , Myanmar to the southeast , and the Bay of Bengal to the south . It is narrowly separated from Nepal and Bhutan by India 's Siliguri Corridor in the north and from China by the Indian state of Sikkim in the northeast . Dhaka , the capital and largest city , is the nation 's economic , political and cultural hub . Chittagong , the largest sea port , is the second largest city . The dominant geographic feature is the Ganges delta , which empties into the Bay of Bengal the combined waters of several river systems , including the Brahmaputra and the Ganges , with numerous criss-crossing rivers and inland waterways . Highlands with evergreen forests cover the northeastern and southeastern regions . The seacoast features the longest natural sea beach and most of the world 's largest mangrove forest .

  "/wiki/Multi-party_system": "A multi-party system is a political system in which multiple political parties across the political spectrum run for national election , and all have the capacity to gain control of government offices , separately or in coalition . Apart from one-party-dominant and two-party systems , multi-party systems tend to be more common in parliamentary systems than presidential systems and far more common in countries that use proportional representation compared to countries that use first-past-the-post elections . Several parties compete for power and all of them have reasonable chance of forming government . First-past-the-post requires concentrated areas of support for large representation in the legislature whereas proportional representation better reflects the range of a population 's views . Proportional systems may have multi-member districts with more than one representative elected from a given district to the same legislative body , and thus a greater number of viable parties . Duverger 's law states that the number of viable political parties is one , plus the number of seats in a district . Argentina , Armenia , Austria , Australia , Belgium , Brazil , Canada , Croatia , Denmark , Finland , France , Germany , Iceland , India , Indonesia , Ireland , Israel , Italy , Kosovo , Lebanon , Maldives , Mexico , Moldova , Nepal , the Netherlands , New Zealand , Norway , Pakistan , the Philippines , Poland , Portugal , Romania , Russia , Serbia , Spain , Sri Lanka , Sweden , Switzerland , Taiwan , Tunisia , Ukraine , and the United Kingdom are examples of nations that have used a multi-party system effectively in their democracies . In these countries , usually no single party has a parliamentary majority by itself . Instead , multiple political parties are compelled to form compromised coalitions for the purpose of developing power blocks and attaining legitimate mandate .",
  "/wiki/Parliamentary_republic": "A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch ( the government ) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature ( the parliament ) . There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics . Most have a clear differentiation between the head of government and the head of state , with the head of government holding real power , much like constitutional monarchies ( however in some countries the head of state , regardless of whether the country 's system is a parliamentary republic or a constitutional monarchy , has 'reserve powers ' given to use at their discretion in order to act as a non-partisan 'referee ' of the political process and ensure the nation 's constitution is upheld ) . Some have combined the roles of head of state and head of government , much like presidential systems , but with a dependency upon parliamentary power . For the first case mentioned above , the form of executive-branch arrangement is distinct from most other governments and semi-presidential republics that separate the head of state ( usually designated as the president ) from the head of government ( usually designated as prime minister , premier or chancellor ) and subject the latter to the confidence of parliament and a lenient tenure in office while the head of state lacks dependency and investing either office with the majority of executive power .

It is the only English speaking country in South America , and is culturally considered part of the Anglophone-Caribbean sphere . In addition it is one of the founding member countries of the Caribbean Community organization ( CARICOM ) . Guyana is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north , Brazil to the south and southwest , Venezuela to the west , and Suriname to the east . With an area of 215,000 square kilometres ( 83,000 sq mi ) , Guyana is the third-smallest sovereign state on mainland South America after Uruguay and Suriname . The region known as the Guianas consists of the large shield landmass north of the Amazon River and east of the Orinoco River known as the land of many waters . Major rivers in Guyana include the Essequibo , the Berbice , and the Demerara . Originally inhabited by many indigenous groups , Guyana was settled by the Dutch before coming under British control in the late 18th century . It was governed as British Guiana , with a mostly plantation-style economy until the 1950s . It gained independence in 1966 , and officially became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations in 1970 . The legacy of British rule is reflected in the country 's political administration and diverse population , which includes Indian , African , Amerindian , and multiracial groups . Guyana is the only South American nation in which English is the official language .",
  "/wiki/Presidential_republic": "A presidential system is a democratic and republican government in which a head of government leads an executive branch that is separate from the legislative branch . This head of government is in most cases also the head of state , which is called president . In presidential countries , the executive is elected and is not responsible to the legislature , which can not in normal circumstances dismiss it . Such dismissal is possible , however , in uncommon cases , often through impeachment . The title president has persisted from a time when such person personally presided over the governing body , as with the President of the Continental Congress in the early United States , prior to the executive function being split into a separate branch of government . A presidential system contrasts with a parliamentary system , where the head of government is elected to power through the legislative . There is also a hybrid system called semi-presidentialism . Countries that feature a presidential or semi-presidential system of government are not the exclusive users of the title of president . Heads of state of parliamentary republics , largely ceremonial in most cases , are called presidents . Dictators or leaders of one-party states , popularly elected or not , are also often called presidents . Presidentialism is the dominant form of government in the continental Americas , with all of its 22 sovereign states being presidential republics ( except for Canada , Belize and Suriname ) . It is also prevalent in Central and southern West Africa and in Central Asia .",

In the Indian Ocean , India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives ; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia . Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",

To the north and northwest , the country is bordered by China and by Russia along the Amnok ( known as the Yalu in Chinese ) and Tumen rivers , and to the south , it is bordered by South Korea , with the heavily fortified Korean Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) separating the two . Nevertheless , North Korea , like its southern counterpart , claims to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands . In 1910 , Korea was annexed by Imperial Japan . At the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 , Korea was divided into two zones , with the north occupied by the Soviet Union and the south occupied by the United States . Negotiations on reunification failed , and in 1948 , separate governments were formed : the socialist Democratic People 's Republic of Korea in the north , and the capitalist Republic of Korea in the south . An invasion initiated by North Korea led to the Korean War ( 1950-1953 ) . The Korean Armistice Agreement brought about a ceasefire , but no peace treaty was signed . North Korea officially describes itself as a self-reliant socialist state , and formally holds elections , though they have been described by outside observers as sham elections . Outside observers also generally view North Korea as a Stalinist dictatorship , particularly noting the elaborate cult of personality around the Kim dynasty . The Workers ' Party of Korea ( WPK ) , led by a member of the ruling family , holds absolute power in the state and leads the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of which all political officers are required to be members . Juche , an ideology of national self-reliance , was introduced into the constitution in 1972 .",
  "/wiki/One-party_state": "A one-party state , single-party state , one-party system , or single-party system is a type of state in which one political party has the right to form the government , usually based on the existing constitution . All other parties are either outlawed or allowed to take only a limited and controlled participation in elections . Sometimes the term de facto one-party state is used to describe a dominant-party system that , unlike the one-party state , allows ( at least nominally ) democratic multiparty elections , but the existing practices or balance of political power effectively prevent the opposition from winning the elections .",
  "/wiki/Socialist_republic": "A socialist state , socialist republic , or socialist country , sometimes referred to as a workers ' state or workers ' republic , is a sovereign state constitutionally dedicated to the establishment of socialism . The term communist state is often used interchangeably in the West specifically when referring to one-party socialist states governed by Marxist-Leninist communist parties , despite these countries being officially socialist states in the process of building socialism . These countries never describe themselves as communist nor as having implemented a communist society . Additionally , a number of countries that are multi-party capitalist states make references to socialism in their constitutions , in most cases alluding to the building of a socialist society , naming socialism , claiming to be a socialist state , or including the term socialist republic or people 's republic in their country 's full name , although this does not necessarily reflect the structure and development paths of these countries ' political and economic systems . Currently , these countries include Algeria , Bangladesh , Guyana , India , Nepal , Nicaragua , North Korea , Portugal , Sri Lanka and Tanzania . The idea of a socialist state stems from the broader notion of state socialism , the political perspective that the working class needs to use state power and government policy to establish a socialist economic system . However , the concept of a socialist state is mainly advocated by Marxist-Leninists and most socialist states have been established by political parties adhering to Marxism-Leninism or some national variation thereof such as Maoism or Titoism . A state , whether socialist or not , is most opposed by anarchists , who reject the idea that the state can be used to establish a socialist society due to its hierarchical and arguably coercive nature , considering a socialist state or state socialism as an oxymoron . The concept of a socialist state is considered unnecessary or counterproductive and rejected also by some classical , libertarian and orthodox Marxists , libertarian socialists and other socialist political thinkers who view the modern state as a byproduct of capitalism which would have no function in a socialist system . A socialist state is to be distinguished from a multi-party liberal democracy governed by a self-described socialist party , where the state is not constitutionally bound to the construction of socialism . In such cases , the political system and machinery of government is not specifically structured to pursue the development of socialism . Socialist states in the Marxist-Leninist sense are sovereign states under the control of a vanguard party which is organizing the country 's economic , political and social development toward the realization of socialism .",
  "/wiki/Juche": "Juche ( Korean : \uc8fc\uccb4/\u4e3b\u9ad4 , lit . 'subject ' ; Korean pronunciation : [ t\u0255ut\u0255\u02b0e ] ; usually left untranslated or translated as self-reliance ) is the official state ideology of North Korea , described by the government as Kim Il-sung 's original , brilliant and revolutionary contribution to national and international thought . It postulates that man is the master of his destiny , that the Korean masses are to act as the masters of the revolution and construction and that by becoming self-reliant and strong , a nation can achieve true socialism . Kim Il-sung ( 1912-1994 ) developed the ideology , originally viewed as a variant of Marxism-Leninism until it became distinctly Korean in character while incorporating the historical materialist ideas of Marxism-Leninism and strongly emphasizing the individual , the nation state and its sovereignty . Consequently , the North Korean government adopted Juche into a set of principles it uses to justify its policy decisions from the 1950s onwards . Such principles include moving the nation towards claimed jaju ( independence ) , through the construction of jarip ( national economy ) and an emphasis upon jawi ( self-defence ) in order to establish socialism . The practice of Juche is firmly rooted in the ideals of sustainability through agricultural independence and a lack of dependency . The Juche ideology has been criticized by many scholars and observers as a mechanism for sustaining the totalitarian rule of the North Korean regime [ full citation needed ] and justifying the country 's heavy-handed isolationism and oppression of the North Korean people . It has also been described as a form of Korean ethnic nationalism , but one that promotes the Kim family as the saviours of the Korean race and acts as a foundation of the subsequent personality cult surrounding them .",

He held the posts of Premier from 1948 to 1972 and President from 1972 to 1994 . He was also the leader of the Workers ' Party of Korea ( WPK ) from 1949 to 1994 ( titled as Chairman from 1949 to 1966 and as General Secretary after 1966 ) . Coming to power after the end of Japanese rule in 1945 , he authorized the invasion of South Korea in 1950 , triggering an intervention in defense of South Korea by the United Nations led by the United States . Following the military stalemate in the Korean War , a ceasefire was signed on 27 July 1953 . He was the third longest-serving non-royal head of state/government in the 20th century , in office for more than 45 years . Under his leadership , North Korea was established as a communist state with a publicly owned and planned economy . It had close political and economic relations with the Soviet Union . By the 1960s , North Korea briefly enjoyed a standard of living higher than the South , which was fraught with political instability and economic crises . The situation reversed in the 1970s , as a newly stable South Korea became an economic powerhouse fueled by Japanese and American investment , military aid , and internal economic development , while North Korea stagnated and then declined in the 1980s . Differences emerged between North Korea and the Soviet Union , chief among them being Kim Il-sung 's philosophy of Juche , which focused on Korean nationalism , self-reliance , and socialism . Despite this , the country received funds , subsidies and aid from the USSR ( and the Eastern Bloc ) until the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 .",
