[ a ] It is a popular poem praising their love story . Lord Byron called it the Romeo and Juliet of the East . Qays and Layla fall in love with each other when they are young , but when they grow up Laylas father does n't allow them to be together . Qays becomes obsessed with her , and his tribe Banu 'Amir and the community gives him the epithet of Majn\u016bn ( \u0645\u062c\u0646\u0648\u0646 crazy , lit . possessed by Jinn ) .
