  "/wiki/Uniform_number": "In team sports , the number , often referred to as the uniform number , squad number , jersey number , shirt number , sweater number , or similar ( with such naming differences varying by sport and region ) is the number worn on a player 's uniform , to identify and distinguish each player ( and sometimes others , such as coaches and officials ) from others wearing the same or similar uniforms . The number is typically displayed on the rear of the jersey , often accompanied by the surname . Sometimes it is also displayed on the front and/or sleeves , or on the player 's shorts or headgear . It is used to identify the player to officials , other players , official scorers , and spectators ; in some sports , it is also indicative of the player 's position . The International Federation of Football History and Statistics , an organization of association football historians , traces the origin of numbers to a 1911 Australian rules football match in Sydney , although photographic evidence exists of numbers being used in Australia as early as May 1903 in a Fitroy v Collingwood match . Player numbers were used in a Queensland vs. New Zealand rugby match played on 17 July 1897 , in Brisbane , Australia , as reported in the Brisbane Courier .",
