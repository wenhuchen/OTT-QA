Finding the LEL too moderate , in 1957 he and John Bean founded the National Labour Party ( NLP ) , an explicitly National Socialist ( Nazi ) group . In 1960 , the NLP merged with Colin Jordan 's White Defence League to found the first British National Party ( BNP ) . Within the BNP , Tyndall and Jordan established a paramilitary wing called Spearhead , which angered Bean and other party members . They expelled Tyndall and Jordan , who went on to establish the National Socialist Movement and then the international World Union of National Socialists . In 1962 , they were convicted and briefly imprisoned for their paramilitary activities . After a split with Jordan , Tyndall formed his Greater Britain Movement ( GBM ) in 1964 .
