It borrows extensively , in all aspects , from Arabic and Persian and its speakers used the ( Perso-Arabic ) Ottoman Turkish alphabet for written communications . During the peak of Ottoman power ( c. 16th century CE ) , words of foreign origin in Turkish literature in the Ottoman empire heavily outnumbered native Turkish words , with Arabic and Persian vocabulary accounting for up to 88% of the Ottoman vocabulary in some texts . Consequently , Ottoman Turkish was largely unintelligible to the less-educated lower-class and to rural Turks , who continued to use kaba T\u00fcrk\u00e7e ( raw/vulgar Turkish ; compare Vulgar Latin ) , which used far fewer foreign loanwords and is the basis of the modern Turkish language . The Tanzim\u00e2t era ( 1839-1876 ) saw the application of the term Ottoman when referring to the language ( \u0644\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc , lis\u00e2n-\u0131 Osm\u00e2n\u00ee or \u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0644\u064a\u062c\u0647 , Osmanl\u0131ca ) ; Modern Turkish makes the same distinction ( Osmanl\u0131ca and Osmanl\u0131 T\u00fcrk\u00e7esi ) .",

Outside Turkey , significant smaller groups of speakers exist in Germany , Austria , Bulgaria , North Macedonia , Northern Cyprus , Greece , the Caucasus , and other parts of Europe and Central Asia . Cyprus has requested that the European Union add Turkish as an official language , even though Turkey is not a member state . To the west , the influence of Ottoman Turkish - the variety of the Turkish language that was used as the administrative and literary language of the Ottoman Empire - spread as the Ottoman Empire expanded . In 1928 , as one of Atat\u00fcrk 's Reforms in the early years of the Republic of Turkey , the Ottoman Turkish alphabet was replaced with a Latin alphabet . The distinctive characteristics of the Turkish language are vowel harmony and extensive agglutination . The basic word order of Turkish is subject-object-verb . Turkish has no noun classes or grammatical gender . The language makes usage of honorifics and has a strong T-V distinction which distinguishes varying levels of politeness , social distance , age , courtesy or familiarity toward the addressee . The plural second-person pronoun and verb forms are used referring to a single person out of respect .",

Situated between the regency of Tunis in the east and the Sultanate of Morocco ( from 1553 ) in the west ( and the Spanish and Portuguese possessions of North Africa ) , the Regency originally extended its borders from La Calle to the east to Trara in the west and from Algiers to Biskra , and after spread to the present eastern and western borders of Algeria . The Regency was governed by beylerbeys , pashas , aghas and deys , and was composed of various beyliks ( provinces ) under the authority of beys ( vassals ) : Constantine in the east , Medea in the Titteri and Mazouna , then Mascara and then Oran in the west . Each beylik was divided into various outan ( counties ) with at their head the ca\u00efds directly under the bey . To administer the interior of the country , the administration relied on the tribes said makhzen . These tribes were responsible for securing order and collecting taxes on the tributary regions of the country . It was through this system that , for three centuries , the State of Algiers extended its authority over the north of Algeria . However , society was still divided into tribes and dominated by maraboutics brotherhoods or local djouads ( nobles ) . Several regions of the country thus only lightly recognised the authority of Algiers . Throughout its history , they formed numerous revolts , confederations , tribal fiefs or sultanates that fought with the regency for control . Before 1830 , out of the 516 political units , a total of 200 principalities or tribes were considered independent because they controlled over 60% of the territory in Algeria and refused to pay taxes to Algiers .",
