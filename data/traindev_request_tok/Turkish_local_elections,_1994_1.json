The DYP was the main opposition party in the Grand National Assembly from 1987 to 1991 . Later , the party won power in the 1991 general election , after having emerged as the largest party . Demirel subsequently returned to the premiership in the period from 1991 to 1993 , before securing the Presidency of Turkey that year . Subsequently , both the DYP leadership and the premiership passed to Tansu \u00c7iller , another prominent member of the party . \u00c7iller was the first female Prime Minister of Turkey , and served until 1996 .

In the local elections 1989 the SHP emerged as the strongest party with 27.8 percent of the vote , winning government power in 6 metropolitan areas , 39 provinces and 283 districts . The Kurdish question placed the party under serious strain as it had seven MPs of Kurdish origin at a time when use of the Kurdish language was forbidden in public and private life in Turkey . Some of these MPs wanted to take part in the Kurdish Conference in Paris 1989 , to which chairman \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc wanted to agree . But after it emerged that representatives of the PKK could also take part , participation was forbidden . Seven Kurdish MPs took part anyway and all were expelled from the party , even though the PKK was not present at the congress and in fact protested in front of the congress against it . As a result Aydin G\u00fcven G\u00fcrkan , 12 other MPs of the SHP , dozens of regional party administrators and 3000 party members resigned from the SHP . Nevertheless the party was one of the first parties to acknowledge that the Kurdish Question was not just an issue of terrorism . In the South Eastern Report published by the party in 1990 the problems of not acknowledging the Kurds as a distinct ethnic group were noticed . It was emphasized the Kurds should be able to express their Kurdish identity and legal barriers prohibiting this should be lifted . After the 1991 general election , the SHP became a partner in the coalition government and \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc became the deputy prime minister ( Nov. 20 ) .

It is the oldest political party in the country , and is currently the main opposition in the Grand National Assembly . The CHP describes itself as a modern social democratic party , which is faithful to the founding principles and values of the Republic of Turkey . The party is cited as the founding party of modern Turkey . Its logo consists of the Six Arrows , which represent the foundational principles of Kemalism : republicanism , nationalism , statism , populism , laicism , and reformism . The political party was established during the Sivas Congress in 1919 as a union of resistance groups against the Greek invasion of Anatolia . The union represented Turkish people as a unified front during the Turkish War of Independence ( 1919-1923 ) . On 9 September 1923 , the People 's Party declared itself to be a political organization and on 29 October 1923 , announced the establishment of the Turkish Republic . On 10 November 1924 , the People 's Party renamed itself the Republican People 's Party ( CHP ) as Turkey moved into a one-party period . During the one-party period , the CHP became the major political organisation of a one-party state . However , CHP faced two opposition parties during this period , both established upon the request of CHP leader and founder of Turkey , Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk , in efforts to kick-start a multi-party democracy in Turkey . The first one was the Progressive Republican Party established in 1924 by famous generals such as Kaz\u0131m Karabekir and Ali Fuat Cebesoy , who both served during the Turkish War of Independence , and the second was the Liberal Republican Party founded by Ali Fethi Okyar in 1930 ."
