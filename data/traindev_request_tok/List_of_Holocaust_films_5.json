  "/wiki/Der_Tod_ist_ein_Meister_aus_Deutschland": "Todesfuge ( translated into English as Death Fugue and Fugue of Death ) is a German language poem written by the Romanian-born poet Paul Celan probably around 1945 and first published in 1948 . It is among [ Celan 's ] most well-known and often-anthologized poems . Despite critics claiming that the lyrical finesse and aesthetic of the poem did not do justice to the cruelty of the Holocaust , others regard the poem as one that combines mysteriously compelling imagery with rhythmic variations and structural patterns that are both elusive and pronounced . At the same time it has been regarded as a masterful description of horror and death in a concentration camp . Celan was born to a Jewish family in Cernauti , Romania ( now Chernivtsy , Ukraine ) ; his parents died in a camp during the Second World War , and Celan himself was a prisoner for a time in a work camp . The poem has reached international relevance by being considered to be one of the most important poems of the post-war period and the most relevant example of Tr\u00fcmmerliteratur .",
