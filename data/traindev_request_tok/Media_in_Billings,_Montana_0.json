  "/wiki/Religious_broadcasting": "Religious broadcasting refers to the dissemination of television and/or radio content that intentionally has religious ideas , religious experience , or religious practice as its core focus . In some countries , religious broadcasting developed primarily within the context of public service provision ( as in the UK ) , whilst in others , it has been driven more by religious organisations themselves ( as in the USA ) . Across Europe and in the US and Canada , religious broadcasting began in the earliest days of radio , usually with the transmission of religious worship , preaching or 'talks ' . Over time , formats evolved to include a broad range of styles and approaches , including radio and television drama , documentary , and chat show formats , as well as more traditional devotional content . Today , many religious organizations record sermons and lectures , and have moved into distributing content on their own web-based IP channels . Religious broadcasting can be funded commercially or through some sort of public broadcasting-style arrangement ( religious broadcasters are often recognized as non-profit organizations ) . Donations from listeners and viewers , often tax-deductible , are solicited by some broadcasters . In the US , 42 percent of non-commercial radio stations currently have a religious format where on the other hand about 80 percent of the 2,400 Christian radio stations and 100 full-power Christian TV stations throughout the entire United States are considered non-profit . In some countries , particularly those with an established state religion , broadcasting related to one particular religion only is allowed , or in some cases required . For example , a function of the state-owned Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation is by law to broadcast such programmes as may promote Islamic ideology , national unity and principles of democracy , freedom equality , tolerance and social justice as enunciated by Islam .

  "/wiki/Country_music": "Country music , also known as country and western ( or simply country ) , and hillbilly music , is a genre of popular music that takes its roots from genres such as American folk music ( especially Appalachian and Western music ) and blues . Its popularized roots originate in the Southern United States of the early 1920s . Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms , folk lyrics , and harmonies mostly accompanied by string instruments such as banjos , electric and acoustic guitars , steel guitars ( such as pedal steels and dobros ) , and fiddles as well as harmonicas . Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history . According to Lindsey Starnes , the term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music ; it came to encompass Western music , which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots , in the mid-20th century . In 2009 in the United States , country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute , and second most popular in the morning commute . The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres . The origins of country music are found in the folk music of working class Americans and/or blue-collar American life , who blended popular songs , Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes , traditional English ballads , cowboy songs , and the musical traditions of various groups of European immigrants .",

  "/wiki/Talk_radio": "Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues and consisting entirely or almost entirely of original spoken word content rather than outside music . Most shows are regularly hosted by a single individual , and often feature interviews with a number of different guests . Talk radio typically includes an element of listener participation , usually by broadcasting live conversations between the host and listeners who call in ( usually via telephone ) to the show . Listener contributions are usually screened by a show 's producers in order to maximize audience interest and , in the case of commercial talk radio , to attract advertisers . Generally , the shows are organized into segments , each separated by a pause for advertisements ; however , in public or non-commercial radio , music is sometimes played in place of commercials to separate the program segments . Variations of talk radio include conservative talk , hot talk , liberal talk ( increasingly known as progressive talk ) and sports talk . While talk radio has historically been associated with broadcast radio , starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of live Internet website streaming and podcasts . Now , it is possible for an individual to use a variety of services to host an Internet-based talk-radio show without carriage by a traditional radio station . In addition , TV programming from talk and news outlets such as BBC , CNN , Bloomberg and Fox is now often available expanding the world of talk radio further .

  "/wiki/Contemporary_hit_radio": "Contemporary hit radio ( also known as CHR , contemporary hits , hit list , current hits , hit music , top 40 , or pop radio ) is a radio format that is common in the United States , Brazil , United Kingdom , Ireland , Canada , New Zealand , Australia , the Philippines , Indonesia , Malaysia , Singapore , China , Hong Kong , Taiwan , Japan , South Korea , Trinidad and Tobago , and South Africa , that focuses on playing current and recurrent popular music as determined by the top 40 music charts . There are several subcategories , dominantly focusing on rock , pop , or urban music . Used alone , CHR most often refers to the CHR-pop format . The term contemporary hit radio was coined in the early 1980s by Radio & Records magazine to designate top 40 stations which continued to play hits from all musical genres as pop music splintered into adult contemporary , urban contemporary and other formats . The term top 40 is also used to refer to the actual list of hit songs , and , by extension , to refer to pop music in general . The term has also been modified to describe top 50 ; top 30 ; top 20 ; top 10 ; hot 100 ( each with its number of songs ) and hot hits radio formats , but carrying more or less the same meaning and having the same creative point of origin with Todd Storz as further refined by Gordon McLendon as well as Bill Drake .

  "/wiki/Classic_rock": "Classic rock is a radio format which developed from the album-oriented rock ( AOR ) format in the early 1980s . In the United States , the classic rock format features rock music ranging generally from the mid-1960s to the 1980s , primarily focusing on commercially successful blues rock and hard rock popularized in the 1970s AOR format . The radio format became increasingly popular with the baby boomer demographic by the end of the 1990s . Although classic rock has mostly appealed to adult listeners , music associated with this format received more exposure with younger generations of listeners with the presence of the Internet and digital downloading . Some classic rock stations also play a limited number of current releases which are stylistically consistent with the station 's sound , or by heritage acts that are still active and producing new music . Conceptually , classic rock has been analyzed by academics as an effort by critics , media , and music establishments to canonize rock music and commodify 1960s Western culture for audiences living in a post-baby boomer economy . The music predominantly selected for the format has been identified as commercially successful songs by white male acts from the Anglosphere , expressing values of Romanticism , self-aggrandizement , and politically undemanding ideologies .",

  "/wiki/Classic_hits": "Classic hits is a radio format which generally includes songs from the top 40 music charts from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s , with music from the 1980s serving as the core of the format . Music that was popularized by MTV in the early 1980s and the nostalgia behind it is a major driver to the format . It is considered the successor to the oldies format , a collection of top 40 songs from the late 1950s through the late 1970s that was once extremely popular in the United States . The term is sometimes incorrectly used as a synonym for the adult hits format , which uses a slightly newer music library stretching from all decades to the present with a major focus on 1990s and 2000s rock and alternative songs . In addition , adult hits stations tend to have larger playlists , playing a given song only a few times per week , compared to the tighter libraries on classic hits stations . For example , KRTH , a classic hits station in Los Angeles , plays power songs up to 30 times a week , which is another differentiator compared to other formats that share songs with classic hits libraries . The classic hits format has become extremely popular in the last few years with stations like KRTH , WCBS-FM in New York , and WLS-FM in Chicago having successful ratings with this model . Classic hits was named format of the summer of 2018 by Nielsen Audio 's research team emphasizing the huge popularity of the format . In addition , the Millennial generation is listening to this format in record numbers , according to a Nielsen report .

  "/wiki/Adult_Contemporary": "In North American music , adult contemporary music ( AC ) is a form of radio-played popular music , ranging from 1960s vocal and 1970s soft rock music to predominantly ballad-heavy music of the present day , with varying degrees of easy listening , pop , soul , rhythm and blues , quiet storm , and rock influence . Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music . Adult contemporary tends to have lush , soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated . It is usually melodic enough to get a listener 's attention , and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music . Like most of pop music , its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse-chorus structure . The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments ( though bass guitar is usually used ) such as acoustic guitars , pianos , saxophones , and sometimes an orchestral set . The electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched . However , recent adult contemporary music may feature synthesizers ( and other electronics , such as drum machines ) . An AC radio station may play mainstream music , but it excludes hip hop , dance tracks , hard rock , and some forms of teen pop , as these are less popular among adults , the target demographic . AC radio often targets the 25-44 age group , the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s . A common practice in recent years of adult contemporary stations is to play less newer music and more hits of the past . This de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart ."
