Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

Among the ships built by Oregon Shipbuilding was the Star of Oregon , which was launched on Liberty Fleet Day , September 27 , 1941 . The rapid expansion of Portland area shipyards during World War II and contraction afterward caused similar expansion and contraction of the population of Vanport City , Oregon , which was also built by Henry J. Kaiser to house the workers of the three area shipyards . The former site of Oregon Shipbuilding in St. Johns is now Schnitzer Steel Industries .",

Serving as a major port , New Orleans is considered an economic and commercial hub for the broader Gulf Coast region of the United States . New Orleans is world-renowned for its distinct music , Creole cuisine , unique dialect , and its annual celebrations and festivals , most notably Mardi Gras . The historic heart of the city is the French Quarter , known for its French and Spanish Creole architecture and vibrant nightlife along Bourbon Street . The city has been described as the most unique in the United States , owing in large part to its cross-cultural and multilingual heritage . Founded in 1718 by French colonists , New Orleans was once the territorial capital of French Louisiana before being traded to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 . New Orleans in 1840 was the third-most populous city in the United States , and it was the largest city in the American South from the Antebellum era until after World War II . The city has historically been very vulnerable to flooding , due to such factors as high rainfall , low lying elevation , poor natural drainage and location next to multiple bodies of water . State and federal authorities have installed a complex system of levees and drainage pumps in an effort to protect the city . New Orleans was severely affected by Hurricane Katrina on August 29 , 2005 , which resulted in flooding more than 80% of the city , thousands of deaths , and so much displacement because of damaged communities and lost housing as to cause a population decline of over 50% . Since Katrina , major redevelopment efforts have led to a rebound in the city 's population .",

  "/wiki/Commencement_Bay-class_escort_carrier": "The Commencement Bay-class escort aircraft carriers were the last class of escort carriers built for the US Navy in World War II . The ships were based on the Maritime Commission type T3 Tanker hull , which gave them a displacement of approximately 23,000 tons and a length of 557 feet ( 170 m ) . Unlike most earlier escort carrier classes , which were laid down as something else and converted to aircraft carriers mid-construction , the Commencement Bays were built as carriers from the keel up . Their general layout was similar to the Sangamon-class escort carriers , but some of the Sangamon 's engineering shortcomings were addressed . They entered service late in World War II - USS Commencement Bay launched on 9 May 1944 - so most of them saw little or no operational service . Thirty-three of them were ordered but many were cancelled prior to completion . Nineteen saw commissioned service in the US Navy , four were broken up on the ways at the end of the war , two were accepted from the builders , but never commissioned and the remainder were cancelled before being laid down . After the war they were seen as potential helicopter , anti-submarine , or auxiliary ( transport ) carriers , and a number of ships served in these roles during the Korean War . The onrushing jet age ended their lives , as the ships were no longer large enough to safely carry the much larger jet aircraft of the late 1950s , and all units were out of service or reclassified by 1960 .",

  "/wiki/Kaiser_Shipyards": "The Kaiser Shipyards were seven major shipbuilding yards located on the United States west coast during World War II . Kaiser ranked 20th among U.S. corporations in the value of wartime production contracts . The shipyards were owned by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company , a creation of American industrialist Henry J. Kaiser ( 1882-1967 ) , who established the shipbuilding company around 1939 in order to help meet the construction goals set by the United States Maritime Commission for merchant shipping . Four of the Kaiser Shipyards were located in Richmond , California , and were called the Richmond Shipyards . Three other shipyards were located in the Pacific Northwest along the Columbia and Willamette rivers : the Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation and the Swan Island Shipyard in Portland , Oregon , and the Vancouver Shipyard in Vancouver , Washington . Henry Kaiser was known for developing new methods of ship building , which allowed his yards to outproduce other similar facilities and build 1,490 ships , 27 percent of the total Maritime Commission construction . Kaiser 's ships were completed in two-thirds the time and a quarter the cost of the average of all other shipyards . Liberty ships were typically assembled in a little over two weeks , and one in less than five days . Kaiser Shipyards shut down at the end of the war . The Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park was dedicated October 25 , 2000 on the site of one of the shipyards in Richmond .",

  "/wiki/Casablanca-class_escort_carrier": "The Casablanca-class escort carrier were a series of escort carriers constructed for the United States Navy during World War II . They were the most numerous class of aircraft carriers ever built . Fifty were laid down , launched and commissioned within the space of less than two years - 3 November 1942 through to 8 July 1944 . These were nearly one third of the 151 carriers built in the United States during the war . Despite their numbers , and the preservation of more famous and larger carriers as museums , none of these modest ships survive today . Five were lost to enemy action during World War II and the remainder were scrapped . Casablanca was the first class to be designed from keel up as an escort carrier . It had a larger and more useful hangar deck than previous conversions . It also had a larger flight deck than the Bogue class . Unlike larger carriers which had extensive armor , protection was limited to splinter plating . Their small size made them useful for transporting assembled aircraft of various sizes , but fighters were limited to smaller and lighter aircraft such as the Grumman F4F Wildcat . The hull numbers were assigned consecutively , from CVE-55 Casablanca to CVE-104 Munda .",

  "/wiki/Destroyer": "In naval terminology , a destroyer is a fast , maneuverable , long-endurance warship intended to escort larger vessels in a fleet , convoy or battle group and defend them against powerful short range attackers . They were originally developed in the late 19th century by Fernando Villaamil for the Spanish Navy as a defense against torpedo boats , and by the time of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 , these torpedo boat destroyers ( TBDs ) were large , swift , and powerfully armed torpedo boats designed to destroy other torpedo boats . Although the term destroyer had been used interchangeably with TBD and torpedo boat destroyer by navies since 1892 , the term torpedo boat destroyer had been generally shortened to simply destroyer by nearly all navies by the First World War . Before World War II , destroyers were light vessels with little endurance for unattended ocean operations ; typically a number of destroyers and a single destroyer tender operated together . After the war , the advent of the guided missile allowed destroyers to take on the surface combatant roles previously filled by battleships and cruisers . This resulted in larger and more powerful guided missile destroyers more capable of independent operation . At the start of the 21st century , destroyers are the global standard for surface combatant ships , with only two nations ( United States and Russia ) operating the heavier class cruisers , with no battleships or true battlecruisers remaining . Modern guided missile destroyers are equivalent in tonnage but vastly superior in firepower to cruisers of the World War II era , and are capable of carrying nuclear-tipped cruise missiles . At 510 feet ( 160 m ) long , a displacement of 9,200 tons , and with armament of more than 90 missiles , guided missile destroyers such as the Arleigh Burke-class are actually larger and more heavily armed than most previous ships classified as guided missile cruisers . Some European navies , such as the French , Spanish , Dutch or German , use the term frigate for their destroyers , which leads to some confusion . After the Second World War , destroyers grew in size . The Allen M. Sumner-class destroyer had a displacement of 2200 tons , while the Arleigh Burke class has a displacement of up to 9600 tons , thus growing in size almost 340% .",

  "/wiki/Nazi_Germany": "Nazi Germany is the common English name for Germany between 1933 and 1945 , when Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party ( NSDAP ) controlled the country through a dictatorship . Under Hitler 's rule , Germany became a totalitarian state where nearly all aspects of life were controlled by the government . The official name of the state was Deutsches Reich ( German Reich ) until 1943 and Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich ( Greater German Reich ) from 1943 to 1945 . Nazi Germany is also known as the Third Reich ( Drittes Reich ) , meaning Third Realm or Third Empire , the first two being the Holy Roman Empire ( 800-1806 ) and the German Empire ( 1871-1918 ) . The Nazi regime ended after the Allies defeated Germany in May 1945 , ending World War II in Europe . Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by the President of the Weimar Republic , Paul von Hindenburg , on 30 January 1933 . The NSDAP then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power . Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the offices and powers of the Chancellery and Presidency . A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole F\u00fchrer ( leader ) of Germany . All power was centralised in Hitler 's person and his word became the highest law . The government was not a coordinated , co-operating body , but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler 's favour . In the midst of the Great Depression , the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a mixed economy .",

  "/wiki/Type_XXI_submarine": "Type XXI submarines were a class of German diesel-electric Elektroboot ( German : electric boat ) submarines designed during the Second World War . One hundred and eighteen were completed , with four being combat ready . During the war only two were put into active service and went on patrols , but these were not used in combat . They were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged , rather than spending most of their time as surface ships that could submerge for brief periods as a means to escape detection . They incorporated many batteries to increase the time they could spend submerged , to as much as several days , and they only needed to surface to periscope depth for recharging via a snorkel . The design included many general improvements as well : much greater underwater speed by an improved hull design , greatly improved diving times , power-assisted torpedo reloading and greatly improved crew accommodations . However , the design was also flawed in many ways , with the submarines being mechanically unreliable and vulnerable to combat damage . The Type XXI submarines were also rushed into production before design work was complete , and the inexperienced facilities which constructed the boats were unable to meet necessary quality standards . After the war , several navies obtained XXIs and operated them for decades in various roles and large navies introduced new submarine designs based on them . These include the Soviet Whiskey , US Tang , UK Porpoise and Swedish Hajen classes , all based on the Type XXI design to some extent .",
