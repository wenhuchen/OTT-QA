The Leinster province comprises the ancient Kingdoms of Meath , Leinster and Osraige . Following the 12th-century Norman invasion of Ireland , the historic fifths of Leinster and Meath gradually merged , mainly due to the impact of the Pale , which straddled both , thereby forming the present-day province of Leinster . The ancient kingdoms were shired into a number of counties for administrative and judicial purposes . In later centuries , local government legislation has seen further sub-division of the historic counties . Leinster has no official function for local-government purposes . However , the province is an officially recognised subdivision of Ireland . It is listed on ISO 3166-2 as one of the four provinces of Ireland and IE-L is attributed to Leinster as its country sub-division code . Leinster had a population of 2,630,720 according to the preliminary results of the 2016 census , making it the most populous province in the country .

Its growth as a major port was paralleled by the expansion of the city throughout the Industrial Revolution . Along with handling general cargo , freight , and raw materials such as coal and cotton , the city merchants were involved in the Atlantic slave trade . In the 19th century , it was a major port of departure for English and Irish emigrants to North America .

Merseyside , which was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972 , takes its name from the River Mersey . Merseyside spans 249 square miles ( 645 km2 ) of land which border Lancashire ( to the north-east ) , Greater Manchester ( to the east ) , Cheshire ( to the south and south-east ) and the Irish Sea to the west . North Wales is across the Dee Estuary . There is a mix of high density urban areas , suburbs , semi-rural and rural locations in Merseyside , but overwhelmingly the land use is urban . It has a focused central business district , formed by Liverpool City Centre , but Merseyside is also a polycentric county with five metropolitan districts , each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs . The Liverpool Urban Area is the fifth most populous conurbation in England , and dominates the geographic centre of the county , while the smaller Birkenhead Urban Area dominates the Wirral Peninsula in the south . For the 12 years following 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government ; district councils shared power with the Merseyside County Council . The county council was abolished in 1986 , and so its districts ( the metropolitan boroughs ) are now effectively unitary authority areas . However , the metropolitan county continues to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference , and several county-wide services are co-ordinated by authorities and joint-boards , such as Merseytravel ( for public transport ) , Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service and the Merseyside Police ( for law-enforcement ) ; as a ceremonial county , Merseyside has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff . As the Lancashire county palatine boundaries remain the same as the historic boundaries , the High Sheriff of Merseyside , along with those of Lancashire and Greater Manchester are appointed within the Duchy and County Palatine of Lancaster .",

Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement , the Northern Ireland Assembly ( colloquially referred to as Stormont after its location ) holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters , while other areas are reserved for the British government . Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in several areas , and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to put forward views and proposals with determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments . On 11 January 2020 , legislators in Northern Ireland formed a government for the first time since the Executive of the 5th Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed in January 2017 , following the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal .

Throughout the Medieval and Early Modern period , Blackpool was a coastal hamlet in Lancashire 's Hundred of Amounderness , and remained such until the mid-18th century when it became fashionable in England to travel to the coast in the summer to improve well-being . In 1781 , visitors attracted to Blackpool 's 7-mile ( 11 km ) sandy beach were able to use a new private road , built by Thomas Clifton and Sir Henry Hoghton . Stagecoaches began running to Blackpool from Manchester in the same year , and from Halifax in 1782 . In the early 19th century , Henry Banks and his son-in-law John Cocker erected new buildings in Blackpool such that its population grew from less than 500 in 1801 to over 2,500 in 1851 . St John 's Church in Blackpool was consecrated in 1821 . Blackpool rose to prominence as a major centre of tourism in England when a railway was built in the 1840s connecting it to the industrialised regions of Northern England . The railway made it much easier and cheaper for visitors to reach Blackpool , triggering an influx of settlers , such that in 1876 Blackpool was incorporated as a borough , governed by its own town council and aldermen . In 1881 , Blackpool was a booming resort with a population of 14,000 and a promenade complete with piers , fortune-tellers , public houses , trams , donkey rides , fish-and-chip shops and theatres . By 1901 the population of Blackpool was 47,000 , by which time its place was cemented as the archetypal British seaside resort .",

Natives of Barrow , as well as the local dialect , are known as Barrovian . In the Middle Ages , Barrow was a small hamlet within the parish of Dalton-in-Furness with Furness Abbey , now on the outskirts of the modern-day town , controlling the local economy before its dissolution in 1537 . The iron prospector Henry Schneider arrived in Furness in 1839 and , with other investors , opened the Furness Railway in 1846 to transport iron ore and slate from local mines to the coast . Further hematite deposits were discovered , of sufficient size to develop factories for smelting and exporting steel . For a period of the late 19th century , the Barrow Hematite Steel Company-owned steelworks was the world 's largest . Barrow 's location and the availability of steel allowed the town to develop into a significant producer of naval vessels , a shift that was accelerated during World War I and the local yard 's specialisation in submarines . The original iron- and steel-making enterprises closed down after World War II , leaving Vickers shipyard as Barrow 's main industry and employer .

To the north lies the Irish Sea , with the English counties of Cheshire to the east and Shropshire to the south-east . The Welsh counties of Powys and Gwynedd lie to the south and west respectively . Clwyd also shares a maritime boundary with the English county of Merseyside along the River Dee . Between 1974 and 1996 , it was a county with a county council , one of the eight counties into which Wales was divided , and was subdivided into six districts . In 1996 , the county of Clwyd was abolished , and the new unitary authorities of Wrexham , Conwy County Borough , Denbighshire , and Flintshire were created ; under this reorganisation , Clwyd became a preserved county , with the name being retained for certain ceremonial functions . This area of north-eastern Wales has been settled since prehistoric times ; the Romans built a fort beside a ford on the River Conwy , and the Normans and Welsh disputed the territory . They built their castles at strategic locations as they advanced and retreated , but in the end England prevailed , and Edward I conquered the country in 1282 . The Act of Union in 1535 incorporated Wales under the English Crown and made it subject to English law . Traditionally , agriculture was the mainstay of the economy of this part of Wales , but with the Industrial Revolution , the North Wales Coalfield was developed and parts of eastern Clwyd around the Dee estuary and Wrexham became industrialised . The advent of the railway running from Chester along the North Wales coast in the mid-19th century made it easy for urban dwellers from Lancashire and Cheshire to visit the seaside towns of North Wales .",
