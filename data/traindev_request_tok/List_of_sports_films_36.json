K2 is the only eight-thousand metre peak that has never been climbed during winter or from its East Face . Ascents have almost always been made in July and August , the warmest times of year ; K2 's more northern location makes it more susceptible to inclement and colder weather . The peak has now been climbed by almost all of its ridges . Although the summit of Everest is at a higher altitude , K2 is a more difficult and dangerous climb , due in part to its more inclement weather and comparatively greater height from base to peak . As of June 2018 [ update ] , only 367 people have completed the ascent . 86 people have died attempting the climb according to the list maintained on the List of deaths on eight-thousanders .",

Almost 95% of the park is designated wilderness . On average , about four million people visit Yosemite each year , and most spend the majority of their time in the seven square miles ( 18 km2 ) of Yosemite Valley . The park set a visitation record in 2016 , surpassing five million visitors for the first time in its history . Yosemite was central to the development of the national park idea . Galen Clark and others lobbied to protect Yosemite Valley from development , ultimately leading to President Abraham Lincoln 's signing the Yosemite Grant in 1864 . John Muir led a successful movement to have Congress establish a larger national park by 1890 , one which encompassed the valley and its surrounding mountains and forests , paving the way for the National Park System . Yosemite is one of the largest and least fragmented habitat blocks in the Sierra Nevada , and the park supports a diversity of plants and animals . The park has an elevation range from 2,127 to 13,114 feet ( 648 to 3,997 m ) and contains five major vegetation zones : chaparral and oak woodland , lower montane forest , upper montane forest , subalpine zone , and alpine .

The international border between Nepal ( Province No . 1 ) and China ( Tibet Autonomous Region ) runs across its summit point . The current official elevation of 8,848 m ( 29,029 ft ) , recognised by China and Nepal , was established by a 1955 Indian survey and subsequently confirmed by a Chinese survey in 1975 . In 1865 , Everest was given its official English name by the Royal Geographical Society , as recommended by Andrew Waugh , the British Surveyor General of India , who chose the name of his predecessor in the post , Sir George Everest , despite Everest 's objections . Mount Everest attracts many climbers , some of them highly experienced mountaineers . There are two main climbing routes , one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal ( known as the standard route ) and the other from the north in Tibet . While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route , Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness , weather , and wind , as well as significant hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall . As of 2019 [ update ] , over 300 people have died on Everest , many of whose bodies remain on the mountain . The first recorded efforts to reach Everest 's summit were made by British mountaineers . As Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time , the British made several attempts on the north ridge route from the Tibetan side . After the first reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921 reached 7,000 m ( 22,970 ft ) on the North Col , the 1922 expedition pushed the north ridge route up to 8,320 m ( 27,300 ft ) , marking the first time a human had climbed above 8,000 m ( 26,247 ft ) .",
