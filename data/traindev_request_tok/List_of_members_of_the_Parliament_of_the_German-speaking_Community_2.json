  "/wiki/Fraction_(politics)": "A parliamentary group , parliamentary party , or parliamentary caucus is a group consisting of members of the same political party or electoral fusion of parties in a legislative assembly such as a parliament or a city council . In some countries , the only way that parties and members of Parliament can receive financial and personal support and join parliamentary committees is by organizing themselves in parliamentary groups . Parliamentary group leaders are often important political players . Parties that are not in government often choose the party 's political leader as the chairperson . [ clarify ] Parliamentary groups often use party discipline to control the votes of their members . Some parliamentary systems allow smaller political parties , who are not numerous enough to form parliamentary groups in their own names , to join with other parties of differing ideologies ( or with independent politicians ) in order to benefit from rights or privileges that are only accorded to formally recognised groups . Such groups are termed technical groups .",

  "/wiki/European_Parliament": "The European Parliament ( EP ) is the legislative branch of the European Union and one of its seven institutions . Together with the Council of the European Union , it adopts European legislation , normally on a proposal from the European Commission . The Parliament is composed of 705 members ( MEPs ) . The Parliament represents the second-largest democratic electorate in the world ( after the Parliament of India ) and the largest trans-national democratic electorate in the world ( 375 million eligible voters in 2009 ) . Since 1979 , it has been directly elected every five years by European Union citizens , using universal suffrage . Voter turnout for parliamentary elections has decreased at each election after 1979 until 2019 , when the voter turnout increased by 8 percentage points and went above 50% for the first time since 1994 . Voting age is 18 in all member states except Malta and Austria , where it is 16 , and Greece , where it is 17 . Although the European Parliament has legislative power , as does the Council , it does not formally possess legislative initiative ( which is the prerogative of the European Commission ) , as most national parliaments of European Union member states do . The Parliament is the first institution of the EU ( mentioned first in the treaties , having ceremonial precedence over all authority at the European level ) , and shares equal legislative and budgetary powers with the Council ( except in a few areas where the special legislative procedures apply ) . It likewise has equal control over the EU budget . Finally , the European Commission , the executive body of the EU ( it exercises executive powers , but no legislative ones other than legislative initiative ) , is accountable to Parliament . In particular , Parliament can decide whether or not to approve the European Council 's nominee for the President of the Commission , and it is further tasked with approving ( or rejecting ) the appointment of the Commission as a whole .",
