  "/wiki/New_Testament": "The New Testament ( Ancient Greek : \u1f29 \u039a\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u1f74 \u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03b8\u03ae\u03ba\u03b7 , transl . H\u0113 Kain\u1e15 Diath\u1e17k\u0113 ; Latin : Novum Testamentum ) is the second part of the Christian biblical canon , the first being the Old Testament . The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus , as well as events in first-century Christianity . Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture . The New Testament is a collection of Christian texts originally written in the Koine Greek language , at different times by various different authors . While the Old Testament canon varies somewhat between different Christian denominations , the 27-book canon of the New Testament has been almost universally recognized within Christianity since at least Late Antiquity . Thus , in almost all Christian traditions today , the New Testament consists of 27 books : the four canonical gospels ( Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John ) , the Acts of the Apostles , the fourteen epistles of Paul , the seven catholic epistles , and the Book of Revelation . The earliest known complete list of the 27 books of the New Testament is found in a letter written by Athanasius , a 4th-century bishop of Alexandria , dated to 367 AD . The 27-book New Testament was first formally canonized during the councils of Hippo ( 393 ) and Carthage ( 397 ) in North Africa . Pope Innocent I ratified the same canon in 405 , but it is probable that a Council in Rome in 382 under Pope Damasus I gave the same list first . These councils also provided the canon of the Old Testament , which included the apocryphal books . There is no scholarly consensus on the date of composition of the latest New Testament texts .",

  "/wiki/Gospel": "Gospel [ note 1 ] originally meant the Christian message itself , but in the 2nd century it came to be used for the books in which the message was set out . The four canonical gospels of Matthew , Mark , Luke and John comprise the first four books of the New Testament of the Bible and were probably written between AD 66 and 110 . All four were anonymous ( the modern names were added in the 2nd century ) , almost certainly none were by eyewitnesses , and all are the end-products of long oral and written transmission , They are a subset of the genre of ancient biography but ancient biographies should not be confused with modern ones , and often included propaganda and kerygma ( preaching ) ; yet while there is no guarantee that the events which they describe are historically accurate , in the quest for the historical Jesus scholars believe that it is possible to differentiate Jesus ' own views from those of his later followers . Many non-canonical gospels were also written , all later than the four canonical gospels , and like them advocating the particular theological views of their various authors .",
  "/wiki/Acts_of_the_Apostles": "The Acts of the Apostles ( Koin\u0113 Greek : \u03a0\u03c1\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f08\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd , Pr\u00e1xeis Apost\u00f3l\u014dn ; Latin : Act\u016bs Apostol\u014drum ) , often referred to simply as Acts , or formally the Book of Acts , is the fifth book of the New Testament ; it tells of the founding of the Christian church and the spread of its message to the Roman Empire . Acts and the Gospel of Luke make up a two-part work , Luke-Acts , by the same anonymous author , usually dated to around 80-90 AD . The first part , the Gospel of Luke , tells how God fulfilled his plan for the world 's salvation through the life , death , and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth , the promised Messiah . Acts continues the story of Christianity in the 1st century , beginning with Jesus 's ascension to Heaven . The early chapters , set in Jerusalem , describe the Day of Pentecost ( the coming of the Holy Spirit ) and the growth of the church in Jerusalem . Initially , the Jews are receptive to the Christian message , but later they turn against the followers of Jesus . Rejected by the Jews , the message is taken to the Gentiles under the guidance of the Apostle Peter . The later chapters tell of Paul 's conversion , his mission in Asia Minor and the Aegean , and finally his imprisonment in Rome , where , as the book ends , he awaits trial . Luke-Acts is an attempt to answer a theological problem , namely how the Messiah of the Jews came to have an overwhelmingly non-Jewish church ; the answer it provides is that the message of Christ was sent to the Gentiles because the Jews rejected it . Luke-Acts can also be seen as a defense of ( or apology for ) the Jesus movement addressed to the Jews : the bulk of the speeches and sermons in Acts are addressed to Jewish audiences , with the Romans serving as external arbiters on disputes concerning Jewish customs and law . On the one hand , Luke portrays the followers of Jesus as a sect of the Jews , and therefore entitled to legal protection as a recognised religion ; on the other , Luke seems unclear as to the future God intends for Jews and Christians , celebrating the Jewishness of Jesus and his immediate followers while also stressing how the Jews had rejected God 's promised Messiah .",

  "/wiki/Pauline_epistles": "The Pauline epistles , also called Epistles of Paul or Letters of Paul , are the thirteen books of the New Testament attributed to Paul the Apostle , although the authorship of some is in dispute . Among these letters are some of the earliest extant Christian documents . They provide an insight into the beliefs and controversies of early Christianity . As part of the canon of the New Testament , they are foundational texts for both Christian theology and ethics . The Epistle to the Hebrews , although it does not bear his name , was traditionally considered Pauline ( although Origen questioned its authorship in the 3rd century C.E . ) , but from the 16th century onwards opinion steadily moved against Pauline authorship and few scholars now ascribe it to Paul , mostly because it does not read like any of his other epistles in style and content . Most scholars agree that Paul actually wrote seven of the Pauline epistles , but that four of the epistles in Paul 's name are pseudepigraphic ( Ephesians , First Timothy , Second Timothy , and Titus ) and that two other epistles are of questionable authorship ( Second Thessalonians and Colossians ) . According to some scholars , Paul wrote these letters with the help of a secretary , or amanuensis , who would have influenced their style , if not their theological content . The Pauline epistles are usually placed between the Acts of the Apostles and the general epistles in modern editions . Most Greek manuscripts , however , place the General epistles first , and a few minuscules ( 175 , 325 , 336 , and 1424 ) place the Pauline epistles at the end of the New Testament .",
