  "/wiki/Grace_Aguilar": "Grace Aguilar ( 2 June 1816 - 16 September 1847 ) was an English novelist , poet and writer on Jewish history and religion . Although she had been writing since childhood , much of her work was published posthumously . Among those are her best known works , the novels Home Influence and A Mother 's Recompense . Aguilar was the eldest child of Sephardic Jewish refugees from Portugal who settled in the London Borough of Hackney . An early illness resulted in her being educated by her parents , especially her mother , who taught her the tenets of Judaism . Later , her father taught the history of Spanish and Portuguese Jews during his own bout with tuberculosis which had led the family to move to the English coast . After surviving the measles at the age of 19 , she began to embark on a serious writing career , even though her physical health never completely recovered . Aguilar 's debut was an anonymous collection of poems , The Magic Wreath of Hidden Flowers . Three years later she translated Isaac Orobio de Castro 's Israel Defended into English at her father 's behest . Later her The Spirit of Judaism drew interest and sales in both Britain and the United States after being published in Philadelphia by Isaac Leeser . He added a preface to the work elucidating his differences with her , the first of many clashes her work would have with mainstream Jewish thought . In the 1840s her novels began to attract regular readers , and Aguilar moved back to London with her parents .",

  "/wiki/Upper_Clapton": "Upper Clapton is a district in the London Borough of Hackney , forming part of Clapton in northeast London , England . Upper Clapton approximates to the northern part of the E5 ( Clapton ) postal district . The district borders the River Lea ( spelled Lea or Lee ) to the east and the border with Lower Clapton to the south is marked by the Lea Bridge and Kenninghall Roads . Neither Upper Clapton nor the wider Clapton area have ever been an administrative unit and consequently their extent has never been formally determined . Describing Upper Clapton as northern E5 is useful but also informal and imperfect , for instance a small area of Clapton Common and the immediately adjacent community is excluded from the postal district despite almost always being publicly viewed as being part of Upper Clapton . As is frequently the case with London districts , these boundaries are often uncertain and overlapping because of the meeting of the developing expansion of the original settlements . Western parts of the area are often considered part of a wider Stamford Hill , understandable perhaps because of the public transport junction and shopping area at Stamford Broadway , and that the Hasidic Jewish community identified as being located in Stamford Hill extends into Upper Clapton .",

  "/wiki/Hackney_Central": "Hackney Central is a sub-district of Hackney in the London Borough of Hackney in London , England and is four miles ( 6.4 km ) northeast of Charing Cross .

The area also includes the central retail area which extends from Hackney Downs station in the west to the Hackney Walk Outlet Village , on Morning Lane and goes in between Wick Road ( Homerton ) and Cassland Road ( South Hackney ) till meeting Hackney Wick , to the east . Hackney Central is the area that once would have been known as Hackney Village . This was a place that flourished from the Tudor period , when principal members of the Court had their houses in the surrounding area , and King Henry VIII of England had a palace ( located near the modern Lea Bridge Road roundabout ) . Hackney Central remained a popular resort for Londoners until the end of the Georgian era , when this suburb of London began to be completely built up . Railways , trams and factories brought an end to Hackney 's rural atmosphere during the Victorian era , and its fortunes declined . The industries of nearby Homerton and the Lee Valley have largely disappeared , leaving the NHS and local council as the largest employers . Successive waves of immigrants , both from abroad and within the United Kingdom , make modern Hackney a culturally vibrant part of inner London , with both the benefits and challenges that this brings . Extensive post-World War II redevelopment replaced much of the housing stock , but the Georgian housing and Victorian terraces that remain have become popular again .",

Until the late 20th century , Wollstonecraft 's life , which encompassed several unconventional personal relationships at the time , received more attention than her writing . Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers , and feminists often cite both her life and her works as important influences . During her brief career , she wrote novels , treatises , a travel narrative , a history of the French Revolution , a conduct book , and a children 's book . Wollstonecraft is best known for A Vindication of the Rights of Woman ( 1792 ) , in which she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men , but appear to be only because they lack education . She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a social order founded on reason . After Wollstonecraft 's death , her widower published a Memoir ( 1798 ) of her life , revealing her unorthodox lifestyle , which inadvertently destroyed her reputation for almost a century . However , with the emergence of the feminist movement at the turn of the twentieth century , Wollstonecraft 's advocacy of women 's equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important . After two ill-fated affairs , with Henry Fuseli and Gilbert Imlay ( by whom she had a daughter , Fanny Imlay ) , Wollstonecraft married the philosopher William Godwin , one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement . Wollstonecraft died at the age of 38 leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts .

She also edited and promoted the works of her husband , the Romantic poet and philosopher Percy Bysshe Shelley . Her father was the political philosopher William Godwin and her mother was the philosopher and feminist Mary Wollstonecraft . Shelley 's mother died less than a month after giving birth to her . She was raised by her father who was able to provide her with a rich if informal education , encouraging her to adhere to his own anarchist political theories . When she was four , her father married a neighbour with whom Shelley came to have a troubled relationship . In 1814 , Shelley began a romance with one of her father 's political followers , Percy Bysshe Shelley , who was already married . Together with her stepsister , Claire Clairmont , she and Percy left for France and travelled through Europe . Upon their return to England , Shelley was pregnant with Percy 's child . Over the next two years , she and Percy faced ostracism , constant debt and the death of their prematurely born daughter . They married in late 1816 , after the suicide of Percy Shelley 's first wife , Harriet . In 1816 , the couple famously spent a summer with Lord Byron , John William Polidori and Claire Clairmont near Geneva , Switzerland , where Shelley conceived the idea for her novel Frankenstein ."
