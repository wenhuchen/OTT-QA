  "/wiki/Special_wards_of_Tokyo": "Special wards ( \u7279\u5225\u533a , tokubetsu-ku ) are a special form of municipalities in Japan under the 1947 Local Autonomy Law . They are city-level wards : primary subdivisions of a prefecture with municipal autonomy largely comparable to other forms of municipalities . Although the autonomy law today allows for special wards to be established in other prefectures , to date , they only exist in the Tokyo Metropolis which consists of 23 special wards and 39 other , ordinary municipalities ( cities , towns and villages ) . The Special wards of Tokyo ( \u6771\u4eac\u7279\u5225\u533a , T\u014dky\u014d tokubetsu-ku ) occupy the land that was Tokyo City in its 1936 borders before it was abolished under the T\u014dj\u014d Cabinet in 1943 to become directly ruled by the prefectural government , then renamed to Metropolitan . During the Occupation of Japan , municipal autonomy was restored to former Tokyo City by the establishment of special wards , each with directly elected mayor and assembly , as in any other city , town or village in Tokyo and the rest of the country . Minority , mostly leftist calls for a restoration of Tokyo City ( \u6771\u4eac\u5e02\u5fa9\u6d3b , T\u014dky\u014d-shi fukkatsu ) were not answered . The question of whether special wards actually are municipalities with full local autonomy rights at all remained a political and legal issue for decades . In Japanese , they are collectively also known as Wards area of Tokyo Metropolis ( \u6771\u4eac\u90fd\u533a\u90e8 , T\u014dky\u014d-to kubu ) , former Tokyo City ( \u65e7\u6771\u4eac\u5e02 , ky\u016b-T\u014dky\u014d-shi ) , or less formally the 23 wards ( 23\u533a , nij\u016bsan-ku ) or just Tokyo ( \u6771\u4eac , T\u014dky\u014d ) if the context makes obvious that this does n't refer to the whole prefecture . Today , all wards refer to themselves as a city in English , but the Japanese designation of special ward ( tokubetsu-ku ) remains unchanged . They are a group of 23 municipalities ; there is no associated single government body separate from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government which governs all 62 municipalities of Tokyo , not only the special wards .",

When Emperor Meiji moved the imperial seat to the city from Kyoto in 1868 , Edo was renamed Tokyo , literally the Eastern Capital . The Tokyo Metropolis formed in 1943 from the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture ( \u6771\u4eac\u5e9c , T\u014dky\u014d-fu ) and the city of Tokyo ( \u6771\u4eac\u5e02 , T\u014dky\u014d-shi ) .
