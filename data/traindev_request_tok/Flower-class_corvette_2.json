  "/wiki/HMS_Abelia_(K184)": "HMS Abelia was a Flower-class corvette that served in the Royal Navy and was built by Harland and Wolff in 1941 . She was launched on 28 November 1940 , and was fitted for minesweeping . She served in World War II ; her commanding officer for parts of 1943 and 1944 was Lieutenant Orme G. Stuart . On 9 January 1944 Abelia encountered a U-boat while on convoy escort duty , and moved to attack with depth charges . Lieutenant Stuart ordered an increase in speed at 950 yards ( 870 m ) to prevent being torpedoed , not knowing that the U-boat was equipped with T5 torpedoes , for which he would have needed to increase speed at 700 yards ( 640 m ) . Abelia was hit and lost her rudder , and the U-boat escaped . She was sold in 1947 and became the merchant vessel Kraft in 1948 . She was renamed Arne Skontorp in 1954 . She was eventually scrapped in December 1966 .",

It is the 12th-largest city in the United Kingdom and the second-largest on the island of Ireland . It had a population of 333,871 as of 2015 [ update ] . Belfast suffered greatly in the Troubles : in the 1970s and 1980s it was reported to be one of the world 's most dangerous cities , with a homicide rate around 31 per 100,000 . By the early 19th century , Belfast became a major port . It played a key role in the Industrial Revolution , becoming the biggest linen-producer in the world , earning it the nickname Linenopolis . By the time it was granted city status in 1888 , it was a major centre of Irish linen production , tobacco-processing and rope-making . Shipbuilding was also a key industry ; the Harland and Wolff shipyard , which built the RMS Titanic , was the world 's biggest shipyard . Belfast as of 2019 [ update ] has a major aerospace and missiles industry . Industrialisation , and the inward migration it brought , made Belfast Northern Ireland 's biggest city and it became the capital of Northern Ireland following the Partition of Ireland in 1922 . Its status as a global industrial centre ended in the decades after the Second World War of 1939-1945 . Belfast is still a major port , with commercial and industrial docks , including the Harland and Wolff shipyard , dominating the Belfast Lough shoreline .",

Although at times they were efficient fleet weapons against enemy naval warships , they were most effectively used in an economic warfare role ( commerce raiding ) and enforcing a naval blockade against enemy shipping . The primary targets of the U-boat campaigns in both wars were the merchant convoys bringing supplies from Canada and other parts of the British Empire , and from the United States to the United Kingdom and ( during the Second World War ) to the Soviet Union and the Allied territories in the Mediterranean . German submarines also destroyed Brazilian merchant ships during World War II , causing Brazil to declare war on both Germany and Italy on 22 August 1942 .

At 592,800 square kilometres ( 228,900 sq mi ) Madagascar is the world 's 2nd largest island country . The nation comprises the island of Madagascar ( the fourth- largest island in the world ) and numerous smaller peripheral islands . Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana , Madagascar split from the Indian subcontinent around 88 million years ago , allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation . Consequently , Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot ; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth . The island 's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats . The archaeological evidence of the earliest human foraging on Madagascar may date up to 10,000 years ago . Human settlement of Madagascar occurred between 350 BC and 550 AD by Indianized Austronesian peoples , arriving on outrigger canoes from Indonesia . The social and religious situation of Indonesia during those times were that of Hinduism and Buddhism , along with native Indonesian culture . These were joined around the 9th century AD by Bantu migrants crossing the Mozambique Channel from East Africa . Other groups continued to settle on Madagascar over time , each one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life . The Malagasy ethnic group is often divided into 18 or more subgroups , of which the largest are the Merina of the central highlands .",

The town was originally known as Inderawuda and was founded around 700 AD by Saint John of Beverley during the time of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria . After a period of Viking control , it passed to the Cerdic dynasty , a period during which it gained prominence in terms of religious importance in Great Britain . It continued to grow especially under the Normans when its trading industry was first established . A place of pilgrimage throughout the Middle Ages due to its founder , it eventually became a significant wool-trading town . Beverley was once the tenth-largest town in England , as well as one of the richest , because of its wool and the pilgrims who came to venerate its founding saint , John of Beverley . After the Reformation , the stature of Beverley was much reduced . In the 20th century , Beverley was the administrative centre of the local government district of the Borough of Beverley ( 1974-1996 ) .
