He rose to prominence as a pioneer of the 1960s French New Wave film movement . During his early career as a film critic , Godard criticized mainstream French cinema 's Tradition of Quality , which emphasized established convention over innovation and experimentation . In response , he and like-minded critics began to make their own films . Many of Godard 's films challenge the conventions of traditional Hollywood in addition to French cinema . In 1964 , Godard described his and his colleagues ' impact : We barged into the cinema like cavemen into the Versailles of Louis XV . He is often considered the most radical French filmmaker of the 1960s and 1970s ; his approach in film conventions , politics and philosophies made him arguably the most influential director of the French New Wave . Along with showing knowledge of film history through homages and references , several of his films expressed his political views ; he was an avid reader of existential and Marxist philosophy . Since the New Wave , his politics have been much less radical and his recent films are about representation and human conflict from a humanist , and a Marxist perspective . In a 2002 Sight & Sound poll , Godard ranked third in the critics ' top ten directors of all time ( which was put together by assembling the directors of the individual films for which the critics voted ) . He is said to have created one of the largest bodies of critical analysis of any filmmaker since the mid-twentieth century .

These films were contemporary with , and associated with , the French New Wave ( la nouvelle vague ) , though Resnais did not regard himself as being fully part of that movement . He had closer links to the Left Bank group of authors and filmmakers who shared a commitment to modernism and an interest in left-wing politics . He also established a regular practice of working on his films in collaboration with writers previously unconnected with the cinema such as Jean Cayrol , Marguerite Duras , Alain Robbe-Grillet , Jorge Sempr\u00fan and Jacques Sternberg . In later films , Resnais moved away from the overtly political topics of some previous works and developed his interests in an interaction between cinema and other cultural forms , including theatre , music , and comic books . This led to imaginative adaptations of plays by Alan Ayckbourn , Henri Bernstein and Jean Anouilh , as well as films featuring various kinds of popular song . His films frequently explore the relationship between consciousness , memory , and the imagination , and he was noted for devising innovative formal structures for his narratives .

The 90-minute program , produced by George Crile III and narrated by Mike Wallace , asserted that in 1967 intelligence officers under General William Westmoreland , the commander of Military Assistance Command , Vietnam ( MAC-V ) , had manipulated intelligence estimates in order to show far fewer communist personnel in South Vietnam than there actually were , thereby creating the impression that the Vietnam War was being won . In response , Westmoreland publicly rebuked these claims and demanded 45 minutes of open airtime to rebut them . CBS refused the request , so Westmoreland sued Crile , Wallace , and CBS for libel on September 13 . A conservative public-interest law firm , Capital Legal Foundation , brought the suit on Westmoreland 's behalf , and its president , Dan Burt , served as Westmoreland 's pro bono attorney . The suit was funded by grants from several conservative organizations , such as the Richard Mellon Scaife Foundation , the John M. Olin Foundation , and the Smith Richardson Foundation whose goals were to kill CBS Reports and turn back the 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan rule , which required that public officials or figures prove actual malice to win a libel suit against the press . The case went to trial two years later . The trial , Westmoreland v. CBS , was approaching its end in 1985 when Westmoreland suddenly dropped his lawsuit , citing a statement by CBS that Westmoreland interpreted as an apology . CBS did not retract anything that had been said in the broadcast , but stated that it had never intended to assert , and does not believe , that General Westmoreland was unpatriotic or disloyal in performing his duties as he saw them . CBS subsequently lost its libel insurance over the case . Additionally , serious , in-depth documentaries became produced far less frequently on CBS and the other two major networks of the time than had been the case during the 1960s and 1970s , a development that perhaps coincides with less aggressive investigative reporting on television on all news programs generally since the time of the suit .

  "/wiki/William_Westmoreland": "William Childs Westmoreland ( March 26 , 1914 - July 18 , 2005 ) was a United States Army General , most notably commander of United States forces during the Vietnam War from 1964 to 1968 . He served as Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1968 to 1972 . Westmoreland adopted a strategy of attrition against the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army , attempting to drain them of manpower and supplies . He also made use of the United States ' edge in artillery and air power , both in tactical confrontations and in relentless strategic bombing of North Vietnam . Many of the battles in Vietnam were technically United States victories , with the United States Army in control of the field afterward ; holding territory gained this way proved difficult , however . Public support for the war eventually diminished , especially after the Battle of Khe Sanh and the Tet Offensive in 1968 . By the time he was re-assigned as Army Chief of Staff , United States military forces in Vietnam had reached a peak of 535,000 personnel . Westmoreland 's strategy was ultimately politically unsuccessful . Growing United States casualties and the draft undermined United States support for the war , while large-scale casualties among non-combatants weakened South Vietnamese support . This also failed to weaken North Vietnam 's will to fight , and the Government of South Vietnam - a factor largely out of Westmoreland 's control - never succeeded in establishing enough legitimacy to quell defections to the Viet Cong .",
