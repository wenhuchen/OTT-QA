  "/wiki/Media_market": "A media market , broadcast market , media region , designated market area ( DMA ) , television market area , or simply market is a region where the population can receive the same ( or similar ) television and radio station offerings , and may also include other types of media including newspapers and Internet content . They can coincide or overlap with one or more metropolitan areas , though rural regions with few significant population centers can also be designated as markets . Conversely , very large metropolitan areas can sometimes be subdivided into multiple segments . Market regions may overlap , meaning that people residing on the edge of one media market may be able to receive content from other nearby markets . They are widely used in audience measurements , which are compiled in the United States by Nielsen Media Research . Nielsen measures both television and radio audiences since its acquisition of Arbitron , which was completed in September 2013 . Markets are identified by the largest city , which is usually located in the center of the market region . However , geography and the fact that some metropolitan areas have large cities separated by some distance can make markets have unusual shapes and result in two , three , or more names being used to identify a single region ( such as Wichita-Hutchinson , Kansas ; Chico-Redding , California ; Albany-Schenectady-Troy , New York ; and Harrisburg-Lebanon-Lancaster-York , Pennsylvania ) . In the United States , radio markets are generally a bit smaller than their television counterparts , as broadcast power restrictions are stricter for radio than TV , and TV reaches further via cable . AM band and FM band radio ratings are sometimes separated , as are broadcast and cable television . Market researchers also subdivide ratings demographically between different age groups , genders , and ethnic backgrounds ; as well as psychographically between income levels and other non-physical factors . This information is used by advertisers to determine how to reach a specific audience .",
  "/wiki/Call_sign": "In broadcasting and radio communications , a call sign ( also known as a call name or call letters - and historically as a call signal - or abbreviated as a call ) is a unique designation for a transmitter station . In the United States of America , they are used for all FCC-licensed transmitters . A call sign can be formally assigned by a government agency , informally adopted by individuals or organizations , or even cryptographically encoded to disguise a station 's identity . The use of call signs as unique identifiers dates to the landline railroad telegraph system . Because there was only one telegraph line linking all railroad stations , there needed to be a way to address each one when sending a telegram . In order to save time , two-letter identifiers were adopted for this purpose . This pattern continued in radiotelegraph operation ; radio companies initially assigned two-letter identifiers to coastal stations and stations aboard ships at sea . These were not globally unique , so a one-letter company identifier ( for instance , 'M ' and two letters as a Marconi station ) was later added . By 1912 , the need to quickly identify stations operated by multiple companies in multiple nations required an international standard ; an ITU prefix would be used to identify a country , and the rest of the call sign an individual station in that country .",
  "/wiki/Network_affiliate": "In the broadcasting industry ( particularly in North America ) , a network affiliate or affiliated station is a local broadcaster , owned by a company other than the owner of the network , which carries some or all of the lineup of television programs or radio programs of a television or radio network . This distinguishes such a television or radio station from an owned-and-operated station ( O & O ) , which is owned by the parent network . Notwithstanding this distinction , it is common in informal speech ( even for networks or O & Os themselves ) to refer to any station , O & O or otherwise , that carries a particular network 's programming as an affiliate , or to refer to the status of carrying such programming in a given market as an affiliation .",

  "/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company": "The Fox Broadcasting Company ( often shortened to Fox and stylized in all caps as FOX ) is an American broadcast television network that is a flagship property of the Fox Corporation . The network is headquartered at 1211 Avenue of the Americas in New York City , with additional offices at the Fox Broadcasting Center ( also in New York ) and at the Fox Television Center in Los Angeles . Launched on October 9 , 1986 , as a competitor to the Big Three television networks ( ABC , CBS and NBC ) , Fox went on to become the most successful attempt at a fourth television network . It was the highest-rated network in the 18-49 demographic from 2004 to 2012 , and earned the position as the most-watched American television network in total viewership during the 2007-08 season . Fox and its affiliated companies operate many entertainment channels in international markets , although these do not necessarily air the same programming as the U.S. network . Most viewers in Canada have access to at least one U.S.-based Fox affiliate , either free-to-air or through a pay television provider , although Fox 's National Football League broadcasts and most of its prime time programming are subject to simultaneous substitution regulations for pay television providers imposed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) to protect rights held by domestically based networks . Fox is named after what was once called 20th Century Fox , its original corporate sibling ( and still its major supplier of programming , despite its acquisition by Disney ) and indirectly for producer William Fox , who founded one of the movie studio 's predecessors , Fox Film . Fox is a member of the North American Broadcasters Association and the National Association of Broadcasters .",

  "/wiki/CBS": "CBS ( an initialism of the network 's former name , the Columbia Broadcasting System ) is an American English-language commercial broadcast television and radio network that is the flagship property of the CBS Entertainment Group division of ViacomCBS . The company is headquartered at the CBS Building in New York City with major production facilities and operations in New York City ( at the CBS Broadcast Center ) and Los Angeles ( at CBS Television City and the CBS Studio Center ) . CBS is sometimes referred to as the Eye Network , in reference to the company 's trademark symbol , in use since 1951 . It has also been called the Tiffany Network , alluding to the perceived high quality of CBS programming during the tenure of William S. Paley . It can also refer to some of CBS 's first demonstrations of color television , which were held in a former Tiffany & Co. building in New York City in 1950 . The network has its origins in United Independent Broadcasters Inc. , a collection of 16 radio stations purchased by Paley in 1928 and renamed the Columbia Broadcasting System . Under Paley 's guidance , CBS would first become one of the largest radio networks in the United States , and eventually one of the Big Three American broadcast television networks . In 1974 CBS dropped its former full name and became known simply as CBS , Inc . The Westinghouse Electric Corporation acquired the network in 1995 , renamed its corporate entity to the current CBS Broadcasting , Inc. in 1997 , and eventually adopted the name of the company it had acquired to become CBS Corporation . In 2000 CBS came under the control of the first Viacom , which was formed as a spin-off of CBS in 1971 . In late 2005 , Viacom split itself into two separate companies and re-established CBS Corporation through the spin-off of its broadcast television , radio , and select cable television and non-broadcasting assets , with the CBS television network at its core . CBS Corporation was controlled by Sumner Redstone through National Amusements , which also controlled the second Viacom until December 4 , 2019 , when the two separated companies agreed to re-merge to become the new single entity known as ViacomCBS .",
