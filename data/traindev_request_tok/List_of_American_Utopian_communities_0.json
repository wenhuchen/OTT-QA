  "/wiki/George_Rapp": "John George Rapp ( German : Johann Georg Rapp ; November 1 , 1757 in Iptingen , Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg - August 7 , 1847 in Economy , Pennsylvania ) was the founder of the religious sect called Harmonists , Harmonites , Rappites , or the Harmony Society . Born in Iptingen , Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg , Germany , Rapp became inspired by the philosophies of Jakob B\u00f6hme , Philipp Jakob Spener , and Emanuel Swedenborg , among others . In the 1780s , George Rapp began preaching and soon started to gather a group of his own followers . His group officially split with the Lutheran Church in 1785 and was promptly banned from meeting . The persecution that Rapp and his followers experienced caused them to leave Germany and come to the United States in 1803 . Rapp was a Pietist , and a number of his beliefs were shared by the Anabaptists , as well as groups such as the Shakers . Rapp 's religious beliefs and philosophy were the cement that held his community together both in Germany and in America - a Christian community and commune , which in America organized as the Harmony Society . The Harmony Society built three American towns , became rich , famous , and survived for 100 years - roughly from 1805 until 1905 .",
  "/wiki/Harmony_Society": "The Harmony Society was a Christian theosophy and pietist society founded in Iptingen , Germany , in 1785 . Due to religious persecution by the Lutheran Church and the government in W\u00fcrttemberg , the group moved to the United States , where representatives initially purchased land in Butler County , Pennsylvania . On February 15 , 1805 , the group of approximately 400 followers formally organized the Harmony Society , placing all their goods in common . Under its founder and spiritual leader , Johann Georg Rapp ( 1757-1847 ) ; Frederick ( Reichert ) Rapp ( 1775-1834 ) , his adopted son who managed its business affairs ; and their associates , the Society existed for one hundred years , roughly from 1805 until 1905 . Members were known as Harmonists , Harmonites , or Rappites .

  "/wiki/Christian_theosophy": "Christian theosophy , also known as Boehmian theosophy and theosophy , refers to a range of positions within Christianity which focus on the attainment of direct , unmediated knowledge of the nature of divinity and the origin and purpose of the universe . They have been characterized as mystical philosophies . Theosophy is considered part of Western esotericism , which believes that hidden knowledge or wisdom from the ancient past offers a path to enlightenment and salvation . Christian theosophy belongs essentially to the Judeo-Christian tradition . The foundation of Christian theosophy is usually attributed to the German philosopher Jakob B\u00f6hme . Jewish Kabbalah was also formative for Christian theosophy from Boehme on . In 1875 , the term theosophy was adopted and revived by the Theosophical Society , an esoteric organisation which spawned a spiritual movement also called Theosophy . In the twentieth century , theosophy became the object of study for various scholars of Western esotericism .",
  "/wiki/Pietism": "Pietism ( /\u02c8pa\u026a\u026at\u026az\u0259m/ ) is a movement within Lutheranism that combines its emphasis on biblical doctrine with the Reformed emphasis on individual piety and living a vigorous Christian life . Although the movement initially was active exclusively within Lutheranism , it had a tremendous impact on Protestantism worldwide , particularly in North America and Europe . Pietism originated in modern Germany in the late 17th century with the work of Philipp Spener , a Lutheran theologian whose emphasis on personal transformation through spiritual rebirth and renewal , individual devotion , and piety laid the foundations for the movement . Although Spener did not directly advocate the quietistic , legalistic , and semi-separatist practices of Pietism , they were more or less involved in the positions he assumed or the practices which he encouraged . Pietism spread from Germany to Switzerland and the rest of German-speaking Europe , to Scandinavia and the Baltics ( where it was heavily influential , leaving a permanent mark on the region 's dominant Lutheranism , with figures like Hans Nielsen Hauge in Norway , Peter Spaak and Carl Olof Rosenius in Sweden , Katarina Asplund in Finland , and Barbara von Kr\u00fcdener in the Baltics ) , and to the rest of Europe . It was further taken to North America , primarily by German and Scandinavian immigrants . There , it influenced Protestants of other ethnic backgrounds , contributing to the 18th-century foundation of evangelicalism , a movement within Protestantism that today has some 300 million followers . In the middle of the 19th century , Lars Levi Laestadius spearheaded a Pietist revival in Scandinavia that upheld what came to be known as Laestadian Lutheran theology , which is adhered to today by the Laestadian Lutheran Church as well as by several congregations within other mainstream Lutheran Churches , such as the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland . The Eielsen Synod and Association of Free Lutheran Congregations are Pietist Lutheran bodies that emerged in the Pietist Lutheran movement in Norway , which was spearheaded by Hans Nielsen Hauge . In 1900 , the Church of the Lutheran Brethren was founded and it adheres to Pietist Lutheran theology , emphasizing a personal conversion experience . Whereas Pietistic Lutherans stayed within the Lutheran tradition , adherents of a related movement known as Radical Pietism believed in separating from the established Lutheran Churches . Some of the theological tenets of Pietism also influenced other traditions of Protestantism , inspiring the Anglican priest John Wesley to begin the Methodist movement and Alexander Mack to begin the Anabaptist Brethren movement .",

The same year , she founded the Nashoba Commune in Tennessee , as a utopian community to demonstrate how to prepare slaves for eventual emancipation , but the project lasted only five years . In the late 1820s Wright was the first woman lecturer to speak publicly before gatherings of men and women in the United States about political and social-reform issues . She advocated for universal education , the emancipation of slaves , birth control , equal rights , sexual freedom , legal rights for married women , and liberal divorce laws . Wright was also vocal in her opposition to organized religion and capital punishment . The clergy and the press harshly criticized Wright 's radical views . Her public lectures in the United States led to the establishment of Fanny Wright societies and her association with the Working Men 's Party , organized in New York City in 1829 , became so strong that its opponents called the partys slate of candidates the Fanny Wright ticket . Wright also wrote about political and social reforms , which included Views of Society and Manners in America ( 1821 ) , a memoir of her travels that provides her observations of early democratic political and social institutions in the United States . She also outlined her position on emancipation in A Plan for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery in the United States Without Danger of Loss to the Citizens of the South ( 1825 ) . In addition , Wright co-edited The New Harmony and Nashoba Gazette or Free Inquirer with Robert Dale Owen in New Harmony , Indiana , as well as the Free Enquirer in New York City in 1829 , and , later , The Sentinel ( renamed New York Sentinel and Working Man 's Advocate ) .

Established by the Harmony Society in 1814 under the leadership of George Rapp , the town was originally known as Harmony ( also called Harmonie , or New Harmony ) . In its early years the 20,000-acre ( 8,100 ha ) settlement was the home of Lutherans who had separated from the official church in the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg and immigrated to the United States . The Harmonists built a new town in the wilderness , but in 1824 they decided to sell their property and return to Pennsylvania . Robert Owen , a Welsh industrialist and social reformer , purchased the town in 1825 with the intention of creating a new utopian community and renamed it New Harmony . While the Owenite social experiment failed two years after it began , the community made some important contributions to American society . New Harmony became known as a center for advances in education and scientific research . Town residents established the first free library , a civic drama club , and a public school system open to men and women . Its prominent citizens included Owen 's sons : Robert Dale Owen , an Indiana congressman and social reformer who sponsored legislation to create the Smithsonian Institution ; David Dale Owen , a noted state and federal geologist ; William Owen , a New Harmony businessman ; and Richard Owen , Indiana state geologist , Indiana University professor , and first president of Purdue University .

  "/wiki/Libertarian_socialist": "Libertarian socialism , also referred to as anarcho-socialism , anarchist socialism , free socialism , stateless socialism , socialist anarchism and socialist libertarianism , is a set of anti-authoritarian , anti-statist and libertarian political philosophies within the socialist movement which rejects the conception of socialism as a form where the state retains centralized control of the economy . Overlapping with anarchism and libertarianism , it criticizes wage labour relationships within the workplace , emphasizing workers ' self-management of the workplace and decentralized structures of political organization . Libertarian socialism often rejects the state itself and asserts that a society based on freedom and justice can be achieved through abolishing authoritarian institutions that control certain means of production and subordinate the majority to an owning class or political and economic elite . Libertarian socialists advocate for decentralized structures based on direct democracy and federal or confederal associations such as citizens'/popular assemblies , cooperatives , libertarian municipalism , trade unions and workers ' councils . All of this is generally done within a general call for libertarian and voluntary human relationships through the identification , criticism and practical dismantling of illegitimate authority in all aspects of human life .

Founded as a joint stock company , it promised its participants a portion of the profits from the farm in exchange for performing an equal share of the work . Brook Farmers believed that by sharing the workload , ample time would be available for leisure activities and intellectual pursuits . Life on Brook Farm was based on balancing labor and leisure while working together for the benefit of the greater community . Each member could choose to do whatever work they found most appealing and all were paid equally , including women . Revenue for the community came from farming and from selling handmade products like clothing as well as through fees paid by the many visitors to Brook Farm . The main source of income was the school , which was overseen by Mrs. Ripley . A pre-school , primary school , and a college preparatory school attracted children internationally and each child was charged for his or her education . Adult education was also offered .

It arose as a reaction , to protest against the general state of intellectualism and spirituality at the time . The doctrine of the Unitarian church as taught at Harvard Divinity School was closely related . Transcendentalism emerged from English and German Romanticism , the Biblical criticism of Johann Gottfried Herder and Friedrich Schleiermacher , the skepticism of David Hume , and the transcendental philosophy of Immanuel Kant and German Idealism . Miller and Versluis regard Emanuel Swedenborg as a pervasive influence on transcendentalism . It was also strongly influenced by Hindu texts on philosophy of the mind and spirituality , especially the Upanishads . A core belief of transcendentalism is in the inherent goodness of people and nature . Adherents believe that society and its institutions have corrupted the purity of the individual , and they have faith that people are at their best when truly self-reliant and independent . Transcendentalism emphasizes subjective intuition over objective empiricism . Adherents believe that individuals are capable of generating completely original insights with little attention and deference to past masters .",

Typically , these particular brands of philosophy are Hellenistic ones and those who most arduously commit themselves to this lifestyle may be considered philosophers . A philosopher is one who challenges what is thought to be common sense , does n't know when to stop asking questions , and reexamines the old ways of thought . In a modern sense , a philosopher is an intellectual who has contributed in one or more branches of philosophy , such as aesthetics , ethics , epistemology , logic , metaphysics , social theory , and political philosophy .

  "/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States": "Abolitionism ( or the Anti-Slavery Movement ) in the United States of America was the movement which sought to end slavery in the United States immediately , active both before and during the American Civil War . In the Americas and western Europe , abolitionism was a movement which sought to end the Atlantic slave trade and set slaves free . In the 17th century , enlightenment thinkers condemned slavery on humanistic grounds and English Quakers and some Evangelical denominations condemned slavery as un-Christian . At that time , most slaves were Africans , but thousands of Native Americans were also enslaved . In the 18th century , as many as six million Africans were transported to the Americas as slaves , at least a third of them on British ships to North America . The colony of Georgia originally prohibited slavery within its territory , and thereafter , abolition was part of the message of the First Great Awakening of the 1730s and 1740s in the Thirteen Colonies . During the Age of Enlightenment rationalist thinkers criticized slavery for violating people 's natural rights . A member of the British Parliament , James Edward Oglethorpe , was among the first to articulate the Enlightenment case against slavery . The founder of the Province of Georgia , Oglethorpe banned slavery on humanistic grounds . He argued against it in Parliament and eventually encouraged his friends Granville Sharp and Hannah More to vigorously pursue the cause . Soon after his death in 1785 , Sharp and More joined with William Wilberforce and others in forming the Clapham Sect .

  "/wiki/Spiritualism": "Spiritualism is a religious movement based on the belief that the spirits of the dead exist and have both the ability and the inclination to communicate with the living . The afterlife , or the spirit world , is seen by spiritualists , not as a static place , but as one in which spirits continue to evolve . These two beliefs - that contact with spirits is possible , and that spirits are more advanced than humans - lead spiritualists to a third belief : that spirits are capable of providing useful knowledge about moral and ethical issues , as well as about the nature of God . Some spiritualists will speak of a concept which they refer to as spirit guides - specific spirits , often contacted , who are relied upon for spiritual guidance . Spiritism , a branch of spiritualism developed by Allan Kardec and today practiced mostly in Continental Europe and Latin America , especially in Brazil , emphasizes reincarnation . Spiritualism developed and reached its peak growth in membership from the 1840s to the 1920s , especially in English-speaking countries . By 1897 , spiritualism was said to have more than eight million followers in the United States and Europe , mostly drawn from the middle and upper classes . Spiritualism flourished for a half century without canonical texts or formal organization , attaining cohesion through periodicals , tours by trance lecturers , camp meetings , and the missionary activities of accomplished mediums . Many prominent spiritualists were women , and like most spiritualists , supported causes such as the abolition of slavery and women 's suffrage . By the late 1880s the credibility of the informal movement had weakened due to accusations of fraud perpetrated by mediums , and formal spiritualist organizations began to appear . Spiritualism is currently practiced primarily through various denominational spiritualist churches in the United States , Canada and the United Kingdom .",

Lane purchased what was known as the Wyman farm and its 90 acres ( 36 ha ) , which also included a dilapidated house and barn . Residents of Fruitlands ate no animal substances , drank only water , bathed in unheated water and no artificial light would prolong dark hours or cost them the brightness of morning . Additionally , property was held communally , and no animal labor was used . The community was short-lived and lasted only seven months . It was dependent on farming , which turned out to be too difficult . The original farmhouse , along with other historic buildings from the area , is now a part of Fruitlands Museum .",
  "/wiki/Amos_Bronson_Alcott": "Amos Bronson Alcott ( /\u02c8\u0254\u02d0lk\u0259t , -k\u026at/ ; November 29 , 1799 - March 4 , 1888 ) was an American teacher , writer , philosopher , and reformer . As an educator , Alcott pioneered new ways of interacting with young students , focusing on a conversational style , and avoided traditional punishment . He hoped to perfect the human spirit and , to that end , advocated a vegan diet before the term was coined . He was also an abolitionist and an advocate for women 's rights . Born in Wolcott , Connecticut in 1799 , Alcott had only minimal formal schooling before attempting a career as a traveling salesman . Worried about how the itinerant life might have a negative impact on his soul , he turned to teaching . His innovative methods , however , were controversial , and he rarely stayed in one place very long . His most well-known teaching position was at the Temple School in Boston . His experience there was turned into two books : Records of a School and Conversations with Children on the Gospels . Alcott became friends with Ralph Waldo Emerson and became a major figure in transcendentalism . His writings on behalf of that movement , however , are heavily criticized for being incoherent . Based on his ideas for human perfection , Alcott founded Fruitlands , a transcendentalist experiment in community living .",
  "/wiki/Skaneateles_Community": "Skaneateles Community was a utopian social experiment established in 1843 by the Society for Universal Inquiry and Reform in a 350-acre ( 1.4 km2 ) farm near Mottville , in Skaneateles in Upstate New York . It was one of several communities established by the Society prior to the Civil War . The community survived for three years . John A. Collins ( 1810-1900 ) , a noted abolitionist , became the community leader . During its life , the community had about a hundred members who shared living quarters as well as work on the farm , and in the sawmill and print shop . Although economically viable , internal differences and Collins ' waning leadership resulted in the dissolution of the community . By 1846 , Collins had reverted to theism and the Whig party , and had become the editor of a daily Whig journal published in Dayton , Ohio . He wrote an autobiographical essay that included a short description of his motives in establishing the community , attributing its failure to human nature :",
  "/wiki/Alasa_Farms": "Alasa Farms , also known as the Sodus Bay Shaker Tract and Sodus Bay Phalanx , is a historic farm complex located near Alton in Wayne County , New York . The farm complex was originally built and occupied by the Sodus Bay Shakers , an official branch of the United Society of Believers in Christ 's Second Appearing , from 1826 to 1838 . It was then briefly occupied by a local lawyer Alexander Duncan and his family . Between 1844 and 1846 , the property was home to the Sodus Bay Phalanx of the Fourier Society ; a group devoted to establishing utopian communities based on communal living . After 1846 , the property lay vacant until 1868 .

  "/wiki/Owenism": "Owenism is the utopian socialist philosophy of 19th-century social reformer Robert Owen and his followers and successors , who are known as Owenites . Owenism aimed for radical reform of society and is considered a forerunner of the cooperative movement . The Owenite movement undertook several experiments in establishment of utopian communities organized according to communitarian and cooperative principles . One of the best known of these efforts , which were largely unsuccessful , was the project at New Harmony , Indiana , which started in 1825 and was abandoned by 1829 . Owenism is also closely associated with the development of the British trade union movement , and with the spread of the Mechanics ' Institute movement .",
  "/wiki/Anarchism": "Anarchism is a radical political movement that is highly skeptical towards authority and rejects all forms of unjust hierarchy . It calls for the abolition of the state which it holds to be undesirable , unnecessary , and harmful . Anarchism advocates for the replacement of the state with stateless societies or other forms of free associations . Anarchism 's timeline stretches back to prehistory when people lived in anarchistic societies long before the establishment of formal states , kingdoms or empires . With the rise of organised hierarchical bodies , skepticism towards authority also rose , but it was not until the 19th century a self-conscious political movement was formed . During the latest half of 19th and the first decades of 20th century , the anarchist movement flourished to most parts of the world , and had a significant role in worker 's struggles for emancipation . Various branches of anarchism were espoused during those times . Anarchists took part in several revolutions , most notably in the Spanish Civil War , where they were crushed by the fascists forces in 1939 , marking the end of the classical era of anarchism . In the latest decades of the 20th century , the anarchist movement nonetheless became relevant and vivid once more . Anarchism employ various tactics in order to meet their ideal ends ; these can be broadly separated in revolutionary and evolutionary tactics . There is significant overlap between the two legs which are merely descriptive . Revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state , and have taken a violent turn in the past .",

  "/wiki/Utopian_socialism": "Utopian socialism is the first current of modern socialism and socialist thought as exemplified by the work of Henri de Saint-Simon , Charles Fourier , \u00c9tienne Cabet , Robert Owen and Henry George . Utopian socialism is often described as the presentation of visions and outlines for imaginary or futuristic ideal societies , with positive ideals being the main reason for moving society in such a direction . Later socialists and critics of utopian socialism viewed utopian socialism as not being grounded in actual material conditions of existing society and in some cases as reactionary . These visions of ideal societies competed with Marxist-inspired revolutionary social democratic movements . As a term or label , it is most often applied to , or used to define , those socialists who lived in the first quarter of the 19th century who were ascribed the label utopian by later socialists as a pejorative in order to imply naivet\u00e9 and to dismiss their ideas as fanciful and unrealistic . A similar school of thought that emerged in the early 20th century which makes the case for socialism on moral grounds is ethical socialism . One key difference between utopian socialists and other socialists ( including most anarchists ) is that utopian socialists generally do not believe any form of class struggle or social revolution is necessary for socialism to emerge . Utopian socialists believe that people of all classes can voluntarily adopt their plan for society if it is presented convincingly . They feel their form of cooperative socialism can be established among like-minded people within the existing society and that their small communities can demonstrate the feasibility of their plan for society .",
  "/wiki/Communalism": "Communalism usually refers to a system that integrates communal ownership and federations of highly localized independent communities . A prominent libertarian socialist , Murray Bookchin , defines the communalist political philosophy that he developed as a theory of government or a system of government in which independent communes participate in a federation , as well as the principles and practice of communal ownership . The term 'government ' in this case does not imply acceptance of a state or top-down hierarchy . This usage of communalism appears to have emerged during the late 20th century to distinguish commune-based systems from other political movements or governments espousing ( if not actually practicing ) similar ideas . In particular , earlier communities and movements advocating such practices were often described as anarchist , socialist or communist . Many historical communities practicing utopian socialism or anarcho-communism did implement internal rules of communalist property ownership in the context of federated communalism . It is at least theoretically possible for a federation of communes to include communes which do not practice communalist rules of property , which is to say , that the overall national government may be a federation of communes , but that private property rather than communalist property is the order within each such commune . Karl Marx , often viewed as the founder of modern communism , criticized older forms , including primitive communism or utopian socialism , as poorly conceived or prone to disintegration in practice . Communalism in the form described above is distinct from the predominant usage in South Asian forms of English : allegiance to a particular ethnic or religious group rather than to a broader society . As such , this usage is synonymous with sectarianism and associated with communal violence .",

The movement split several times due to factional disagreements . The last community of Icarians , located a few miles outside Corning , Iowa , disbanded voluntarily in 1898 . The 46 years of tenure at this location made the Corning Icarian Colony one of the longest-lived non-religious communal living experiments in US history .",

Cabet became the most popular socialist advocate of his day , with a special appeal to artisans who were being undercut by factories , and his communitarian ideals ( based on the Golden Rule ) later influenced Karl Marx and others . Cabet published Voyage en Icarie in French in 1839 ( and in English in 1840 as Travels in Icaria ) , in which he proposed replacing capitalist production with workers ' cooperatives . Recurrent problems with French officials ( a treason conviction in 1834 resulted in five years ' exile in England ) , led him to emigrate to the United States in 1848 . Cabet founded utopian communities in Texas and Illinois , but was again undercut , this time by recurring feuds with his followers .",
