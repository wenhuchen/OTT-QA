The Taliban recognized him as the Commander of the Faithful or the Supreme Leader of the Muslims until being succeeded by Mullah Akhtar Mansour in 2015 . Some sources described Mullah Omar as Head of the Supreme Council of Afghanistan . The Supreme Council was initially established at Kandahar in 1994 . Born into a poor family with no political connections , Omar joined the Afghan mujahideen in their war against the Soviet Union and the communist Democratic Republic of Afghanistan during the 1980s . He founded the Taliban in 1994 and by 1995 had captured much of southern Afghanistan ; in September 1996 , the Taliban took Kabul , the country 's capital . During his tenure as Emir of Afghanistan , Omar seldom left the city of Kandahar and rarely met with outsiders . He was known for speaking little and living in austere conditions . He became wanted by the U.S. Government after being accused of harbouring Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda militants after the September 11 attacks .

His death was kept secret by the Taliban for two years until it was revealed in July 2015 by Afghanistan 's National Directorate of Security .",
  "/wiki/Guantanamo_captive": "The Guantanamo Bay detention camp is a United States military prison located within Guantanamo Bay Naval Base , also referred to as Guant\u00e1namo , G-Bay , GTMO , and Gitmo ( /\u02c8\u0261\u026atmo\u028a/ ) , which is on the coast of Guant\u00e1namo Bay in Cuba . Indefinite detention without trial and torture have led the operations of this camp to be considered a major breach of human rights by Amnesty International and a violation of Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth amendments of the United States Constitution . The camp was established by President George W. Bush 's administration in 2002 during the War on Terror . His successor , President Barack Obama , promised that he would close it , but met strong bipartisan opposition from Congress , which passed laws to prohibit detainees from Guantanamo being imprisoned in the U.S. During Obama 's administration , the number of inmates was reduced from about 245 to 41 ; most former detainees were freed and transferred to other countries . In January 2018 , President Donald Trump signed an executive order to keep the detention camp open indefinitely .

  "/wiki/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal": "The Combatant Status Review Tribunals ( CSRT ) were a set of tribunals for confirming whether detainees held by the United States at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp had been correctly designated as enemy combatants .

  "/wiki/Taliban": "The Taliban ( Pashto : \u0637\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u0646 , \u1e6d\u0101lib\u0101n students ) or Taleban , who refer to themselves as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan ( IEA ) , are a Sunni Islamic fundamentalist political movement and military organization in Afghanistan currently waging war ( an insurgency , or jihad ) within that country . Since 2016 , the Taliban 's leader is Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada . From 1996 to 2001 , the Taliban held power over roughly three quarters of Afghanistan , and enforced there a strict interpretation of Sharia , or Islamic law . The Taliban emerged in 1994 as one of the prominent factions in the Afghan Civil War and largely consisted of students ( talib ) from the Pashtun areas of eastern and southern Afghanistan who had been educated in traditional Islamic schools , and fought during the Soviet-Afghan War . Under the leadership of Mohammed Omar , the movement spread throughout most of Afghanistan , sequestering power from the Mujahideen warlords . The totalitarian Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan was established in 1996 and the Afghan capital was transferred to Kandahar . It held control of most of the country until being overthrown after the American-led invasion of Afghanistan in December 2001 following the September 11 attacks . At its peak , formal diplomatic recognition of the Taliban 's government was acknowledged by only three nations : Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , and the United Arab Emirates . The group later regrouped as an insurgency movement to fight the American-backed Karzai administration and the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) in the War in Afghanistan . The Taliban have been condemned internationally for the harsh enforcement of their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law , which has resulted in the brutal treatment of many Afghans , especially women . During their rule from 1996 to 2001 , the Taliban and their allies committed massacres against Afghan civilians , denied UN food supplies to 160,000 starving civilians and conducted a policy of scorched earth , burning vast areas of fertile land and destroying tens of thousands of homes . According to the United Nations , the Taliban and their allies were responsible for 76% of Afghan civilian casualties in 2010 , 80% in 2011 , and 80% in 2012 .",
