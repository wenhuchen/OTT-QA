  "/wiki/Cochlear_implant": "A cochlear implant ( CI ) is a surgically implanted neuroprosthetic device to provide a person with moderate to profound sensorineural hearing loss a modified sense of sound . CI bypasses the normal acoustic hearing process to replace it with electric signals which directly stimulate the auditory nerve . A person with a cochlear implant receiving intensive auditory training may learn to interpret those signals as sound and speech . However , one third of deaf children do not develop language if they are on a CI program alone and have no sign language input . The implant has two main components . The outside component is generally worn behind the ear , but could also be attached to clothing , for example , in young children . This component , the sound processor , contains microphones , electronics that include Digital Signal Processor chips , battery , and a coil which transmits a signal to the implant across the skin . The inside component , the actual implant , has a coil to receive signals , electronics , and an array of electrodes which is placed into the cochlea , which stimulate the cochlear nerve . The surgical procedure is performed under general anesthesia . Surgical risks are minimal but can include tinnitus , facial nerve bruising and dizziness . From the early days of implants in the 1970s and the 1980s , speech perception via an implant has steadily increased . Many users of modern implants gain reasonable to good hearing and speech perception skills post-implantation , especially when combined with lipreading .",

Penman chronicles the story of cousins Maude and Stephen as they fight for Englands throne . Publishers Weekly gave a positive review of When Christ and His Saints Slept . The book was described as a magnificent combination of history and humanity in which Penman presents complicated politics in a persuasive manner with well-presented characters . Although based on real life historical characters - Queen Maude and King Stephen are the main protagonists - it was thought that , in the fictional character Ranulf , Penman added a successful addition . The only complaint was that the era in which Penman sets the action ( 12th century England ) lacks epic qualities . The novel had a first printing of 75,000 copies with a major ad and promotion campaign and author tour ."
