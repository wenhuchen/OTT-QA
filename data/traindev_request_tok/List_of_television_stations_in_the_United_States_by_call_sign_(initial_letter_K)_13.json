  "/wiki/Religious_broadcasting": "Religious broadcasting refers to the dissemination of television and/or radio content that intentionally has religious ideas , religious experience , or religious practice as its core focus . In some countries , religious broadcasting developed primarily within the context of public service provision ( as in the UK ) , whilst in others , it has been driven more by religious organisations themselves ( as in the USA ) . Across Europe and in the US and Canada , religious broadcasting began in the earliest days of radio , usually with the transmission of religious worship , preaching or 'talks ' . Over time , formats evolved to include a broad range of styles and approaches , including radio and television drama , documentary , and chat show formats , as well as more traditional devotional content . Today , many religious organizations record sermons and lectures , and have moved into distributing content on their own web-based IP channels . Religious broadcasting can be funded commercially or through some sort of public broadcasting-style arrangement ( religious broadcasters are often recognized as non-profit organizations ) . Donations from listeners and viewers , often tax-deductible , are solicited by some broadcasters . In the US , 42 percent of non-commercial radio stations currently have a religious format where on the other hand about 80 percent of the 2,400 Christian radio stations and 100 full-power Christian TV stations throughout the entire United States are considered non-profit . In some countries , particularly those with an established state religion , broadcasting related to one particular religion only is allowed , or in some cases required . For example , a function of the state-owned Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation is by law to broadcast such programmes as may promote Islamic ideology , national unity and principles of democracy , freedom equality , tolerance and social justice as enunciated by Islam .
