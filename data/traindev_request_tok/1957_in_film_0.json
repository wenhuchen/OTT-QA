The film uses the historical setting of the construction of the Burma Railway in 1942-1943 . The cast included William Holden , Jack Hawkins , Alec Guinness , and Sessue Hayakawa . It was initially scripted by screenwriter Carl Foreman , who was later replaced by Michael Wilson . Both writers had to work in secret , as they were on the Hollywood blacklist and had fled to the UK in order to continue working . As a result , Boulle , who did not speak English , was credited and received the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay ; many years later , Foreman and Wilson posthumously received the Academy Award . The film was widely praised , winning seven Academy Awards ( including Best Picture ) at the 30th Academy Awards . In 1997 , the film was deemed culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress . It has been included on the American Film Institute 's list of best American films ever made .

  "/wiki/David_Lean": "Sir David Lean CBE ( 25 March 1908 - 16 April 1991 ) was an English film director , producer , screenwriter and editor . Widely considered as one of the most influential directors of all time , Lean was mostly famous for his large-scale epics such as The Bridge on the River Kwai ( 1957 ) , Lawrence of Arabia ( 1962 ) , Doctor Zhivago ( 1965 ) and A Passage to India ( 1984 ) . He also directed adaptations of Charles Dickens novels Great Expectations ( 1946 ) and Oliver Twist ( 1948 ) , and the romantic drama Brief Encounter ( 1945 ) . Originally a film editor in the early 1930s , Lean made his directorial debut with 1942 's In Which We Serve , which was the first of four collaborations with No\u00ebl Coward . Beginning with Summertime in 1955 , Lean began to make internationally co-produced films financed by the big Hollywood studios ; in 1970 , however , the critical failure of his film Ryan 's Daughter led him to take a fourteen-year break from filmmaking , during which he planned a number of film projects which never came to fruition . In 1984 he had a career revival with A Passage to India , adapted from E. M. Forster 's novel ; it was an instant hit with critics but proved to be the last film Lean would direct . Lean 's affinity for pictorialism and inventive editing techniques has led him to be lauded by directors such as Steven Spielberg , Stanley Kubrick , Martin Scorsese , and Ridley Scott . Lean was voted 9th greatest film director of all time in the British Film Institute Sight & Sound Directors ' Top Directors poll in 2002 . Nominated seven times for the Academy Award for Best Director , which he won twice for The Bridge on the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia , he has seven films in the British Film Institute 's Top 100 British Films ( with three of them being in the top five ) and was awarded the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1990 .",

  "/wiki/Mother_India": "Mother India is a 1957 Indian epic drama film , directed by Mehboob Khan and starring Nargis , Sunil Dutt , Rajendra Kumar , and Raaj Kumar . A remake of Khan 's earlier film Aurat ( 1940 ) , it is the story of a poverty-stricken village woman named Radha ( Nargis ) , who in the absence of her husband , struggles to raise her sons and survive against a cunning money-lender amidst many troubles . The title of the film was chosen to counter American author Katherine Mayo 's 1927 polemical book Mother India , which vilified Indian culture . Allusions to Hindu mythology are abundant in the film , and its lead character has been seen as a metonymic representation of a Hindu woman who reflects high moral values and the concept of what it means to be a mother to society through self-sacrifice . Mother India metaphorically represents India as a nation in the aftermath of independence , and alludes to a strong sense of nationalism and nation-building . While some authors treat Radha as the symbol of women empowerment , others see her cast in female stereotypes . The film was shot in Mumbai 's Mehboob Studios and in the villages of Maharashtra , Gujarat , and Uttar Pradesh . The music by Naushad introduced global music , including Western classical music and orchestra , to Hindi cinema . The film was among the most expensive Hindi cinema ( Bollywood ) productions and earned the highest revenue for any Indian film at that time . Adjusted for inflation , Mother India still ranks among the all-time Indian box office hits . It was released in India amid fanfare in October 1957 , and had several high-profile screenings , including one at the capital , New Delhi , attended by the country 's president and prime minister . Mother India became a definitive cultural classic and is regarded as one of the best films in Indian and world cinema .",

  "/wiki/Cinema_of_Italy": "The Cinema of Italy comprises the films made within Italy or by Italian directors . The first Italian director is considered to be Vittorio Calcina [ it ] , a collaborator of the Lumi\u00e8re Brothers , who filmed Pope Leo XIII in 1896 . Since its beginning , Italian cinema has influenced film movements worldwide . As of 2018 , Italian films have won 14 Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film ( the most of any country ) as well as 12 Palmes d'Or ( the second-most of any country ) , one Academy Award for Best Picture and many Golden Lions and Golden Bears . Italy is a birthplace of Art Cinema and the stylistic aspect of film has been the most important factor in the history of Italian movies . In the early 1900s , artistic and epic films such as Otello ( 1906 ) , The Last Days of Pompeii ( 1908 ) , L'Inferno ( 1911 ) , Quo Vadis ( 1913 ) , and Cabiria ( 1914 ) , were made as adaptations of books or stage plays . Italian filmmakers were utilizing complex set designs , lavish costumes , and record budgets , to produce pioneering films . One of the first cinematic avante-garde movements , Italian Futurism , took place in Italy in the late 1910s . After a period of decline in the 1920s , the Italian film industry was revitalized in the 1930s with the arrival of sound film . A popular Italian genre during this period , the Telefoni Bianchi , consisted of comedies with glamorous backgrounds . While Italy 's Fascist government provided financial support for the nation 's film industry , most notably the construction of the Cinecitt\u00e0 studios ( the largest film studio in Europe ) , it also engaged in censorship , and thus many Italian films produced in the late 1930s were propaganda films . Post-World War II Italy saw the rise of the influential Italian neorealist movement , which launched the directorial careers of Luchino Visconti , Roberto Rossellini , and Vittorio De Sica .",

Note that , in line with the definition above , this list does not include any Soviet television series or television movies , which were not shown in cinemas of the Soviet Union . The annual list includes sales during each year only , which often means that the total number of tickets sold was bigger . As an example , according to the list below the film The Red Snowball Tree , the top seller of the year 1974 , sold 62.5 million tickets during that year . But the total number of sold tickets during all years was bigger ( former deputy director of the USSR GosKino Boris Pavlenok named 140 million , however , it was clearly exaggeration ) . This figure is comparable to some of the United States ' all-time highest ticket sellers , such as The Sound of Music , E.T . the Extra-Terrestrial , and Titanic , in fact exceeding the latter 's estimated ticket sales of 135.5 million . In the mid-1960s , the Soviet Union sold 4 billion tickets and grossed 1 billion \u0440\u0443\u0431 annually . At the 1960s exchange rate of 0.9 \u0440\u0443\u0431 per US dollar , this was $ 1.11 billion ( equivalent to $ 9 billion adjusted for inflation ) . Soviet ticket prices were generally lower than American ticket prices , due to lower living costs in the Soviet Union , with average ticket prices ranging from 25 kopecks in the mid-1960s to 50 kopecks in the early 1980s . Both domestic Soviet films and foreign films were shown , the latter having a limited quota and thus drawing higher average ticket sales than domestic productions .",
