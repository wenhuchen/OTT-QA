The program , sponsored by Adidas , offers professional-ready players in the U.S. developmental system not yet eligible for the MLS SuperDraft early entry , allowing MLS to compete with foreign professional clubs without comparable restrictions on player signing . From its establishment in 1997 to 2005 , the program was sponsored by Nike and was called Project-40 . Originally intended to improve the U.S. national team player pool , American national team eligibility is no longer required for program entry . Carlos Parra was the first Project-40 player when he signed with the league and was allocated to the New York/New Jersey MetroStars in 1997 . Since then , the program has included players such as Tim Howard , DaMarcus Beasley , Maurice Edu , Carlos Bocanegra , Clint Dempsey , Jozy Altidore , Ben Olsen , Sacha Kljestan , Freddy Adu , Brad Guzan , Michael Bradley , Nick Rimando and Kyle Beckerman . Generation Adidas players do not count against the MLS senior roster and usually earn a much higher salary than the league minimum . Entering into the program automatically classifies a player as professional , and thus disqualifies them from playing college soccer . As a result , Generation Adidas players are also guaranteed scholarships to continue their college education should their professional career not pan out . From 1998 to 2000 , MLS entered a team of Project-40 players , supplemented by other MLS players who did not get much playing time , into the A-League in the USL .
