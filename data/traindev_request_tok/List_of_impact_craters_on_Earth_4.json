It also shares maritime borders with Nunavut , Prince Edward Island , and Nova Scotia . Quebec is Canada 's largest province by area and its second-largest administrative division ; only the territory of Nunavut is larger . It is historically and politically considered to be part of Central Canada ( with Ontario ) . Quebec is the second-most populous province of Canada , after Ontario . It is the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population , with French as the sole provincial official language . Most inhabitants live in urban areas near the Saint Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City , the capital . Approximately half of Quebec residents live in the Greater Montreal Area , including the Island of Montreal . English-speaking communities and English-language institutions are concentrated in the west of the island of Montreal but are also significantly present in the Outaouais , Eastern Townships , and Gasp\u00e9 regions . The Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec region , occupying the northern half of the province , is sparsely populated and inhabited primarily by Aboriginal peoples . The climate around the major cities is four-seasons continental with cold and snowy winters combined with warm to hot humid summers , but farther north long winter seasons dominate and as a result the northern areas of the province are marked by tundra conditions .",

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean , covering 9.98 million square kilometres ( 3.85 million square miles ) , making it the world 's second-largest country by total area . Its southern border with the United States , stretching some 8,891 kilometres ( 5,525 mi ) , is the world 's longest bi-national land border . Canada 's capital is Ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . As a whole , Canada is sparsely populated , with most of its land area dominated by forest and tundra . Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",
  "/wiki/Massive_Australian_Precambrian/Cambrian_Impact_Structure": "The Massive Australian Precambrian/Cambrian Impact Structure also known as MAPCIS is a proposed impact structure based upon arguments presented by Daniel P. Connelly , a pharmacist , at Geological Society of America meetings . Its center is located approximately equidistant between Uluru ( Ayers Rock ) and Mount Conner in Australia 's Northern Territory . The structure is approximately 600 km ( 370 mi ) in diameter . However , a hypothetical outermost ring 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 mi ) in diameter is claimed to be the result of undefined far field stresses . Connelly argues that the age of this hypothetical impact is approximately 545 mya which puts it just before the Cambrian explosion ( 542 mya ) of the current Phanerozoic eon ( 541 mya ) . If confirmed as an impact structure , it would be the largest on Earth .",

It is sparsely populated , with a population of only 245,800 , fewer than half as many people as Tasmania . The archaeological history of the Northern Territory begins over 40,000 years ago when Indigenous Australians settled the region . Makassan traders began trading with the indigenous people of the Northern Territory for trepang from at least the 18th century onwards . The coast of the territory was first seen by Europeans in the 17th century . The British were the first Europeans to attempt to settle the coastal regions . After three failed attempts to establish a settlement ( 1824-28 , 1838-49 , and 1864-66 ) , success was achieved in 1869 with the establishment of a settlement at Port Darwin . Today the economy is based on tourism , especially Kakadu National Park in the Top End and the Ulu\u1e5fu-Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park ( Ayers Rock ) in central Australia , and mining .

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories .

Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",
