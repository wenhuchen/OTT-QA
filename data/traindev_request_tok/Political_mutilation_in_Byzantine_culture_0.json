The First Iconoclasm , as it is sometimes called , existed between about 726 and 787 . The Second Iconoclasm was between 814 and 842 . According to the traditional view , Byzantine Iconoclasm was started by a ban on religious images by Emperor Leo III and continued under his successors . It was accompanied by widespread destruction of images and persecution of supporters of the veneration of images . The pope remained firmly in support of the use of images throughout the period , and the whole episode widened the growing divergence between the Byzantine and Carolingian traditions in what was still a unified church , as well as facilitating the reduction or removal of Byzantine political control over parts of Italy . Iconoclasm is the deliberate destruction within a culture of the culture 's own religious icons and other symbols or monuments , usually for religious or political motives .

The only child of Emperor Leo IV , Constantine was named co-emperor with him at the age of five in 776 and succeeded him as sole Emperor in 780 , aged nine . His mother Irene exercised control over him as regent until 790 , assisted by her chief minister Staurakios , and eventually Constantine ruled himself , until his mother blinded and deposed him . Though the regency lost power when Constantine reached maturity in 790 , Irene continued to attempt to exercise control , and retained the title of Empress . Constantine suffered military defeats and made unpopular decisions , such as marrying his mistress , Theodote . Irene had Constantine deposed , blinded and imprisoned in 797 and seized power for herself , becoming the first Empress regnant of the Empire . Constantine likely died shortly thereafter . Constantine VI was the final ruler to be universally recognized as Roman Emperor , being recognized as such by both the Empire which he ruled in the east , the papacy and the Western European powers over which the pope held suzerainty . With his mother becoming Empress regnant upon his deposition , the papacy crowned Charlemagne as a new Emperor in Western Europe , asserting that a woman could not be Empress in her own right . This laid the foundations of a new polity , independent of the East , that would evolve into the Holy Roman Empire .",
  "/wiki/Irene_of_Athens": "Irene of Athens [ a ] ( c. 752 - 9 August 803 ) , also known as Irene Sarantapechaina , [ b ] was Byzantine empress consort by marriage to Leo IV from 775 to 780 , regent during the minority of her son Constantine VI from 780 until 790 , co-regent from 792 until 797 , and finally sole ruler and first empress regnant of the Byzantine Empire from 797 to 802 . A member of the politically prominent Sarantapechos family , she was selected as Leo IV 's bride for unknown reasons in 768 . Even though her husband was an iconoclast , she harbored iconophile sympathies . During her rule as regent , she called the Second Council of Nicaea in 787 , which condemned iconoclasm as heretical and brought an end to the first iconoclast period ( 730-787 ) . As Irene 's son Constantine reached maturity , he began to move out from under the influence of his mother . In the early 790s , several attempted revolts tried to proclaim him as sole ruler . In 797 , Irene gouged out her son 's eyes , maiming him so severely that he died a few days later . With her son dead , Irene proclaimed herself sole ruler . Irene 's alleged unprecedented status as a female ruler of the Roman Empire ( there had been women ruling the empire in their own right before , notably Pulcheria ) led Pope Leo III to proclaim Charlemagne emperor of the Holy Roman Empire on Christmas Day of 800 under the pretext that a woman could not rule and so the throne of the Roman Empire was actually vacant . A revolt in 802 overthrew Irene and exiled her to the island of Lesbos , supplanting her on the throne with Nikephoros I. Irene died in exile less than a year later .",

Immediately he faced the long revolt of Thomas the Slav , which almost cost him his throne and was not completely quelled until spring 824 .

At the same time , and despite having seemingly won the battle , Bryennios 's army fell into disorder after its own Pecheneg allies attacked its camp . Reinforced by Turkish mercenaries , Alexios lured the troops of Bryennios into another ambush through a feigned retreat . The rebel army broke and Bryennios was captured .
