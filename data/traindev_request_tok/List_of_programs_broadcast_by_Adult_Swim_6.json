  "/wiki/Yogi_Bear": "Yogi Bear is an anthropomorphic funny animal who has appeared in numerous comic books , animated television shows and films . He made his debut in 1958 as a supporting character in The Huckleberry Hound Show . Yogi Bear was the first breakout character in animated television ; he was created by Hanna-Barbera and was eventually more popular than Huckleberry Hound . In January 1961 , he was given his own show , The Yogi Bear Show , sponsored by Kellogg 's , which included the segments Snagglepuss and Yakky Doodle . Hokey Wolf replaced his segment on The Huckleberry Hound Show . A musical animated feature film , Hey There , It 's Yogi Bear ! , was released in 1964 . Yogi was one of several Hanna-Barbera characters to have a collar . This allowed animators to keep his body static , redrawing only his head in each frame when he spoke - one of the methods used by Hanna-Barbera to cut costs by reducing the number of drawings needed for a seven-minute cartoon from around 14,000 to around 2,000 . Yogi will be returning as a Main character for the first time in almost 30 years since Yo Yogi ! in a new animated series for HBO Max titled Jellystone ! Created by CH Greenblatt and Sam Register and Produced by Warner Bros . Animation , premiering sometime in 2020 .",

It was created by award-winning animators Mike Judge and Don Hertzfeldt . Following the demise of other American touring festivals of animation , such as Spike and Mike 's Classic Festival of Animation , [ note 1 ] the stated purpose of the Animation Show was to bring animated short films back into proper cinemas , where most of them were intended to be seen , and to free these artists from the dungeons of Internet exhibition . It was the first-ever festival of animation to be curated by working animators and was described as a passion project by its creators , not something intended to turn a giant profit . A sister series of Animation Show DVD volumes are also available , but the producers stress that the theatrical and DVD lineups are intentionally a little bit different , to encourage audiences to not just wait for the DVD but to visit the cinema and view these films properly .

Mike Judge and Don Hertzfeldt programmed the first three Animation Show programs together .

Batman Beyond is set in the chronological future of the DC animated universe ( despite being released before Static Shock , Justice League and Justice League Unlimited ) , and serves as a continuance of both Batman : The Animated Series and The New Batman Adventures . Though the initial announcement of the series drew mixed reactions , Batman Beyond went on to receive critical acclaim and a cult following . The show is said to explore the darker side of many Batman projects , playing on key elements such as emotions , personal relations , fear of the unknown , as well as cyberpunk and sci-fi themes such as the issues and dilemmas of innovation and technological and scientific progress affecting society , and the psychology of the character of Bruce Wayne . As such , it was considerably darker than most other children 's programs at the time , although producer Bruce Timm recalls it was conceived as a kid-friendly Batman cartoon .
