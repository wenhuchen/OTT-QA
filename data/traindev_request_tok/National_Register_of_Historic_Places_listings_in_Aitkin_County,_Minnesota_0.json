  "/wiki/Aitkin_Carnegie_Library": "The Aitkin Carnegie Library is a Carnegie library in Aitkin , Minnesota , United States . It was designed by architects Claude & Starck and was built in the Classical Revival style . It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 . It is a one-story buff-colored brick building upon an elevated basement and a concrete foundation . It has a central classical pedimented portico . In 1981 it was deemed significant both for its role in the intellectual and cultural development of Aitkin and as a well-preserved example of the Minnesota small-town library structures financed by Andrew Carnegie , noted turn-of-the-century steel magnate . Aitkin citizens organized a free public library in 1904 . The library collection was temporarily housed in the village council chamber until the present structure 's construction in 1911 with a $ 6,500 grant from the Carnegie Foundation . The library , unlike many Carnegie-funded libraries which have been demolished or altered as community library systems have expanded , retains its original design integrity while continuing to serve the community in its intended educational role . Architecturally , the library is a notable local example of public Neo-classical design . While it was still serving as a library in 1981 , the building later served as the Jaques Art Center .",

At first , Carnegie libraries were almost exclusively in places where he had a personal connection - namely his birthplace in Scotland and the Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania area , his adopted home-town . Yet , beginning in the middle of 1899 , Carnegie substantially increased funding to libraries outside these areas . In later years few towns that requested a grant and agreed to his terms were refused . By the time the last grant was made in 1919 , there were 3,500 libraries in the United States , nearly half of them built with construction grants paid by Carnegie .",
  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",

  "/wiki/Mississippi_River": "The Mississippi River is the second-longest river and chief river of the second-largest drainage system on the North American continent , second only to the Hudson Bay drainage system . From its traditional source of Lake Itasca in northern Minnesota , it flows generally south for 2,320 miles ( 3,730 km ) to the Mississippi River Delta in the Gulf of Mexico . With its many tributaries , the Mississippi 's watershed drains all or parts of 32 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian mountains . The main stem is entirely within the United States ; the total drainage basin is 1,151,000 sq mi ( 2,980,000 km2 ) , of which only about one percent is in Canada . The Mississippi ranks as the fourth-longest river and fifteenth-largest river by discharge in the world . The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota , Wisconsin , Iowa , Illinois , Missouri , Kentucky , Tennessee , Arkansas , Mississippi , and Louisiana . Native Americans have lived along the Mississippi River and its tributaries for thousands of years . Most were hunter-gatherers , but some , such as the Mound Builders , formed prolific agricultural societies . The arrival of Europeans in the 16th century changed the native way of life as first explorers , then settlers , ventured into the basin in increasing numbers . The river served first as a barrier , forming borders for New Spain , New France , and the early United States , and then as a vital transportation artery and communications link . In the 19th century , during the height of the ideology of manifest destiny , the Mississippi and several western tributaries , most notably the Missouri , formed pathways for the western expansion of the United States . Formed from thick layers of the river 's silt deposits , the Mississippi embayment is one of the most fertile regions of the United States ; steamboats were widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries to ship agricultural and industrial goods .",

  "/wiki/Speculation": "Speculation is the purchase of an asset ( a commodity , goods , or real estate ) with the hope that it will become more valuable in the near future . In finance , speculation is also the practice of engaging in risky financial transactions in an attempt to profit from short term fluctuations in the market value of a tradable financial instrument - rather than attempting to profit from the underlying financial attributes embodied in the instrument such as capital gains , dividends , or interest . Many speculators pay little attention to the fundamental value of a security and instead focus purely on price movements . Speculation can in principle involve any tradable good or financial instrument . Speculators are particularly common in the markets for stocks , bonds , commodity futures , currencies , fine art , collectibles , real estate , and derivatives . Speculators play one of four primary roles in financial markets , along with hedgers , who engage in transactions to offset some other pre-existing risk , arbitrageurs who seek to profit from situations where fungible instruments trade at different prices in different market segments , and investors who seek profit through long-term ownership of an instrument 's underlying attributes .",

  "/wiki/Middle_Woodland_Period": "In the classification of archaeological cultures of North America , the Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures spanned a period from roughly 1000 BCE to European contact in the eastern part of North America , with some archaeologists distinguishing the Mississippian period , from 1000 CE to European contact as a separate period . The term Woodland Period was introduced in the 1930s as a generic term for prehistoric sites falling between the Archaic hunter-gatherers and the agriculturalist Mississippian cultures . The Eastern Woodlands cultural region covers what is now eastern Canada south of the Subarctic region , the Eastern United States , along to the Gulf of Mexico . This period is variously considered a developmental stage , a time period , a suite of technological adaptations or traits , and a family tree of cultures related to earlier Archaic cultures . It can be characterized as a chronological and cultural manifestation without any massive changes in a short time but instead having a continuous development in stone and bone tools , leather crafting , textile manufacture , cultivation , and shelter construction . Many Woodland peoples used spears and atlatls until the end of the period , when they were replaced by bows and arrows ; however , Southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns . The most cited technological distinction of this period was the widespread use of pottery ( although pottery manufacture had arisen during the Archaic period in some places ) , and the diversification of pottery forms , decorations , and manufacturing practices . The increasing use of horticulture and the development of the Eastern Agricultural Complex , consisting of weedy seed plants as well as gourd cultivation , also meant that groups became less mobile over time and , in some times and places , people lived in permanently occupied villages and cities . Intensive agriculture characterizes the Mississippian period from c. 1000-1400 CE and may have continued up to European contact , around 500 years ago .",
