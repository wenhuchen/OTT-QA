  "/wiki/Robert_F._Boyle": "Robert Francis Boyle ( October 10 , 1909 - August 1 , 2010 ) was an American film art director and production designer . Born in Los Angeles , Boyle trained as an architect , graduating from the University of Southern California ( USC ) . When he lost his job in that field during the Great Depression , Boyle found work in films as an extra . In 1933 he was hired as a draftsman in the Paramount Pictures art department , headed by supervising art director Hans Dreier . Beginning with Cecil B. DeMille 's The Plainsman , Boyle went on to work on a variety of pictures as a sketch artist , draftsman and assistant art director before becoming an art director at Universal Studios in the early 1940s . Boyle collaborated several times with Alfred Hitchcock , first as an associate art director for Saboteur ( 1942 ) and later as a full-fledged production designer for North by Northwest ( 1959 ) , The Birds ( 1963 ) , and Marnie ( 1964 ) . Denied permission to shoot footage on Mount Rushmore , Hitchcock turned to Boyle to create realistic replicas of the stone heads . Boyle abseiled down the monument , photographing its contours in detail , before constructing just enough to put the actors on so we could get down shots , up shots , side shots , whatever we needed . Almost two decades earlier , Boyle had delivered the Statue of Liberty reproduction that was used in the climactic scene of Saboteur . For The Birds , Boyle was put in charge of the title characters . He later recalled , We needed to find out which birds we could use best , and finally settled on two types : sea gulls , which were very greedy beasts that would always fly toward the camera if there was a piece of meat , and crows , which had a strange sort of intelligence . Boyle described his relationship with Hitchcock : It was a meeting of equals : the director who knew exactly what he wanted , and the art director who knew how to get it done .",
