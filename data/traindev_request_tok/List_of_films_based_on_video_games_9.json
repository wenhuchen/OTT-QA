Halo was originally developed by Bungie Studios . The series centers on an interstellar war between humanity and an alliance of aliens known as the Covenant . The Covenant , led by their religious leaders called the Prophets , worship an ancient civilization known as the Forerunners , who perished while defeating the parasitic Flood . The central focus of the franchise builds off the experiences of Master Chief John-117 , one of a group of supersoldiers codenamed Spartans , and his artificial intelligence ( AI ) companion , Cortana . Other characters , such as Noble Six from Halo : Reach , are also introduced in the series . The term Halo refers to the Halo Array : a group of immense , habitable , ring-shaped superweapons that were created by the Forerunners to destroy the Flood , but which the Covenant mistake for religious artifacts that , if activated , would transport them on a Great Journey to meet the Forerunners . They are similar to the Orbitals in Iain M. Banks ' Culture novels , and to a lesser degree to author Larry Niven 's Ringworld concept . The games in the series are critically acclaimed , with the original considered the Xbox 's killer app . This led to the term Halo killer being used to describe console games that aspire , or are considered , to be better than Halo .
