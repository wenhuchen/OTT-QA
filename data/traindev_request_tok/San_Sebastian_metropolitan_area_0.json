  "/wiki/Irun": "Irun ( Spanish : Ir\u00fan , Basque : Irun ) is a town of the Bidasoaldea region in the province of Gipuzkoa in the Basque Autonomous Community , Spain . It lies on the foundations of the ancient Oiasso , cited as a Roman-Vasconic town during the period . One of the biggest towns in Gipuzkoa , its border town situation ( it is located on the border between Spain and France , across the Bidasoa river from Hendaye ) , has made Irun into a commercial and logistic centre . Irun railway station is a major break-of-gauge where the SNCF 1,435 mm ( 4 ft 8 1\u20442 in ) standard gauge rails meet the 1,668 mm ( 5 ft 5 21\u204432 in ) broad gauge Renfe ones . Currently Irun features a fair ground provided with modern exhibition and telecommunication facilities just at some 100 metres away from the actual borderline at the Santiago Bridge ( river Bidasoa ) . Irun is part of the conurbation of Txingudi bay with Hondarribia and Hendaye , the town being also involved in the Eurocit\u00e9 Basque Bayonne-San Sebasti\u00e1n ( fr ) .

  "/wiki/Bidasoa-Txingudi": "The place-name Bidasoa-Txingudi is a recent creation , combining the name of the river Bidasoa , which here provides a natural frontier between France and Spain in the Basque Country , with that of a bay on the French side of the estuary , the Bay of Txingudi . It is formed by the towns of Irun and Hondarribia on the Spanish side of the France-Spain border and the neighbouring town of Hendaye ( Hendaia ) on the French side . In 1999 , a decade of efforts to forge closer links between these three municipalities , with a combined population of around 85,000 , bore fruit in the launching of a consortium set up to undertake cross-frontier projects in the area . In Basque , the consortium is known as Bidasoa-Txingudi Mugaz Gaindiko Partzuergoa , in French as Consorcio transfrontalier Bidasoa-Txingudi and in Spanish as Consorcio Transfronterizo Bidasoa-Txingudi . The French version of the name , using the Spanish word consorcio rather than the French consortium , reflects the fact that it was set up using a Spanish legal vehicle for co-operation between local authorities . One of the first acts of the promoters of cross-frontier cooperation was to create a new name for the area . Prior to the three towns cooperation initiative , the name of the river Bidasoa had been used to define the 'comarca ' ( a Spanish territorial type of district ) , which groups Irun and Hondarribia as the Comarca del Bajo Bidasoa . But there had been no common name covering the broader area also including Hendaia . The name Txingudi , written in accordance with modern Basque orthography , was originally applied to a small marshy bay on the edges of Hendaia . In recent years , it had also come to be applied to a marshy area between Irun and Hondarribia which was made into a nature reserve under the protection of the Basque government in 1998 , and by extension to the area around the Bidasoa estuary . By combining this name with the name of the river , the initiators of the cross-border project invented a catchy new name , Bidasoa-Txingudi . The bestowing of a new name for the area of Bidasoa-Txingudi supported efforts to create a sense of common identity among people on either side of the frontier and thus bolster acceptance of cross-frontier cooperation .",
