The state is the 10th largest by area , the least populous , and the second most sparsely populated state in the country . Wyoming is bordered on the north by Montana , on the east by South Dakota and Nebraska , on the south by Colorado , on the southwest by Utah , and on the west by Idaho and Montana . The state population was estimated at 577,737 in 2018 , which is less than 31 of the most populous U.S. cities including Denver in neighboring Colorado .

The western two-thirds of the state is covered mostly by the mountain ranges and rangelands of the Rocky Mountains , while the eastern third of the state is high elevation prairie called the High Plains . Almost half of the land in Wyoming is owned by the U.S. government , leading Wyoming to rank sixth by area and fifth by proportion of a state 's land owned by the federal government . Federal lands include two national parks - Grand Teton and Yellowstone - two national recreation areas , two national monuments , several national forests , historic sites , fish hatcheries , and wildlife refuges . Original inhabitants of the region include the Crow , Arapaho , Lakota , and Shoshone . Southwestern Wyoming was claimed by the Spanish Empire and then Mexican territory until it was ceded to the United States in 1848 at the end of the Mexican-American War . The region acquired the name Wyoming when a bill was introduced to the U.S. Congress in 1865 to provide a temporary government for the territory of Wyoming . The name was used earlier for the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania , and is derived from the Munsee word xw\u00e9 : wam\u0259nk , meaning at the big river flat .",
