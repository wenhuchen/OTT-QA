The Financial Post started publication in 1907 by John Bayne Maclean . It was a weekly publication , and one of the core assets of Maclean 's media business , which eventually became Maclean-Hunter . The paper was purchased by Sun Media in 1987 , and expanded into a daily tabloid on February 1 , 1988 , and added home delivery newspaper in 1990 , with a reformatted Financial Post Magazine following shortly after . In 1998 , Sun Media sold the Financial Post to Hollinger , whose CEO Conrad Black had been seeking a way to establish a national newspaper . Sun Media acquired the Kitchener-Waterloo Record , the Guelph Mercury , the Hamilton Spectator and the Cambridge Reporter from Hollinger in exchange , but has since sold all four papers . The Hollinger transaction was finalized in July 1998 .
