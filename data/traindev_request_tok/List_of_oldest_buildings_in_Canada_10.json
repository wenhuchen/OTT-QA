  "/wiki/Fort_Selkirk": "Fort Selkirk is a former trading post on the Yukon River at the confluence of the Pelly River in Canada 's Yukon . For many years it was home to the Selkirk First Nation ( Northern Tutchone ) . Archaeological evidence shows that the site has been in use for at least 8,000 years . Robert Campbell established a Hudson 's Bay Company trading post nearby in 1848 . In early 1852 he moved the post to its current location . Resenting the interference of the Hudson 's Bay Company with their traditional trade with interior Athabaskan First Nations , Chilkat Tlingit First Nation warriors attacked and looted the post that summer on Saturday , August 21 , 1852 . It was rebuilt about 40 years later and became an important supply point along the Yukon River . It was essentially abandoned by the mid-1950s after the Klondike Highway bypassed it and Yukon River traffic died down . At age 28 , under the command of Inspector John Douglas Moodie , Francis Joseph Fitzgerald was the first to chart an overland route from Edmonton to Fort Selkirk , Yukon via northern British Columbia and the Pelly River ( 1897 ) . The voyage took eleven months , having covered about 1,000 miles . As a result of this achievement , Fitzgerald was promoted corporal in 1899 . Many of the buildings have been restored and the Fort Selkirk Historic Site is owned and managed jointly by the Selkirk First Nation and the Yukon Government 's Department of Tourism and Culture .",

  "/wiki/Yukon_Hotel": "The Yukon Hotel is a National Historic Site of Canada and part of the Dawson Historical Complex . It is a log building with a three-storey false facade on First Avenue at the corner of Church Street in Dawson City , Yukon . The building was constructed during the Klondike Gold Rush in 1898 by J.E . Binet , who named it Binet Block . A local entrepreneur , he and his brother J.O . Binet also operated Malden House , the Marconi Hotel , and Binet Brothers Saloon , and the Binet Bros. Hotel and General Merchants in Mayo . He and his workers used available materials , rushing to complete it by November . The narrow building had large street-level windows flanking the main entrance . Only the facade was made of milled lumber , as it was in short supply ; the remainder of the building was made of rough logs chinked with mud . It was leased to the Government of Canada for $ 1000 per month , which used it for the office of the Commissioner of Yukon , William Ogilvie , for land and timber agent offices , the territorial registrar , and as living quarters for the staff . In November 1900 , the government relocated its offices to the post office , newly constructed at the corner of Third Street and King Street . Binet then operated the building as a residence .",
  "/wiki/Robert_W._Service": "Robert William Service ( January 16 , 1874 - September 11 , 1958 ) was a British-Canadian poet and writer , often called the Bard of the Yukon . Born in Lancashire of Scottish descent , he was a bank clerk by trade , but spent long periods travelling in Western America and Canada , often in some poverty . When his bank sent him to the Yukon , he was inspired by tales of the Klondike Gold Rush , and wrote two poems The Shooting of Dan McGrew and The Cremation of Sam McGee , which showed remarkable authenticity from an author with no experience of gold-mining , and enjoyed immediate popularity . Encouraged by this , he quickly wrote more poems on the same theme , which were published as Songs of a Sourdough ( re-titled The Spell of the Yukon and Other Verses in the U.S. ) , and achieved a massive sale . When his next collection Ballads of a Cheechako proved equally successful , Service could afford to travel widely and live a leisurely life , basing himself in Paris and the French Riviera . Partly because of their popularity , and the speed with which he wrote them , his works were dismissed as doggerel by the critics , who were tending to say the same of Kipling , with whom Service was often compared . This did not worry Service , who was happy to classify his work as verse , not poetry .",
  "/wiki/Whitehorse,_Yukon": "Whitehorse is the capital and only city of Yukon , and the largest city in northern Canada . It was incorporated in 1950 and is located at kilometre 1426 ( Historic Mile 918 ) on the Alaska Highway in southern Yukon . Whitehorse 's downtown and Riverdale areas occupy both shores of the Yukon River , which originates in British Columbia and meets the Bering Sea in Alaska . The city was named after the White Horse Rapids for their resemblance to the mane of a white horse , near Miles Canyon , before the river was dammed . Because of the city 's location in the Whitehorse valley and relative proximity to the Pacific Ocean , the climate is milder than comparable northern communities such as Yellowknife . At this latitude winter days are short and summer days have up to about 19 hours of daylight . Whitehorse , as reported by Guinness World Records , is the city with the least air pollution in the world . As of the 2016 census , the population was 25,085 . This represents approximately 70 percent of the entire population of Yukon territory ."
