  "/wiki/Master_of_Arts_(Scotland)": "The degree of Master of Arts ( MA ) in Scotland typically refers to an undergraduate degree ( either a three-year general degree or four-year Honours degree ) in humanities or social sciences awarded by one of the ancient universities of Scotland ( the University of St Andrews , the University of Glasgow , the University of Aberdeen , and the University of Edinburgh ) plus the University of Dundee ( as a result of its history as a constituent college of the University of St Andrews ) and Heriot-Watt University ( at honours level only ) . The first two years of the Scottish Master of Arts consist of ordinary Bachelor level courses ; however , after these , students who are accepted to pursue the Honours route will complete more advanced subjects and write a dissertation in their fourth year . Students who choose to do a general degree will complete their third year at a lower level of specialisation , and receive a Bachelor of Arts ( BA ) or MA without Honours . For the postgraduate degree referred to in other places as Master of Arts , Scottish universities usually award the degree of Master of Letters ( MLitt ) or Master of Science ( MSc ) . Generally , non-ancient universities in Scotland ( e.g . University of Strathclyde , The Robert Gordon University , Edinburgh Napier University , etc . ) , award arts degrees as Bachelor of Arts .",
  "/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe": "The Edinburgh Festival Fringe ( also referred to as The Fringe or Edinburgh Fringe , or Edinburgh Fringe Festival ) is the world 's largest arts festival , which in 2018 spanned 25 days and featured more than 55,000 performances of 3,548 different shows in 317 venues . Established in 1947 as an alternative to the Edinburgh International Festival , it takes place annually in Edinburgh , Scotland , in the month of August . The Edinburgh Festival Fringe has become a world-leading celebration of arts and culture , surpassed only by the Olympics in terms of global ticketed events . As an event it has done more to place Edinburgh in the forefront of world cities than anything else . It is an open access ( or unjuried ) performing arts festival , meaning there is no selection committee , and anyone may participate , with any type of performance . The official Fringe Programme categorises shows into sections for theatre , comedy , dance , physical theatre , circus , cabaret , children 's shows , musicals , opera , music , spoken word , exhibitions and events . Comedy is the largest section , making up over one-third of the programme and the one that in modern times has the highest public profile , due in part to the Edinburgh Comedy Awards . The Festival is supported by the Festival Fringe Society , which publishes the programme , sells tickets to all events from a central physical box office and website , and offers year-round advice and support to performers . The Society 's permanent location is at the Fringe Shop on the Royal Mile , and in August they also manage Fringe Central , a separate collection of spaces in Appleton Tower and other University of Edinburgh buildings , dedicated to providing support for Fringe participants during their time at the festival . The Fringe board of directors is drawn from members of the Festival Fringe Society , who are often Fringe participants themselves - performers or administrators . Elections are held once a year , in August , and Board members serve a term of four years . The Board appoints the Fringe Chief Executive ( formerly known as the Fringe Administrator or Director ) , currently Shona McCarthy who assumed the role in March 2016 .",

The kingdoms of Scotland and England were individual sovereign states , with their own parliaments , judiciaries , and laws , though both were ruled by James in personal union . James was the son of Mary , Queen of Scots , and a great-great-grandson of Henry VII , King of England and Lord of Ireland , positioning him to eventually accede to all three thrones . James succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months , after his mother was compelled to abdicate in his favour . Four different regents governed during his minority , which ended officially in 1578 , though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583 . In 1603 , he succeeded the last Tudor monarch of England and Ireland , Elizabeth I , who died childless . He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years , a period known after him as the Jacobean era , until his death . After the Union of the Crowns , he based himself in England ( the largest of the three realms ) from 1603 , returning to Scotland only once , in 1617 , and styled himself King of Great Britain and Ireland . He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland . In his reign , the Plantation of Ulster and British colonisation of the Americas began . At 57 years and 246 days , James 's reign in Scotland was the longest of any Scottish monarch . He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England , including the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the English Parliament .",
  "/wiki/Scots_people": "The Scottish people ( Scots : Scots Fowk ; Scottish Gaelic : Albannaich ) or Scots , are a nation and ethnic group native to Scotland . Historically , they emerged from an amalgamation of two Celtic-speaking peoples , the Picts and Gaels , who founded the Kingdom of Scotland ( or Alba ) in the 9th century . Later , the neighbouring Celtic-speaking Cumbrians , as well as Germanic-speaking Anglo-Saxons and Norse , were incorporated into the Scottish nation . In modern usage , Scottish people or Scots is used to refer to anyone whose linguistic , cultural , family ancestral or genetic origins are from Scotland . The Latin word Scoti originally referred to the Gaels , but came to describe all inhabitants of Scotland . Considered pejorative , the term Scotch has also been used for Scottish people , primarily outside Scotland . People of Scottish descent live in many countries . Emigration , influenced by factors such as the Highland and Lowland Clearances , Scottish participation in the British Empire , and latterly industrial decline and unemployment , have resulted in Scottish people being found throughout the world . Scottish emigrants took with them their Scottish languages and culture . Large populations of Scottish people settled the new-world lands of North and South America , Australia and New Zealand . Canada has the highest level of Scottish descendants per capita in the world and the second-largest population of Scottish descendants , after the United States . Scotland has seen migration and settlement of many peoples at different periods in its history .",

The Makars have often been referred to by literary critics as Scots Chaucerians . In modern usage , poets of the Scots revival in the 18th century , such as Allan Ramsay and Robert Fergusson are also makars . Since 2002 , the term makar has been revived as the name for a publicly funded poet , first in Edinburgh , followed by Glasgow , Stirling and Dundee , and in 2004 the position of The Scots Makar , in the sense of a Scottish poet laureate , was introduced by the Scottish Parliament .",

He is widely regarded as the national poet of Scotland and is celebrated worldwide . He is the best known of the poets who have written in the Scots language , although much of his writing is also in English and a light Scots dialect , accessible to an audience beyond Scotland . He also wrote in standard English , and in these writings his political or civil commentary is often at its bluntest . He is regarded as a pioneer of the Romantic movement , and after his death he became a great source of inspiration to the founders of both liberalism and socialism , and a cultural icon in Scotland and among the Scottish diaspora around the world . Celebration of his life and work became almost a national charismatic cult during the 19th and 20th centuries , and his influence has long been strong on Scottish literature . In 2009 he was chosen as the greatest Scot by the Scottish public in a vote run by Scottish television channel STV . As well as making original compositions , Burns also collected folk songs from across Scotland , often revising or adapting them . His poem ( and song ) Auld Lang Syne is often sung at Hogmanay ( the last day of the year ) , and Scots Wha Hae served for a long time as an unofficial national anthem of the country . Other poems and songs of Burns that remain well known across the world today include A Red , Red Rose , A Man 's a Man for A ' That , To a Louse , To a Mouse , The Battle of Sherramuir , Tam o ' Shanter and Ae Fond Kiss .",

  "/wiki/Feminism": "Feminism is a range of social movements , political movements , and ideologies that aim to define , establish , and achieve the political , economic , personal , and social equality of the sexes . [ a ] Feminism incorporates the position that societies prioritize the male point of view , and that women are treated unfairly within those societies . Efforts to change that include fighting gender stereotypes and seeking to establish educational and professional opportunities for women that are equal to those for men . Feminist movements have campaigned and continue to campaign for women 's rights , including the right to vote , to hold public office , to work , to earn fair wages , equal pay and eliminate the gender pay gap , to own property , to receive education , to enter contracts , to have equal rights within marriage , and to have maternity leave . Feminists have also worked to ensure access to legal abortions and social integration and to protect women and girls from rape , sexual harassment , and domestic violence . Changes in dress and acceptable physical activity have often been part of feminist movements . Some scholars consider feminist campaigns to be a main force behind major historical societal changes for women 's rights , particularly in the West , where they are near-universally credited with achieving women 's suffrage , gender-neutral language , reproductive rights for women ( including access to contraceptives and abortion ) , and the right to enter into contracts and own property . Although feminist advocacy is , and has been , mainly focused on women 's rights , some feminists , including bell hooks , argue for the inclusion of men 's liberation within its aims , because they believe that men are also harmed by traditional gender roles . Feminist theory , which emerged from feminist movements , aims to understand the nature of gender inequality by examining women 's social roles and lived experience ; it has developed theories in a variety of disciplines in order to respond to issues concerning gender . Numerous feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years and represent different viewpoints and aims . Some forms of feminism have been criticized for taking into account only white , middle class , and college-educated perspectives . This criticism led to the creation of ethnically specific or multicultural forms of feminism , including black feminism and intersectional feminism .",

  "/wiki/Fairy_tales": "A fairy tale , fairytale , wonder tale , magic tale , or M\u00e4rchen is an instance of a folklore genre that takes the form of a short story . Such stories typically feature entities such as dwarfs , dragons , elves , fairies , giants , gnomes , goblins , griffins , mermaids , talking animals , trolls , unicorns , or witches , and usually magic or enchantments . In most cultures , there is no clear line separating myth from folk or fairy tale ; all these together form the literature of preliterate societies . Fairy tales may be distinguished [ by whom ? ] from other folk narratives such as legends ( which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described ) and explicit moral tales , including beast fables . The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and , at least in recent centuries , mostly relates to children 's literature . In less technical contexts , the term is also used to describe something blessed with unusual happiness , as in fairy-tale ending ( a happy ending ) or fairy-tale romance . Colloquially , the term fairy tale or fairy story can also mean any far-fetched story or tall tale ; it is used especially of any story that not only is not true , but could not possibly be true . Legends are perceived [ by whom ? ] as real ; fairy tales may merge into legends , where the narrative is perceived both by teller and hearers as being grounded in historical truth . However , unlike legends and epics , fairy tales usually do not contain more than superficial references to religion and to actual places , people , and events ; they take place once upon a time rather than in actual times . Fairy tales occur both in oral and in literary form ; the name fairy tale ( conte de f\u00e9es in French ) was first ascribed to them by Madame d'Aulnoy in the late 17th century .",
  "/wiki/Robert_Henryson": "Robert Henryson ( Middle Scots : Robert Henrysoun ) was a poet who flourished in Scotland in the period c. 1460-1500 . Counted among the Scots makars , he lived in the royal burgh of Dunfermline and is a distinctive voice in the Northern Renaissance at a time when the culture was on a cusp between medieval and renaissance sensibilities . Little is known of his life , but evidence suggests that he was a teacher who had training in law and the humanities , that he had a connection with Dunfermline Abbey and that he may also have been associated for a period with Glasgow University . His poetry was composed in Middle Scots at a time when this was the state language . It is one of the most important bodies of work in the canon of early Scottish literature . His writing consists mainly of narrative works highly inventive in their development of story-telling techniques . He generally achieved a canny balance of humour and high seriousness which is often multi-layered in its effects . This is especially so in his Morall Fabillis , in which he expresses a consistent but complex world view that seems standard , on the surface , vis a vis the major ruling power of the church , while containing critical and questioning elements . This range is further extended in his Testament of Cresseid with its more tragic vision . Overall , his themes and tone convey an attractive impression of humanity and compassionate intellect . He was a subtle rhetorician and remains to this day one of the finest in the Scots language . Although his writing usually incorporated a typically medieval didactic purpose , it also has much in common with other artistic currents of northern Europe which were generally developing , such as the realism of Flemish painting , the historical candour of Barbour or the narrative scepticism of Chaucer ."
