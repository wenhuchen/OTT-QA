Accused of blasphemy at his trial , he made a speech denouncing the Jewish authorities who were sitting in judgment on him and was then stoned to death . His martyrdom was witnessed by Saul of Tarsus , a Pharisee who would later become a follower of Jesus and known as Paul the Apostle .

Stephen is mentioned in Acts 6 as one of the Greek-speaking Hellenistic Jews selected to participate in a fairer distribution of welfare to the Greek-speaking widows . The Catholic , Anglican , Oriental Orthodox , Eastern Orthodox Churches , and the Church of the East venerate Stephen as a saint . The Lutheran Church recognizes Stephen as a saint as it recognizes all Christians as saints . Traditionally , Stephen is invested with a crown of martyrdom ; artistic representations often depict him with three stones and the martyr 's palm frond .

Other titles for John include John the Forerunner in Eastern Christianity , John the Immerser in some Baptist traditions , and the prophet John ( Ya\u1e25y\u0101 ) in Islam . He is sometimes alternatively called John the Baptizer . John the Baptist is mentioned by the Hebrew historian Josephus and revered as a major religious figure in Christianity , Islam , the Bah\u00e1 ' \u00ed Faith , and Mandaeism . He is called a prophet by all of these faiths , and is honored as a saint in many Christian traditions . According to the New Testament , John anticipated a messianic figure greater than himself , and the Gospels portray John as the precursor or forerunner of Jesus , since John announces Jesus ' coming and prepares the people for Jesus ' ministry . Jesus himself identifies John as Elijah who is to come , which some biblical scholars interpret to mean that Jesus believed that John was the reincarnation of the Old Testament prophet Elijah , although John the Baptist in the Gospel of John explicitly denies being linked to Elijah ( John 1:21 ) . According to the New Testament , John the Baptist and Jesus of Nazareth were relatives . Some scholars maintain that John belonged to the Essenes , a semi-ascetic Judaic sect who expected a Hebrew messiah and who practiced ritual baptism . John used baptism as the central symbol or sacrament of his pre-messianic movement . Most scholars agree that John baptized Jesus , and several New Testament accounts report that some of Jesus ' early followers had previously been followers of John . According to the New Testament John was sentenced to death and subsequently beheaded by Herod Antipas sometime between 28 and 36 AD after John rebuked him for divorcing his wife , Phasaelis , and then unlawfully wedding Herodias , the wife of his brother Herod Philip I .",

  "/wiki/Holy_Saviour": "Two names and a variety of titles are used to refer to Jesus in the New Testament . In Christianity , the two names Jesus and Emmanuel that refer to Jesus in the New Testament have salvific attributes . After the crucifixion of Jesus the early Church did not simply repeat his messages , but focused on him , proclaimed him , and tried to understand and explain his message . One element of the process of understanding and proclaiming Jesus was the attribution of titles to him . Some of the titles that were gradually used in the early Church and then appeared in the New Testament were adopted from the Jewish context of the age , while others were selected to refer to , and underscore the message , mission and teachings of Jesus . In time , some of these titles gathered significant Christological significance . Christians have attached theological significance to the Holy Name of Jesus . The use of the name of Jesus in petitions is stressed in John 16:23 when Jesus states : If you ask the Father anything in my name he will give it you .

  "/wiki/Assumption_of_the_Blessed_Virgin_Mary": "The Assumption of Mary into Heaven ( often shortened to the Assumption ) is , according to the beliefs of the Catholic Church , Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy , the bodily taking up of the Virgin Mary into Heaven at the end of her earthly life . In the churches that observe it , the Assumption is a major feast day , commonly celebrated on 15 August . In many countries , the feast is also marked as a Holy Day of Obligation in the Roman Catholic Church . The Catholic Church teaches as dogma that the Virgin Mary having completed the course of her earthly life , was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory . This doctrine was dogmatically defined by Pope Pius XII on 1 November 1950 , in the apostolic constitution Munificentissimus Deus by exercising papal infallibility . While the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church believe in the Dormition of the Mother of God ( Dormition of the Theotokos or the Falling Asleep of the Mother of God ) , whether Mary had a physical death has not been dogmatically defined . In Munificentissimus Deus ( item 39 ) Pope Pius XII pointed to the Book of Genesis ( 3:15 ) as scriptural support for the dogma in terms of Mary 's victory over sin and death through her intimate association with the new Adam ( Christ ) as also reflected in 1 Corinthians 15:54 : then shall come to pass the saying that is written , Death is swallowed up in victory . The New Testament contains no explicit narrative about the death or Dormition , nor of the Assumption of Mary , but several scriptural passages have been theologically interpreted to describe the ultimate fate in this and the afterworld of the Mother of Jesus ( see below ) .
