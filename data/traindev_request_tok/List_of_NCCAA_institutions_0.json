Kansas is bordered by Nebraska on the north ; Missouri on the east ; Oklahoma on the south ; and Colorado on the west . Kansas is named after the Kansas River , which in turn was named after the Kansa Native Americans who lived along its banks . The tribe 's name ( natively kk\u0105 : ze ) is often said to mean people of the ( south ) wind although this was probably not the term 's original meaning . For thousands of years , what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes . Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys . Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison . Kansas was first settled by Americans in 1827 with the establishment of Fort Leavenworth . The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s , in the midst of political wars over the slavery debate . When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the Kansas-Nebraska Act , abolitionist Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a free state or a slave state . Thus , the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided , and was known as Bleeding Kansas .",

[ a ] It is the most populous city in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex , the fourth-largest metropolitan area in the country at 7.5 million people . Dallas and nearby Fort Worth were initially developed due to the construction of major railroad lines through the area allowing access to cotton , cattle and later oil in North and East Texas . The construction of the Interstate Highway System reinforced Dallas 's prominence as a transportation hub , with four major interstate highways converging in the city and a fifth interstate loop around it . Dallas then developed as a strong industrial and financial center and a major inland port , due to the convergence of major railroad lines , interstate highways and the construction of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport , one of the largest and busiest airports in the world . In addition , Dallas has DART ( Dallas Area Rapid Transit ) with different colored train lines that transport throughout the metroplex . Dominant sectors of its diverse economy include defense , financial services , information technology , telecommunications , and transportation .
