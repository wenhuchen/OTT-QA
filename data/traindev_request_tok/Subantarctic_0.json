At 165,250,000 square kilometers ( 63,800,000 square miles ) in area ( as defined with an Antarctic southern border ) , this largest division of the World Ocean - and , in turn , the hydrosphere - covers about 46% of Earth 's water surface and about one-third of its total surface area , making it larger than all of Earth 's land area combined . The centers of both the Water Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere are in the Pacific Ocean . The equator subdivides it into the North ( ern ) Pacific Ocean and South ( ern ) Pacific Ocean , with two exceptions : the Gal\u00e1pagos and Gilbert Islands , while straddling the equator , are deemed wholly within the South Pacific .

It has a total land area of 268,000 square kilometres ( 103,500 sq mi ) . New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 mi ) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres ( 600 mi ) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal , fungal , and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , and its most populous city is Auckland . Sometime between 1250 and 1300 , Polynesians settled in the islands and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture . In 1642 , Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight New Zealand . In 1840 , representatives of the United Kingdom and M\u0101ori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi , which declared British sovereignty over the islands . In 1841 , New Zealand became a colony within the British Empire and in 1907 it became a dominion ; it gained full statutory independence in 1947 and the British monarch remained the head of state .",

They did not make a landfall , and he mislabeled the coordinates for the island and the island was not sighted again until 1808 , when the British whaler captain James Lindsay named it Lindsay Island . The first claim of landing , although disputed , was by American sailor Benjamin Morrell . In 1825 , the island was claimed for the British Crown by George Norris , who named it Liverpool Island . He also reported Thompson Island as nearby , although this was later shown to be a phantom island . The first Norvegia expedition landed on the island in 1927 and claimed it for Norway .",

Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders . Today , owing to France 's past overseas expansion , there are numerous French-based creole languages , most notably Haitian Creole . A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French .
