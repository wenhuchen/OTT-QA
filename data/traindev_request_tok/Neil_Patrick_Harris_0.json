The character first appeared in Showcase # 4 ( October 1956 ) , created by writer Robert Kanigher and penciler Carmine Infantino . Barry Allen is a reinvention of a previous character called the Flash , who appeared in 1940s comic books as the character Jay Garrick . Because he is a speedster , his power consists mainly of superhuman speed . Various other effects are also attributed to his ability to control the speed of molecular vibrations , including his ability to vibrate at speed to pass through objects . The Flash wears a distinct red and gold costume treated to resist friction and wind resistance , traditionally storing the costume compressed inside a ring . Barry Allen 's classic stories introduced the concept of the Multiverse to DC Comics , and this concept played a large part in DC 's various continuity reboots over the years . The Flash has traditionally always had a significant role in DC 's major company-wide reboot stories , and in the crossover Crisis on Infinite Earths # 8 ( Nov. 1985 ) , Barry Allen died saving the Multiverse , removing the character from the regular DC lineup for 23 years . His return to regular comics is foreshadowed during the narrative ( and a single image of a blur ) in Grant Morrison 's crossover story Final Crisis : Rogues ' Revenge # 3 ( Nov. 2008 ) , fully actualized in Geoff Johns ' accompanying The Flash : Rebirth # 1 ( June 2009 ) , kicking off a six-issue limited series . He has since played a pivotal role in the crossover stories Blackest Night ( 2009 ) , Flashpoint ( 2011 ) , Convergence ( 2015 ) , and DC Rebirth ( 2016 ) . Allen is the most well-known and commonly featured individual to take the mantle of the Flash , being present in numerous media adaptations , one-shots and comic-book story-arcs taking place in alternate universes . Barry Allen has been featured in several media , first appearing in animated form in the 1967 The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure and then in the related Super Friends program .",

The youngest in a family of acrobats known as the Flying Graysons , Richard watches a mafia boss named Tony Zucco kill his parents in order to extort money from the circus that employed them .

Drawing inspiration from Batman and Robin , the two protect Kandor as the superheroes Nightwing and Flamebird . Following the Crisis on Infinite Earths continuity reboot in 1985 , Nightwing was re-imagined as a legendary vigilante from Krypton whose story inspires Dick Grayson 's choice of name when he leaves behind his Robin identity . Other stories set among the Batman family of characters have seen acquaintances and friends of Richard John Dick Grayson briefly assume the title , including his fellow Robin alumnus Jason Todd . Meanwhile , Superman stories have seen Superman 's adopted son Chris Kent and Power Girl take up the name for brief turns as Nightwing .
