  "/wiki/Nandrolone": "Nandrolone , also known as 19-nortestosterone , is an androgen and anabolic steroid ( AAS ) which is used in the form of esters such as nandrolone decanoate ( brand name Deca-Durabolin ) and nandrolone phenylpropionate ( brand name Durabolin ) . Nandrolone esters are used in the treatment of anemias , cachexia ( wasting syndrome ) , osteoporosis , breast cancer , and for other indications . They are not used by mouth and instead are given by injection into muscle or fat . Side effects of nandrolone esters include symptoms of masculinization like acne , increased hair growth , voice changes , and increased sexual desire . They are synthetic androgens and anabolic steroids and hence are agonists of the androgen receptor ( AR ) , the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) . Nandrolone esters have strong anabolic effects and weak androgenic effects , which give them a mild side effect profile and make them especially suitable for use in women and children . They are long-lasting prodrugs of nandrolone in the body . Nandrolone esters were first described and introduced for medical use in the late 1950s . They are among the most widely used AAS worldwide . In addition to their medical use , nandrolone esters are used to improve physique and performance , and are said to be the most widely used AAS for such purposes . The drugs are controlled substances in many countries and so non-medical use is generally illicit .",

  "/wiki/Testosterone": "Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone and anabolic steroid . In male humans , testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as testes and prostate , as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass , and the growth of body hair . In addition , testosterone is involved in health and well-being , and the prevention of osteoporosis . Insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty and bone loss . Testosterone is a steroid from the androstane class containing a keto and hydroxyl groups at the three and seventeen positions respectively . It is biosynthesized in several steps from cholesterol and is converted in the liver to inactive metabolites . It exerts its action through binding to and activation of the androgen receptor . In humans and most other vertebrates , testosterone is secreted primarily by the testicles of males and , to a lesser extent , the ovaries of females . On average , in adult males , levels of testosterone are about 7 to 8 times as great as in adult females . As the metabolism of testosterone in males is more pronounced , the daily production is about 20 times greater in men . Females are also more sensitive to the hormone . In addition to its role as a natural hormone , testosterone is used as a medication in the treatment of low testosterone levels in men , transgender hormone therapy for transgender men , and breast cancer in women .",
