Sabrina was created by writer George Gladir and artist Dan DeCarlo , and first appeared in Archie 's Madhouse # 22 ( cover-dated Oct. 1962 ) . Storylines of the character at elementary-school-age also appear under the title Sabrina -- That Cute Little Witch in almost all of the Little Archie comics . The series ' premise is that Sabrina , a half-witch - her mother is an ordinary human , or mortal as witches refer to them , while her father is a warlock - lives with her two aunts , Hilda and Zelda Spellman , both witches themselves , in the fictional town of Greendale , which is located somewhere near Riverdale , the home of Archie Andrews . Also living with the three women as the family pet is Salem Saberhagen , a witch who has been turned into a cat as punishment for world domination attempts . Sabrina 's primary romantic interest is her mortal boyfriend Harvey Kinkle who , like nearly all the other mortals in Sabrina 's world , is unaware his girlfriend is a witch . Most of Sabrina 's adventures consist of Sabrina either trying to use her powers in secret to help others - witches generally are not allowed to tell mortals about their abilities or existence - or dealing with the day-to-day trials of being a teenager . A recurring theme in Sabrina 's stories is her learning more about the proper use of her powers , either through her aunts or from trips to a magical dimension that is the home of various magical/mythological creatures , including other witches . Various names are given to this dimension ; the mid-late 2000s comics refer to it as the Magic Realm , while the live-action sitcom referred to it as the Other Realm . The comic 's characters have also appeared in various other media formats . The live-action sitcom , in which Sabrina discovers her powers at the age of sixteen , aired for seven seasons on ABC and the WB .

  "/wiki/Discordianism": "Discordianism is a paradigm based upon the book Principia Discordia , written by Greg Hill with Kerry Wendell Thornley in 1963 , the two working under the pseudonyms Malaclypse the Younger and Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst . According to self-proclaimed crackpot historian Adam Gorightly , Discordianism was founded as a parody religion . Many outside observers still regard Discordianism as a parody religion , although some of its adherents may utilize it as a legitimate religion or as a metaphor for a governing philosophy . The Principia Discordia , if read literally , encourages the worship of the Greek goddess Eris , known in Latin as Discordia , the goddess of disorder , or archetypes and ideals associated with her . Depending on the version of Discordianism , Eris might be considered the goddess exclusively of disorder or the goddess of disorder and chaos . Both views are supported by the Principia Discordia . The Principia Discordia holds three core principles : the Aneristic ( order ) , the Eristic ( disorder ) , and the notion that both are mere illusions . Due to these principles , a Discordian believes there is no distinction between disorder and chaos , since the only difference between the two is that one refers to 'order ' . An argument presented by the text is that it is only by rejecting these principles that you can truly perceive reality as it is , chaos . It is difficult to estimate the number of Discordians because they are not required to hold Discordianism as their only belief system , and because , by nature of the system itself , there is an encouragement to form schisms and cabals .",

  "/wiki/Godzilla": "Godzilla ( Japanese : \u30b4\u30b8\u30e9 , Hepburn : G\u014djira ) ( /\u0261\u0252d\u02c8z\u026al\u0259/ ; [ \u0261o\ua71cd\u0291i\u027ea ] ( listen ) ) is a fictional monster , or kaiju , originating from a series of Japanese films of the same name . The character first appeared in Ishir\u014d Honda 's 1954 film Godzilla and became a worldwide pop culture icon , appearing in various media , including 32 films produced by Toho , three Hollywood films and numerous video games , novels , comic books and television shows . Godzilla has been dubbed the King of the Monsters , a phrase first used in Godzilla , King of the Monsters ! , the Americanized version of the original film . Godzilla is depicted as an enormous , destructive , prehistoric sea monster awakened and empowered by nuclear radiation . With the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Lucky Dragon 5 incident still fresh in the Japanese consciousness , Godzilla was conceived as a metaphor for nuclear weapons . As the film series expanded , some stories took on less serious undertones , portraying Godzilla as an antihero , or a lesser threat who defends humanity . With the end of the Cold War , several post-1984 Godzilla films shifted the character 's portrayal to themes including Japan 's forgetfulness over its imperial past , natural disasters and the human condition . Godzilla has been featured alongside many supporting characters . It has faced human opponents such as the JSDF , or other monsters , including King Ghidorah , Mechagodzilla and Gigan .

  "/wiki/Nazis": "National Socialism ( German : Nationalsozialismus ) , more commonly known as Nazism ( /\u02c8n\u0251\u02d0tsi\u026az\u0259m , \u02c8n\u00e6t-/ ) , is the ideology and practices associated with the Nazi Party - officially the National Socialist German Workers ' Party ( Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei or NSDAP ) - in Nazi Germany , and of other far-right groups with similar ideas and aims . Nazism is a form of fascism and showed that ideology 's disdain for liberal democracy and the parliamentary system , but also incorporated fervent antisemitism , anti-communism , scientific racism , and eugenics into its creed . Its extreme nationalism came from Pan-Germanism and the ethno-nationalist v\u00f6lkisch movement prominent in the German nationalism of the time , and it was strongly influenced by the Freikorps paramilitary groups that emerged after Germany 's defeat in World War I , from which came the party 's cult of violence which was at the heart of the movement . Nazism subscribed to pseudo-scientific theories of racial hierarchy and Social Darwinism , identifying the Germans as a part of what the Nazis regarded as an Aryan or Nordic master race . It aimed to overcome social divisions and create a German homogeneous society based on racial purity which represented a people 's community ( Volksgemeinschaft ) . The Nazis aimed to unite all Germans living in historically German territory , as well as gain additional lands for German expansion under the doctrine of Lebensraum and exclude those who they deemed either community aliens or inferior races . The term National Socialism arose out of attempts to create a nationalist redefinition of socialism , as an alternative to both Marxist international socialism and free market capitalism . Nazism rejected the Marxist concepts of class conflict and universal equality , opposed cosmopolitan internationalism , and sought to convince all parts of the new German society to subordinate their personal interests to the common good , accepting political interests as the main priority of economic organization , which tended to match the general outlook of collectivism or communitarianism rather than economic socialism . The Nazi Party 's precursor , the Pan-German nationalist and antisemitic German Workers ' Party , was founded on 5 January 1919 . By the early 1920s the party was renamed the National Socialist German Workers ' Party - to attract workers away from left-wing parties such as the Social Democrats ( SPD ) and the Communists ( KPD ) - and Adolf Hitler assumed control of the organization . The National Socialist Program or 25 Points was adopted in 1920 and called for a united Greater Germany that would deny citizenship to Jews or those of Jewish descent , while also supporting land reform and the nationalization of some industries . In Mein Kampf ( My Struggle ; 1924-1925 ) , Hitler outlined the anti-Semitism and anti-Communism at the heart of his political philosophy , as well as his disdain for representative democracy and his belief in Germany 's right to territorial expansion .",
