  "/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)": "The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States , along with its main rival , the Republican Party . Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison 's Democratic-Republican Party , the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson , making it the world 's oldest active political party . In its early years , the Party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s , the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform . Well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings ; following the New Deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South . The New Deal Coalition of 1932-1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction - many of whom were Catholics based in the cities . After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the core bases of the two parties shifted , with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic . The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s . White evangelicals and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local levels since the 1990s . People living in urban areas , women , college graduates , sexual and gender minorities , millennials , and black , Latino , Jewish , Muslim and Asian Americans tend to support the Democratic Party .

  "/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States": "The vice president of the United States is the second-highest officer in the executive branch of the U.S. federal government , after the president of the United States , and ranks first in the presidential line of succession . The vice president is also an officer in the legislative branch , as president of the Senate . In this capacity , the vice president is empowered to preside over Senate deliberations , but may not vote except to cast a tie-breaking vote . The vice president also presides over joint sessions of Congress . The vice president is indirectly elected together with the president to a four-year term of office by the people of the United States through the Electoral College . Section 2 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment , ratified in 1967 , created a mechanism for intra-term vice presidential succession , establishing that vice presidential vacancies will be filled by the president and confirmed by both houses of Congress . Prior to 1967 , in the event a vice president succeeded to the presidency , died , or resigned from office , the vice presidency remained vacant until the next presidential and vice presidential terms began . The vice president is also a statutory member of the National Security Council , and the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution . The Office of the Vice President assists and organises the vice president 's official functions . The role of the vice presidency has changed dramatically since the office was created during the 1787 constitutional Convention . Especially over the past 100 years , the vice presidency has evolved into a position of domestic and foreign policy political power , and is now widely seen as an integral part of a president 's administration . As the vice president 's role within the executive branch has expanded , his role within the legislative branch has contracted ; for example , he presides over the Senate only infrequently ."
