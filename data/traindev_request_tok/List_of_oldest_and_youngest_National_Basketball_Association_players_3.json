National Basketball Association ( NBA ) teams took turns selecting amateur United States college basketball players and other eligible players , including international players . It was televised nationally by ESPN . State Farm was the presenting sponsor of the NBA draft for the seventh consecutive year . This draft was the last to use the original weighted lottery system that gave teams near the bottom of the NBA draft better odds at the top three picks of the draft while teams higher up had worse odds in the process ; the rule was agreed upon by the NBA on September 28 , 2017 , but would not be implemented until the 2019 draft . It was also considered the final year where undrafted college underclassmen were forced to begin their professional careers early ; on August 8 , 2018 , the NCAA announced that players who declared for the NBA draft and were not selected would have the opportunity to return to their school for at least another year . With the last year of what was , at the time , the most recent lottery system ( with the NBA draft lottery being held in Chicago instead of in New York ) , the Phoenix Suns won the first overall pick on May 15 , 2018 , with the Sacramento Kings at the second overall pick and the Atlanta Hawks at third overall pick . The Suns ' selection was their first No . 1 overall selection in franchise history . They used the selection on the Bahamian center Deandre Ayton from the nearby University of Arizona . This draft was also notable for its lack of draft-day trades involving NBA veterans . An average of more than five veterans per year were traded on the day of the last three drafts , but this draft was the first since 2003 in which no such trades were announced .",
