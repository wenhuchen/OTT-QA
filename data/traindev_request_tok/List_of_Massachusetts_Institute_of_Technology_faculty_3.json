  "/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine": "The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded yearly by the Nobel Foundation for outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine . One of five prizes bequested in 1895 by Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel , it is an award for scientific progress through laboratory discoveries in experimental physiology . The Nobel Prize is presented annually on the anniversary of Nobel 's death , 10 December . As of 2019 , 110 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine have been awarded to 207 men and 12 women . The first one was awarded in 1901 to the German physiologist Emil von Behring , for his work on serum therapy and the development of a vaccine against diphtheria . The first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , Gerty Cori , received it in 1947 for her role in elucidating the metabolism of glucose , important in many aspects of medicine , including treatment of diabetes . The prize consists of a medal along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award . The front side of the medal displays the same profile of Alfred Nobel depicted on the medals for Physics , Chemistry , and Literature ; the reverse side is unique to this medal . The most recent Nobel prize was announced by Karolinska Institute on 7 October 2019 , and has been awarded to Americans William Kaelin Jr. , Gregg L. Semenza and British Peter J. Ratcliffe - for their discoveries of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability . Some awards have been controversial . This includes one to Ant\u00f3nio Egas Moniz in 1949 for the prefrontal lobotomy , bestowed despite protests from the medical establishment . Other controversies resulted from disagreements over who was included in the award .",

Serving as a senior research mathematician at Princeton University during the later part of his life , he shared the 1994 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with game theorists Reinhard Selten and John Harsanyi . In 2015 , he also shared the Abel Prize with Louis Nirenberg for his work on nonlinear partial differential equations . John Nash is the only person to be awarded both the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences and the Abel Prize . In 1959 , Nash began showing clear signs of mental illness , and spent several years at psychiatric hospitals being treated for paranoid schizophrenia . After 1970 , his condition slowly improved , allowing him to return to academic work by the mid-1980s .
