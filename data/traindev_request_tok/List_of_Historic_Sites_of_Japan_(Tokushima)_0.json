It is the most common source ore for refining elemental mercury , and is the historic source for the brilliant red or scarlet pigment termed vermilion and associated red mercury pigments . Cinnabar generally occurs as a vein-filling mineral associated with recent volcanic activity and alkaline hot springs . The mineral resembles quartz in symmetry and in its exhibiting birefringence . Cinnabar has a mean refractive index near 3.2 , a hardness between 2.0 and 2.5 , and a specific gravity of approximately 8.1 . The color and properties derive from a structure that is a hexagonal crystalline lattice belonging to the trigonal crystal system , crystals that sometimes exhibit twinning . Cinnabar has been used for its color since antiquity in the Near East , including as a rouge-type cosmetic , in the New World since the Olmec culture , and in China since as early as the Yangshao culture , where it was used in coloring stoneware . Associated modern precautions for use and handling of cinnabar arise from the toxicity of the mercury component , which was recognized as early as ancient Rome ."
