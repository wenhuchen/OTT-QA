  "/wiki/Jane_and_the_Dragon": "Jane and the Dragon is a series of children 's books written and illustrated by Martin Baynton . The original trilogy consists of Jane and the Dragon ( 1988 ) , The Dragon 's Purpose ( 1989 ) , and Jane and the Magician ( 2000 ) . In 2008 two further books followed : Three 's a Crowd and A Dragon 's Tail . The first book features Jane , a young girl whose mother is a lady-in-waiting to the queen . Jane is expected to grow up in her mother 's footsteps , but wishes to become a knight . When the royal prince is kidnapped by a dragon ( who lives near by the kingdom ) , Jane sets out to rescue the boy . She does and becomes a squire in the process . She does not slay the dragon but instead befriends him , and they soon become best friends . Their adventures continue in the next four books . Baynton says that the inspiration for the books came from his wanting to write a story about a girl who wanted to follow her dreams despite the expectations of her family and friends and from a young girl telling him how she hated fairy stories because the girls were wimps . The book series inspired an animated series on television .",
  "/wiki/Writer": "A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate ideas . Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels , short stories , poetry , plays , screenplays , and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public . Writers ' texts are published across a range of media . Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well , often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society . The term writer is also used elsewhere in the arts - such as songwriter - but as a standalone writer normally refers to the creation of written language . Some writers work from an oral tradition . Writers can produce material across a number of genres , fictional or non-fictional . Other writers use multiple media - for example , graphics or illustration - to enhance the communication of their ideas . Another recent demand has been created by civil and government readers for the work of non-fictional technical writers , whose skills create understandable , interpretive documents of a practical or scientific nature . Some writers may use images ( drawing , painting , graphics ) or multimedia to augment their writing . In rare instances , creative writers are able to communicate their ideas via music as well as words . As well as producing their own written works , writers often write on how they write ( that is , the process they use ) ; why they write ( that is , their motivation ) ; and also comment on the work of other writers ( criticism ) .",
  "/wiki/Illustrator": "An illustrator is an artist who specializes in enhancing writing or elucidating concepts by providing a visual representation that corresponds to the content of the associated text or idea . The illustration may be intended to clarify complicated concepts or objects that are difficult to describe textually , which is the reason illustrations are often found in children 's books . Illustration is the art of making images that work with something and add to it without needing direct attention and without distracting from what they illustrate . The other thing is the focus of the attention , and the illustration 's role is to add personality and character without competing with that other thing . Illustrations have been used in advertisements , architectural rendering , greeting cards , posters , books , graphic novels , storyboards , business , technical communications , magazines , shirts , video games , tutorials , and newspapers . A cartoon illustration can add humor to stories or essays .",

  "/wiki/Brothers_Grimm": "The Brothers Grimm ( die Br\u00fcder Grimm or die Gebr\u00fcder Grimm ) , Jacob Ludwig Karl ( 1785-1863 ) and Wilhelm Carl ( 1786-1859 ) , were German academics , philologists , cultural researchers , lexicographers and authors who together collected and published folklore during the 19th century . They were among the first and best-known collectors of German and European folk tales , and popularized traditional oral tale types such as Cinderella ( Aschenputtel ) , The Frog Prince ( Der Froschk\u00f6nig ) , The Goose-Girl ( Die G\u00e4nsemagd ) , Hansel and Gretel ( H\u00e4nsel und Gretel ) , Rapunzel , Rumpelstiltskin ( Rumpelstilzchen ) , Sleeping Beauty ( Dornr\u00f6schen ) , and Snow White ( Schneewittchen ) . Their classic collection , Children 's and Household Tales ( Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen ) , was published in two volumes - the first in 1812 and the second in 1815 . The brothers were born in the town of Hanau in Hesse-Cassel ( now Germany ) and spent most of their childhood in the nearby town of Steinau . Their father 's death in 1796 impoverished the family and affected the brothers for many years after . They attended the University of Marburg where they began a lifelong dedication to researching the early history of German language and literature , including German folktales . The rise of Romanticism during the 18th century had revived interest in traditional folk stories , which to the Grimms and their colleagues represented a pure form of national literature and culture . The Brothers Grimm established a methodology for collecting and recording folk stories that became the basis for folklore studies . Between the first edition of 1812-1815 and the seventh ( and final ) edition of 1857 , they revised their collection many times , so that it grew from 156 stories to more than 200 . In addition to collecting and editing folk tales , the brothers compiled German legends . Individually , they published a large body of linguistic and literary scholarship . Together , in 1838 , they began work on a massive historical German dictionary ( Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch ) which , in their lifetimes , they completed only as far as the word Frucht ( 'fruit ' ) .",
