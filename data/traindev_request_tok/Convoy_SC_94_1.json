  "/wiki/HMCS_Assiniboine_(I18)": "HMS Kempenfelt was a C-class destroyer built for the Royal Navy in the early 1930s . A flotilla leader , she saw service in the Home Fleet before World War II and the ship made several deployments to Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War , enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict . Kempenfelt was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy ( RCN ) in 1939 and renamed HMCS Assiniboine . During World War II , she served as a convoy escort in the battle of the Atlantic , sinking one German submarine by ramming , on anti-submarine patrols during the invasion of Normandy , and was employed as a troop transport after VE Day for returning Canadian servicemen , before being decommissioned in mid-1945 . Assiniboine was sold for scrap in 1945 , but she ran aground while being towed to the breakers and was not broken up until 1952 .",
  "/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Navy": "The Royal Canadian Navy ( RCN ; French : Marine royale canadienne ) is the naval force of Canada . The RCN is one of three environmental ( land - army , sea - navy , and air - air force ) commands within the unified Canadian Armed Forces . As of 2017 [ update ] , The Royal Canadian Navy operates 12 frigates , 4 attack submarines , 12 coastal defence vessels and 8 patrol/training vessels , as well as several auxiliary vessels . The Royal Canadian Navy consists of 8,500 Regular Force and 5,100 Primary Reserve sailors , supported by 5,300 civilians .

[ a 2 ] Founded in 1910 as the Naval Service of Canada and given royal sanction on 29 August 1911 , the Royal Canadian Navy was amalgamated with the Royal Canadian Air Force and the Canadian Army to form the unified Canadian Armed Forces in 1968 , after which it was known as Maritime Command until 2011 . In 2011 , its historical title of Royal Canadian Navy was restored . Over the course of its history , the RCN has served in the First and Second World Wars , the Korean War , the Persian Gulf War , the War in Afghanistan and numerous United Nations peacekeeping missions and NATO operations .",
  "/wiki/Canadian_River-class_destroyer": "The River class was a class of fourteen destroyers of the Royal Canadian Navy ( RCN ) that served before and during the Second World War . They were named after Canadian rivers . The River class was a dissimilar collection of warships , consisting of twelve vessels purchased from the Royal Navy and two built specifically by British yards for the RCN . They included two A class , five C class , two D class , one E class , two F class , one G class and one H class . HMCS Saguenay and HMCS Skeena were the first ships specifically built for the RCN and were adapted from the Royal Navy 's A class .",
  "/wiki/Destroyer": "In naval terminology , a destroyer is a fast , maneuverable , long-endurance warship intended to escort larger vessels in a fleet , convoy or battle group and defend them against powerful short range attackers . They were originally developed in the late 19th century by Fernando Villaamil for the Spanish Navy as a defense against torpedo boats , and by the time of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 , these torpedo boat destroyers ( TBDs ) were large , swift , and powerfully armed torpedo boats designed to destroy other torpedo boats . Although the term destroyer had been used interchangeably with TBD and torpedo boat destroyer by navies since 1892 , the term torpedo boat destroyer had been generally shortened to simply destroyer by nearly all navies by the First World War . Before World War II , destroyers were light vessels with little endurance for unattended ocean operations ; typically a number of destroyers and a single destroyer tender operated together . After the war , the advent of the guided missile allowed destroyers to take on the surface combatant roles previously filled by battleships and cruisers . This resulted in larger and more powerful guided missile destroyers more capable of independent operation . At the start of the 21st century , destroyers are the global standard for surface combatant ships , with only two nations ( United States and Russia ) operating the heavier class cruisers , with no battleships or true battlecruisers remaining . Modern guided missile destroyers are equivalent in tonnage but vastly superior in firepower to cruisers of the World War II era , and are capable of carrying nuclear-tipped cruise missiles . At 510 feet ( 160 m ) long , a displacement of 9,200 tons , and with armament of more than 90 missiles , guided missile destroyers such as the Arleigh Burke-class are actually larger and more heavily armed than most previous ships classified as guided missile cruisers . Some European navies , such as the French , Spanish , Dutch or German , use the term frigate for their destroyers , which leads to some confusion . After the Second World War , destroyers grew in size . The Allen M. Sumner-class destroyer had a displacement of 2200 tons , while the Arleigh Burke class has a displacement of up to 9600 tons , thus growing in size almost 340% .",
  "/wiki/HMCS_Battleford_(K165)": "HMCS Battleford was a Flower-class corvette of the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War . She served primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic . After the war she was sold to the Venezuelan Navy and renamed Libertad .",
  "/wiki/Flower-class_corvette": "The Flower-class corvette ( also referred to as the Gladiolus class after the lead ship ) was a British class of 294 corvettes used during World War II , specifically with the Allied navies as anti-submarine convoy escorts during the Battle of the Atlantic . Royal Navy ships of this class were named after flowers , hence the name of the class . The majority served during World War II with the Royal Navy ( RN ) and Royal Canadian Navy ( RCN ) . Several ships built largely in Canada were transferred from the RN to the United States Navy ( USN ) under the lend-lease programme , seeing service in both navies . Some corvettes transferred to the USN were manned by the US Coast Guard . The vessels serving with the US Navy were known as Temptress and Action-class patrol gunboats . Other Flower-class corvettes served with the Free French Naval Forces , the Royal Netherlands Navy , the Royal Norwegian Navy , the Royal Indian Navy , the Royal Hellenic Navy , the Royal New Zealand Navy , the Royal Yugoslav Navy , and , immediately post-war , the South African Navy . After World War II many surplus Flower-class vessels saw worldwide use in other navies , as well as civilian use . HMCS Sackville is the only member of the class to be preserved as a museum ship .",
  "/wiki/Corvette": "A corvette is a small warship . It is traditionally the smallest class of vessel considered to be a proper ( or rated ) warship . The warship class above the corvette is that of the frigate , while the class below was historically that of the sloop-of-war . The modern types of ship below a corvette are coastal patrol craft , missile boat and fast attack craft . In modern terms , a corvette is typically between 500 tons and 2,000 tons , although recent designs may approach 3,000 tons , which might instead be considered a small frigate . The word corvette is first found in Middle French , a diminutive of the Dutch word corf , meaning a small ship , from the Latin corbis , meaning basket . The rank corvette captain , equivalent in many navies to lieutenant commander , derives from the name of this type of ship . The rank is the most junior of three captain ranks in several European ( e.g. , France , Spain , Italy , Croatia ) and South American ( e.g. , Argentina , Chile ) navies , because a corvette , as the smallest class of rated warship , was traditionally the smallest class of vessel entitled to a commander of a captain rank .",

  "/wiki/HMS_Broke_(D83)": "HMS Broke was a Thornycroft type flotilla leader of the Royal Navy . She was the second of four ships of this class that were ordered from J I Thornycroft on April 1918 , and was originally named Rooke after Rear Admiral Sir George Rooke of the Dutch Wars and the Battle of Vigo Bay . The naturalist Peter Scott , among the ship 's crew in 1940 , conducted experiments in ship camouflage , having the two sides of Broke painted in different patterns .",
  "/wiki/Royal_Navy": "The Royal Navy ( RN ) is the United Kingdom 's naval warfare force . Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels .",
  "/wiki/Thornycroft_type_destroyer_leader": "The Thornycroft type leader or Shakespeare class were a class of five destroyer leaders designed by John I. Thornycroft & Company and built by them at Woolston , Southampton for the Royal Navy towards the end of World War I . They were named after historical naval leaders . Only Shakespeare and Spenser were completed in time for wartime service . The other three were completed after the war , Broke and Keppel after being towed to Royal dockyards for completion , and two further ships - Saunders and Spragge - were cancelled . The function of a leader was to carry the flag staff of a destroyer flotilla , therefore they were enlarged to carry additional crew , offices and signalling equipment , allowing a fifth gun to be carried . These ships were very similar to the Admiralty type leader , but had broad , slab-sided funnels characteristic of Thornycroft designs . The design was used as the basis for several ships built for foreign navies in the 1920s .",
  "/wiki/Flotilla_leader": "A flotilla leader was a warship of late 19th century and early 20th century navies suitable for commanding a flotilla of destroyers or other small warships , typically a small cruiser or a large destroyer ( known as a destroyer leader ) . The flotilla leader provided space , equipment and staff for the flotilla commodore ( who typically held the rank of captain ) , including a wireless room , senior engineering and gunnery officers , and administrative staff to support the officers . Originally , older light or scout cruisers were often used , but in the early 1900s , the rapidly increasing speed of new destroyer designs meant that such vessels could no longer keep pace with their charges . Accordingly , large destroyer designs were produced for use as leaders . As destroyers changed from specialized anti-torpedo boat vessels that operated in squadrons to larger multi-purpose ships that operated alone or as leaders of groups of smaller vessels , and as command and control techniques improved ( and the technology became more readily available ) , the need for specialized flotilla leaders decreased and their functions were adopted by all destroyers . The last specialized flotilla leader to be built for the Royal Navy was HMS Inglefield , launched in 1936 . Subsequent leaders used the same design as the private ships of the class , with minor detailed changes to suit them to their role . In the Royal Navy , the flotilla leader and commanding officer were known as Captain ( D ) . In the Royal Navy , flotilla leaders and divisional leaders could be identified by particular coloured bands painted on their funnels .",
