  "/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine": "The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded yearly by the Nobel Foundation for outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine . One of five prizes bequested in 1895 by Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel , it is an award for scientific progress through laboratory discoveries in experimental physiology . The Nobel Prize is presented annually on the anniversary of Nobel 's death , 10 December . As of 2019 , 110 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine have been awarded to 207 men and 12 women . The first one was awarded in 1901 to the German physiologist Emil von Behring , for his work on serum therapy and the development of a vaccine against diphtheria . The first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , Gerty Cori , received it in 1947 for her role in elucidating the metabolism of glucose , important in many aspects of medicine , including treatment of diabetes . The prize consists of a medal along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award . The front side of the medal displays the same profile of Alfred Nobel depicted on the medals for Physics , Chemistry , and Literature ; the reverse side is unique to this medal . The most recent Nobel prize was announced by Karolinska Institute on 7 October 2019 , and has been awarded to Americans William Kaelin Jr. , Gregg L. Semenza and British Peter J. Ratcliffe - for their discoveries of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability . Some awards have been controversial . This includes one to Ant\u00f3nio Egas Moniz in 1949 for the prefrontal lobotomy , bestowed despite protests from the medical establishment . Other controversies resulted from disagreements over who was included in the award .",
  "/wiki/Oxygen": "Oxygen is the chemical element with the symbol O and atomic number 8 . It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table , a highly reactive nonmetal , and an oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds . By mass , oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe , after hydrogen and helium . At standard temperature and pressure , two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen , a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O2 . Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth 's atmosphere . As compounds including oxides , the element makes up almost half of the Earth 's crust . Dioxygen is used in cellular respiration and many major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen , such as proteins , nucleic acids , carbohydrates , and fats , as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells , teeth , and bone . Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water , the major constituent of lifeforms . Oxygen is continuously replenished in Earth 's atmosphere by photosynthesis , which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water and carbon dioxide . Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms . Another form ( allotrope ) of oxygen , ozone ( O3 ) , strongly absorbs ultraviolet UVB radiation and the high-altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation . However , ozone present at the surface is a byproduct of smog and thus a pollutant .",
  "/wiki/Metabolism": "Metabolism ( /m\u0259\u02c8t\u00e6b\u0259l\u026az\u0259m/ , from Greek : \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae metabol\u0113 , change ) is the set of life-sustaining chemical reactions in organisms . The three main purposes of metabolism are : the conversion of food to energy to run cellular processes ; the conversion of food/fuel to building blocks for proteins , lipids , nucleic acids , and some carbohydrates ; and the elimination of nitrogenous wastes . These enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce , maintain their structures , and respond to their environments . ( The word metabolism can also refer to the sum of all chemical reactions that occur in living organisms , including digestion and the transport of substances into and between different cells , in which case the above described set of reactions within the cells is called intermediary metabolism or intermediate metabolism ) . Metabolic reactions may be categorized as catabolic - the breaking down of compounds ( for example , the breaking down of glucose to pyruvate by cellular respiration ) ; or anabolic - the building up ( synthesis ) of compounds ( such as proteins , carbohydrates , lipids , and nucleic acids ) . Usually , catabolism releases energy , and anabolism consumes energy . The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways , in which one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical , each step being facilitated by a specific enzyme . Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable reactions that require energy that will not occur by themselves , by coupling them to spontaneous reactions that release energy . Enzymes act as catalysts - they allow a reaction to proceed more rapidly - and they also allow the regulation of the rate of a metabolic reaction , for example in response to changes in the cell 's environment or to signals from other cells . The metabolic system of a particular organism determines which substances it will find nutritious and which poisonous . For example , some prokaryotes use hydrogen sulfide as a nutrient , yet this gas is poisonous to animals . The basal metabolic rate of an organism is the measure of the amount of energy consumed by all of these chemical reactions .",
  "/wiki/Lactic_acid": "Lactic acid is an organic acid . It has a molecular formula CH3CH ( OH ) COOH . It is white in solid state and it is miscible with water . While in liquid state ( dissolved state ) it is a colorless solution . Production includes both artificial synthesis as well as natural sources . Lactic acid is an alpha-hydroxy acid ( AHA ) due to the presence of carboxyl group adjacent to the hydroxyl group . It is used as a synthetic intermediate in many organic synthesis industries and in various biochemical industries . The conjugate base of lactic acid is called lactate . In solution , it can ionize a proton from the carboxyl group , producing the lactate ion CH3CH ( OH ) CO\u22122 . Compared to acetic acid , its pKa is 1 unit less , meaning lactic acid is ten times more acidic than acetic acid . This higher acidity is the consequence of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the \u03b1-hydroxyl and the carboxylate group . Lactic acid is chiral , consisting of two enantiomers .",

  "/wiki/Physiological_chemistry": "Biochemistry , sometimes called biological chemistry , is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms . Biochemical processes give rise to the complexity of life . A sub-discipline of both biology and chemistry , biochemistry can be divided in three fields ; structural biology , enzymology and metabolism . Over the last decades of the 20th century , biochemistry has through these three disciplines become successful at explaining living processes . Almost all areas of the life sciences are being uncovered and developed by biochemical methodology and research . Biochemistry focuses on understanding the chemical basis which allows biological molecules to give rise to the processes that occur within living cells and between cells , which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of tissues , organs , and organism structure and function . Biochemistry is closely related to molecular biology , the study of the molecular mechanisms of biological phenomena . Much of biochemistry deals with the structures , functions and interactions of biological macromolecules , such as proteins , nucleic acids , carbohydrates and lipids , which provide the structure of cells and perform many of the functions associated with life . The chemistry of the cell also depends on the reactions of smaller molecules and ions . These can be inorganic , for example water and metal ions , or organic , for example the amino acids , which are used to synthesize proteins . The mechanisms by which cells harness energy from their environment via chemical reactions are known as metabolism . The findings of biochemistry are applied primarily in medicine , nutrition , and agriculture .",
  "/wiki/Carotenoids": "Carotenoids ( /k\u0259\u02c8r\u0252t\u026an\u0254\u026ad/ ) , also called tetraterpenoids , are yellow , orange , and red organic pigments that are produced by plants and algae , as well as several bacteria , and fungi . Carotenoids give the characteristic color to pumpkins , carrots , corn , tomatoes , canaries , flamingos , salmon , lobster , shrimp , and daffodils . Carotenoids can be produced from fats and other basic organic metabolic building blocks by all these organisms . The only land dwelling arthropods known to produce carotenoids are aphids , and spider mites , which acquired the ability and genes from fungi. , It is also produced by endosymbiotic bacteria in whiteflies . Carotenoids from the diet are stored in the fatty tissues of animals , and exclusively carnivorous animals obtain the compounds from animal fat . In the human diet , absorption of carotenoids is improved when consumed with fat in a meal . Cooking carotenoid-containing vegetables in oil increases carotenoid bioavailability . There are over 1,100 known carotenoids which can be further categorized into two classes , xanthophylls ( which contain oxygen ) and carotenes ( which are purely hydrocarbons and contain no oxygen ) . All are derivatives of tetraterpenes , meaning that they are produced from 8 isoprene molecules and contain 40 carbon atoms . In general , carotenoids absorb wavelengths ranging from 400 to 550 nanometers ( violet to green light ) . This causes the compounds to be deeply colored yellow , orange , or red . Carotenoids are the dominant pigment in autumn leaf coloration of about 15-30% of tree species , but many plant colors , especially reds and purples , are due to polyphenols .",
  "/wiki/Vitamins": "A vitamin is an organic molecule ( or related set of molecules ) that is an essential micronutrient that an organism needs in small quantities for the proper functioning of its metabolism . Essential nutrients can not be synthesized in the organism , either at all or not in sufficient quantities , and therefore must be obtained through the diet . Vitamin C can be synthesized by some species but not by others ; it is not a vitamin in the first instance but is in the second . The term vitamin does not include the three other groups of essential nutrients : minerals , essential fatty acids , and essential amino acids . Most vitamins are not single molecules , but groups of related molecules called vitamers . For example , vitamin E consists of four tocopherols and four tocotrienols . The thirteen vitamins required by human metabolism are vitamin A ( as all-trans-retinol , all-trans-retinyl-esters , as well as all-trans-beta-carotene and other provitamin A carotenoids ) , vitamin B1 ( thiamine ) , vitamin B2 ( riboflavin ) , vitamin B3 ( niacin ) , vitamin B5 ( pantothenic acid ) , vitamin B6 ( pyridoxine ) , vitamin B7 ( biotin ) , vitamin B9 ( folic acid or folate ) , vitamin B12 ( cobalamins ) , vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) , vitamin D ( calciferols ) , vitamin E ( tocopherols and tocotrienols ) , and vitamin K ( quinones ) . Vitamins have diverse biochemical functions . Vitamin A acts as a regulator of cell and tissue growth and differentiation . Vitamin D provides a hormone-like function , regulating mineral metabolism for bones and other organs . The B complex vitamins function as enzyme cofactors ( coenzymes ) or the precursors for them . Vitamins C and E function as antioxidants .",

  "/wiki/Sulfur": "Sulfur ( in British English , sulphur ) is a chemical element with the symbol S and atomic number 16 . It is abundant , multivalent , and nonmetallic . Under normal conditions , sulfur atoms form cyclic octatomic molecules with a chemical formula S8 . Elemental sulfur is a bright yellow , crystalline solid at room temperature . Sulfur is the tenth most common element by mass in the universe , and the fifth most common on Earth . Though sometimes found in pure , native form , sulfur on Earth usually occurs as sulfide and sulfate minerals . Being abundant in native form , sulfur was known in ancient times , being mentioned for its uses in ancient India , ancient Greece , China , and Egypt . In the Bible , sulfur is called brimstone , which means burning stone . Today , almost all elemental sulfur is produced as a byproduct of removing sulfur-containing contaminants from natural gas and petroleum . The greatest commercial use of the element is the production of sulfuric acid for sulfate and phosphate fertilizers , and other chemical processes . The element sulfur is used in matches , insecticides , and fungicides . Many sulfur compounds are odoriferous , and the smells of odorized natural gas , skunk scent , grapefruit , and garlic are due to organosulfur compounds .",

The simplest peptides are dipeptides , followed by tripeptides , tetrapeptides , etc . A polypeptide is a long , continuous , and unbranched peptide chain . Hence , peptides fall under the broad chemical classes of biological oligomers and polymers , alongside nucleic acids , oligosaccharides , polysaccharides , and others . Peptides are distinguished from proteins on the basis of size , and as an arbitrary benchmark can be understood to contain approximately 50 or fewer amino acids . Proteins consist of one or more polypeptides arranged in a biologically functional way , often bound to ligands such as coenzymes and cofactors , or to another protein or other macromolecule ( DNA , RNA , etc . ) , or to complex macromolecular assemblies . Finally , while aspects of the lab techniques applied to peptides versus polypeptides and proteins differ ( e.g. , the specifics of electrophoresis , chromatography , etc . ) , the size boundaries that distinguish peptides from polypeptides and proteins are not absolute : long peptides such as amyloid beta have been referred to as proteins , and smaller proteins like insulin have been considered peptides . Amino acids that have been incorporated into peptides are termed residues . A water molecule is released during formation of each amide bond . All peptides except cyclic peptides have an N-terminal ( amine group ) and C-terminal ( carboxyl group ) residue at the end of the peptide ( as shown for the tetrapeptide in the image ) .",

King is best known for advancing civil rights through nonviolence and civil disobedience , inspired by his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi . King led the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and later became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference ( SCLC ) . As president of the SCLC , he then led an unsuccessful 1962 struggle against segregation in Albany , Georgia , and helped organize the nonviolent 1963 protests in Birmingham , Alabama . He helped organize the 1963 March on Washington , where he delivered his famous I Have a Dream speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial . On October 14 , 1964 , King won the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance . In 1965 , he helped organize the Selma to Montgomery marches . In his final years , he expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty and the Vietnam War . FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover considered him a radical and made him an object of the FBI 's COINTELPRO from 1963 on . FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties , recorded his extramarital liaisons and reported on them to government officials , and , in 1964 , mailed King a threatening anonymous letter , which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide .

  "/wiki/Antibodies": "An antibody ( Ab ) , also known as an immunoglobulin ( Ig ) , is a large , Y-shaped protein produced mainly by plasma cells that is used by the immune system to neutralize pathogens such as pathogenic bacteria and viruses . The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the pathogen , called an antigen , via the fragment antigen-binding ( Fab ) variable region . Each tip of the Y of an antibody contains a paratope ( analogous to a lock ) that is specific for one particular epitope ( analogous to a key ) on an antigen , allowing these two structures to bind together with precision . Using this binding mechanism , an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system , or can neutralize its target directly ( for example , by inhibiting a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival ) . Depending on the antigen , the binding may impede the biological process causing the disease or may activate macrophages to destroy the foreign substance . The ability of an antibody to communicate with the other components of the immune system is mediated via its Fc region ( located at the base of the Y ) , which contains a conserved glycosylation site involved in these interactions . The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system . Antibodies are secreted by B cells of the adaptive immune system , mostly by differentiated B cells called plasma cells . Antibodies can occur in two physical forms , a soluble form that is secreted from the cell to be free in the blood plasma , and a membrane-bound form that is attached to the surface of a B cell and is referred to as the B-cell receptor ( BCR ) . The BCR is found only on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure . In most cases , interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and , therefore , antibody generation following antigen binding . Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids , as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms .",

  "/wiki/Superconductivity": "Superconductivity is the set of physical properties observed in certain materials , wherein electrical resistance vanishes and from which magnetic flux fields are expelled . Any material exhibiting these properties is a superconductor . Unlike an ordinary metallic conductor , whose resistance decreases gradually as its temperature is lowered even down to near absolute zero , a superconductor has a characteristic critical temperature below which the resistance drops abruptly to zero . An electric current through a loop of superconducting wire can persist indefinitely with no power source . This phenomenon was discovered by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes on April 8 , 1911 , in Leiden . Like ferromagnetism and atomic spectral lines , superconductivity is a quantum mechanical mystery . It is characterized by the Meissner effect , the complete ejection of magnetic field lines from the interior of the superconductor during its transitions into the superconducting state . The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity can not be understood simply as the idealization of perfect conductivity in classical physics . In 1986 , it was discovered that some cuprate-perovskite ceramic materials have a critical temperature above 90 K ( \u2212183 \u00b0C ) . Such a high transition temperature is theoretically impossible for a conventional superconductor , leading the materials to be termed high-temperature superconductors . The cheaply available coolant liquid nitrogen boils at 77 K , and thus the existence of superconductivity at higher temperatures than this facilitates many experiments and applications that are less practical at lower temperatures .",

  "/wiki/Lawrence_Klein": "Lawrence Robert Klein ( September 14 , 1920 - October 20 , 2013 ) was an American economist . For his work in creating computer models to forecast economic trends in the field of econometrics in the Department of Economics at the University of Pennsylvania , he was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1980 specifically for the creation of econometric models and their application to the analysis of economic fluctuations and economic policies . Due to his efforts , such models have become widespread among economists . Harvard University professor Martin Feldstein told the Wall Street Journal that Klein was the first to create the statistical models that embodied Keynesian economics , tools still used by the Federal Reserve Bank and other central banks .",
  "/wiki/Econometry": "Econometrics is the application of statistical methods to economic data in order to give empirical content to economic relationships . More precisely , it is the quantitative analysis of actual economic phenomena based on the concurrent development of theory and observation , related by appropriate methods of inference . An introductory economics textbook describes econometrics as allowing economists to sift through mountains of data to extract simple relationships . The first known use of the term econometrics ( in cognate form ) was by Polish economist Pawe\u0142 Ciompa in 1910 . Jan Tinbergen is considered by many to be one of the founding fathers of econometrics . Ragnar Frisch is credited with coining the term in the sense in which it is used today . A basic tool for econometrics is the multiple linear regression model . Econometric theory uses statistical theory and mathematical statistics to evaluate and develop econometric methods . Econometricians try to find estimators that have desirable statistical properties including unbiasedness , efficiency , and consistency . Applied econometrics uses theoretical econometrics and real-world data for assessing economic theories , developing econometric models , analysing economic history , and forecasting .",

  "/wiki/Cholesterol": "Cholesterol ( from the Ancient Greek chole- ( bile ) and stereos ( solid ) , followed by the chemical suffix -ol for an alcohol ) is an organic molecule . It is a sterol ( or modified steroid ) , a type of lipid . Cholesterol is biosynthesized by all animal cells and is an essential structural component of animal cell membranes . Cholesterol also serves as a precursor for the biosynthesis of steroid hormones , bile acid and vitamin D. Cholesterol is the principal sterol synthesized by all animals . In vertebrates , hepatic cells typically produce the greatest amounts . It is absent among prokaryotes ( bacteria and archaea ) , although there are some exceptions , such as Mycoplasma , which require cholesterol for growth . Fran\u00e7ois Poulletier de la Salle first identified cholesterol in solid form in gallstones in 1769 . However , it was not until 1815 that chemist Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul named the compound cholesterine .",

  "/wiki/Prion": "Prions are misfolded proteins with the ability to transmit their misfolded shape onto normal variants of the same protein . They characterize several fatal and transmissible neurodegenerative diseases in humans and many other animals . It is not known what causes the normal protein to misfold , but the abnormal three-dimensional structure is suspected of conferring infectious properties , collapsing nearby protein molecules into the same shape . The word prion derives from proteinaceous infectious particle . The hypothesized role of a protein as an infectious agent stands in contrast to all other known infectious agents such as viruses , bacteria , fungi and parasites , all of which contain nucleic acids ( DNA , RNA or both ) . Prion variants of the prion protein ( PrP ) , whose specific function is uncertain , are hypothesized as the cause of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies ( TSEs ) , including scrapie in sheep , chronic wasting disease ( CWD ) in deer , bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) in cattle ( commonly known as mad cow disease ) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ( CJD ) in humans . All known prion diseases in mammals affect the structure of the brain or other neural tissue ; all are progressive , have no known effective treatment and are always fatal . Until 2015 , all known mammalian prion diseases were considered to be caused by the prion protein ( PrP ) ; however in 2015 multiple system atrophy ( MSA ) was found to be transmissible and was hypothesized to be caused by a prion form of alpha-synuclein . Prions form abnormal aggregates of proteins called amyloids , which accumulate in infected tissue and are associated with tissue damage and cell death . Amyloids are also responsible for several other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer 's disease and Parkinson 's disease . Prion aggregates are stable , and this structural stability means that prions are resistant to denaturation by chemical and physical agents : they can not be destroyed by ordinary disinfection or cooking . This makes disposal and containment of these particles difficult .",

  "/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy": "A Doctor of Philosophy ( PhD , Ph.D. , or DPhil ; Latin philosophiae doctor or doctor philosophiae ) is the highest university degree that is conferred after a course of study by universities in most countries . PhDs are awarded for programs across the whole breadth of academic fields . As an earned research degree , those studying for a PhD are usually required to produce original research that expands the boundaries of knowledge , normally in the form of a thesis or dissertation , and defend their work against experts in the field . The completion of a PhD is often a requirement for employment as a university professor , researcher , or scientist in many fields . Individuals who have earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree may , in many jurisdictions , use the title Doctor ( often abbreviated Dr or Dr. ) with their name , although the proper etiquette associated with this usage may also be subject to the professional ethics of their own scholarly field , culture , or society . Those who teach at universities or work in academic , educational , or research fields are usually addressed by this title professionally and socially in a salutation or conversation . Alternatively , holders may use post-nominal letters such as Ph.D. , PhD , or DPhil ( depending on the awarding institution ) . It is , however , considered incorrect to use both the title and post-nominals at the same time . The specific requirements to earn a PhD degree vary considerably according to the country , institution , and time period , from entry-level research degrees to higher doctorates . During the studies that lead to the degree , the student is called a doctoral student or PhD student ; a student who has completed all their coursework and comprehensive examinations and is working on their thesis/dissertation is sometimes known as a doctoral candidate or PhD candidate ( see : all but dissertation ) . A student attaining this level may be granted a Candidate of Philosophy degree at some institutions or may be granted a master 's degree en route to the doctoral degree . Sometimes this status is also colloquially known as PhD ABD , meaning All But Dissertation .",
  "/wiki/Femtosecond": "A femtosecond is the SI unit of time equal to 10\u221215 or 1/1,000,000,000,000,000 of a second ; that is , one quadrillionth , or one millionth of one billionth , of a second . For context , a femtosecond is to a second as a second is to about 31.71 million years ; a ray of light travels approximately 0.3 \u03bcm ( micrometers ) in 1 femtosecond , a distance comparable to the diameter of a virus . The word femtosecond is formed by the SI prefix femto and the SI unit second . Its symbol is fs . A femtosecond is equal to 1000 attoseconds , or 1/1000 picosecond . Because the next higher SI unit is 1000 times larger , times of 10\u221214 and 10\u221213 seconds are typically expressed as tens or hundreds of femtoseconds .",
  "/wiki/Spectroscopy": "Spectroscopy /sp\u025bk\u02c8tr\u0252sk\u0259pi/ is the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation ( via electron spectroscopy , atomic spectroscopy , etc ) . Historically , spectroscopy originated through the study of visible light dispersed according to its wavelength , by a prism . Later the concept was expanded greatly to include any interaction with radiative energy as a function of its wavelength or frequency , predominantly in the electromagnetic spectrum , though matter waves and acoustic waves can also be considered forms of radiative energy ; recently , with tremendous difficulty , even gravitational waves have been associated with a spectral signature in the context of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory ( LIGO ) and laser interferometry . Spectroscopic data are often represented by an emission spectrum , a plot of the response of interest , as a function of wavelength or frequency . Spectroscopy , primarily in the electromagnetic spectrum , is a fundamental exploratory tool in the fields of physics , chemistry , and astronomy , allowing the composition , physical structure and electronic structure of matter to be investigated at atomic scale , molecular scale , macro scale , and over astronomical distances . Important applications arise from biomedical spectroscopy in the areas of tissue analysis and medical imaging .",

  "/wiki/Neutrino": "A neutrino ( /nu\u02d0\u02c8tri\u02d0no\u028a/ or /nju\u02d0\u02c8tri\u02d0no\u028a/ ) ( denoted by the Greek letter \u03bd ) is a fermion ( an elementary particle with spin of 1/2 ) that interacts only via the weak subatomic force and gravity . The neutrino is so named because it is electrically neutral and because its rest mass is so small ( -ino ) that it was long thought to be zero . The mass of the neutrino is much smaller than that of the other known elementary particles . The weak force has a very short range , the gravitational interaction is extremely weak , and neutrinos do not participate in the strong interaction . Thus , neutrinos typically pass through normal matter unimpeded and undetected . Weak interactions create neutrinos in one of three leptonic flavors : electron neutrinos ( \u03bde ) , muon neutrinos ( \u03bd\u03bc ) , or tau neutrinos ( \u03bd\u03c4 ) , in association with the corresponding charged lepton . Although neutrinos were long believed to be massless , it is now known that there are three discrete neutrino masses with different tiny values , but they do not correspond uniquely to the three flavors . A neutrino created with a specific flavor has an associated specific quantum superposition of all three mass states . As a result , neutrinos oscillate between different flavors in flight . For example , an electron neutrino produced in a beta decay reaction may interact in a distant detector as a muon or tau neutrino . Although only differences between squares of the three mass values are known as of 2019 , cosmological observations imply that the sum of the three masses must be less than one millionth that of the electron . For each neutrino , there also exists a corresponding antiparticle , called an antineutrino , which also has spin of 1/2 and no electric charge ."
