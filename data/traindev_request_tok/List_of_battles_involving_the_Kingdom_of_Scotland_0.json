  "/wiki/Scotland": "Scotland ( Scots : Scotland , Scottish Gaelic : Alba [ \u02c8al\u032a\u02e0ap\u0259 ] ( listen ) ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain , with a border with England to the southeast , and is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west , the North Sea to the northeast , the Irish Sea to the south , and more than 790 islands , including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides . The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England . In 1997 , a Scottish Parliament was re-established , in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members , having authority over many areas of domestic policy . The head of the Scottish Government is the first minister of Scotland , who is supported by the deputy first minister of Scotland .",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Brunanburh": "The Battle of Brunanburh was fought in 937 between \u00c6thelstan , King of England , and an alliance of Olaf Guthfrithson , King of Dublin ; Constantine II , King of Scotland , and Owain , King of Strathclyde . The battle is often cited as the point of origin for English nationalism : historians such as Michael Livingston argue that the men who fought and died on that field forged a political map of the future that remains [ in modernity ] , arguably making the Battle of Brunanburh one of the most significant battles in the long history not just of England , but of the whole of the British Isles . Following an unchallenged invasion of Scotland by \u00c6thelstan in 934 , possibly launched because Constantine had violated a peace treaty , it became apparent that \u00c6thelstan could be defeated only by an alliance of his enemies . Olaf led Constantine and Owen in the alliance . In August 937 Olaf and his army sailed from Dublin to join forces with Constantine and Owen , but the invaders were routed in the battle against \u00c6thelstan . The poem Battle of Brunanburh in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recounts that there were never yet as many people killed before this with sword 's edge . since the east Angles and Saxons came up over the broad sea . \u00c6thelstan 's victory preserved the unity of England . The historian \u00c6thelweard wrote around 975 that [ t ] he fields of Britain were consolidated into one , there was peace everywhere , and abundance of all things . Alfred Smuth has called the battle the greatest single battle in Anglo-Saxon history before Hastings . The site of the battle is unknown and scholars have proposed many places .",
  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Dublin": "Vikings invaded the territory around Dublin in the 9th century , establishing the Norse Kingdom of Dublin , the earliest and longest-lasting Norse kingdom in Ireland . Its territory corresponded to most of present-day County Dublin . The Norse referred to the kingdom as Dyflin , which is derived from Irish Dubh Linn , meaning 'black pool ' . The first reference to the Vikings comes from the Annals of Ulster and the first entry for 841 AD reads : Pagans still on Lough Neagh . It is from this date onward that historians get references to ship fortresses or longphorts being established in Ireland . It may be safe to assume that the Vikings first over-wintered in 840-841 AD . The actual location of the longphort of Dublin is still a hotly debated issue . Norse rulers of Dublin were often co-kings , and occasionally also Kings of J\u00f3rv\u00edk in what is now Yorkshire . Under their rule , Dublin became the biggest slave port in Western Europe . Over time , the settlers in Dublin became increasingly Gaelicized . They began to exhibit a great deal of Gaelic and Norse cultural syncretism , and are often referred to as Norse-Gaels . The extent of the kingdom varied , but in peaceful times it extended roughly as far as Wicklow ( Wykinglo ) in the south , Glen Ding near Blessington , Leixlip ( Lax Hlaup ) west of Dublin , and Skerries , Dublin ( Skere ) to the north .",
  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Strathclyde": "Strathclyde ( lit . Strath of the River Clyde ) , originally Cumbric : Ystrad Clud or Alclud ( and Strath-Clota in Anglo-Saxon ) , was one of the early medieval kingdoms of the Britons in what the Welsh call Hen Ogledd ( the Old North ) , the Brythonic-speaking parts of what is now southern Scotland and northern England . The kingdom developed during the post-Roman period . It is also known as Alt Clut , a Brittonic term for Dumbarton Castle , the medieval capital of the region . It may have had its origins with the Brythonic Damnonii people of Ptolemy 's Geography . The language of Strathclyde , and that of the Britons in surrounding areas under non-native rulership , is known as Cumbric , a dialect or language closely related to Old Welsh , and in modern terms to Welsh , Cornish and Breton . Scottish toponymy and archaeology points to some later settlement by Vikings or Norse-Gaels ( see Scandinavian Scotland ) , although to a lesser degree than in neighbouring Galloway . A small number of Anglian place-names show some limited settlement by Anglo-Saxon incomers from Northumbria prior to the Norse settlement . Owing to the series of language changes in the area , it is not possible to say whether any Goidelic settlement took place before Gaelic was introduced in the High Middle Ages during the 11th century . After the sack of Dumbarton Rock by a Viking army from Dublin in 870 , the name Strathclyde comes into use , perhaps reflecting a move of the centre of the kingdom to Govan . In the same period , it was also referred to as Cumbria , and its inhabitants as Cumbrians . During the High Middle Ages , the area was conquered by the Goidelic-speaking Kingdom of Alba in the 11th century , becoming part of the new Kingdom of Scotland .",
  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_England": "The Kingdom of England ( Anglo-Norman : Realme d'Engleterre , French : Royaume d'Angleterre ) was a sovereign state on the island of Great Britain from 927 , when it emerged from various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms until 1707 , when it united with Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain . On 12 July 927 , the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were united by \u00c6thelstan ( r. 927-939 ) to form the Kingdom of England . In 1016 , the kingdom became part of the North Sea Empire of Cnut the Great , a personal union between England , Denmark and Norway . The Norman conquest of England in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at Winchester to Westminster , and the City of London quickly established itself as England 's largest and principal commercial centre . Histories of the kingdom of England from the Norman conquest of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties : Norman 1066-1154 , Plantagenet 1154-1485 , Tudor 1485-1603 and Stuart 1603-1707 ( interrupted by the Interregnum of 1649-1660 ) . Dynastically , all English monarchs after 1066 ultimately claim descent from the Normans ; the distinction of the Plantagenets is merely conventional , beginning with Henry II ( reigned 1154-1189 ) as from that time , the Angevin kings became more English in nature ; the houses of Lancaster and York are both Plantagenet cadet branches , the Tudor dynasty claimed descent from Edward III via John Beaufort and James VI and I of the House of Stuart claimed descent from Henry VII via Margaret Tudor . The completion of the conquest of Wales by Edward I in 1284 put Wales under the control of the English crown . Edward III ( reigned 1327-1377 ) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe ; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and government - in particular the evolution of the English parliament . From the 1340s the kings of England also laid claim to the crown of France , but after the Hundred Years ' War and the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in 1455 , the English were no longer in any position to pursue their French claims and lost all their land on the continent , except for Calais . After the turmoils of the Wars of the Roses , the Tudor dynasty ruled during the English Renaissance and again extended English monarchical power beyond England proper , achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542 . Henry VIII oversaw the English Reformation , and his daughter Elizabeth I ( reigned 1558-1603 ) the Elizabethan Religious Settlement , meanwhile establishing England as a great power and laying the foundations of the British Empire by claiming possessions in the New World . From the accession of James VI and I in 1603 , the Stuart dynasty ruled England in personal union with Scotland and Ireland .",

Archbishop Thurstan of York had exerted himself greatly to raise the army , preaching that to withstand the Scots was to do God 's work . The centre of the English position was therefore marked by a mast ( mounted upon a cart ) bearing a pyx carrying the consecrated host and from which were flown the consecrated banners of the minsters of Durham , York , Beverley and Ripon : hence the name of the battle .

The identity of the Scottish commander is unrecorded and unknown . Herbert , Bishop of Glasgow , Baldwin , Sheriff of Lanark/Clydesdale , and Walter fitz Alan , Steward of Scotland are all possible candidates for this position .

It is the historic county town of Renfrewshire . Called the Cradle of the Royal Stewarts for its early link with Scotland 's former royal house , Renfrew gained royal burgh status in 1397 . As the county town , Renfrew once was a centre of local government for the surrounding area . Whilst the county remained known as Renfrewshire , the focus of local government gradually shifted from Renfrew to its larger neighbour Paisley . Following the reorganisation of 1996 , Renfrewshire was divided for local government purposes into three modern council areas : Renfrewshire , with considerably smaller boundaries than the old county , including Renfrew and with its administrative centre at Paisley ; Inverclyde with its centre at Greenock , covering the western part of the county ; and East Renfrewshire , with its centre at Giffnock . The boundaries of the historic County of Renfrew remain for a number of ceremonial and administrative purposes . The House of Stewart was previously based out of the former Renfrew Castle . In 1164 , it was the site of the Battle of Renfrew , a decisive victory for the Scottish crown over Somerled , Lord of the Isles . Given its link to the monarchy and the victory at Renfrew , the heir to the British throne holds the title of Baron Renfrew and Lord of the Isles , the current holder being Prince Charles , Duke of Rothesay .

  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_the_Isles": "The Kingdom of the Isles comprised the Hebrides , the islands of the Firth of Clyde and the Isle of Man from the 9th to the 13th centuries AD . The islands were known to the Norse as the Su\u00f0reyjar , or Southern Isles as distinct from the Nor\u00f0reyjar or Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland . In Scottish Gaelic , the kingdom is known as R\u00ecoghachd nan Eilean . The historical record is incomplete , and the kingdom was not a continuous entity throughout the entire period . The islands concerned are sometimes referred to as the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles , although only some of the later rulers claimed that title . At times the rulers were independent of external control , although for much of the period they had overlords in Norway , Ireland , England , Scotland or Orkney . At times there also appear to have been competing claims for all or parts of the territory . The islands involved have a total land area of over 8,300 square kilometres ( 3,205 sq mi ) and extend for more than 500 kilometres ( 310 mi ) from north to south . Viking influence in the area commenced in the late 8th century , and whilst there is no doubt that the U\u00ed \u00cdmair dynasty played a prominent role in this early period , the records for the dates and details of the rulers are speculative until the mid-10th century . Hostility between the Kings of the Isles and the rulers of Ireland , and intervention by the crown of Norway ( either directly or through their vassal the Earl of Orkney ) were recurring themes . The Laxdaela Saga contains mention of several persons who are said to have come to Iceland from Sodor , which appears to be these Su\u00f0reyjar , before or around the middle of the 10th century . An invasion by Magnus Barefoot in the late 11th century resulted in a brief period of direct Norwegian rule over the kingdom , but soon the descendants of Godred Crovan re-asserted a further period of largely independent overlordship .",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Largs": "The Battle of Largs ( 2 October 1263 ) was a decisive engagement between the kingdoms of Norway and Scotland , on the Firth of Clyde near Largs , Scotland . The conflict formed part of the Norwegian expedition against Scotland in 1263 , in which Haakon Haakonsson , King of Norway attempted to reassert Norwegian sovereignty over the western seaboard of Scotland . Since the beginning of the 12th century this region had lain within the Norwegian realm , ruled by magnates who recognised the overlordship of the Kings of Norway . In the mid-13th century , two Scottish kings , Alexander II and his son Alexander III , attempted to incorporate the region into their own realm . Following failed attempts to purchase the islands from the Norwegian king , the Scots launched military operations . Haakon responded to the Scottish aggression by leading a massive fleet from Norway , which reached the Hebrides in the summer of 1263 . By the end of September , Haakon 's fleet occupied the Firth of Clyde , and when negotiations between the kingdoms broke down , he brought the bulk of his fleet to anchor off the Cumbraes . On the night of 1 October , during a bout of stormy weather , several Norwegian vessels were driven aground on the Ayrshire coast , near present-day Largs . On 2 October , while the Norwegians were salvaging their vessels , the main Scottish army arrived on the scene . Composed of infantry and cavalry , the Scottish force was commanded by Alexander of Dundonald , Steward of Scotland . The Norwegians were gathered in two groups : the larger main force on the beach and a small contingent atop a nearby mound . The advance of the Scots threatened to divide the Norwegian forces , so the contingent on the mound ran to rejoin their comrades on the beach below .",
