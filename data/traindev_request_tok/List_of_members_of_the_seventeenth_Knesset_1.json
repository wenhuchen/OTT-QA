A secular party , it was founded in 1973 by Menachem Begin and Ariel Sharon in an alliance with several right-wing parties . Likud 's landslide victory in the 1977 elections was a major turning point in the country 's political history , marking the first time the left had lost power . In addition , it was the first time in Israel that a right-wing party won the plurality of the votes . However , after ruling the country for most of the 1980s , the party lost the Knesset election in 1992 . Nevertheless , Likud 's candidate Benjamin Netanyahu did win the vote for Prime Minister in 1996 and was given the task of forming a government after the 1996 elections . Netanyahu 's government fell apart after a vote of no confidence , which led to elections being called in 1999 and Likud losing power to the One Israel coalition led by Ehud Barak . In 2001 , Likud 's Ariel Sharon , who replaced Netanyahu following the 1999 election , defeated Barak in an election called by the Prime Minister following his resignation . After the party recorded a convincing win in the 2003 elections , Likud saw a major split in 2005 when Sharon left to form the Kadima party . This resulted in Likud slumping to fourth place in the 2006 elections and losing 28 seats in the Knesset . Following the 2009 elections , Likud was able to gain 15 seats , and , with Netanyahu back in control of the party , formed a coalition with fellow right-wing parties Yisrael Beiteinu and Shas to take control of the government from Kadima , which earned a plurality , but not a majority .",

However , over the years , they have co-operated and united as a voting bloc , in order to win the maximum number of seats in the Knesset , since many extra votes can be wasted if election thresholds are not attained under Israel 's proportional representation parliamentary system . When UTJ joined Ariel Sharon 's coalition in 2004 , it split into its two constituent factions of Degel HaTorah and Agudat Israel . Before the 2006 election , Degel HaTorah and Agudat Israel agreed to revive their alliance under the banner of United Torah Judaism to not waste votes , and to achieve maximum representation in the 17th Knesset . The party won 8 seats in the 21st Knesset elections in 2019 , which was up from 6 seats in the 20th Knesset elections in 2015 . This is , so far , the best result of the party ever , making them the 4th-strongest party in the Knesset . According to The New York Times , UTJ is notable for its embrace of technology and electronic communication systems , including the Internet , in contrast to Haredi tradition .",
