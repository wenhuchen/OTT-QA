  "/wiki/Tudor_Revival_architecture": "Tudor Revival architecture ( also known as mock Tudor in the UK ) first manifested itself in domestic architecture in the United Kingdom in the latter half of the 19th century . Based on revival of aspects that were perceived as Tudor architecture , in reality it usually took the style of English vernacular architecture of the Middle Ages that had survived into the Tudor period . The style later became an influence elsewhere , especially the British colonies . For example , in New Zealand , the architect Francis Petre adapted the style for the local climate . In Singapore , then a British colony , architects such as R. A. J. Bidwell pioneered what became known as the Black and White House . The earliest examples of the style originate with the works of such eminent architects as Norman Shaw and George Devey , in what at the time was thought Neo-Tudor design . Tudorbethan is a subset of Tudor Revival architecture that eliminated some of the more complex aspects of Jacobethan in favor of more domestic styles of Merrie England , which were cosier and quaint . It was associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement .",

Based on the setting , the pharmacy is classified as a community or institutional pharmacy . Providing direct patient care in the community of institutional pharmacies are considered clinical pharmacy . The scope of pharmacy practice includes more traditional roles such as compounding and dispensing of medications , and it also includes more modern services related to health care , including clinical services , reviewing medications for safety and efficacy , and providing drug information . Pharmacists , therefore , are the experts on drug therapy and are the primary health professionals who optimize the use of medication for the benefit of the patients . An establishment in which pharmacy ( in the first sense ) is practiced is called a pharmacy ( this term is more common in the United States ) or a chemist 's ( which is more common in Great Britain ) . In the United States and Canada , drugstores commonly sell medicines , as well as miscellaneous items such as confectionery , cosmetics , office supplies , toys , hair care products and magazines and occasionally refreshments and groceries .
