  "/wiki/NY_104": "New York State Route 104 ( NY 104 ) is a 182.41-mile-long ( 293.56 km ) east-west state highway in Upstate New York in the United States . It spans six counties and enters the vicinity of four cities - Niagara Falls , Lockport , Rochester , and Oswego - as it follows a routing largely parallel to the southern shoreline of Lake Ontario , along a ridge of the old shoreline of Glacial Lake Iroquois . The western terminus of NY 104 is an intersection with NY 384 in Niagara Falls , Niagara County , while its eastern terminus is a junction with NY 13 in the town of Williamstown , Oswego County . The portion of NY 104 between Rochester and the village of Webster east of the city is a limited-access highway known as the Keeler Street Expressway west of NY 590 and the Irondequoit-Wayne County Expressway east of NY 590 ; from Williamson to Oswego , NY 104 is a super two highway . The majority of Ridge Road and modern NY 104 from the village of Red Creek to the town of Mexico were originally designated as part of Route 30 , an unsigned legislative route , early in the 20th century . All of Ridge Road and its continuation through Oswego to the hamlet of Maple View gained a signed designation by 1926 and became part of U.S. Route 104 ( US 104 ) , a United States Numbered Highway extending from Niagara Falls to Maple View , c. 1935 . US 104 , which never connected to US 4 , its implied parent route , was redesignated as NY 104 c. 1972 . As part of the redesignation , NY 104 was extended east to NY 13 in Williamstown over what had been New York State Route 126 . The 104 designation , whether it be US 104 or NY 104 , has shifted from surface streets to expressways and super twos , particularly from Rochester east to Oswego . The first such realignment occurred in the 1940s in Wayne County and was completed by the realignment of NY 104 onto the Irondequoit-Wayne County Expressway near Webster in the 1980s .",

  "/wiki/County_Route_11_(Monroe_County,_New_York)": "The Monroe County , New York , Department of Transportation maintains 663 miles ( 1,067 km ) of roads as county routes . Unlike most counties in New York , Monroe County does not post reassurance markers along its county routes . In fact , the only field reference to a route 's designation are reference markers posted at bridges and culverts along the highway , which carry the county route number on the second line . Routes that do not cross either type of structure at some point are completely unsigned . As a result , county routes in Monroe County are widely known by their road name and not by their number . Route numbers were initially assigned across the county from east to west , beginning at the Wayne County line and generally progressing westward to the Orleans County line . Subsequent routes ( those above County Route 238 or CR 238 ) do not follow this pattern and are located in all areas of the county . As a general rule , east-west routes have designations ending in an odd number while north-south highways carry designations ending in an even number . Several county routes partially or wholly overlap with New York state touring routes , serving as internal designations for county-maintained segments of those routes .",

The route is one of the longest routes in New York State , paralleling two similarly lengthy routes , NY 104 to the north and NY 5 to the south , as well as the Erie Canal , as it proceeds east . Much of NY 31 west of Jordan was originally designated as part of a legislative route from the late 1900s to the early 1920s . NY 31 itself was assigned in the mid-1920s , utilizing all of legislative Route 30 ( modern NY 31 , NY 429 , and NY 104 ) west of Rochester and much of its current alignment from Rochester to Lenox . At Lenox , NY 31 turned southeast to follow what is now NY 316 and NY 46 to NY 5 in Oneida . It was realigned by 1929 to continue west to Lewiston on Ridge Road and altered in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to continue east to Utica via Verona . With the advent of U.S. Route 104 ( US 104 ) c. 1935 , NY 31 was realigned west of Rochester to follow most of its modern routing . NY 31 was truncated westward to NY 365 in Verona in the early 1940s , moving the eastern terminus of NY 31 to the same junction that also had served as the northern terminus of New York State Route 234 , a north-south route that extended southeastward to Vernon Center , since the early 1930s .
