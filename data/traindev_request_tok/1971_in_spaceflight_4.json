The facility will be renamed Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in February or March 2020 . CCAFS is headquartered at the nearby Patrick Air Force Base , and located on Cape Canaveral in Brevard County , Florida , CCAFS . The station is the primary launch head of America 's Eastern Range with three launch pads currently active ( Space Launch Complexes 37B , 40 , and 41 ) . Popularly known as Cape Kennedy from 1963 to 1973 , and as Cape Canaveral from 1949 to 1963 and from 1973 to the present , the facility is south-southeast of NASA 's Kennedy Space Center on adjacent Merritt Island , with the two linked by bridges and causeways . The Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Skid Strip provides a 10,000-foot ( 3,000 m ) runway close to the launch complexes for military airlift aircraft delivering heavy and outsized payloads to the Cape . A number of American space exploration pioneers were launched from CCAFS , including the first U.S. Earth satellite in 1958 , first U.S. astronaut ( 1961 ) , first U.S. astronaut in orbit ( 1962 ) , first two-man U.S. spacecraft ( 1965 ) , first U.S. unmanned lunar landing ( 1966 ) , and first three-man U.S. spacecraft ( 1968 ) . It was also the launch site for all of the first spacecraft to ( separately ) fly past each of the planets in the Solar System ( 1962-1977 ) , the first spacecraft to orbit Mars ( 1971 ) and roam its surface ( 1996 ) , the first American spacecraft to orbit and land on Venus ( 1978 ) , the first spacecraft to orbit Saturn ( 2004 ) , and to orbit Mercury ( 2011 ) , and the first spacecraft to leave the Solar System ( 1977 ) . Portions of the base have been designated a National Historic Landmark for their association with the early years of the American space program .",

Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas .",

For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty .

Launch operations for the Apollo , Skylab and Space Shuttle programs were carried out from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 and managed by KSC . Located on the east coast of Florida , KSC is adjacent to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station ( CCAFS ) . The management of the two entities work very closely together , share resources , and even own facilities on each other 's property .

Starting with the fourth Gemini mission , the NASA launch control center in Florida ( Mercury Control Center , later the Launch Control Center ) began handing off control of the vehicle to the Mission Control Center in Houston , shortly after liftoff ; in prior missions it held control throughout the entire mission . Additionally , the center manages launch of robotic and commercial crew missions and researches food production and In-Situ Resource Utilization for off-Earth exploration . Since 2010 , the center has worked to become a multi-user spaceport through industry partnerships , even adding a new launch pad ( LC-39C ) in 2015 .

Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas .

Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD .

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) ."
