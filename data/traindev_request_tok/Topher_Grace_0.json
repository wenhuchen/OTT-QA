  "/wiki/Traffic_(2000_film)": "Traffic is a 2000 American movie crime drama film directed by Steven Soderbergh and written by Stephen Gaghan . It explores the illegal drug trade from a number of perspectives : users , enforcers , politicians , and traffickers . Their stories are edited together throughout the film , although some of the characters do not meet each other . The film is an adaptation of the 1989 British Channel 4 television series Traffik . 20th Century Fox , the original financiers of the film , demanded that Harrison Ford play a leading role and that significant changes to the screenplay be made . Soderbergh refused and proposed the script to other major Hollywood studios , but it was rejected because of the three-hour running time and the subject matter - Traffic is more of a political film than most Hollywood productions . USA Films , however , liked the project from the start and offered the filmmakers more money than Fox . Soderbergh operated the camera himself and adopted a distinctive color grade for each storyline so that audiences could tell them apart . Traffic was critically acclaimed and earned numerous awards , including four Oscars : Best Director for Steven Soderbergh , Best Supporting Actor for Benicio del Toro , Best Adapted Screenplay for Stephen Gaghan and Best Film Editing for Stephen Mirrione . It was also a commercial success with a worldwide box-office revenue total of $ 207.5 million , well above its estimated $ 46 million budget . In 2004 , USA Network ran a miniseries - also called Traffic - based on this film and the 1989 British television series .",
