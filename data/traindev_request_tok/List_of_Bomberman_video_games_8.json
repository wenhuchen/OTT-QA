  "/wiki/Commodore_64": "The Commodore 64 , also known as the C64 or the CBM 64 , is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International ( first shown at the Consumer Electronics Show , in Las Vegas , January 7-10 , 1982 ) . It has been listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time , with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units . Volume production started in early 1982 , marketing in August for US $ 595 ( equivalent to $ 1,576 in 2019 ) . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET , the C64 took its name from its 64 kilobytes ( 65,536 bytes ) of RAM . With support for multicolor sprites and a custom chip for waveform generation , the C64 could create superior visuals and audio compared to systems without such custom hardware . The C64 dominated the low-end computer market for most of the 1980s . For a substantial period ( 1983-1986 ) , the C64 had between 30% and 40% share of the US market and two million units sold per year , outselling IBM PC compatibles , Apple computers , and the Atari 8-bit family of computers . Sam Tramiel , a later Atari president and the son of Commodore 's founder , said in a 1989 interview , When I was at Commodore we were building 400,000 C64s a month for a couple of years . In the UK market , the C64 faced competition from the BBC Micro and the ZX Spectrum , but the C64 was still one of the two most popular computers in the UK . Part of the Commodore 64 's success was its sale in regular retail stores instead of only electronics or computer hobbyist specialty stores . Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control costs , including custom integrated circuit chips from MOS Technology . It has been compared to the Ford Model T automobile for its role in bringing a new technology to middle-class households via creative and affordable mass-production .",

  "/wiki/Amiga": "The Amiga is a family of personal computers introduced by Commodore in 1985 . The original model was part of a series of 16/32- and 32-bit computers that featured 256 KB or more of RAM , mouse-based GUIs , and significantly improved graphics and audio over 8-bit systems . This wave included the Atari ST - released the same year - Apple 's Macintosh , and later the Apple IIGS . Based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor , the Amiga differed from its contemporaries through the inclusion of custom hardware to accelerate graphics and sound , including sprites and a blitter , and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS . The Amiga 1000 was released in July 1985 , but a series of production problems kept it from becoming widely available until early 1986 . The best selling model , the Amiga 500 , was introduced in 1987 and became one of the leading home computers of the late 1980s and early 1990s with four to six million sold . The A3000 was introduced in 1990 , followed by the A500+ , and the A600 in March 1992 . Finally , the A1200 and the A4000 were released in late 1992 . The platform became particularly popular for gaming and programming demos . It also found a prominent role in the desktop video , video production , and show control business , leading to video editing systems such as the Video Toaster . The Amiga 's native ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it a popular platform for early tracker music software . The relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory enabled the development of 3D rendering packages , including LightWave 3D , Imagine , Aladdin4D , TurboSilver and Traces , a predecessor to Blender .",

DOS primarily consists of Microsoft 's MS-DOS and a rebranded IBM version under the name PC DOS , both of which were introduced in 1981 . Later compatible systems from other manufacturers include DR DOS ( 1988 ) , ROM-DOS ( 1989 ) , PTS-DOS ( 1993 ) , and FreeDOS ( 1998 ) . MS-DOS dominated the IBM PC compatible market between 1981 and 1995 . Dozens of other operating systems also use the acronym DOS , beginning with the mainframe DOS/360 from 1966 . Others include Apple DOS , Apple ProDOS , Atari DOS , Commodore DOS , TRSDOS , and AmigaDOS .",

The initial ST model , the 520ST , saw limited release in April-June 1985 and was widely available in July . The Atari ST is the first personal computer to come with a bitmapped color GUI , using a version of Digital Research 's GEM released in February 1985 . The 1040ST , released in 1986 , is the first personal computer to ship with a megabyte of RAM in the base configuration and also the first with a cost-per-kilobyte of less than US $ 1 . The Atari ST is part of a mid-1980s generation of home computers that have 16 or 32-bit processors , 256 KB or more of RAM , and mouse-controlled graphical user interfaces . This generation includes the Macintosh , Commodore Amiga , Apple IIGS , and , the most advanced true 32bit Acorn Archimedes . ST officially stands for Sixteen/Thirty-two , which refers to the Motorola 68000 's 16-bit external bus and 32-bit internals . The ST was sold with either Atari 's color monitor or the less expensive monochrome monitor . The system 's two color graphics modes are only available on the former while the highest-resolution mode needs the monochrome monitor . In some markets , particularly Germany , the machine gained a strong foothold as a small business machine for CAD and desktop publishing work . Thanks to its built-in MIDI ports , the ST enjoyed success for running music sequencer software and as a controller of musical instruments among amateurs and well-known musicians alike . The ST was superseded by the Atari STE , Atari TT , Atari MEGA STE , and Falcon computers .",

Most arcade games are video games , pinball machines , electro-mechanical games , redemption games or merchandisers . While exact dates are debated , the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s . Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s , the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home video game consoles such as the Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost . The Eastern Hemisphere retains a strong arcade industry .",
  "/wiki/Namco": "Namco Ltd. [ a ] ( stylized as NAMCO ) [ b ] is a former Japanese developer and publisher of arcade and home console video games , originally headquartered in \u014cta , Tokyo . Several international divisions were established , including Namco America in Santa Clara , California , Shanghai Namco in mainland China , and Namco Enterprises Asia in Hong Kong . Namco was founded by Masaya Nakamura as Nakamura Seisakusho [ c ] on June 1 , 1955 , beginning as a producer of coin-operated amusement rides for Japanese department store roof gardens , seeing success with making children 's rides for the Mitsukoshi chain . Renamed Nakamura Manufacturing in 1959 , the company purchased the struggling Japanese division of Atari from Nolan Bushnell in 1974 and began releasing their games in Japan , where they quickly became one of the leading game companies in Asia . The acquisition inspired Namco to produce their own video games in-house , beginning with Gee Bee in 1978 . Namco released their first major hit Galaxian a year later , followed by Pac-Man in 1980 - the latter has since become the most successful arcade game of all time and one of the highest-grossing video games of all time . In February 2005 , Namco announced they would merge with Bandai to form Bandai Namco Holdings . The merge was finalized on September 25 , creating Japan 's third-largest video game entity by revenue and the seventh largest by revenue in the world . Both operated independently under the new holdings company until March 31 , 2006 , where their video game operations were merged to form Namco Bandai Games . The original Namco name was spun-off into a new company the same day , which handled the amusement park and arcade center operations of Bandai Namco Holdings . It was renamed to Bandai Namco Amusement during a corporate restructuring on April 1 , 2018 . Namco produced several critically and commercially successful franchises , including Pac-Man , Galaxian , Tekken , Ace Combat , Dig Dug , Soulcalibur , Xevious , Ridge Racer and Tales , and was one of the world 's most prolific video game companies .",
  "/wiki/Watara_Supervision": "The Watara Supervision , also known as the QuickShot Supervision in the UK , is a monochrome handheld game console , originating from Asia , and introduced in 1992 as a cut-price competitor for Nintendo 's Game Boy . It came packaged with a game called Crystball , which is similar to Breakout . One unique feature of the Supervision was that it could be linked up to a television via a link cable . Games played in this way would display in four colors , much like Nintendo 's Super Game Boy add-on for the SNES . A full color TV link was also in the works , but because of the Supervision 's failure to make a major impression among gamers it was cancelled , along with the games which were in development for it . Though the machine garnered some attention at launch ( mainly due to the low price for the machine and its games , which many felt might enable it to make inroads into Nintendo 's market share ) it was ultimately unsuccessful in unseating the Game Boy from its position as the world 's most popular handheld . Reasons commonly cited are the poor quality screen which was prone to blurring and made following the action difficult , a general lack of games and the simplistic nature of those that were released . Yet another problem was that most of the games that were available were developed in Taiwan or Hong Kong , meaning that fans of big-name Western and Japanese developers were underwhelmed by the apparent lack of support from these companies . Only a tiny handful of games were developed by third parties , including Sachen and the British developer B.I.T.S . Up against Nintendo 's list of popular franchises ( Zelda , Mario , Metroid ) and those of its third parties ( Castlevania , Mega Man ) - all of which eventually surfaced on the Game Boy - the Supervision 's games were of little interest to most .",

With the exception of the latter two handhelds , all of Thin Chen 's games were produced without license from the console manufacturers . The company produced at least 70 unique games for the NES and Famicom and at least 32 for the Game Boy ( compiled into eight 4-in-1 cartridges ) , making it the most prolific unlicensed developer and publisher for both consoles . The company also produced its own Nintendo Entertainment System hardware clones , such as the Q-Boy . Most of Thin Chen 's products were released under the Sachen brand name , although the names Joy Van and Commin were also used for certain early games for the Famicom and handheld consoles respectively .

All of the machines in the family are technically similar and differ primarily in packaging . They are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU running at 1.79 MHz , [ a ] and were the first home computers designed with custom co-processor chips . This architecture enabled graphics and sound capabilities more advanced than most contemporary machines , and gaming on the platform was a major draw . The first-person space combat simulator Star Raiders is considered the platform 's killer app . The systems launched with a series of plug and play peripherals that used the Atari SIO serial bus system , an early analog of USB . [ b ] To meet stringent FCC requirements , much of the circuitry of the original machines is enclosed in a cast aluminum block , which made them physically robust but expensive to produce . The 400 and 800 were replaced by the XL series in 1983 , then-after the company was sold and reestablished as Atari Corporation-the XE models in 1985 . The XL and XE are lighter in construction and less expensive to build , while also having Atari BASIC built-in and reducing the number of joystick ports from 4 to 2 .

  "/wiki/Personal_computer": "A personal computer ( PC ) is a multi-purpose computer whose size , capabilities , and price make it feasible for individual use . Personal computers are intended to be operated directly by an end user , rather than by a computer expert or technician . Unlike large costly minicomputers and mainframes , time-sharing by many people at the same time is not used with personal computers . Institutional or corporate computer owners in the 1960s had to write their own programs to do any useful work with the machines . While personal computer users may develop their own applications , usually these systems run commercial software , free-of-charge software ( freeware ) , which is most often proprietary , or free and open-source software , which is provided in ready-to-run , or binary , form . Software for personal computers is typically developed and distributed independently from the hardware or operating system manufacturers . Many personal computer users no longer need to write their own programs to make any use of a personal computer , although end-user programming is still feasible . This contrasts with mobile systems , where software is often only available through a manufacturer-supported channel , and end-user program development may be discouraged by lack of support by the manufacturer . Since the early 1990s , Microsoft operating systems and Intel hardware dominated much of the personal computer market , first with MS-DOS and then with Microsoft Windows . Alternatives to Microsoft 's Windows operating systems occupy a minority share of the industry . These include Apple 's macOS and free and open-source Unix-like operating systems .

Initially intended for use inside the Bell System , AT & T licensed Unix to outside parties in the late 1970s , leading to a variety of both academic and commercial Unix variants from vendors including University of California , Berkeley ( BSD ) , Microsoft ( Xenix ) , IBM ( AIX ) , and Sun Microsystems ( Solaris ) . In the early 1990s , AT & T sold its rights in Unix to Novell , which then sold its Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation ( SCO ) in 1995 . The UNIX trademark passed to The Open Group , a neutral industry consortium , which allows the use of the mark for certified operating systems that comply with the Single UNIX Specification ( SUS ) . Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the Unix philosophy : the operating system provides a set of simple tools that each performs a limited , well-defined function , with a unified filesystem ( the Unix filesystem ) as the main means of communication , and a shell scripting and command language ( the Unix shell ) to combine the tools to perform complex workflows .

Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution . Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries , many of which are provided by the GNU Project . Many Linux distributions use the word Linux in their name , but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software , causing some controversy .

Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland , and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether , or include a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any purpose .

  "/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License": "The GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL or GPL ) is a widely used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run , study , share , and modify the software . The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms . This is in distinction to permissive software licenses , of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples . GPL was the first copyleft license for general use . Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF .

Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",
  "/wiki/X11": "The X Window System ( X11 , or simply X ) is a windowing system for bitmap displays , common on Unix-like operating systems . X provides the basic framework for a GUI environment : drawing and moving windows on the display device and interacting with a mouse and keyboard . X does not mandate the user interface - this is handled by individual programs . As such , the visual styling of X-based environments varies greatly ; different programs may present radically different interfaces . X originated at the Project Athena at Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) in 1984 . [ better source needed ] The X protocol has been at version 11 ( hence X11 ) since September 1987 . The X.Org Foundation leads the X project , with the current reference implementation , X.Org Server , available as free and open source software under the MIT License and similar permissive licenses .",
  "/wiki/Commodore_Format": "Commodore Format was a British magazine for users of the Commodore 64 home computer . It was published on the third Thursday of every month . All 61 issues were produced by Future plc . These came towards the end of the machine 's commercial life - from October 1990 until October 1995 .",
  "/wiki/Freeware": "Freeware is software , most often proprietary , that is distributed at no monetary cost to the end user . There is no agreed-upon set of rights , license , or EULA that defines freeware unambiguously ; every publisher defines its own rules for the freeware it offers . For instance , modification , redistribution by third parties , and reverse engineering without the author 's permission are permitted by some publishers but prohibited by others . Unlike with free and open-source software , which are also often distributed free of charge , the source code for freeware is typically not made available . Freeware may be intended to benefit its producer by , for example , encouraging sales of a more capable version , as in the freemium and shareware business models ."
