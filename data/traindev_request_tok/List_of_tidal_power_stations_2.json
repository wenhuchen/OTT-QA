  "/wiki/Megawatt": "The watt ( symbol : W ) is a unit of power . In the International System of Units ( SI ) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second , and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer . In SI base units , the watt is described as k g m 2 s \u2212 3 { \\displaystyle kg\\ , m^ { 2 } s^ { -3 } } , which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis . The watt is named after James Watt , an 18th century scottish inventor .",
  "/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system": "A geographic coordinate system is a coordinate system that enables every location on Earth to be specified by a set of numbers , letters or symbols . [ note 1 ] The coordinates are often chosen such that one of the numbers represents a vertical position and two or three of the numbers represent a horizontal position ; alternatively , a geographic position may be expressed in a combined three-dimensional Cartesian vector . A common choice of coordinates is latitude , longitude and elevation . To specify a location on a plane requires a map projection .",

The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo , which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time , ruling most of the Korean Peninsula , Manchuria , parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia under Gwanggaeto the Great . Its capital , Seoul , is a major global city and half of South Korea 's over 51 million people live in the Seoul Capital Area , the fourth largest metropolitan economy in the world . The Korean Peninsula was inhabited as early as the Lower Paleolithic period . Its first kingdom was noted in Chinese records in the early 7th century BC . Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea into Silla and Balhae in the late 7th century , Korea was ruled by the Goryeo dynasty ( 918-1392 ) and the Joseon dynasty ( 1392-1897 ) . The succeeding Korean Empire was annexed into the Empire of Japan in 1910 . After World War II , Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S.-administered zones , with the latter becoming the Republic of Korea in August 1948 . In 1950 , a North Korean invasion began the Korean War and after its end in 1953 , the country 's economy began to soar , recording the fastest rise in average GDP per capita in the world between 1980 and 1990 . Authoritarian rule ended in 1987 and the country is now the most advanced democracy with the highest level of press freedom in Asia . South Korea is a member of the OECD 's Development Assistance Committee , the G20 and the Paris Club . South Korea is a highly developed country and the world 's 12th-largest economy by nominal GDP .",

  "/wiki/Incheon_Tidal_Power_Station": "The Incheon Tidal Power Station is a large tidal power station proposed for Incheon Bay , South Korea . The facility is designed to top 1,320 megawatts ( 1,770,000 hp ) in generating capacity with the help of 44 water turbines rated at 30 megawatts ( 40,000 hp ) each , which would make this facility the largest of its kind in the world . The construction and developments costs are expected to reach \u20a93.9 trillion ( US $ 3.4 billion ) , of which would be entirely covered by private funding . The station is expected to generate up to 2.41 TWh of energy annually . Planning for the project was halted in 2012 following environmental concerns since when there has been no news as to when it might proceed or be formally cancelled .",
  "/wiki/Severn_Barrage": "The Severn Barrage is any of a range of ideas for building a barrage from the English coast to the Welsh coast over the Severn tidal estuary . Ideas for damming or barraging the Severn estuary ( and Bristol Channel ) have existed since the 19th century . The building of such a barrage would constitute an engineering project comparable with some of the world 's biggest . The purposes of such a project has typically been one , or several of : transport links , flood protection , harbour creation , or tidal power generation . In recent decades it is the latter that has grown to be the primary focus for barrage ideas , and the others are now seen as useful side-effects . Following the Severn Tidal Power Feasibility Study ( 2008-10 ) , the British government concluded that there was no strategic case for building a barrage but to continue to investigate emerging technologies . In June 2013 the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee published its findings after an eight-month study of the arguments for and against the Barrage . MPs said the case for the barrage was unproven . They were not convinced the economic case was strong enough and said the developer , Hafren Power , had failed to answer serious environmental and economic concerns .",

Russia 's capital and largest city is Moscow ; other major urban areas include Saint Petersburg , Novosibirsk , Yekaterinburg , Nizhny Novgorod , Kazan and Chelyabinsk . The East Slavs emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD . Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants , the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century . In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire , beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium . Rus ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states , until it was finally reunified by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th century . By the 18th century , the nation had greatly expanded through conquest , annexation , and exploration to become the Russian Empire , which was the third largest empire in history , stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east .

In the Indian Ocean , India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives ; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia . Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",

The area is 3 square miles ( 8 km2 ) , making it the third-largest island of the Channel Islands , and the second largest in the Bailiwick . It is around 10 miles ( 15 km ) from the west of La Hague on the Cotentin Peninsula , Normandy , in France , 20 miles ( 30 km ) from the north-east of Guernsey and 60 miles ( 100 km ) from the south coast of Great Britain . It is the closest of the Channel Islands to France and to the United Kingdom . It is separated from Cap de la Hague by the dangerous Alderney Race ( French : Raz Blanchard ) . As of 2018 , the island had a population of 2,039 ; natives are traditionally nicknamed vaques after the cows , or else lapins after the many rabbits seen in the island . Formally , they are known as Ridunians , from the Latin Riduna . The only parish of Alderney is the parish of St Anne , which covers the whole island . The main town , St Anne , historically known as La Ville ( The Town ) , is often referred to as St Anne 's by visitors and incomers , but rarely by locals ( who , in normal conversation , still most frequently refer to the area centred on Victoria Street simply as Town ) . The town 's High Street , which formerly had a small handful of shops , is now almost entirely residential , forming a T-junction with Victoria Street at its highest point ."
