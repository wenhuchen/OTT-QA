  "/wiki/Powerlifting": "Powerlifting is a strength sport that consists of three attempts at maximal weight on three lifts : squat , bench press , and deadlift . As in the sport of Olympic weightlifting , it involves the athlete attempting a maximal weight single lift of a barbell loaded with weight plates . Powerlifting evolved from a sport known as odd lifts , which followed the same three-attempt format but used a wider variety of events , akin to strongman competition . Eventually odd lifts became standardized to the current three . In competition , lifts may be performed equipped or un-equipped ( typically referred to as 'raw ' lifting or 'classic ' in the IPF specifically ) . Equipment in this context refers to a supportive bench shirt or squat/deadlift suit or briefs . In some federations , knee wraps are permitted in the equipped but not un-equipped division ; in others , they may be used in both equipped and un-equipped lifting . Weight belts , knee sleeves , wrist wraps and special footwear may also be used , but are not considered when distinguishing equipped from un-equipped lifting . Competitions take place across the world . Powerlifting has been a Paralympic sport ( bench press only ) since 1984 and , under the IPF , is also a World Games sport . Local , national and international competitions have also been sanctioned by other federations operating independently of the IPF .",
