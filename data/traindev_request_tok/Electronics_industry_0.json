  "/wiki/E-commerce": "E-commerce ( electronic commerce ) is the activity of electronically buying or selling of products on online services or over the Internet . Electronic commerce draws on technologies such as mobile commerce , electronic funds transfer , supply chain management , Internet marketing , online transaction processing , electronic data interchange ( EDI ) , inventory management systems , and automated data collection systems . E-commerce is in turn driven by the technological advances of the semiconductor industry , and is the largest sector of the electronics industry . Modern electronic commerce typically uses the World Wide Web for at least one part of the transaction 's life cycle although it may also use other technologies such as e-mail . Typical e-commerce transactions include the purchase of online books ( such as Amazon ) and music purchases ( music download in the form of digital distribution such as iTunes Store ) , and to a less extent , customized/personalized online liquor store inventory services . There are three areas of e-commerce : online retailing , electronic markets , and online auctions . E-commerce is supported by electronic business . E-commerce businesses may also employ some or all of the followings :",
  "/wiki/Business-to-business": "Business-to-business ( B2B or , in some countries , BtoB ) is a situation where one business makes a commercial transaction with another . This typically occurs when : B2B is often contrasted with business-to-consumer ( B2C ) . In B2B commerce , it is often the case that the parties to the relationship have comparable negotiating power , and even when they do not , each party typically involves professional staff and legal counsel in the negotiation of terms , whereas B2C is shaped to a far greater degree by economic implications of information asymmetry . However , within a B2B context , large companies may have many commercial , resource and information advantages over smaller businesses . The United Kingdom government , for example , created the post of Small Business Commissioner under the Enterprise Act 2016 to enable small businesses to resolve disputes and consider complaints by small business suppliers about payment issues with larger businesses that they supply . Business-to-Business companies represent a significant part of the United States economy . This is especially true in firms of 500 employees and above , of which there were 19,464 in 2015 , where it is estimated that as many as 72% are businesses that primarily serve other businesses .",
  "/wiki/High_tech": "High technology , or high tech ( sometimes also called frontier technology or frontier tech ) , is technology that is at the cutting edge : the most advanced technology available . The opposite of high tech is low technology , referring to simple , often traditional or mechanical technology ; for example , a slide rule is a low-tech calculating device . The phrase was used in a 1958 The New York Times story advocating atomic energy for Europe : . Western Europe , with its dense population and its high technology . Robert Metz used the term in a financial column in 1969 : Arthur H. Collins of Collins Radio ] controls a score of high technology patents in a variety of fields . and in a 1971 article used the abbreviated form , high tech . A widely used classification of high-technological manufacturing industries is provided by the OECD . It is based on the intensity of research and development activities used in these industries within OECD countries , resulting in four distinct categories . Startups working on high technologies ( or developing new high technologies ) are sometimes referred to as deep tech .",

  "/wiki/Power_electronics": "Power electronics is the application of solid-state electronics to the control and conversion of electric power . The first high power electronic devices were mercury-arc valves . In modern systems , the conversion is performed with semiconductor switching devices such as diodes , thyristors , and power transistors such as the power MOSFET and IGBT . In contrast to electronic systems concerned with transmission and processing of signals and data , in power electronics substantial amounts of electrical energy are processed . An AC/DC converter ( rectifier ) is the most typical power electronics device found in many consumer electronic devices , e.g . television sets , personal computers , battery chargers , etc . The power range is typically from tens of watts to several hundred watts . In industry a common application is the variable speed drive ( VSD ) that is used to control an induction motor . The power range of VSDs start from a few hundred watts and end at tens of megawatts . The power conversion systems can be classified according to the type of the input and output power",
  "/wiki/Thin-film_transistor": "A thin-film transistor ( TFT ) is a special type of metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor ( MOSFET ) made by depositing thin films of an active semiconductor layer as well as the dielectric layer and metallic contacts over a supporting ( but non-conducting ) substrate . A common substrate is glass , because the primary application of TFTs is in liquid-crystal displays ( LCDs ) . This differs from the conventional bulk MOSFET transistor , where the semiconductor material typically is the substrate , such as a silicon wafer .",
  "/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display": "A liquid-crystal display ( LCD ) is a flat-panel display or other electronically modulated optical device that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals combined with polarizers . Liquid crystals do not emit light directly , instead using a backlight or reflector to produce images in color or monochrome . LCDs are available to display arbitrary images ( as in a general-purpose computer display ) or fixed images with low information content , which can be displayed or hidden , such as preset words , digits , and seven-segment displays , as in a digital clock . They use the same basic technology , except that arbitrary images are made from a matrix of small pixels , while other displays have larger elements . LCDs can either be normally on ( positive ) or off ( negative ) , depending on the polarizer arrangement . For example , a character positive LCD with a backlight will have black lettering on a background that is the color of the backlight , and a character negative LCD will have a black background with the letters being of the same color as the backlight . Optical filters are added to white on blue LCDs to give them their characteristic appearance . LCDs are used in a wide range of applications , including LCD televisions , computer monitors , instrument panels , aircraft cockpit displays , and indoor and outdoor signage . Small LCD screens are common in portable consumer devices such as digital cameras , watches , calculators , and mobile telephones , including smartphones . LCD screens are also used on consumer electronics products such as DVD players , video game devices and clocks . LCD screens have replaced heavy , bulky cathode ray tube ( CRT ) displays in nearly all applications . LCD screens are available in a wider range of screen sizes than CRT and plasma displays , with LCD screens available in sizes ranging from tiny digital watches to very large television receivers .",

  "/wiki/Video_game": "A video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a two- or three-dimensional video display device such as a touchscreen , virtual reality headset or monitor/TV set . Since the 1980s , video games have become an increasingly important part of the entertainment industry , and whether they are also a form of art is a matter of dispute . The electronic systems used to play video games are called platforms . Video games are developed and released for one or several platforms and may not be available on others . Specialized platforms such as arcade games , which present the game in a large , typically coin-operated chassis , were common in the 1980s in video arcades , but declined in popularity as other , more affordable platforms became available . These include dedicated devices such as video game consoles , as well as general-purpose computers like a laptop , desktop or handheld computing devices . The input device used for games , the game controller , varies across platforms . Common controllers include gamepads , joysticks , mouse devices , keyboards , the touchscreens of mobile devices , or even a person 's body , using a Kinect sensor . Players view the game on a display device such as a television or computer monitor or sometimes on virtual reality head-mounted display goggles . There are often game sound effects , music and voice actor lines which come from loudspeakers or headphones . Some games in the 2000s include haptic , vibration-creating effects , force feedback peripherals and virtual reality headsets . Since the 2010s , the commercial importance of the video game industry has been increasing .",

  "/wiki/Streaming_media": "Streaming media is multimedia that is constantly received by and presented to an end-user while being delivered by a provider . The verb to stream refers to the process of delivering or obtaining media in this manner ; the term refers to the delivery method of the medium , rather than the medium itself , and is an alternative to file downloading , a process in which the end-user obtains the entire file for the content before watching or listening to it . A client end-user can use their media player to start playing digital video or digital audio content before the entire file has been transmitted . Distinguishing delivery method from the media distributed applies specifically to telecommunications networks , as most of the delivery systems are either inherently streaming ( e.g . radio , television , streaming apps ) or inherently non-streaming ( e.g . books , video cassettes , audio CDs ) . For example , in the 1930s , elevator music was among the earliest popular music available as streaming media ; nowadays Internet television is a common form of streamed media . The term streaming media can apply to media other than video and audio , such as live closed captioning , ticker tape , and real-time text , which are all considered streaming text . Live streaming is the delivery of Internet content in real-time much as live television broadcasts content over the airwaves via a television signal . Live internet streaming requires a form of source media ( e.g . a video camera , an audio interface , screen capture software ) , an encoder to digitize the content , a media publisher , and a content delivery network to distribute and deliver the content . Live streaming does not need to be recorded at the origination point , although it frequently is .",
