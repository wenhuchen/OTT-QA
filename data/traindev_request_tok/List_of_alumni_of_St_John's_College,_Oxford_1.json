  "/wiki/Philosophy,_Politics_and_Economics": "Philosophy , politics and economics or politics , philosophy , and economics ( PPE ) is an interdisciplinary undergraduate or postgraduate degree which combines study from three disciplines . The first institution to offer degrees in PPE was the University of Oxford in the 1920s . This particular course has produced a significant number of notable graduates such as Aung San Suu Kyi , Burmese politician and State Counsellor of Myanmar , Nobel Peace Prize winner ; Princess Haya bint Hussein daughter of the late King Hussein of Jordan and wife of the ruler of Dubai ; Christopher Hitchens , the British-American polemicist , Oscar winning writer and director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck ; Philippa Foot a British philosopher ; Harold Wilson , Edward Heath and David Cameron , former Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom ; Hugh Gaitskell , William Hague and Ed Miliband , former Leaders of the Opposition ; former Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto and current Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan ; and Malcolm Fraser , Bob Hawke and Tony Abbott , former Prime Ministers of Australia . The course received fresh attention in 2017 , when Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai earned a place . In the 1980s , the University of York went on to establish its own PPE degree based upon the Oxford model ; King 's College London , the University of Warwick , the University of Manchester , and other British universities later followed . According to the BBC , the Oxford PPE dominate [ s ] public life ( in the UK ) . It is now offered at several other leading colleges and universities around the world . More recently Warwick University and Kings College added a new degree under the name of PPL ( Politics , Philosophy and Law ) with the aim to bring an alternative to the more classical PPE degrees . In the United States , it is offered by two Ivy League universities -- the University of Pennsylvania and Yale University ( under the designation Ethics , Politics and Economics ) . In the non-English speaking world the French grande \u00e9cole Sciences Po ( Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris originally , now existing in 8 other big French cities : Aix , Bordeaux , Grenoble , Lille , Lyon , Rennes , Strasbourg and Toulouse ) offers since the late 19th century an approaching cursus with a wide variety of electives . Sciences Po has been emulated in a number of countries . A good number of French political and entrepreunarial elite and civil servants are Sciences Po graduates , though the vast majority of political ministers and elected officials at the national level prefers or adds the even more selective grande \u00e9cole ENA ( \u00c9cole Nationale d'Administration ) .",

  "/wiki/Jurisprudence": "Jurisprudence or legal theory is the theoretical study of law . Scholars of jurisprudence seek to explain the nature of law in its most general form and provide a deeper understanding of legal reasoning , legal systems , legal institutions , and the role of law in society . Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was focused on the first principles of natural law , civil law , and the law of nations . General jurisprudence can be divided into categories both by the type of question scholars seek to answer and by the theories of jurisprudence , or schools of thought , regarding how those questions are best answered . Contemporary philosophy of law , which deals with general jurisprudence , addresses problems internal to law and legal systems and problems of law as a social institution that relates to the larger political and social context in which it exists . This article addresses three distinct branches of thought in general jurisprudence . Ancient natural law is the idea that there are rational objective limits to the power of legislative rulers . The foundations of law are accessible through reason , and it is from these laws of nature that human laws gain whatever force they have . Analytic jurisprudence ( Clarificatory jurisprudence ) rejects natural law 's fusing of what law is and what it ought to be . It espouses the use of a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to aspects of legal systems . It encompasses such theories of jurisprudence as legal positivism , which holds that there is no necessary connection between law and morality and that the force of law comes from basic social facts ; and legal realism , which argues that the real-world practice of law determines what law is , the law having the force that it does because of what legislators , lawyers , and judges do with it . Normative jurisprudence is concerned with evaluative theories of law .",

  "/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Canada": "The Prime Minister of Canada is an official who serves as the primary minister of the Crown , chair of the Cabinet , and thus head of government of Canada . Officially , the prime minister is appointed by the Governor General of Canada , but by constitutional convention , the prime minister must have the confidence of the elected House of Commons . Normally , this is the leader of the party caucus with the greatest number of seats in the house . But if that leader lacks the support of the majority , the governor general can appoint another leader who has that support or may dissolve parliament and call a new election . By constitutional convention , a prime minister holds a seat in parliament and , since the early 20th century , this has more specifically meant the House of Commons . The office is not outlined in any of the documents that constitute the written portion of the Constitution of Canada ; executive authority is formally vested in the sovereign and exercised on his or her behalf by the governor general . The prime ministership is part of Canada 's constitutional convention tradition . The office was modelled after that which existed in Britain at the time . Sir John A. Macdonald was commissioned by the Viscount Monck on 24 May 1867 , to form the first government of the Canadian Confederation . On 1 July 1867 , the first ministry assumed office . The date for which a prime minister begins his or her term has been determined by the date that he or she is sworn into his or her portfolio , as an oath of office as prime minister is not required .
