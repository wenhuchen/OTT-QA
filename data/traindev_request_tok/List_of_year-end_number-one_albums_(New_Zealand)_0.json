  "/wiki/The_Joshua_Tree": "The Joshua Tree is the fifth studio album by Irish rock band U2 . It was produced by Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno , and was released on 9 March 1987 on Island Records . In contrast to the ambient experimentation of their 1984 release , The Unforgettable Fire , the band aimed for a harder-hitting sound within the limitation of conventional song structures on The Joshua Tree . The album is influenced by American and Irish roots music , and through sociopolitically conscious lyrics embellished with spiritual imagery , it contrasts the group 's antipathy for the real America with their fascination with the mythical America . Inspired by American experiences , literature , and politics , U2 chose America as a theme for the record . Recording began in January 1986 in Ireland , and to foster a relaxed , creative atmosphere , the group primarily recorded in two houses . Several events during the sessions helped shape the conscious tone of the album , including the band 's participation in the Conspiracy of Hope benefit concerts for Amnesty International , the death of roadie Greg Carroll , and lead vocalist Bono 's travels to Central America . Recording was completed in November 1986 ; additional production continued into January 1987 . Throughout the sessions , U2 sought a cinematic quality for the record , one that would evoke a sense of location , in particular , the open spaces of the United States . They represented this in the sleeve photography depicting them in American desert landscapes . The Joshua Tree received critical acclaim , topped the charts in over 20 countries , and became the fastest-selling album in British history . According to Rolling Stone , the album increased the band 's stature from heroes to superstars .",
