The palace , which served as the imperial residence and the administrative centre of for most of the Nara period from 710 to 794 AD , was located at the north-central location of the city in accordance with the Chinese models used for the design of the capital . The palace consisted of a large rectangular walled enclosure ( the daidairi ) , which contained several ceremonial and administrative buildings including the government ministries . Inside this enclosure was the separately walled residential compound of the emperor or the Inner Palace . In addition to the emperor 's living quarters , the Inner Palace contained the residences of the imperial consorts , as well as certain official and ceremonial buildings more closely linked to the person of the emperor . The original role of the palace was to manifest the centralised government model adopted by Japan from China in the 7th century - the Daij\u014d-kan and its subsidiary Eight Ministries . The palace was designed to provide an appropriate setting for the emperor 's residence , the conduct of great affairs of state , and the accompanying ceremonies . After the capital was moved to Heian , the palace structures were either moved there or suffered several fires and other disasters and disappeared . The site was built over for agriculture that almost no trace of it remained , however the location was still known . Excavations started in the 1970s and large-scale reconstruction based on contemporary literary sources and excavations starting in the 2000s . The excavated remains of the palace , and the surrounding area , was established as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998 along with a number of other buildings and area , as the Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara .",
