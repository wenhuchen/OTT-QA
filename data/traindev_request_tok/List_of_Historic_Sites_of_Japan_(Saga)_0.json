  "/wiki/Yoshinogari_site": "Yoshinogari ( \u5409\u91ce\u30f6\u91cc \u907a\u8de1 Yoshinogari iseki ) is the name of a large and complex Yayoi archaeological site in Yoshinogari and Kanzaki in Saga Prefecture , Ky\u016bsh\u016b , Japan . According to the Yayoi chronology established by pottery seriations in the 20th century , Yoshinogari dates to between the 3rd century BC and the 3rd century AD . However , recent attempts to use absolute dating methods such as AMS radiocarbon dating have shown that the earliest Yayoi component of Yoshinogari dates to before 400 BC . This archaeological site is of great importance in Japanese and world prehistory because of the massive size and important nature of the settlement and the artifacts found there . Yoshinogari consists of a settlement , a cemetery , and multiple ditch-and-palisade enclosed precincts . Bronze mirrors from China , Japanese-style bronze mirrors , bronze daggers , coins , bells , and halberds , iron tools , wooden tools , prehistoric human hair , and many other precious artifacts have been unearthed from Yoshinogari features . The total area of this site is approximately 40 hectares . This site has been continuously excavated by a number of different agencies and institutions since 1986 . Due to the superior features , artifacts , and significance in Japanese prehistory and protohistory , the site was designated as a Special National Historic Site in 1991 , and a National Park was created there in 1992 . Ancient structures are being reconstructed on the site and the park is a major tourist attraction . Yoshinogari is located 12 km from the Ariake Sea on a low hill that extends out of the Sefuri Mountains and is surrounded on three sides by land that is suitable for wet-rice ( paddy ) cultivation .",

  "/wiki/Yayoi_period": "The Yayoi period ( \u5f25\u751f\u6642\u4ee3 , Yayoi jidai ) , dated 300 BC - 300 AD , started at the beginning of the Neolithic in Japan , continued through the Bronze Age , and towards its end crossed into the Iron Age . Since the 1980s , scholars have argued that a period previously classified as a transition from the J\u014dmon period should be reclassified as Early Yayoi . The date of the beginning of this transition is controversial , with estimates ranging from the 10th to the 6th centuries BC . The period is named after the neighborhood of Tokyo where archaeologists first uncovered artifacts and features from that era . Distinguishing characteristics of the Yayoi period include the appearance of new Yayoi pottery styles and the start of an intensive rice agriculture in paddy fields . A hierarchical social class structure dates from this period and has its origin in China . Techniques in metallurgy based on the use of bronze and iron were also introduced from China over Korea to Japan in this period . The Yayoi followed the J\u014dmon period ( 14,000-1,000 BC ) and Yayoi culture flourished in a geographic area from southern Ky\u016bsh\u016b to northern Honsh\u016b . Archaeological evidence supports the idea that during this time , an influx of farmers ( Yayoi people ) from the Asian continent to Japan overwhelmed and displaced the native hunter-gatherer population . Modern Japanese are descendants of the Yayoi people with only very small influence from the former J\u014dmon hunter-gatherers .",

  "/wiki/Japanese_invasions_of_Korea_(1592\u20131598)": "The Japanese invasions of Korea comprised two separate yet linked operations : an initial invasion in 1592 , a brief truce in 1596 , and a second invasion in 1597 . The conflict ended in 1598 with the withdrawal of the Japanese forces from the Korean Peninsula after a military stalemate in Korea 's southern coastal provinces . The invasions were launched by Toyotomi Hideyoshi with the intent of conquering the Korean Peninsula and China , which were respectively ruled by the Joseon and Ming dynasty . Japan quickly succeeded in occupying large portions of the Korean Peninsula , but the contribution of reinforcements by the Ming , as well as the disruption of Japanese supply fleets along the western and southern coasts by the Joseon Navy forced a withdrawal of Japanese forces from Pyongyang and the northern provinces to the south , in Busan and nearby southern regions . Afterwards , with guerrilla warfare waged against the Japanese by righteous armies ( Joseon civilian militias ) and supply difficulties hampering both sides , neither the Japanese nor the combined Ming and Joseon forces were able to mount a successful offensive or gain any additional territory , resulting in a military stalemate . The first phase of the invasion lasted from 1592 until 1596 , and was followed by ultimately unsuccessful peace negotiations between Japan and the Ming between 1596 and 1597 . In 1597 , Japan renewed its offensive by invading Korea a second time . The pattern of the second invasion largely mirrored that of the first . The Japanese had initial successes on land , capturing several cities and fortresses , only to be halted and forced to withdraw to the southern coastal regions of the peninsula . The pursuing Ming and Joseon forces , however , were unable to dislodge the Japanese from their remaining fortresses and entrenched positions in the southern coastal areas , where both sides again became locked in a ten-month long military stalemate . With Hideyoshi 's death in 1598 , limited progress on land , and continued disruption of supply lines by the Joseon navy , the Japanese forces in Korea were ordered to withdraw back to Japan by the new governing Council of Five Elders . Final peace negotiations between the parties followed afterwards and continued for several years , ultimately resulting in the normalization of relations .",

Baekje alternately battled and allied with Goguryeo and Silla as the three kingdoms expanded control over the peninsula . At its peak in the 4th century , Baekje controlled most of the western Korean peninsula , as far north as Pyongyang , and may have even held territories in China , such as in Liaoxi , though this view is controversial . It became a significant regional sea power , with political and trade relations with China and Japan . Baekje was a great maritime power ; its nautical skill , which made it the Phoenicia of East Asia , was instrumental in the dissemination of Buddhism throughout East Asia and continental culture to Japan .

It was preceded by the Sui dynasty and followed by the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period in Chinese history . Historians generally regard the Tang as a high point in Chinese civilization , and a golden age of cosmopolitan culture . Tang territory , acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers , rivaled that of the Han dynasty . The Tang capital at Chang'an ( present-day Xi'an ) was the most populous city in the world in its day . The L\u01d0 family ( \u674e ) founded the dynasty , seizing power during the decline and collapse of the Sui Empire . The dynasty was interrupted for 15 years when Empress Wu Zetian seized the throne , proclaiming the Wu Zhou dynasty and becoming the only legitimate Chinese empress regnant . In two censuses of the 7th and 8th centuries , the Tang records estimated the population by number of registered households at about 50 million people . Yet , even when the central government was breaking down and unable to compile an accurate census of the population in the 9th century , it is estimated that the population had grown by then to about 80 million people . [ b ] With its large population base , the dynasty was able to raise professional and conscripted armies of hundreds of thousands of troops to contend with nomadic powers in dominating Inner Asia and the lucrative trade-routes along the Silk Road . Various kingdoms and states paid tribute to the Tang court , while the Tang also conquered or subdued several regions which it indirectly controlled through a protectorate system .

The style shares much in common with the Chinese Famille Verte style . The quality of its decoration was highly prized in the West and widely imitated by major European porcelain manufacturers during the Rococo period . Kakiemon is a term that generates some confusion , being the name of a family , one or more kilns , and a brightly-coloured overglaze style broadly imitating Chinese wares . The style originated with the family , whose kilns were the main producers of it , but other kilns also made it , and the Kakiemon kilns made other styles . Both the palette and style , and very probably the kiln , were in place by the 1680s . The style is a sub-type of what is called in the West Imari ware , the overglaze coloured variety of the broader grouping Arita ware , dominant in Japanese export porcelain in its first successful period , up to the 1740s . The style was quickly copied by the new European porcelain factories that appeared in the 18th century , such as Meissen in Germany , Chantilly in France and Chelsea in England .

  "/wiki/Anagama_kiln": "The anagama kiln ( Japanese : \u7a96\u7aaf ) is an ancient type of pottery kiln brought to Japan from China via Korea in the 5th century . It is a version of the climbing dragon kiln of south China , whose further development was also copied , for example in breaking up the firing space into a series of chambers in the noborigama kiln . An anagama ( a Japanese term meaning cave kiln ) consists of a firing chamber with a firebox at one end and a flue at the other . Although the term firebox is used to describe the space for the fire , there is no physical structure separating the stoking space from the pottery space . The term anagama describes single-chamber kilns built in a sloping tunnel shape . In fact , ancient kilns were sometimes built by digging tunnels into banks of clay . The anagama is fueled with firewood , in contrast to the electric or gas-fueled kilns commonly used by most contemporary potters . A continuous supply of fuel is needed for firing , as wood thrown into the hot kiln is consumed very rapidly . Stoking occurs round the clock until a variety of variables are achieved including the way the fired pots look inside the kiln , the temperatures reached and sustained , the amount of ash applied , the wetness of the walls and the pots , etc . Burning wood not only produces heat of up to 1400\u00b0C ( 2,500 \u00b0F ) , it also produces fly ash and volatile salts . Wood ash settles on the pieces during the firing , and the complex interaction between flame , ash , and the minerals of the clay body forms a natural ash glaze . This glaze may show great variation in color , texture , and thickness , ranging from smooth and glossy to rough and sharp .",
  "/wiki/Saggar": "A saggar is a type of kiln furniture . It is a ceramic boxlike container used in the firing of pottery to enclose or protect ware being fired inside a kiln . Traditionally , saggars were made primarily from fireclay . Saggars have been used to protect , or safeguard , ware from open flame , smoke , gases and kiln debris : the name may be a contraction of the word safeguard . Their use is widespread , including in China , Korea , Japan and the United Kingdom . Saggars are still used in the production of ceramics to shield ware from the direct contact of flames and from damage by kiln debris . Modern saggars are made of alumina ceramic , cordierite ceramic , mullite ceramic silicon carbide and in special cases from zirconia .",
  "/wiki/Paddy_field": "A paddy field is a flooded parcel of arable land used for growing semiaquatic crops , most notably rice and taro . It originates from the Neolithic rice-farming cultures of the Yangtze River basin in southern China , associated with pre-Austronesian and Hmong-Mien cultures . It was spread in prehistoric times by the Austronesian expansion to Island Southeast Asia , Madagascar , Melanesia , Micronesia , and Polynesia . The technology was also acquired by other cultures in mainland Asia for rice farming , spreading to East Asia , Mainland Southeast Asia , and South Asia . Fields can be built into steep hillsides as terraces and adjacent to depressed or steeply sloped features such as rivers or marshes . They can require a great deal of labor and materials to create , and need large quantities of water for irrigation . Oxen and water buffalo , adapted for life in wetlands , are important working animals used extensively in paddy field farming . Paddy-field farming remains the dominant form of growing rice in modern times . It is practiced extensively in Bangladesh , Cambodia , China , India , Indonesia , Iran , Japan , Laos , Malaysia , Myanmar , Nepal , North Korea , Pakistan , the Philippines , South Korea , Sri Lanka , Thailand , Taiwan , and Vietnam . It has also been introduced elsewhere since the colonial era , notably in Northern Italy , the Camargue in France , and in Spain , particularly in the Albufera de Val\u00e8ncia wetlands in the Valencian Community , the Ebro Delta in Catalonia and the Guadalquivir wetlands in Andalusia , as well as along the eastern coast of Brazil , the Artibonite Valley in Haiti , and Sacramento Valley in California , among other places . Paddy fields are a major source of atmospheric methane and have been estimated to contribute in the range of 50 to 100 million tonnes of the gas per annum . Studies have shown that this can be significantly reduced while also boosting crop yield by draining the paddies to allow the soil to aerate to interrupt methane production .",

During the pre-1945 period , Japan moved into political totalitarianism , ultranationalism and fascism culminating in Japan 's invasion of China in 1937 . This was part of a global period of social upheavals and conflicts such as the Great Depression and World War II . Defeat in the Second World War brought about radical change in Japan . For the first and only time in its history , Japan was occupied by foreign powers ; this occupation lasted seven years . Allied occupation brought forth sweeping democratic reforms . It led to the formal end of the emperor 's status as a demigod and the transformation of Japan from a form of mixed constitutional and absolute monarchy to a Constitutional monarchy with a liberal democracy .

It was produced in Lord Nabeshima of Saga Domain 's kiln at Okawachi near Arita in the Edo period , for the use and profit of the family . The name therefore derives from the family . The Okawachi kiln was already in use , and continued to make other wares at the same time . Production began around 1700 , and continued until the late 19th century , with similar wares being produced elsewhere by descendants of the master lineage to the present day Unlike most Arita ware , the designs drew on Japanese rather than Chinese traditions , especially those of textile design , and are often marked by a free use of empty space . Much of the wares were dishes for food made in sets of five , with a high foot . These followed in shape the dishes in lacquered wood , which until then were the preferred dining dishes used by the aristocracy . The Nabeshima used them themselves and gave them to other feudal lords as prestige gifts . Very few were exported until the Meiji period . A variety of designs are used , ranging from the abstract to the representational . Animal and plant designs are popular , and designs showing three patterned jars are a particular feature . The technique also differs from that of most Japanese porcelain , with the outlines of the pattern done in underglaze blue before the overglaze enamelled final decoration .",
  "/wiki/Overglaze": "Overglaze decoration , overglaze enamelling or on-glaze decoration is a method of decorating pottery , most often porcelain , where the coloured decoration is applied on top of the already fired and glazed surface , and then fixed in a second firing at a relatively low temperature , often in a muffle kiln . It is often described as producing enamelled decoration . The colours fuse on to the glaze , so the decoration becomes durable . This decorative firing is usually done at a lower temperature which allows for a more varied and vidid palette of colours , using pigments which will not colour correctly at the high temperature necessary to fire the porcelain body . Historically , a relatively narrow range of colours could be achieved with underglaze decoration , where the coloured pattern is applied before glazing , notably the cobalt blue of blue and white porcelain . Many historical styles , for example Imari ware , Chinese doucai and wucai , combine the two types of decoration . In such cases the first firing for the body , underglaze decoration and glaze is followed by the second firing after the overglaze enamels have been applied . The technique was first seen in Chinese ceramics in Cizhou stoneware from as early as the 12th century , with use on porcelain following within a century , though it did not become predominant until later , and the full possibilities were not realized until the 17th century . Some techniques use thin metal leaf as well as the more usual pigments , which are typically applied in a liquid or paste form , painted by brush , or using stencils or transfer printing . Today overglaze decoration is much less commonly used , other than in traditionalist wares , as the range of colours available in underglaze has greatly expanded .",

Thus dispensing the need for a separate wedge to hold the blade in place , as is the case in most other traditional wooden planes . The chip breaker is held in place with a simple nail inserted some distance away from and perpendicular to the axis of the main blade . The chip breaker is not tapered like the main blade , instead it has bent ears that bear down on the plane blade . Chip breakers in Japan were introduced relatively recently during the Meiji period . The soles of Japanese planes also have different configurations intended for varying applications . The apparently simple design disguises a great deal of complexity ."
