  "/wiki/\"Weird_Al\"_Yankovic": "Alfred Matthew Weird Al Yankovic ( /\u02c8j\u00e6\u014bk\u0259v\u026ak/ YANG-k\u0259-vik ; born October 23 , 1959 ) is an American musical comedian whose humorous songs make light of popular culture and often parody specific songs by contemporary musical acts ; original songs that are style pastiches of the work of other acts ; and polka medleys of several popular songs , featuring his favored instrument , the accordion . Since his first-aired comedy song in 1976 , he has sold more than 12 million albums ( as of 2007 [ update ] ) , recorded more than 150 parody and original songs , and performed more than 1,000 live shows . His works have earned him five Grammy Awards and a further eleven nominations , four gold records , and six platinum records in the United States . Yankovic 's first top ten Billboard album ( Straight Outta Lynwood ) and single ( White & Nerdy ) were both released in 2006 , nearly three decades into his career . His latest album , Mandatory Fun ( 2014 ) , became his first number-one album during its debut week . Yankovic 's success comes in part from his effective use of music video to further parody popular culture , the song 's original artist , and the original music videos themselves , scene-for-scene in some cases . He directed later videos himself and went on to direct for other artists , including Ben Folds , Hanson , The Black Crowes , and The Presidents of the United States of America . With the decline of music television and the onset of social media , Yankovic used YouTube and other video sites to publish his videos ; this strategy proved integral , helping to boost sales of his later albums , including Mandatory Fun . Yankovic has stated that he may forgo traditional albums in favor of timely releases of singles and EPs following on this success . In addition to recording his albums , Yankovic wrote and starred in the film UHF ( 1989 ) and the television series The Weird Al Show ( 1997 ) . He has also made guest appearances and performed voice acting roles on many television shows and video web content , in addition to starring in Al TV specials on MTV . He has also written two children 's books , When I Grow Up and My New Teacher and Me !",
  "/wiki/Straight_Outta_Lynwood": "Straight Outta Lynwood is the twelfth studio album by Weird Al Yankovic , released on September 26 , 2006 . It was the sixth studio album self-produced by Yankovic . The musical styles on the album are built around parodies and pastiches of pop and rock music of the mid-2000s . The album 's lead single , White & Nerdy , is a parody of Chamillionaire 's hit single Ridin ' . The single peaked at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 ; Canadian Idiot , a parody of Green Day 's American Idiot , also charted , peaking at number 82 . The album contains three further parodies , based on Confessions Part II by Usher , Do I Make You Proud by Taylor Hicks , and Trapped in the Closet by R. Kelly . The other half of the album is original material , containing many style parodies - musical imitations of existing artists , such as Brian Wilson , Rage Against the Machine , Sparks , animated musical specials , Cake , and 1980s charity songs . Originally , there were plans for the album 's lead single to have been a spoof of James Blunt 's hit You 're Beautiful entitled You 're Pitiful , but Blunt 's record label , Atlantic , blocked the commercial release of the parody . In 2006 , the album was released as both a digital download and as a DualDisc ( a double-sided optical disc that contained a CD on one side and a DVD on the other ) containing both the album and animated music videos for a number of the album 's songs . Straight Outta Lynwood was met with mostly positive reviews , with many critics in particular applauding White & Nerdy and Trapped in the Drive-Thru . Some of the other parody songs , however , were met with a more mixed response . The album peaked at number 10 on the Billboard 200 .",

  "/wiki/The_Beatles": "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960 . With a line-up comprising John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison and Ringo Starr , they are regarded as the most influential band of all time . The group were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music 's recognition as an art form . Rooted in skiffle , beat and 1950s rock and roll , their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways ; the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock . As pioneers in recording , songwriting and artistic presentation , the group revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era 's youth and sociocultural movements . Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney , the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960 , initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass . The core trio of Lennon , McCartney and Harrison , together since 1958 , went through a succession of drummers , including Pete Best , before asking Starr to join them in 1962 . Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings , greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit , Love Me Do , in late 1962 . As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed Beatlemania , the band acquired the nickname the Fab Four , with Epstein , Martin and other members of the band 's entourage sometimes given the informal title of fifth Beatle . By early 1964 , the Beatles were international stars , leading the British Invasion of the United States pop market and breaking numerous sales records .

Among the conductors who worked with the orchestra in its early years were Richard Strauss , Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler and Arturo Toscanini ; of the Philharmonia 's younger conductors , the most important to its development was Herbert von Karajan , who though never formally chief conductor was closely associated with the orchestra in the late 1940s and early 1950s . The Philharmonia became widely regarded as the finest of London 's five symphony orchestras in its first two decades . From the late 1950s to the early 1970s the orchestra 's chief conductor was Otto Klemperer , with whom the orchestra gave many concerts and made numerous recordings of the core orchestral repertoire . During Klemperer 's tenure Legge , citing the difficulty of maintaining the orchestra 's high standards , attempted to disband it in 1964 , but the players , backed by Klemperer , formed themselves into a self-governing ensemble as the New Philharmonia Orchestra . After thirteen years under this title , they negotiated the rights to revert to the original name . In Klemperer 's last years the orchestra suffered a decline , both financial and artistic , but recovered under his successor , Riccardo Muti , who revitalised the orchestra in his ten-year term , 1972-1982 . The orchestra 's standards remained high throughout the controversial chief conductorship of Giuseppe Sinopoli from 1984 to 1994 , and the more orthodox tenure of Christoph von Dohn\u00e1nyi between 1997 and 2008 . Esa-Pekka Salonen , principal conductor since 2008 , is due to serve until 2021 , when Santtu-Matias Rouvali is scheduled to succeed him . The Philharmonia has had many celebrated players in its ranks and has commissioned more than 100 compositions . It gives more than 160 concerts a year , tours widely , and from its inception has been known for its many recordings .",

  "/wiki/The_Philharmonia_Orchestra": "The Philharmonia Orchestra is a British orchestra based in London . It was founded in 1945 by Walter Legge , a classical music record producer for EMI . Among the conductors who worked with the orchestra in its early years were Richard Strauss , Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler and Arturo Toscanini ; of the Philharmonia 's younger conductors , the most important to its development was Herbert von Karajan , who though never formally chief conductor was closely associated with the orchestra in the late 1940s and early 1950s . The Philharmonia became widely regarded as the finest of London 's five symphony orchestras in its first two decades . From the late 1950s to the early 1970s the orchestra 's chief conductor was Otto Klemperer , with whom the orchestra gave many concerts and made numerous recordings of the core orchestral repertoire . During Klemperer 's tenure Legge , citing the difficulty of maintaining the orchestra 's high standards , attempted to disband it in 1964 , but the players , backed by Klemperer , formed themselves into a self-governing ensemble as the New Philharmonia Orchestra . After thirteen years under this title , they negotiated the rights to revert to the original name . In Klemperer 's last years the orchestra suffered a decline , both financial and artistic , but recovered under his successor , Riccardo Muti , who revitalised the orchestra in his ten-year term , 1972-1982 . The orchestra 's standards remained high throughout the controversial chief conductorship of Giuseppe Sinopoli from 1984 to 1994 , and the more orthodox tenure of Christoph von Dohn\u00e1nyi between 1997 and 2008 . Esa-Pekka Salonen , principal conductor since 2008 , is due to serve until 2021 , when Santtu-Matias Rouvali is scheduled to succeed him . The Philharmonia has had many celebrated players in its ranks and has commissioned more than 100 compositions . It gives more than 160 concerts a year , tours widely , and from its inception has been known for its many recordings .",
