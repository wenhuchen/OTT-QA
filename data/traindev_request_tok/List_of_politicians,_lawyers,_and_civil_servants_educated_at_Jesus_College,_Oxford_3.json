  "/wiki/James_Chadwin": "James Armstrong Chadwin QC ( 7 June 1930 - 16 January 2006 ) was a prominent British barrister , whose cases included defending Peter Sutcliffe , the Yorkshire Ripper . Chadwin was born in Glasgow and educated at the High School of Glasgow , Glasgow University ( where he read modern languages and met the woman he was to marry ) and Jesus College , Oxford . Whilst at Oxford , he was active as an actor and director in university theatre and also joined the Oxford University Air Squadron . He then spent six years in the Royal Air Force as an education officer at RAF Sandwich , his eyesight not being good enough to enable him to be a pilot . He was then called to the bar by Gray 's Inn in 1958 and joined chambers in Newcastle upon Tyne where his contemporaries included Peter Taylor , later Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales . Chadwin practised mainly in the field of criminal law and became a Queen 's Counsel in 1976 . He also became a Recorder in the same year , presiding over some trials at the Old Bailey . He was later appointed a Bencher of Gray 's Inn and , in 1988 , Leader of the Northern Circuit . Chadwin represented Peter Sutcliffe in 1981 . Sutcliffe had admitted killing 13 women and attempting to kill seven others . Four psychiatrists reported on Sutcliffe and diagnosed paranoid schizophrenia , and Sir Michael Havers QC , the Attorney-General , was prepared to accept a plea of guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility . However , the trial judge , Mr Justice Boreham , refused to accept this plea and so Sutcliffe was tried for murder .",
  "/wiki/Barrister": "A barrister is a type of lawyer in common law jurisdictions . Barristers mostly specialise in courtroom advocacy and litigation . Their tasks include taking cases in superior courts and tribunals , drafting legal pleadings , researching the philosophy , hypothesis and history of law , and giving expert legal opinions . Barristers are distinguished from solicitors , who have more direct access to clients , and may do transactional-type legal work . It is mainly barristers who are appointed as judges , and they are rarely hired by clients directly . In some legal systems , including those of Scotland , South Africa , Scandinavia , Pakistan , India , Bangladesh , and the British Crown dependencies of Jersey , Guernsey and the Isle of Man , the word barrister is also regarded as an honorific title . In a few jurisdictions , barristers are usually forbidden from conducting litigation , and can only act on the instructions of a solicitor , who performs tasks such as corresponding with parties and the court , and drafting court documents . In England and Wales , barristers may seek authorisation from the Bar Standards Board to conduct litigation . This allows a barrister to practise in a 'dual capacity ' , fulfilling the role of both barrister and solicitor . In some countries with common law legal systems , such as New Zealand and some regions of Australia , lawyers are entitled to practise both as barristers and solicitors , but it remains a separate system of qualification to practise exclusively as a barrister .",
  "/wiki/Yorkshire_Ripper": "Peter William Sutcliffe ( born 2 June 1946 ) , also known as Peter William Coonan , is a prolific English serial killer who was dubbed the Yorkshire Ripper by the press . On 22 May 1981 , Sutcliffe was convicted of murdering 13 women and attempting to murder seven others . He is serving 20 concurrent sentences of life imprisonment , which was increased to a whole life order in 2010 . All except two of his murders took place in West Yorkshire ; the others were in Manchester . Sutcliffe initially attacked women and girls in residential areas , but appears to have moved to red light districts because he was attracted by the vulnerability of prostitutes . Sutcliffe had allegedly regularly used the services of prostitutes in Leeds and Bradford . He carried out murders over five years , including women who were not prostitutes . After his arrest in Sheffield by South Yorkshire Police for driving with false number plates in January 1981 , he was transferred to West Yorkshire Police , who questioned him about the killings . He confessed to being the perpetrator , saying that the voice of God had sent him on a mission to kill prostitutes . At his trial , Sutcliffe pleaded not guilty to murder on grounds of diminished responsibility , but he was convicted of murder on a majority verdict . Following his conviction , Sutcliffe began using his mother 's maiden name of Coonan . West Yorkshire Police were criticised for their failure to catch Sutcliffe despite having interviewed him nine times in the course of their five-year investigation .",

Such degrees are generally preparation for legal careers ; but while their curricula may be reviewed by legal authority , they do not themselves confer a license .

A copyright is subject to limitations based on public interest considerations , such as the fair use doctrine in the United States .

Copyrights can be granted by public law and are in that case considered territorial rights . This means that copyrights granted by the law of a certain state , do not extend beyond the territory of that specific jurisdiction . Copyrights of this type vary by country ; many countries , and sometimes a large group of countries , have made agreements with other countries on procedures applicable when works cross national borders or national rights are inconsistent .

  "/wiki/Serjeant-at-law": "A Serjeant-at-Law ( SL ) , commonly known simply as a Serjeant , was a member of an order of barristers at the English and Irish bar . The position of Serjeant-at-Law ( servientes ad legem ) , or Sergeant-Counter , was centuries old ; there are writs dating to 1300 which identify them as descended from figures in France before the Norman Conquest . The Serjeants were the oldest formally created order in England , having been brought into existence as a body by Henry II . The order rose during the 16th century as a small , elite group of lawyers who took much of the work in the central common law courts . With the creation of Queen 's Counsel ( or Queen 's Counsel Extraordinary ) during the reign of Elizabeth I , the order gradually began to decline , with each monarch opting to create more King 's or Queen 's Counsel . The Serjeants ' exclusive jurisdictions were ended during the 19th century and , with the Judicature Act 1873 coming into force in 1875 , it was felt that there was no need to have such figures , and no more were created . The last appointed was Nathaniel Lindley , later a Law Lord , who retired in 1905 and died in 1921 . The number of Irish Serjeants-at-law was limited to three ( originally one , later two ) . The last appointment was A. M. Sullivan in 1912 ; after his 1921 relocation to the English bar he remained Serjeant Sullivan as a courtesy title . The Serjeants had for many centuries exclusive jurisdiction over the Court of Common Pleas , being the only lawyers allowed to argue a case there . At the same time they had rights of audience in the other central common law courts ( the Court of King 's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas ) and precedence over all other lawyers . Only Serjeants-at-Law could become judges of these courts right up into the 19th century , and socially the Serjeants ranked above Knights Bachelor and Companions of the Bath .",
