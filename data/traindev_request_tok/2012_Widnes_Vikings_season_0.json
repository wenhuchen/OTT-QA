  "/wiki/Rugby_league_positions": "A rugby league team consists of thirteen players on the field , with four substitutes on the bench . Each of the thirteen players is assigned a position , normally with a standardised number , which reflects their role in attack and defence , although players can take up any position at any time . Players are divided into two general types , forwards and backs . Forwards are generally chosen for their size and strength . They are expected to run with the ball , to attack , and to make tackles . Forwards are required to improve the team 's field position thus creating space and time for the backs . Backs are usually smaller and faster , though a big , fast player can be of advantage in the backs . Their roles require speed and ball-playing skills , rather than just strength , to take advantage of the field position gained by the forwards . Typically forwards tend to operate in the centre of the field , while backs operate nearer to the touch-lines , where more space can usually be found .",

  "/wiki/Fullback_(rugby_league)": "Fullback ( or full-back ) is one of the positions in a rugby league football team . Typically wearing jersey number 1 , the fullback is a member of the team 's 'back-line ' ( No . 1-7 ) . The position 's name comes from their duty of standing the furthest back in defence , behind the forwards ( 8-13 ) , half backs ( 6 and 7 ) and the three-quarter backs ( 2-5 ) . Fullbacks are therefore the last line of defence , having to tackle any opposition players and regather the ball from any kicks that make it through their teammates . It is for this reason that the fullback is also referred to as the sweeper or custodian . Being able to secure high bomb kicks is a highly sought quality in fullbacks . Fullback is also one of the most important positions in attack , handling the ball nearly every set of six and often running into open space on the field . Therefore , together with the two half backs and hooker , fullback is one of the four key positions that make up what is referred to as a team 's 'spine ' . Because the fullback makes the most support runs , players in the fullback role complete more very high-intensity running than any other position . The Rugby League International Federation 's Laws of the Game state that the 'fullback ' is to be numbered 1 . However , traditionally players ' jersey numbers have varied , and in the modern Super League , each squad 's players are assigned individual numbers regardless of position .",
