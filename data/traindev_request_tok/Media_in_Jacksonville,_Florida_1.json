  "/wiki/Call_sign": "In broadcasting and radio communications , a call sign ( also known as a call name or call letters - and historically as a call signal - or abbreviated as a call ) is a unique designation for a transmitter station . In the United States of America , they are used for all FCC-licensed transmitters . A call sign can be formally assigned by a government agency , informally adopted by individuals or organizations , or even cryptographically encoded to disguise a station 's identity . The use of call signs as unique identifiers dates to the landline railroad telegraph system . Because there was only one telegraph line linking all railroad stations , there needed to be a way to address each one when sending a telegram . In order to save time , two-letter identifiers were adopted for this purpose . This pattern continued in radiotelegraph operation ; radio companies initially assigned two-letter identifiers to coastal stations and stations aboard ships at sea . These were not globally unique , so a one-letter company identifier ( for instance , 'M ' and two letters as a Marconi station ) was later added . By 1912 , the need to quickly identify stations operated by multiple companies in multiple nations required an international standard ; an ITU prefix would be used to identify a country , and the rest of the call sign an individual station in that country .",

  "/wiki/Independent_station_(North_America)": "An independent station is a type of television station broadcasting in the United States or Canada that is not affiliated with any broadcast television network ; most commonly , these stations carry a mix of syndicated , brokered and in some cases , local programming to fill time periods when network programs typically would air . Stations that are affiliated with networks such as The CW , MyNetworkTV or to a lesser degree , even Fox may be considered to be quasi-independent stations as these networks mainly provide programming during primetime , with limited to no network-supplied content in other time periods . Independent radio is a similar concept with regards to community radio stations , although with a slightly different meaning ( as many non-indie commercial broadcasting radio stations produce the vast majority of their own programming , perhaps retaining only a nominal affiliation with a radio network for news updates or syndicated radio programming ) .",
