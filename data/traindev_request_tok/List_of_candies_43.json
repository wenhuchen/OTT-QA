  "/wiki/Brittle_(food)": "Brittle is a type of confection consisting of flat broken pieces of hard sugar candy embedded with nuts such as pecans , almonds , or peanuts . It has many variations around the world , such as pasteli in Greece , croquant in France , gozinaki in Georgia , gachak in Indian Punjab , chikki in other parts of India , kotkoti in Bangladesh [ citation needed ] , Huasheng tang ( \u82b1\u751f\u7cd6 ) in China , Thua Tat ( \u0e16\u0e31\u0e48\u0e27\u0e15\u0e31\u0e14 ) in Thailand and k\u1eb9o l\u1ea1c in Vietnam . In parts of the Middle East , brittle is made with pistachios , while many Asian countries use sesame seeds and peanuts . Peanut brittle is the most popular brittle recipe in the US . The term brittle first appears in print in 1892 , though the candy itself has been around for much longer . Traditionally , a mixture of sugar and water is heated to the hard crack stage corresponding to a temperature of approximately 300 \u00b0F ( 149 \u00b0C ) , although some recipes also call for ingredients such as corn syrup and salt in the first step . Nuts are mixed with the caramelized sugar . At this point spices , leavening agents , and often peanut butter or butter are added . The hot candy is poured out onto a flat surface for cooling , traditionally a granite or marble slab . The hot candy may be troweled to uniform thickness . When the brittle cools , it is broken into pieces .",
  "/wiki/Confection": "Confectionery is the art of making confections , which are food items that are rich in sugar and carbohydrates . Exact definitions are difficult . In general , though , confectionery is divided into two broad and somewhat overlapping categories , bakers ' confections and sugar confections . Bakers ' confectionery , also called flour confections , includes principally sweet pastries , cakes , and similar baked goods . Sugar confectionery includes candies ( usually called sweets in British English ) , candied nuts , chocolates , chewing gum , bubble gum , pastillage , and other confections that are made primarily of sugar . In some cases , chocolate confections ( confections made of chocolate ) are treated as a separate category , as are sugar-free versions of sugar confections . The words candy ( US and Canada ) , sweets ( UK and Ireland ) , and lollies ( Australia and New Zealand ) are common words for the most common varieties of sugar confectionery . The confectionery industry also includes specialized training schools and extensive historical records . Traditional confectionery goes back to ancient times and continued to be eaten through the Middle Ages into the modern era .",
  "/wiki/Sucrose": "Sucrose is common sugar . It is a disaccharide , a molecule composed of two monosaccharides : glucose and fructose . Sucrose is produced naturally in plants , from which table sugar is refined . It has the molecular formula C12H22O11 . For human consumption , sucrose is extracted and refined from either sugarcane or sugar beet . Sugar mills - typically located in tropical regions near where sugarcane is grown - crush the cane and produce raw sugar which is shipped to other factories for refining into pure sucrose . Sugar beet factories are located in temperate climates where the beet is grown , and process the beets directly into refined sugar . The sugar refining process involves washing the raw sugar crystals before dissolving them into a sugar syrup which is filtered and then passed over carbon to remove any residual colour . The sugar syrup is then concentrated by boiling under a vacuum and crystallized as the final purification process to produce crystals of pure sucrose that are clear , odorless , and sweet . Sugar is often an added ingredient in food production and food recipes . About 185 million tonnes of sugar were produced worldwide in 2017 .",
  "/wiki/Pecan": "The pecan /p\u026a\u02c8k\u00e6n/ ( Carya illinoinensis ) is a species of hickory native to northern Mexico and the southern United States in the region of the Mississippi River . The tree is cultivated for its seed in the southern United States , primarily in Georgia , and in Mexico which produces nearly half of the world total . The seed is an edible nut used as a snack and in various recipes , such as praline candy and pecan pie . The pecan , in various aspects , is included in state symbols of Alabama , Arkansas , California , Oklahoma and Texas .",
  "/wiki/Almond": "The almond ( Prunus dulcis , syn . Prunus amygdalus ) is a species of tree native to Iran and surrounding countries but widely cultivated elsewhere . The almond is also the name of the edible and widely cultivated seed of this tree . Within the genus Prunus , it is classified with the peach in the subgenus Amygdalus , distinguished from the other subgenera by corrugations on the shell ( endocarp ) surrounding the seed . The fruit of the almond is a drupe , consisting of an outer hull and a hard shell with the seed , which is not a true nut , inside . Shelling almonds refers to removing the shell to reveal the seed . Almonds are sold shelled or unshelled . Blanched almonds are shelled almonds that have been treated with hot water to soften the seedcoat , which is then removed to reveal the white embryo .",
  "/wiki/Peanut": "The peanut , also known as the groundnut , goober ( US ) , or monkey nut ( UK ) , and taxonomically classified as Arachis hypogaea , is a legume crop grown mainly for its edible seeds . It is widely grown in the tropics and subtropics , being important to both small and large commercial producers . It is classified as both a grain legume and , due to its high oil content , an oil crop . World annual production of shelled peanuts was 44 million tonnes in 2016 , led by China with 38% of the world total . Atypically among legume crop plants , peanut pods develop underground ( geocarpy ) rather than above ground . With this characteristic in mind , the botanist Carl Linnaeus named the species hypogaea , which means under the earth . As a legume , the peanut belongs to the botanical family Fabaceae ; this is also known as Leguminosae , and commonly known as the bean , or pea , family . Like most other legumes , peanuts harbor symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in root nodules . This capacity to fix nitrogen means peanuts require less nitrogen-containing fertilizer and also improve soil fertility , making them valuable in crop rotations . Peanuts are similar in taste and nutritional profile to tree nuts such as walnuts and almonds , and as a culinary nut are often served in similar ways in Western cuisines . The botanical definition of a nut is a fruit whose ovary wall becomes hard at maturity . Using this criterion , the peanut is not a typical nut .",

It is most often found with sugar added , in the form of sweetened condensed milk ( SCM ) , to the extent that the terms condensed milk and sweetened condensed milk are often used interchangeably today . SCM is a very thick , sweet product , which when canned can last for years without refrigeration if not opened . The product is used in numerous dessert dishes in many countries . A related product is evaporated milk , which has undergone a lengthier preservation process because it is not sweetened . Evaporated milk is known in some countries as unsweetened condensed milk . Both products have a similar amount of water removed .",
  "/wiki/Butter": "Butter is a dairy product made from the fat and protein components of milk or cream . It is a semi-solid emulsion at room temperature , consisting of approximately 80% butterfat . It is used at room temperature as a spread , melted as a condiment , and used as an ingredient in baking , sauce making , pan frying , and other cooking procedures . Most frequently made from cow 's milk , butter can also be manufactured from the milk of other mammals , including sheep , goats , buffalo , and yaks . It is made by churning milk or cream to separate the fat globules from the buttermilk . Salt and food colorings are sometimes added to butter . Rendering butter , removing the water and milk solids , produces clarified butter or ghee , which is almost entirely butterfat . Butter is a water-in-oil emulsion resulting from an inversion of the cream , where the milk proteins are the emulsifiers . Butter remains a firm solid when refrigerated , but softens to a spreadable consistency at room temperature , and melts to a thin liquid consistency at 32 to 35 \u00b0C ( 90 to 95 \u00b0F ) . The density of butter is 911 grams per litre ( 0.950 lb per US pint ) . It generally has a pale yellow color , but varies from deep yellow to nearly white . Its natural , unmodified color is dependent on the source animal 's feed and genetics , but the commercial manufacturing process commonly manipulates the color with food colorings like annatto or carotene .",
  "/wiki/Flavoring": "Flavor ( American English ) or flavour ( British English ; see spelling differences ) is the sensory impression of food or other substances , and is determined primarily by the chemical senses of taste and smell . The trigeminal senses , which detect chemical irritants in the mouth and throat , as well as temperature and texture , are also important to the overall gestalt of flavor perception . The flavor of the food , as such , can be altered with natural or artificial flavorants which affect these senses . A flavorant is defined as a substance that gives another substance flavor , altering the characteristics of the solute , causing it to become sweet , sour , tangy , etc . A flavor is a quality of something that affects the sense of taste . Of the three chemical senses , smell is the main determinant of a food item 's flavor . Five basic tastes - sweet , sour , bitter , salty and umami ( savory ) are universally recognized , although some cultures also include pungency and oleogustus ( fattiness ) . The number of food smells is unbounded ; a food 's flavor , therefore , can be easily altered by changing its smell while keeping its taste similar . This is exemplified in artificially flavored jellies , soft drinks and candies , which , while made of bases with a similar taste , have dramatically different flavors due to the use of different scents or fragrances . The flavorings of commercially produced food products are typically created by flavorists . Although the terms flavoring and flavorant in common language denote the combined chemical sensations of taste and smell , the same terms are used in the fragrance and flavors industry to refer to edible chemicals and extracts that alter the flavor of food and food products through the sense of smell . Due to the high cost or unavailability of natural flavor extracts , most commercial flavorants are nature-identical , which means that they are the chemical equivalent of natural flavors , but chemically synthesized rather than being extracted from source materials .",
  "/wiki/Sugar": "Sugar is the generic name for sweet-tasting , soluble carbohydrates , many of which are used in food . Simple sugars , also called monosaccharides , include glucose , fructose , and galactose . Compound sugars , also called disaccharides or double sugars , are molecules composed of two monosaccharides joined by a glycosidic bond . Common examples are sucrose ( glucose + fructose ) , lactose ( glucose + galactose ) , and maltose ( two molecules of glucose ) . In the body , compound sugars are hydrolysed into simple sugars . Table sugar , granulated sugar or regular sugar refers to sucrose , a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose . Longer chains of monosaccharides are not regarded as sugars , and are called oligosaccharides or polysaccharides . Some other chemical substances , such as glycerol and sugar alcohols , may have a sweet taste , but are not classified as sugar . Sugars are found in the tissues of most plants . Honey and fruit are abundant natural sources of unbounded simple sugars . Sucrose is especially concentrated in sugarcane and sugar beet , making them ideal for efficient commercial extraction to make refined sugar . In 2016 , the combined world production of those two crops was about two billion tonnes .",
  "/wiki/Cotton_candy": "Cotton candy is a spun sugar confection that resembles cotton . It usually contains small amounts of flavoring and/or food coloring . The candy is made by heating and liquefying sugar , spinning it centrifugally through minute holes - and finally allowing the sugar to rapidly cool and re-solidify into fine strands . It is often sold at fairs , circuses , carnivals , and festivals - served on either a stick , paper cone or in a plastic bag . Cotton candy is made and sold globally - as fairy floss in Australia and New Zealand , candy floss in the UK , Ireland , Egypt , India and Sri Lanka , and tooth floss in South Africa .

  "/wiki/Cone_(geometry)": "A cone is a three-dimensional geometric shape that tapers smoothly from a flat base ( frequently , though not necessarily , circular ) to a point called the apex or vertex . A cone is formed by a set of line segments , half-lines , or lines connecting a common point , the apex , to all of the points on a base that is in a plane that does not contain the apex . Depending on the author , the base may be restricted to be a circle , any one-dimensional quadratic form in the plane , any closed one-dimensional figure , or any of the above plus all the enclosed points . If the enclosed points are included in the base , the cone is a solid object ; otherwise it is a two-dimensional object in three-dimensional space . In the case of a solid object , the boundary formed by these lines or partial lines is called the lateral surface ; if the lateral surface is unbounded , it is a conical surface . In the case of line segments , the cone does not extend beyond the base , while in the case of half-lines , it extends infinitely far . In the case of lines , the cone extends infinitely far in both directions from the apex , in which case it is sometimes called a double cone . Either half of a double cone on one side of the apex is called a nappe . The axis of a cone is the straight line ( if any ) , passing through the apex , about which the base ( and the whole cone ) has a circular symmetry . In common usage in elementary geometry , cones are assumed to be right circular , where circular means that the base is a circle and right means that the axis passes through the centre of the base at right angles to its plane . If the cone is right circular the intersection of a plane with the lateral surface is a conic section . In general , however , the base may be any shape and the apex may lie anywhere ( though it is usually assumed that the base is bounded and therefore has finite area , and that the apex lies outside the plane of the base ) .",

  "/wiki/Vegetarians": "Vegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat ( red meat , poultry , seafood , and the flesh of any other animal ) , and may also include abstention from by-products of animal slaughter . Vegetarianism may be adopted for various reasons . Many people object to eating meat out of respect for sentient life . Such ethical motivations have been codified under various religious beliefs , as well as animal rights advocacy . Other motivations for vegetarianism are health-related , political , environmental , cultural , aesthetic , economic , or personal preference . There are variations of the diet as well : an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet includes both eggs and dairy products , an ovo-vegetarian diet includes eggs but not dairy products , and a lacto-vegetarian diet includes dairy products but not eggs . A strict vegetarian diet - referred to as vegan - excludes all animal products , including eggs and dairy . Avoidance of animal products may require dietary supplements to prevent deficiencies such as vitamin B12 deficiency , which leads to pernicious anemia . Psychologically , preference for vegetarian foods can be impacted by one 's own socio-economic status and evolutionary factors . Packaged and processed foods , such as cakes , cookies , candies , chocolate , yogurt , and marshmallows , often contain unfamiliar animal ingredients , and so may be a special concern for vegetarians due to the likelihood of such additives . Feelings among vegetarians may vary concerning these ingredients . Some vegetarians scrutinize product labels for animal-derived ingredients while others do not object to consuming cheese made with animal-derived rennet .",

Dietary vegans ( also known as strict vegetarians ) refrain from consuming meat , eggs , dairy products , and any other animal-derived substances . [ d ] An ethical vegan ( also known as a moral vegetarian ) is someone who not only follows a vegan diet but extends the philosophy into other areas of their lives , and opposes the use of animals for any purpose . [ e ] Another term is environmental veganism , which refers to the avoidance of animal products on the premise that the industrial farming of animals is environmentally damaging and unsustainable . Well-planned vegan diets are regarded as appropriate for all stages of life , including infancy and pregnancy , by the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics , [ f ] Dietitians of Canada , the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council , New Zealand Ministry of Health , Harvard Medical School , and the British Dietetic Association . The German Society for Nutrition does not recommend vegan diets for children or adolescents , or during pregnancy and breastfeeding . [ g ] In preliminary clinical research , vegan diets lowered the risk of type 2 diabetes , high blood pressure , obesity , and ischemic heart disease . Vegan diets tend to be higher in dietary fiber , magnesium , folic acid , vitamin C , vitamin E , iron , and phytochemicals ; and lower in dietary energy , saturated fat , cholesterol , long-chain omega-3 fatty acids , vitamin D , calcium , zinc , and vitamin B12 .

In common parlance , the term is used to denote U.S. Air Force aircraft modified and used to transport the president . The aircraft are prominent symbols of the American presidency and its power . The idea of designating specific military aircraft to transport the President arose in 1943 , when officials of the United States Army Air Forces , the predecessor to the U.S. Air Force , became concerned about using commercial airlines for presidential travel . A C-87 Liberator Express was reconfigured for use as the first dedicated VIP-and-presidential transport aircraft and named Guess Where II , but the Secret Service rejected it because of its safety record . A C-54 Skymaster was then converted for presidential use ; dubbed the Sacred Cow , it carried President Franklin D. Roosevelt to the Yalta Conference in February 1945 and was used for another two years by President Harry S. Truman . The Air Force One call sign was created in 1953 , after a Lockheed Constellation named Columbine II carrying President Dwight D.

  "/wiki/New_Jersey": "New Jersey is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the Northeastern United States . It is bordered on the north and east by the state of New York ; on the east , southeast , and south by the Atlantic Ocean ; on the west by the Delaware River and Pennsylvania ; and on the southwest by the Delaware Bay and the State of Delaware . New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state by area but the 11th-most populous , with 9 million residents as of 2017 and an area of 8,722.58 square miles , making it the most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states , with its biggest city being Newark . New Jersey lies completely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia . New Jersey was the second-wealthiest U.S. state by median household income as of 2017 . New Jersey was inhabited by Native Americans for more than 2,800 years , with historical tribes such as the Lenape along the coast . In the early 17th century , the Dutch and the Swedes founded the first European settlements in the state . The English later seized control of the region , naming it the Province of New Jersey after the largest of the Channel Islands , Jersey , and granting it as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley , 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton . New Jersey was the site of several important battles during the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century . In the 19th century , factories in the cities Camden , Paterson , Newark , Trenton , Jersey City , and Elizabeth ( known as the Big Six ) , helped drive the Industrial Revolution . New Jersey 's geographic location at the center of the Northeast megalopolis , between Boston and New York City to the northeast , and Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Washington , D.C. , to the southwest , fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century . At the turn of the 21st century , this suburbanization began reverting with the consolidation of New Jersey 's culturally diverse populace toward more urban settings within the state , with towns home to commuter rail stations outpacing the population growth of more automobile-oriented suburbs since 2008 .",

  "/wiki/Corn_syrup": "Corn syrup is a food syrup which is made from the starch of corn ( called maize in some countries ) and contains varying amounts of maltose and higher oligosaccharides , depending on the grade . Corn syrup , also known as glucose syrup to confectioners , is used in foods to soften texture , add volume , prevent crystallization of sugar , and enhance flavor . Corn syrup is distinct from high-fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) , which is manufactured from corn syrup by converting a large proportion of its glucose into fructose using the enzyme D-xylose isomerase , thus producing a sweeter compound due to higher levels of fructose . The more general term glucose syrup is often used synonymously with corn syrup , since glucose syrup in the United States is most commonly made from corn starch . Technically , glucose syrup is any liquid starch hydrolysate of mono- , di- , and higher-saccharides and can be made from any source of starch ; wheat , tapioca and potatoes are the most common other sources .",
  "/wiki/Hydrogenation": "Hydrogenation - meaning , to treat with hydrogen - is a chemical reaction between molecular hydrogen ( H2 ) and another compound or element , usually in the presence of a catalyst such as nickel , palladium or platinum . The process is commonly employed to reduce or saturate organic compounds . Hydrogenation typically constitutes the addition of pairs of hydrogen atoms to a molecule , often an alkene . Catalysts are required for the reaction to be usable ; non-catalytic hydrogenation takes place only at very high temperatures . Hydrogenation reduces double and triple bonds in hydrocarbons .",
  "/wiki/Palm_kernel_oil": "Palm kernel oil is an edible plant oil derived from the kernel of the oil palm Elaeis guineensis .

It is used widely as an acidifier , as a flavoring and a chelating agent . A citrate is a derivative of citric acid ; that is , the salts , esters , and the polyatomic anion found in solution . An example of the former , a salt is trisodium citrate ; an ester is triethyl citrate . When part of a salt , the formula of the citrate ion is written as C6H5O3\u22127 or C3H5O ( COO ) 3\u22123 .",
  "/wiki/Flavour": "Flavor ( American English ) or flavour ( British English ; see spelling differences ) is the sensory impression of food or other substances , and is determined primarily by the chemical senses of taste and smell . The trigeminal senses , which detect chemical irritants in the mouth and throat , as well as temperature and texture , are also important to the overall gestalt of flavor perception . The flavor of the food , as such , can be altered with natural or artificial flavorants which affect these senses . A flavorant is defined as a substance that gives another substance flavor , altering the characteristics of the solute , causing it to become sweet , sour , tangy , etc . A flavor is a quality of something that affects the sense of taste . Of the three chemical senses , smell is the main determinant of a food item 's flavor . Five basic tastes - sweet , sour , bitter , salty and umami ( savory ) are universally recognized , although some cultures also include pungency and oleogustus ( fattiness ) . The number of food smells is unbounded ; a food 's flavor , therefore , can be easily altered by changing its smell while keeping its taste similar . This is exemplified in artificially flavored jellies , soft drinks and candies , which , while made of bases with a similar taste , have dramatically different flavors due to the use of different scents or fragrances . The flavorings of commercially produced food products are typically created by flavorists . Although the terms flavoring and flavorant in common language denote the combined chemical sensations of taste and smell , the same terms are used in the fragrance and flavors industry to refer to edible chemicals and extracts that alter the flavor of food and food products through the sense of smell . Due to the high cost or unavailability of natural flavor extracts , most commercial flavorants are nature-identical , which means that they are the chemical equivalent of natural flavors , but chemically synthesized rather than being extracted from source materials .",

  "/wiki/Caramelization": "Caramelization or caramelisation is the browning of sugar , a process used extensively in cooking for the resulting sweet nutty flavor and brown colour . The brown colours are produced by three groups of polymers : caramelans ( C24H36O18 ) , caramelens ( C36H50O25 ) , and caramelins ( C125H188O80 ) . As the process occurs , volatile chemicals such as diacetyl are released , producing the characteristic caramel flavor . Like the Maillard reaction , caramelization is a type of non-enzymatic browning . Unlike the Maillard reaction , caramelization is pyrolytic , as opposed to being a reaction with amino acids . When caramelization involves the disaccharide sucrose , it is broken down into the monosaccharides fructose and glucose .",

  "/wiki/Inverted_sugar_syrup": "Inverted sugar syrup ( also called invert syrup , or simply invert sugar ) is an edible mixture of two simple sugars - glucose and fructose - that is made by heating sucrose ( table sugar ) with water . It is thought to be sweeter than table sugar , and foods that contain it retain moisture better and crystallize less easily . Bakers , who call it invert syrup , may use it more than other sweeteners . Though inverted sugar syrup can be made by heating table sugar in water alone , [ citation needed ] the reaction can be sped up by adding lemon juice , cream of tartar or other catalysts often without changing the flavor noticeably . The mixture of the two simple sugars is formed by a process of hydrolysis of sucrose . This mixture has the opposite direction of optical rotation as the original sugar , which is why it is called an invert sugar .",
  "/wiki/Flour": "Flour is a powder made by grinding raw grains , roots , beans , nuts , or seeds . It is used to make many different foods . Cereal flour is the main ingredient of bread , which is a staple food for most cultures . Wheat flour is one of the most important ingredients in Oceanic , European , South American , North American , Middle Eastern , North Indian and North African cultures , and is the defining ingredient in their styles of breads and pastries . Wheat is the most common base for flour . Corn flour has been important in Mesoamerican cuisine since ancient times and remains a staple in the Americas . Rye flour is a constituent of bread in central Europe . Cereal flour consists either of the endosperm , germ , and bran together ( whole-grain flour ) or of the endosperm alone ( refined flour ) . Meal is either differentiable from flour as having slightly coarser particle size ( degree of comminution ) or is synonymous with flour ; the word is used both ways . For example , the word cornmeal often connotes a grittier texture whereas corn flour connotes fine powder , although there is no codified dividing line .",
