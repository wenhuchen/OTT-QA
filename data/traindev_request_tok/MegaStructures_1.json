[ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",
  "/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge": "The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate , the one-mile-wide ( 1.6 km ) strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean . The structure links the U.S. city of San Francisco , California - the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula - to Marin County , carrying both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait . The bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco , California , and the United States . It was initially designed by engineer Joseph Strauss in 1917 . It has been declared one of the Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers . The Frommer 's travel guide describes the Golden Gate Bridge as possibly the most beautiful , certainly the most photographed , bridge in the world . At the time of its opening in 1937 , it was both the longest and the tallest suspension bridge in the world , with a main span of 4,200 feet ( 1,280 m ) and a total height of 746 feet ( 227 m ) .",

The small island was developed with facilities for a lighthouse , a military fortification , a military prison , and a federal prison from 1934 until 21 March 1963 . The water currents around the island were high at all times , which presumably decreased the chance of an inmate escaping . Beginning in November 1969 , the island was occupied for more than 19 months by a group of Native Americans from San Francisco , who were part of a wave of Native American activism across the U.S. , with public protests through the 1970s . In 1972 , Alcatraz became part of Golden Gate National Recreation Area and received designation as a National Historic Landmark in 1986 . Today , the island 's facilities are managed by the National Park Service as part of Golden Gate National Recreation Area ; it is open to tours . Visitors can reach the island in a little under 15 minutes by ferry ride from Pier 33 , located between the San Francisco Ferry Building and Fisherman 's Wharf , San Francisco . Hornblower Cruises and Events , operating under the name Alcatraz Cruises , is the official ferry provider to and from the island . Alcatraz Island is home to the abandoned prison , the site of the oldest operating lighthouse on the West Coast of the United States , early military fortifications , and natural features such as rock pools and a seabird colony ( mostly western gulls , cormorants , and egrets ) . According to a 1971 documentary on the history of Alcatraz , the island measures 1,675 feet ( 511 m ) by 590 feet ( 180 m ) and is 135 feet ( 41 m ) at highest point during mean tide .

Singapore is located about one degree ( 137 kilometres or 85 miles ) north of the equator , and is situated off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula , and by extension , the southernmost extremity of continental Asia . The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia 's Riau Islands , its northern , western , and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia , and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east . It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south , and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans , being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east . The country 's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets , the combined area of which has increased by almost 25% since the country 's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects . Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history , modern Singapore , then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate , was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles , a British colonial officer , established a trading post of the East India Company on the island . In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond . During the Second World War , Imperial Japan successfully invaded Singapore , resulting in an interregnum of British rule corresponding with a brief Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 . Following Japan 's surrender in 1945 , the Straits Settlements were dissolved , with Singapore being returned to British control as a standalone crown colony in 1946 .",

Thousands of ships drop anchor in the harbour , connecting the port to over 600 other ports in 123 countries and spread over six continents . The Port of Singapore is not a mere economic boon , but an economic necessity because Singapore is lacking in land and natural resources . The Port is critical for importing natural resources , and then later re-exporting products after they have been refined and shaped in some manner , for example wafer fabrication or oil refining to generate revenue . The service industries such as hospitality services typical of a port of call restock the food and water supplies on ships . Ships pass between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean through the Singapore Strait . The Straits of Johor on the country 's north are impassable for ships due to the Johor-Singapore Causeway , built in 1923 , which links the town of Woodlands , Singapore to the city of Johor Bahru in Malaysia .",

  "/wiki/Oil_sands": "Oil sands , crude bitumen , or more technically bituminous sands , are a type of unconventional petroleum deposit . Oil sands are either loose sands or partially consolidated sandstone containing a naturally occurring mixture of sand , clay , and water , soaked with a dense and extremely viscous form of petroleum technically referred to as bitumen Natural bitumen deposits are reported in many countries , but in particular are found in extremely large quantities in Canada . Other large reserves are located in Kazakhstan , Russia , and Venezuela . The estimated worldwide deposits of oil are more than 2 trillion barrels ( 320 billion cubic metres ) ; the estimates include deposits that have not been discovered . Proven reserves of bitumen contain approximately 100 billion barrels , and total natural bitumen reserves are estimated at 249.67 Gbbl ( 39.694\u00d710^9 m3 ) worldwide , of which 176.8 Gbbl ( 28.11\u00d710^9 m3 ) , or 70.8% , are in Alberta , Canada . The crude bitumen contained in the Canadian oil sands is described by the National Energy Board of Canada as a highly viscous mixture of hydrocarbons heavier than pentanes which , in its natural state , is not usually recoverable at a commercial rate through a well because it is too thick to flow . Crude bitumen is a thick , sticky form of crude oil , so heavy and viscous ( thick ) that it will not flow unless heated or diluted with lighter hydrocarbons such as light crude oil or natural-gas condensate . At room temperature , it is much like cold molasses . The World Energy Council ( WEC ) defines natural bitumen as oil having a viscosity greater than 10,000 centipoise under reservoir conditions and an API gravity of less than 10\u00b0 API . The Orinoco Belt in Venezuela is sometimes described as oil sands , but these deposits are non-bituminous , falling instead into the category of heavy or extra-heavy oil due to their lower viscosity . Natural bitumen and extra-heavy oil differ in the degree by which they have been degraded from the original conventional oils by bacteria . According to the WEC , extra-heavy oil has a gravity of less than 10\u00b0 API and a reservoir viscosity of no more than 10,000 centipoise .",

  "/wiki/Sea_Launch": "Sea Launch is a multinational spacecraft launch service that used a mobile maritime launch platform for equatorial launches of commercial payloads on specialized Zenit-3SL rockets through 2014 . By 2014 , it had assembled and launched thirty-two rockets , with an additional three failures and one partial failure . All commercial payloads have been communications satellites intended for geostationary transfer orbit with such customers as EchoStar , DirecTV , XM Satellite Radio , PanAmSat , and Thuraya . The launcher and its payload are assembled on a purpose-built ship Sea Launch Commander in Long Beach , California , US . The assembled spacecraft is then positioned on top of the self-propelled platform Ocean Odyssey and moved to the equatorial Pacific Ocean for launch , with the Sea Launch Commander serving as command center . The sea-based launch system means the rockets can be fired from the optimal position on Earth 's surface , considerably increasing payload capacity and reducing launch costs compared to land-based systems . Sea Launch mothballed its ships and put operations on long-term hiatus in 2014 , following the Russian military intervention in Ukraine . By 2015 , discussions on disposition of company assets are underway , and the Sea Launch partners are in a court-administered dispute about unpaid expenses that Boeing claims it incurred . In September 2016 , S7 Group , owner of S7 Airlines announced they were purchasing Sea Launch . Launch services will be provided by S7 Sea Launch , a US subsidiary .",

Military uses include attacking enemy surface ships ( merchant and military ) , or other submarines , aircraft carrier protection , blockade running , ballistic missile submarines as part of a nuclear strike force , reconnaissance , conventional land attack ( for example using a cruise missile ) , and covert insertion of special forces . Civilian uses for submarines include marine science , salvage , exploration and facility inspection and maintenance . Submarines can also be modified to perform more specialized functions such as search-and-rescue missions or undersea cable repair . Submarines are also used in tourism and undersea archaeology . Most large submarines consist of a cylindrical body with hemispherical ( or conical ) ends and a vertical structure , usually located amidships , which houses communications and sensing devices as well as periscopes .

  "/wiki/Roller_coaster": "A roller coaster is a type of amusement ride that employs a form of elevated railroad track designed with tight turns , steep slopes , and sometimes inversions . People ride along the track in open cars , and the rides are often found in amusement parks and theme parks around the world . LaMarcus Adna Thompson obtained one of the first known patents for a roller coaster design in 1885 , related to the Switchback Railway that opened a year earlier at Coney Island . The track in a coaster design does not necessarily have to be a complete circuit , as shuttle roller coasters demonstrate . Most roller coasters have multiple cars in which passengers sit and are restrained . Two or more cars hooked together are called a train . Some roller coasters , notably Wild Mouse roller coasters , run with single cars .",
