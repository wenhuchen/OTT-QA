  "/wiki/Overtime_(sports)": "Overtime or extra time is an additional period of play specified under the rules of a sport to bring a game to a decision and avoid declaring the match a tie or draw where the scores are the same . In some sports , this extra period is played only if the game is required to have a clear winner , as in single-elimination tournaments where only one team or players can advance to the next round or win the tournament . In other sports , particularly those prominently played in North America where ties are generally disfavored , some form of overtime is employed for all games . The rules of overtime or extra time vary between sports and even different competitions . Some may employ sudden death , where the first player or team who scores immediately wins the game . In others , play continues until a specified time has elapsed , and only then is the winner declared . If the contest remains tied after the extra session , depending on the rules , the match may immediately end as a draw , additional periods may be played , or a different tiebreaking procedure such as a penalty shootout may be used instead . The terms overtime and in overtime ( abbreviated OT or IOT ) are primarily used in North America , whereas the terms extra time and after extra time ( abbreviated a.e.t . ) are usually used in other continents . However , in basketball , the terms overtime and in overtime are used worldwide .",

  "/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)": "A penalty shoot-out ( officially kicks from the penalty mark ) is a method of determining which team is awarded victory in an association football match that can not end in a draw , when the score is tied after the regulation playing time as well as extra time ( if used ) have expired . In a penalty shoot-out , each team takes turns shooting at goal from the penalty mark , with the goal only defended by the opposing team 's goalkeeper . Each team has five shots which must be taken by different kickers ; the team that makes more successful kicks is declared the victor . Shoot-outs finish as soon as one team has an insurmountable lead . If scores are level after five pairs of shots , the shootout progresses into additional sudden-death rounds . Balls successfully kicked into the goal during a shoot-out do not count as goals for the individual kickers or the team , and are tallied separately from the goals scored during normal play ( including extra time , if any ) . Although the procedure for each individual kick in the shoot-out resembles that of a penalty kick , there are some differences . Most notably , neither the kicker nor any player other than the goalkeeper may play the ball again once it has been kicked . The penalty shoot-out is one of the three methods of breaking a draw that are currently approved by the Laws of the Game ; the others are extra time and , for two-legged ties , the away goals rule . A shoot-out is usually used only after one or more of the other methods fail to produce a winner . The method of breaking a draw for a specific match is determined beforehand by the match organizing body . In most professional level competitions , two 15-minute extra time periods are played if the score is tied at the end of regulation time , and a shoot-out is held if the score is still tied after the extra time periods .",
