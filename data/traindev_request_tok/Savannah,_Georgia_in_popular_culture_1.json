A strategic port city in the American Revolution and during the American Civil War , Savannah is today an industrial center and an important Atlantic seaport . It is Georgia 's fifth-largest city , with a 2018 estimated population of 145,862 . The Savannah metropolitan area , Georgia 's third-largest , had an estimated population of 389,494 in 2018 .

Though the name Tybee Island is used for both the island and the city , geographically they are not identical : only part of the island 's territory lies within the city . The island is the easternmost point in Georgia . The famous phrase From Rabun Gap to Tybee Light , intended to illustrate the geographic diversity of Georgia , contrasts a mountain pass near the state 's northernmost point with the coastal island 's famous lighthouse . As of the 2010 census , the city 's population was 2,990 . The entire island is a part of the Savannah Metropolitan Statistical Area . Officially renamed Savannah Beach in a publicity move at the end of the 1950s , the city of Tybee Island has since reverted to its original name . ( The name Savannah Beach nevertheless appears on official state maps as far back as 1952 and as recently as the mid-1970s . ) The small island , which has long been a quiet getaway for the residents of Savannah , has become a popular vacation spot with tourists from outside the Savannah metropolitan area . Tybee Island is home to the first of what would eventually become the Days Inn chain of hotels , the oft-photographed Tybee Island Light Station , and the Fort Screven Historic District . It is one of the few locations where the U.S. Air Force dropped an atomic bomb - by accident ( during a botched 1958 military training exercise ) . Though the Tybee Bomb did not detonate ( and , according to some reports , was not armed with a fuse ) , there has been ongoing concern , since the Mark 15 nuclear bomb lost during the mishap was never found .",
