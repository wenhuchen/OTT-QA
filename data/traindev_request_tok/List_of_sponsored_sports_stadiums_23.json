This provides a road link to Pleasant Point , Fairlie , Twizel , Lake Tekapo , Aoraki / Mount Cook and Queenstown . Timaru has been built on rolling hills created from the lava flows of the extinct Mt Horrible volcano , which last erupted thousands of years ago . The result is that most of the main streets are undulating , a clear contrast with the flat landscape of the Canterbury Plains to the north . This volcanic rock is used for the construction of local bluestone buildings .",

The Avon River flows through the centre of the city , with an urban park located along its banks . Archaeological evidence has indicated that people first settled in the Christchurch area in about 1250 . Christchurch became a city by Royal Charter on 31 July 1856 , making it officially the oldest established city in New Zealand . The Canterbury Association , which settled the Canterbury Plains , named the city after Christ Church , Oxford . The new settlement was laid out in a grid pattern centred on Cathedral Square ; during the 19th century there were few barriers to the rapid growth of the urban area , except for the Pacific to the east and the Port Hills to the south . Agriculture is the historic mainstay of Christchurch 's economy . The early presence of the University of Canterbury and the heritage of the city 's academic institutions in association with local businesses has fostered a number of technology-based industries . Christchurch is one of five 'gateway cities ' for Antarctic exploration , hosting Antarctic support bases for several nations . The city suffered a series of earthquakes between September 2010 and January 2012 , with the most destructive of them occurring at 12.51 p.m. on Tuesday , 22 February 2011 , in which 185 people were killed and thousands of buildings across the city collapsed or suffered severe damage .",

  "/wiki/Multi-purpose_stadium": "A multi-purpose stadium is a type of stadium designed to be easily used by multiple types of events . While any stadium could potentially host more than one type of sport or event , this concept usually refers to a specific design philosophy that stresses multifunctionality over specificity . It is used most commonly in Canada and the United States , where the two most popular outdoor team sports - football and baseball - require radically different facilities . Football uses a rectangular field ( Canadian football fields are larger than American ones ) , while baseball is played on a diamond and large outfield . This requires a particular design to accommodate both , usually an oval , while some later designs used an octorad . While building stadiums in this way means that sports teams and governments can share costs , it also imposes some challenges . In North America , multipurpose stadiums were built primarily during the 1960s and 1970s as shared home stadiums for Major League Baseball and National Football League or Canadian Football League teams . Some stadiums were renovated to allow multipurpose configurations during the 1980s . This type of stadium is associated with an era of suburbanization , in which many sports teams followed their fans out of large cities into areas with cheaper , plentiful land . They were usually built near highways and had large parking lots , but were rarely connected to public transit . As multipurpose stadiums were rarely ideal for both sports usually housed in them , they had fallen out of favor by the 1990s , with the SkyDome that opened in 1989 being the last such stadium completed to accommodate baseball and football . With the completion of the Truman Sports Complex in Kansas City in 1973 , a model for purpose-built stadiums was laid down .",

Its name comes from D\u00f9n \u00c8ideann , the Scottish Gaelic name for Edinburgh , the capital of Scotland . The urban area of Dunedin lies on the central-eastern coast of Otago , surrounding the head of Otago Harbour , and the harbour and hills around Dunedin are the remnants of an extinct volcano . The city suburbs extend out into the surrounding valleys and hills , onto the isthmus of the Otago Peninsula , and along the shores of the Otago Harbour and the Pacific Ocean . Dunedin was the largest New Zealand city by territorial land area until superseded by Auckland with the formation of the Auckland Council in November 2010 . Archaeological evidence points to lengthy occupation of the area by M\u0101ori prior to the arrival of Europeans . The province and region of Otago takes its name from the Ngai Tahu village of Otakou at the mouth of the harbour , which became a whaling station in the 1830s . In 1848 a Scottish settlement was established by the Lay Association of the Free Church of Scotland . Between 1855 and 1900 many thousands of Scots emigrated to the incorporated city . Dunedin became wealthy during the Central Otago Gold Rush , beginning in the 1860s . In the mid-1860s , and between 1878 and 1881 , it was New Zealand 's largest urban area .

It has an area of approximately 32,000 square kilometres ( 12,000 sq mi ) , making it the country 's third largest local government region . Its population was 232,300 in June 2018 .

The exact meaning of the term is disputed , with common translations being isolated village and place of red earth , the latter referring to the reddish-ochre clay which is common in the area around Dunedin . Otago is also the old name of the European settlement on the Otago Harbour , established by the Weller Brothers in 1831 , which lies close to the modern harbourside community of Otakou . The place later became the focus of the Otago Association , an offshoot of the Free Church of Scotland , notable for its adoption of the principle that ordinary people , not the landowner , should choose the ministers . Major centres include Dunedin ( the principal city ) , Oamaru ( made famous by Janet Frame ) , Balclutha , Alexandra , and the major tourist centres Queenstown and Wanaka . Kaitangata in South Otago is a prominent source of coal . The Waitaki and Clutha rivers provide much of the country 's hydroelectric power .
