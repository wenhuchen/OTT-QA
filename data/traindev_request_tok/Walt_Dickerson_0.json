For much of his career , Ra led The Arkestra , an ensemble with an ever-changing name and flexible line-up . Born and raised in Alabama , Blount became involved in the Chicago jazz scene during the late 1940s . He soon abandoned his birth name , taking the name Le Sony ' r Ra , shortened to Sun Ra ( after Ra , the Egyptian God of the Sun ) . He developed a complex persona and an idiosyncratic , myth-based credo that would make him a pioneer of Afrofuturism . He claimed to be an alien from Saturn on a mission to preach peace , and throughout his life he publicly denied ties to his prior identity . His widely eclectic and avant-garde music echoed the entire history of jazz , from ragtime and early New Orleans hot jazz , to swing music , bebop , free jazz and fusion . His compositions ranged from keyboard solos to works for big bands of over 30 musicians , along with electronic excursions , songs , chants , percussion pieces , and anthems . From the mid-1950s until his death , Ra led the musical collective The Arkestra ( which featured artists such as Marshall Allen , John Gilmore and June Tyson throughout its various iterations ) . Its performances often included dancers and musicians dressed in elaborate , futuristic costumes inspired by ancient Egyptian attire and the Space Age . ( Following Ra 's illness-forced retirement in 1992 , the band remained active as The Sun Ra Arkestra , and , as of 2018 , continues performing under the leadership of veteran Ra sideman Marshall Allen . ) Though his mainstream success was limited , Sun Ra was a prolific recording artist and frequent live performer , and remained influential throughout his life for his music and persona .",
