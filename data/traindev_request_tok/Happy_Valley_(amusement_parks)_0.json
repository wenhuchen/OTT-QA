Nanjing , one of the nation 's most important cities for over a thousand years , is recognized as one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China . It has been one of the world 's largest cities , enjoying peace and prosperity despite wars and disasters . Nanjing served as the capital of Eastern Wu ( 229-280 ) , one of the three major states in the Three Kingdoms period ; the Eastern Jin and each of the Southern dynasties ( Liu Song , Southern Qi , Liang and Chen ) , which successively ruled southern China from 317-589 ; the Southern Tang ( 937-75 ) , one of the Ten Kingdoms ; the Ming dynasty when , for the first time , all of China was ruled from the city ( 1368-1421 ) ; and the Republic of China under the right wing Kuomintang ( 1927-37 , 1946-49 ) prior to its flight to Taiwan by Chiang Kai-Shek during the Chinese Civil War .",

Jiangsu has the highest GDP per capita of Chinese provinces and second-highest GDP of Chinese provinces , after Guangdong . Jiangsu borders Shandong in the north , Anhui to the west , and Zhejiang and Shanghai to the south . Jiangsu has a coastline of over 1,000 kilometres ( 620 mi ) along the Yellow Sea , and the Yangtze River passes through the southern part of the province . Since the Sui and Tang dynasties , Jiangsu has been a national economic and commercial center , partly due to the construction of the Grand Canal . Cities such as Nanjing , Suzhou , Wuxi , Changzhou and Shanghai ( separated from Jiangsu in 1927 ) are all major Chinese economic hubs . Since the initiation of economic reforms in 1990 , Jiangsu has become a focal point for economic development . It is widely regarded as China 's most developed province , when measured by its Human Development Index ( HDI ) . Jiangsu is home to many of the world 's leading exporters of electronic equipment , chemicals and textiles . It has also been China 's largest recipient of foreign direct investment since 2006 ."
