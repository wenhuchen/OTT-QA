  "/wiki/Pitcher": "In baseball , the pitcher is the player who throws the baseball from the pitcher 's mound toward the catcher to begin each play , with the goal of retiring a batter , who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the pitcher is assigned the number 1 . The pitcher is often considered the most important player on the defensive side of the game , and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum . There are many different types of pitchers , such as the starting pitcher , relief pitcher , middle reliever , lefty specialist , setup man , and the closer . Traditionally , the pitcher also bats . Starting in 1973 with the American League and spreading to further leagues throughout the 1980s and 1990s , the hitting duties of the pitcher have generally been given over to the position of designated hitter , a cause of some controversy . The National League in Major League Baseball and the Japanese Central League are among the remaining leagues that have not adopted the designated hitter position .",

USC 's official colors are cardinal and gold . The Trojans have a cross-town rivalry with UCLA . However , USC 's rivalry with Notre Dame predates the UCLA rivalry by three years . The Notre Dame rivalry stems mainly from the annual football game played between these two universities and is considered the greatest intersectional rivalry in college football .",

  "/wiki/Catcher": "Catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player . When a batter takes his/her turn to hit , the catcher crouches behind home plate , in front of the ( home ) umpire , and receives the ball from the pitcher . In addition to this primary duty , the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well . The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket , but in cricket , wicketkeepers are increasingly known for their batting abilities . Positioned behind home plate , the catcher can see the whole field , and is therefore in the best position to direct and lead the other players in a defensive play . The catcher typically calls for pitches using hand signals . The calls are based on the pitcher 's mechanics and strengths , as well as the batter 's tendencies and weaknesses . Foul tips , bouncing balls in the dirt , and contact with runners during plays at the plate are all events to be handled by the catcher , necessitating the use of protective equipment . This includes a mask , chest and throat protectors , shin guards , and a heavily padded catcher 's mitt . Because the position requires a comprehensive understanding of the game 's strategies , the pool of former catchers yields a disproportionate number of managers in both Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball , including such prominent examples as Connie Mack , Steve O'Neill , Al L\u00f3pez , Mike Scioscia , and Joe Torre . The physical and mental demands of being involved on every defensive play can wear catchers down over a long season , and can have a negative effect on their offensive output . Because of the strategic defensive importance of catching , if a catcher has exceptional defensive skills , teams are often willing to overlook their relative offensive weaknesses .",

  "/wiki/First_baseman": "First base , or 1B , is the first of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a baserunner to score a run for that player 's team . A first baseman is the player on the team playing defense who fields the area nearest first base , and is responsible for the majority of plays made at that base . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the first baseman is assigned the number 3 . Also called first sacker or cornerman , the first baseman is ideally a tall player who throws left-handed and possesses good flexibility and quick reflexes . Flexibility is needed because the first baseman receives throws from the other infielders , the catcher and the pitcher after they have fielded ground balls . In order for the runner to be called out , the first baseman must be able to stretch towards the throw and catch it before the runner reaches first base . First base is often referred to as the other hot corner - the hot corner being third base - and therefore , like the third baseman , he must have quick reflexes to field the hardest hit balls down the foul line , mainly by left-handed pull hitters and right-handed hitters hitting to the opposite field . They often are power hitters who have a substantial number of home runs and extra base hits while maintaining a .270 plus batting average . [ citation needed ]",

  "/wiki/Second_baseman": "In baseball and softball , second baseman is a fielding position in the infield , between second and first base . The second baseman often possesses quick hands and feet , needs the ability to get rid of the ball quickly , and must be able to make the pivot on a double play . In addition , second basemen are usually right-handed ; only four left-handed throwing players have ever played second base in Major League Baseball since 1950 . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the second baseman is assigned the number 4 . Good second basemen need to have very good range since they have to field balls closer to the first baseman who is often holding runners on , or moving towards the base to cover . On a batted ball to right field , the second baseman goes out towards the ball for the relay . Due to these requirements , second base is sometimes a primarily defensive position in the modern game , but there are hitting stars as well .",

  "/wiki/Third_baseman": "A third baseman , abbreviated 3B , is the player in baseball whose responsibility is to defend the area nearest to third base - the third of four bases a baserunner must touch in succession to score a run . In the scoring system used to record defensive plays , the third baseman is assigned the number ' 5 ' . The third baseman requires good reflexes in reacting to batted balls , as he is often the closest infielder ( roughly 90-120 feet ) to the batter . The third base position requires a strong and accurate arm , as the third baseman often makes long throws to first base . The third baseman sometimes must throw quickly to second base in time to start a double play . The third baseman must also field fly balls in fair and foul territory . Third base is known as the hot corner , because the third baseman is relatively close to the batter and most right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball hard in this direction . A third baseman must possess good hand-eye coordination and quick reactions in order to catch hard line drives sometimes in excess of 125 miles per hour ( 201 km/h ) . Third basemen often must begin in a position even closer to the batter if a bunt is expected , creating a hazard if the ball is instead hit sharply . As with middle infielders , right-handed throwing players are standard at the position because they do not need to turn their body before throwing across the infield to first base . Mike Squires , who played fourteen games at third base in 1982 and 1983 , is a very rare example of a third baseman who threw lefty . Some third basemen have been converted from middle infielders or outfielders because the position does not require them to run as fast .",
  "/wiki/USC_Trojans_baseball": "The USC Trojans baseball program represents the University of Southern California in college baseball . Established in 1888 , the team is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the Pac-12 Conference . USC home 's field is Dedeaux Field , which is named in honor of former head coach and National College Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Rod Dedeaux . The USC Trojans are one of the most successful programs in the history of college baseball . The Trojans have won more baseball national championships than any other program across all divisions of college baseball . With 12 national championships , USC is far and away the leader in that category ; no other Division I school has more than six . As of June 30 , 2018 , USC also ranked fifth in all-time College World Series ( CWS ) appearances with 21 , trailing only Texas ( 36 ) , Miami ( FL ) ( 25 ) , and Arizona State ( 22 ) , and Florida State ( 22 ) . The Trojans have won more individual CWS games ( 74 ) than any program but Texas ( 85 ) . USC also ranked fourth in all-time NCAA Tournament wins with 173 - trailing only Texas ( 240 ) , Miami ( 192 ) , and Florida State ( 192 ) - and eighth in total NCAA Tournament appearances with 37 .

  "/wiki/Shortstop": "Shortstop , abbreviated SS , is the baseball or softball fielding position between second and third base , which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions . Historically the position was assigned to defensive specialists who were typically poor at batting and were often placed at the bottom of the batting order . Today shortstops are often able to hit well and many are placed at the top of the lineup . In the numbering system used by scorers to record defensive plays , the shortstop is assigned the number 6 . More hit balls go to the shortstop than to any other position , as there are more right-handed hitters in baseball than left-handed hitters , and most hitters have a tendency to pull the ball slightly . Like a second baseman , a shortstop must be agile , for example when performing a 4-6-3 double play . Also , like a third baseman , the shortstop fields balls hit to the left side of the infield , where a strong arm is needed to throw out a batter-runner before they reach the safety of first base .",
