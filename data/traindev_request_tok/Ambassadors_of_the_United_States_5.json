Subsequent rule by Ptolemaic Egypt , the Classical and Eastern Roman Empire , Arab caliphates for a short period , the French Lusignan dynasty and the Venetians , was followed by over three centuries of Ottoman rule between 1571 and 1878 ( de jure until 1914 ) . Cyprus was placed under the UK 's administration based on the Cyprus Convention in 1878 and was formally annexed by the UK in 1914 . While Turkish Cypriots made up 18% of the population , the partition of Cyprus and creation of a Turkish state in the north became a policy of Turkish Cypriot leaders and Turkey in the 1950s .

Ambassador to Persia/Iran was also the Ambassador to Afghanistan . The U.S. Legation at Kabul was established on June 6 , 1942 , with Charles W. Thayer as Charg\u00e9 dAffaires ad interim . Cornelius Van Hemert Engert presented his credentials to the government of Afghanistan on July 2 , 1942 , as the first envoy solely accredited to Afghanistan . Ambassador Adolph Dubs was assassinated in a botched kidnapping attempt in 1979 . For the next ten years no ambassador was appointed ; only a series of charg\u00e9s daffaires represented the U.S. in Kabul . The embassy at Kabul was closed on January 30 , 1989 , due to concerns that the new regime would not be able to maintain security and protect diplomats following the final departure of Soviet forces from the country . Following the overthrow of the Taliban government , the U.S. Liaison Office in Kabul opened on December 17 , 2001 , with Ambassador James Dobbins serving as Director .",

It is also a municipality , forming part of the greater Kabul Province , and divided into 22 districts . According to estimates in 2019 , the population of Kabul is 4.114 million , which includes all the major ethnic groups of Afghanistan . Afghanistan 's only city with a population of over 1 million , Kabul serves as its political , cultural and economical center . Rapid urbanization had made Kabul the world 's 75th largest city . Kabul is located high up in a narrow valley between the Hindu Kush mountains , with an elevation of 1,790 metres ( 5,873 ft ) making it one of the highest capitals in the world . The city is said to be over 3,500 years old , mentioned since at least the time of the Achaemenid Empire . Located at crossroads in Asia - roughly halfway between Istanbul in the west and Hanoi in the east - it is in a strategic location along the trade routes of South and Central Asia , and a key location of the ancient Silk Road . It has been part of the Achaemenids followed by the Seleucids , Mauryans , Kushans , Kabul Shahis , Saffarids , Samanids , Ghaznavids , Ghurids , Khwarazmians , Qarlughids , Khaljis , Timurids , Mughals , and Hotaks , until finally becoming part of the Durrani Empire ( also known as the Afghan Empire ) in 1747 . Kabul became the capital of Afghanistan in 1776 , during the reign of Timur Shah Durrani , the son of Ahmad Shah Durrani . In the early 19th century , the British occupied the city , but after establishing foreign relations , they were compelled to withdraw all forces from Afghanistan . The city was occupied by the Soviets in 1979 but they too abandoned it after the 1988 Geneva Accords were signed .",

Afghanistan is bordered by Pakistan to the east and south ; [ b ] Iran to the west ; Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , and Tajikistan to the north ; and China to the northeast . Occupying 652,000 square kilometers ( 252,000 sq mi ) , it is a mountainous country with plains in the north and southwest . Kabul is the capital and largest city . The population is 32 million , mostly composed of ethnic Pashtuns , Tajiks , Hazaras and Uzbeks . Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the Middle Paleolithic Era , and the country 's strategic location along the Silk Road connected it to the cultures of the Middle East and other parts of Asia . The land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed numerous military campaigns , including those by Alexander the Great , Mauryas , Muslim Arabs , Mongols , British , Soviets , and by the United States with allied countries . The land also served as the source from which the Kushans , Hephthalites , Samanids , Saffarids , Ghaznavids , Ghorids , Khaljis , Mughals , Hotaks , Durranis , and others have risen to form major empires . The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan began with the Hotak and Durrani dynasties in the 18th century . In the late 19th century , Afghanistan became a buffer state in the Great Game between British India and the Russian Empire . Its border with British India , the Durand Line , was formed in 1893 but it is not recognized by the Afghan government and it has led to strained relations with Pakistan since the latter 's independence in 1947 . Following the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919 the country was free of foreign influence , eventually becoming a monarchy under Amanullah Khan , until almost 50 years later when Zahir Shah was overthrown and a republic was established .",
  "/wiki/Settam-e-Melli": "Settam-e-Melli ( Dari Persian for National Oppression ) , variously romanized as Setam-i-Milli , Setami Milli , Setam-i-Meli , Setam-e-Meli , Setami-i-Milli , and Setame Melli , was a political movement in Afghanistan , led by Tahir Badakhshi . The organization was affiliated with the Non-Aligned Movement , and was opposed by both the Afghan monarchy and by the Soviet-aligned People 's Democratic Party of Afghanistan . Its followers were mostly Persian speakers . Most of its members were non-Pashtuns - Tajik , Uzbek , and other minorities - and it has been variously described as an anti-Pashtun separatist group and as a Tajik and Uzbek separatist group . Information on Settam-e-Melli is vague and contradictory , but it appears to have been an anti-Pashtun leftist mutation . The group was founded in 1968 by Tahir Badakhshi , a Tajik who formerly had been a member of the Central Committee of the People 's Democratic Party of Afghanistan and split with the party . The group emphasized militant class struggle and mass mobilization of peasants and recruited Tajiks , Uzbeks , and other minorities from Kabul and the northeastern provinces . Responsibility for the kidnapping and murder of the American ambassador to Afghanistan , Adolph Dubs , on February 14 , 1979 at the Kabul Hotel is sometimes attributed to Settam-e-Melli , but the true identity and aims of the militants who kidnapped Dubs is uncertain , and the circumstances are still clouded . Some consider the allegation that Settam-e-Melli was responsible to be dubious , pointing to a former Kabul policeman who has claimed that at least one kidnapper was part of the Parcham faction of the People 's Democratic Party of Afghanistan . During the Taraki-Amin period , the Setamis withdrew to the Afghan countryside , though as an urban movement this removed them from their powerbase . During the 1979-1986 rule of communist president Babrak Karmal , the Setamis became closer with the government , partially as Karmal had been a personal friend of Badakhshi ( who had been killed in 1979 ) . A Setami leader , Bashir Baghlani , went over to the government in 1983 , and was made Minister of Justice .",

A Greek colony named Euesperides had existed in the area from around 525 BC . In the 3rd century BC , it was relocated and refounded as the Ptolemaic city of Berenice . Berenice prospered under the Romans , and after the 3rd century AD it superseded Cyrene and Barca as the center of Cyrenaica . The city went into decline during the Byzantine period and had already been reduced to a small town before its conquest by the Arabs . In 1911 , Italy captured Benghazi and the rest of Tripolitania from the Ottomans . Under Italian rule , Benghazi witnessed a period of extensive development and modernization , particularly in the second half of the 1930s . The city changed hands several times during World War II and was heavily damaged in the process .

  "/wiki/2012_Benghazi_attack": "The 2012 Benghazi attack was a coordinated attack against two United States government facilities in Benghazi , Libya by members of the Islamic militant group Ansar al-Sharia . At 9:40 p.m. , September 11 , members of Ansar al-Sharia attacked the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi resulting in the deaths of U.S . Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens and U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith . Stevens was the first U.S. ambassador killed in the line of duty since 1979 . At around 4:00 a.m. on September 12 , the group launched a mortar attack against a CIA annex approximately one-mile ( 1.6 km ) away , killing CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and wounding ten others . Initial analysis by the CIA , repeated by top government officials , indicated that the attack spontaneously arose from a protest . Subsequent investigations showed that the attack was premeditated - although rioters and looters not originally part of the group may have joined in after the attacks began . There is no definitive evidence that al-Qaeda or any other international terrorist organization participated in the Benghazi attack . The United States immediately increased security worldwide at diplomatic and military facilities and began investigating the Benghazi attack . Many Libyans condemned the attacks . They staged public demonstrations condemning Ansar al-Sharia , which had been formed during the 2011 Libyan civil war in opposition to leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi . Despite persistent accusations against President Obama , Hillary Clinton , and Susan Rice , ten investigations - six by Republican-controlled congressional committees - did not find that they or any other high-ranking Obama administration officials had acted improperly ."
