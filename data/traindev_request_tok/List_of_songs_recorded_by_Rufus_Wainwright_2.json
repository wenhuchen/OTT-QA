He moved to Paris intending to study with Nadia Boulanger , but she refused him .

His critically acclaimed 1959 book Lyrics on Several Occasions , an amalgam of autobiography and annotated anthology , is an important source for studying the art of the lyricist in the golden age of American popular song .",

Sometimes , especially early on , they would collaborate extensively when writing songs , working eyeball to eyeball as Lennon phrased . Later , it was more common for one of the two credited authors to write all or most of a song with limited input from the other .

The song remained popular for decades , and the Indiana General Assembly adopted it as the official state song on March 14 , 1913 . The song was the basis for a 1923 film of the same title .

The song was composed during a transitory time in musical history when songs first began to be recorded for the phonograph . It was among the earliest pieces of popular music to be recorded . Dresser 's inability to control the distribution of phonograph cylinders led him and his company to join other composers to petition the United States Congress to expand federal copyright protections over the new technology . Dresser 's ballad was the subject of some controversy after his death in 1906 . His younger brother , novelist Theodore Dreiser , publicly claimed to have authored part of the song , but the validity of his claim was never proven . The ambiguity of United States copyright laws at the time and the poor management of Dresser 's estate left the song vulnerable to plagiarism .",
