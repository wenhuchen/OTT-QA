  "/wiki/United_States_Football_League": "The United States Football League ( USFL ) was an American football league that played for three seasons , 1983 through 1985 . The league played a spring/summer schedule in each of its active seasons . The 1986 season was scheduled to be played in the autumn/winter , directly competing against the long-established National Football League ( NFL ) . However , the USFL ceased operations before that season was scheduled to begin . The ideas behind the USFL were conceived in 1965 by New Orleans businessman David Dixon , who saw a market for a professional football league that would play in the summer , when the National Football League and college football were in their off-season . Dixon had been a key player in the construction of the Louisiana Superdome and the expansion of the NFL into New Orleans in 1967 . He developed The Dixon Plan - a blueprint for the USFL based upon securing NFL-caliber stadiums in top TV markets , securing a national TV broadcast contract , and controlling spending - and found investors willing to buy in . Though the original franchise owners and founders of the USFL had promised to abide by the general guidelines set out by Dixon 's plan , problems arose before the teams took the field , with some franchises facing financial problems and instability from the beginning . Due to pressure from the NFL , some franchises had difficulty securing leases in stadiums that were also used by NFL teams , forcing them to scramble to find alternate venues in their chosen city or hurriedly move to a new market . The USFL had no hard salary cap , and because of this , some teams quickly escalated player payrolls to unsustainable levels despite pledges to keep costs under control . While a handful of USFL franchises abided by the Dixon Plan and were relatively stable , others suffered repeated financial crises , and there were many franchise relocations , mergers , and ownership changes during the league 's short existence ; however , none of its teams actually folded during any given season . These problems were worsened as some owners began engaging in bidding wars for star players against NFL teams and each other , forcing other owners to do the same or face a competitive disadvantage .",
