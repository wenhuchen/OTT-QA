Boniface spent his early career abroad in diplomatic roles . In the College of Cardinals , he discriminated not only against the Benedictines but also members of the Colonna family , some of whom had contested the validity of the 1294 papal conclave that elected him following the unusual resignation of Pope Celestine V. The dispute resulted in battles between troops of Boniface and his adversaries and the deliberate destruction and salting of the town of Palestrina , despite the pope 's assurances that the surrendering city would be spared . Boniface VIII put forward some of the strongest claims of any pope to temporal as well as spiritual power . He involved himself often with foreign affairs , including in France , Sicily , Italy and the First War of Scottish Independence . These views , and his chronic intervention in temporal affairs , led to many bitter quarrels with Albert I of Germany , Philip IV of France , and Dante Alighieri , who wrote his treatise De Monarchia to dispute Boniface 's claims of papal supremacy and placed the pope in the Eighth Circle of Hell in his Divine Comedy , among the simoniacs . Boniface systematized canon law by collecting it in a new volume , Liber Sextus ( 1298 ) , which continues to be important source material for canon lawyers . He organized the first Catholic jubilee year to take place in Rome in order to gain political clout over Philip IV of France or make up for loss of funds from him . Boniface had first entered into conflict with Philip IV of France in 1296 when the latter sought to reinforce the nascent nation state by imposing taxes on the clergy and barring them from administration of the law .

  "/wiki/Crown-cardinal": "A crown-cardinal ( Italian : cardinale della corona ) was a cardinal protector of a Roman Catholic nation , nominated or funded by a Catholic monarch to serve as their representative within the College of Cardinals and , on occasion , to exercise the right claimed by some monarchs to veto a candidate for election to the papacy . More generally , the term may refer to any cardinal significant as a secular statesman or elevated at the request of a monarch . Francis Burkle-Young defines a crown cardinal as one elevated to the cardinalate solely on the recommendation of the European kings and without , in many cases , having performed any service at all for the advance of the Church . According to conclave historian Frederic Baumgartner , the crown-cardinals rarely came to Rome except for the conclaves , if then , and they were largely unknown to the majority of the College . Usually unable to take part in the pratiche , they were not papabili and rarely received more than one or two votes . Crown-cardinals generally opposed the election of crown-cardinals from other kingdoms , although they tended to unite against the election of cardinal-nephews . Opposition to national cardinal protectors arose in the fifteenth century due to the perceived conflict of interest , and Pope Martin V attempted to forbid them entirely in 1425 . A reform of Pope Pius II dated 1464 regards national cardinal protectors as generally inconsistent with curial responsibility , with several exceptions . Such protectorships were first openly permitted by popes Innocent VIII and Alexander VI , both of whom required the explicit written consent of the pontiff for a cardinal to take up a position of service to a secular prince . An unnamed cardinal even suggested elevating national cardinal protectors to a full and official position in the Roman Curia , equivalent to an ambassador .",
