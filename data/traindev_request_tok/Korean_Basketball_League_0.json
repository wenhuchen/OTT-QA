  "/wiki/Points_per_game": "Points per game , often abbreviated PPG , is the average number of points scored by a player per game played in a sport , over the course of a series of games , a whole season , or a career . It is calculated by dividing the total number of points by number of games . The terminology is often used in basketball and ice hockey . For description of sports points see points for ice hockey or points for basketball . In games divided into fixed time periods , especially those in which a player may exit and re-enter the game multiple or an unlimited number of times , a player may receive the same credit ( in this context , a liability ) for participation in a game regardless of how long ( i.e. , for what portion of the game clock 's elapsing ) s/he was actually on the field or court . For this reason , the points-per-game statistic may understate the contribution of players who are highly effective but used only in certain specific pinch or clutch scenarios , such that a points-per-unit-time figure ( e.g. , points per 48 minutes in the case of professional basketball ) may better represent their effectiveness within the context in which a coach or manager plays them . Although the points-per-game statistic has the advantage of factoring in the breadth of scenarios in which the player is effective , in that a player effective in many different scenarios will play more minutes per game and therefore contribute more to the team 's overall performance , it still fails to distinguish between an ineffective player , an effective pinch/clutch offensive player , and a player assuming a primarily defensive role in a position whose title does not necessarily make the nature of his/her role obvious ( e.g. , basketball forward and star rebounder Dennis Rodman ) .",
