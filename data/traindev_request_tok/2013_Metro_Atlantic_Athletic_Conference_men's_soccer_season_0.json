  "/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York": "Buffalo is the second largest city in the U.S. state of New York and the largest city in Western New York . As of 2018 [ update ] , the population was 256,304 . The city is the county seat of Erie County and a major gateway for commerce and travel across the Canada-United States border , forming part of the bi-national Buffalo Niagara Region . As of the April 1 , 2010 , the metropolitan statistical area ( MSA ) had a population of 1,135,509 ; the combined statistical area ( CSA ) , which adds Cattaraugus County , had a population of 1,215,826 inhabitants . The Buffalo area was inhabited before the 17th century by the Native American Iroquois tribe and later by French colonizers . The city grew significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of immigration , the construction of the Erie Canal and rail transportation , and its close proximity to Lake Erie . This growth provided an abundance of fresh water and an ample trade route to the Midwestern United States while grooming its economy for the grain , steel and automobile industries that dominated the city 's economy in the 20th century . Since the city 's economy relied heavily on manufacturing , deindustrialization in the latter half of the 20th century led to a steady decline in population . While some manufacturing activity remains , Buffalo 's economy has transitioned to service industries with a greater emphasis on healthcare , research and higher education , which emerged following the Great Recession . Buffalo is on the eastern shore of Lake Erie , at the head of the Niagara River , 16 miles ( 26 km ) south of Niagara Falls . Its early embrace of electric power led to the nickname The City of Light . The city is also famous for its urban planning and layout by Joseph Ellicott , an extensive system of parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted , as well as significant architectural works .",
