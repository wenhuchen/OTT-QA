As of July 2016 the city has a population of 531,902 , and the metropolitan area had a population of 800,296 . It is the eleventh largest city and the seventh largest metropolitan area in Canada . The Algonquian people had originally named the area K\u00e9bec , an Algonquin [ note 1 ] word meaning where the river narrows , because the Saint Lawrence River narrows proximate to the promontory of Quebec and its Cape Diamant . Explorer Samuel de Champlain founded a French settlement here in 1608 , and adopted the Algonquin name . Quebec City is one of the oldest European cities in North America . The ramparts surrounding Old Quebec ( Vieux-Qu\u00e9bec ) are the only fortified city walls remaining in the Americas north of Mexico . This area was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985 as the Historic District of Old Qu\u00e9bec . The city 's landmarks include the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac hotel that dominates the skyline and the Citadelle of Quebec , an intact fortress that forms the centrepiece of the ramparts surrounding the old city and includes a secondary royal residence .

  "/wiki/New_France": "New France ( French : Nouvelle-France ) , also sometimes known as the French North American Empire or Royal New France , was the area colonized by France in America , beginning with the exploration of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence by Jacques Cartier in 1534 and ending with the cession of New France to Great Britain and Spain in 1763 under the Treaty of Paris ( 1763 ) . The territory of New France consisted of five colonies at its peak in 1712 , each with its own administration : Canada , the most developed colony and divided into the districts of Qu\u00e9bec , Trois-Rivi\u00e8res , and Montr\u00e9al ; Hudson 's Bay ; Acadie in the northeast ; Plaisance on the island of Newfoundland ; and Louisiane . It extended from Newfoundland to the Canadian Prairies and from Hudson Bay to the Gulf of Mexico , including all the Great Lakes of North America . In the sixteenth century , the lands were used primarily to draw from the wealth of natural resources such as furs through trade with the various indigenous peoples . In the seventeenth century , successful settlements began in Acadia and in Quebec . By 1765 , the population of the new Province of Quebec reached approximately 70,000 settlers . The 1713 Treaty of Utrecht resulted in France giving Great Britain its claims over mainland Acadia , the Hudson Bay , and Newfoundland . France established the colony of \u00cele Royale , now called Cape Breton Island , where they built the Fortress of Louisbourg . The British expelled the Acadians in the Great Upheaval from 1755 to 1764 , which has been remembered on July 28 each year since 2003 . Their descendants are dispersed in the Maritime Provinces of Canada and in Maine and Louisiana , with small populations in Ch\u00e9ticamp , Nova Scotia and the Magdalen Islands . Some also went to France . In 1763 , France ceded the rest of New France to Great Britain and Spain , except the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon , at the Treaty of Paris which ended the Seven Years ' War , part of which included the French and Indian War in America .",

  "/wiki/Manorialism": "Manorialism or seignorialism was an organizing principle of rural economies which vested legal and economic power in a Lord of the Manor . He was supported economically from his own direct landholding in a manor ( sometimes called a fief ) , and from the obligatory contributions of a legally subject part of the peasant population under his jurisdiction and that of his manorial court . These obligations could be payable in several ways , in labor ( the French term corv\u00e9e is conventionally applied ) , in kind or in coin . Manorialism originated in the Roman villa system of the Late Roman Empire , and was widely practiced in medieval western and parts of central Europe as well as China . An essential element of feudal society , manorialism was slowly replaced by the advent of a money-based market economy and new forms of agrarian contract . In examining the origins of the monastic cloister , Walter Horn found that as a manorial entity the Carolingian monastery . differed little from the fabric of a feudal estate , save that the corporate community of men for whose sustenance this organization was maintained consisted of monks who served God in chant and spent much of their time in reading and writing . Manorialism died slowly and piecemeal , along with its most vivid feature in the landscape , the open field system . It outlasted serfdom as it outlasted feudalism : primarily an economic organization , it could maintain a warrior , but it could equally well maintain a capitalist landlord . It could be self-sufficient , yield produce for the market , or it could yield a money rent . The last feudal dues in France were abolished at the French Revolution . In parts of eastern Germany , the Rittergut manors of Junkers remained until World War II .",

As of 2011 , Statistics Canada listed 329,500 adherents to the Jewish religion in Canada and 309,650 who claimed Jewish as an ethnicity . One does not necessarily include the other and studies which have attempted to combine the two streams have arrived at figures in excess of 375,000 Jews in Canada . This total would account for approximately 1.1% of the Canadian population . The Jewish community in Canada is composed predominantly of Ashkenazi Jews and their descendants . Other Jewish ethnic divisions are also represented and include Sephardi Jews , Mizrahi Jews , and Bene Israel . A number of converts to Judaism make up the Jewish-Canadian community , which manifests a wide range of Jewish cultural traditions and encompasses the full spectrum of Jewish religious observance .

  "/wiki/Cemetery": "A cemetery or graveyard is a place where the remains of dead people are buried or otherwise interred .

The term graveyard is often used interchangeably with cemetery , but a graveyard primarily refers to a burial ground within a churchyard . The intact or cremated remains of people may be interred in a grave , commonly referred to as burial , or in a tomb , an above-ground grave ( resembling a sarcophagus ) , a mausoleum , columbarium , niche , or other edifice . In Western cultures , funeral ceremonies are often observed in cemeteries . These ceremonies or rites of passage differ according to cultural practices and religious beliefs . Modern cemeteries often include crematoria , and some grounds previously used for both , continue as crematoria as a principal use long after the interment areas have been filled .",
  "/wiki/Chapel": "A chapel is a Christian place of prayer and worship that is usually relatively small , and is distinguished from a church . The term has several senses . Firstly , smaller spaces inside a church that have their own altar are often called chapels ; the Lady chapel is a common type of these . Secondly , a chapel is a place of worship , sometimes non-denominational , that is part of a building or complex with some other main purpose , such as a school , college , hospital , palace or large aristocratic house , castle , barracks , prison , funeral home , cemetery , airport , or a military or commercial ship . Thirdly , chapels are small places of worship , built as satellite sites by a church or monastery , for example in remote areas ; these are often called a chapel of ease . A feature of all these types is that often no clergy were permanently resident or specifically attached to the chapel . Finally , for historical reasons , chapel is also often the term used for independent or nonconformist places of worship in Great Britain - outside the established church , even where in practice they operate as a parish church . The earliest Christian places of worship are now often referred to as chapels , as they were not dedicated buildings but rather a dedicated chamber within a building . Most larger churches had one or more secondary altars which , if they occupied a distinct space , would often be called a chapel . In Russian Orthodox tradition , the chapels were built underneath city gates , where most people could visit them . The most famous example is the Iberian Chapel . Although chapels frequently refer to Christian places of worship , they are also commonly found in Jewish synagogues and do not necessarily denote a specific denomination .",
  "/wiki/Gable": "A gable is the generally triangular portion of a wall between the edges of intersecting roof pitches . The shape of the gable and how it is detailed depends on the structural system used , which reflects climate , material availability , and aesthetic concerns . A gable wall or gable end more commonly refers to the entire wall , including the gable and the wall below it . Some types of roofs do not have a gable ( for example hip roofs do not ) . One common type of roof with gables , the gable roof , is named after its prominent gables . A parapet made of a series of curves ( Dutch gable ) or horizontal steps ( crow-stepped gable ) may hide the diagonal lines of the roof . Gable ends of more recent buildings are often treated in the same way as the Classic pediment form . But unlike Classical structures , which operate through trabeation , the gable ends of many buildings are actually bearing-wall structures . Thus , the detailing can be ambiguous or misleading . [ citation needed ] Gable style is also used in the design of fabric structures , with varying degree sloped roofs , dependent on how much snowfall is expected . Sharp gable roofs are a characteristic of the Gothic and classical Greek styles of architecture . The opposite or inverted form of a gable roof is a V-roof or butterfly roof .",

He made between 21 and 29 trips across the Atlantic Ocean , and founded Quebec , and New France , on 3 July 1608 . An important figure in Canadian history , Champlain created the first accurate coastal map during his explorations , and founded various colonial settlements . Born into a family of mariners , Champlain began exploring North America in 1603 , under the guidance of his uncle , Fran\u00e7ois Grav\u00e9 Du Pont . From 1604 to 1607 , he participated in the exploration and settlement of the first permanent European settlement north of Florida , Port Royal , Acadia ( 1605 ) , as well as the first European settlement that would become Saint John , New Brunswick ( 1604 ) . In 1608 , he established the French settlement that is now Quebec City . [ Note 3 ] Champlain was the first European to describe the Great Lakes , and published maps of his journeys and accounts of what he learned from the natives and the French living among the Natives . He formed relationships with local Montagnais and Innu , and , later , with others farther west - tribes of the ( Ottawa River , Lake Nipissing , and Georgian Bay ) , and with Algonquin and Wendat ; he also agreed to provide assistance in the Beaver Wars against the Iroquois . In 1620 , Louis XIII of France ordered Champlain to cease exploration , return to Quebec , and devote himself to the administration of the country .

The walls can be simple palisades or earthworks to extensive military fortifications with towers , bastions and gates to access to the city .

Generally , these are referred to as city walls or town walls , although there were also walls , such as the Great Wall of China , Walls of Benin , Hadrian 's Wall , Anastasian Wall , the Cyclopean Wall Rajgir and the metaphorical Atlantic Wall , which extended far beyond the borders of a city and were used to enclose regions or mark territorial boundaries . In mountainous terrain , defensive walls such as letzis were used in combination with castles to seal valleys from potential attack . Beyond their defensive utility , many walls also had important symbolic functions - representing the status and independence of the communities they embraced . Existing ancient walls are almost always masonry structures , although brick and timber-built variants are also known . Depending on the topography of the area surrounding the city or the settlement the wall is intended to protect , elements of the terrain such as rivers or coastlines may be incorporated in order to make the wall more effective . Walls may only be crossed by entering the appropriate city gate and are often supplemented with towers . The practice of building these massive walls , though having its origins in prehistory , was refined during the rise of city-states , and energetic wall-building continued into the medieval period and beyond in certain parts of Europe . Simpler defensive walls of earth or stone , thrown up around hillforts , ringworks , early castles and the like , tend to be referred to as ramparts or banks .",
  "/wiki/Picturesque": "Picturesque is an aesthetic ideal introduced into English cultural debate in 1782 by William Gilpin in Observations on the River Wye , and Several Parts of South Wales , etc . Relative Chiefly to Picturesque Beauty ; made in the Summer of the Year 1770 , a practical book which instructed Englands leisured travellers to examine the face of a country by the rules of picturesque beauty . Picturesque , along with the aesthetic and cultural strands of Gothic and Celticism , was a part of the emerging Romantic sensibility of the 18th century . The term picturesque needs to be understood in relationship to two other aesthetic ideals : the beautiful and the sublime . By the last third of the 18th century , Enlightenment and rationalist ideas about aesthetics were being challenged by looking at the experiences of beauty and sublimity as non-rational . Aesthetic experience was not just a rational decision - one did not look at a pleasing curved form and decide it was beautiful ; rather it came naturally as a matter of basic human instinct . Edmund Burke in his 1757 A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful argued that the soft gentle curves appealed to the male sexual desire , while the sublime horrors appealed to our desires for self-preservation . Picturesque arose as a mediator between these opposed ideals of beauty and the sublime , showing the possibilities that existed between these two rationally idealized states . As Thomas Gray wrote in 1765 of the Scottish Highlands : The mountains are ecstatic [ \u2026 ] . None but those monstrous creatures of God know how to join so much beauty with so much horror .

  "/wiki/Palladian_architecture": "Palladian architecture is a European style of architecture derived from and inspired by the designs of the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio ( 1508-1580 ) . What is recognised as Palladian architecture today is an evolution of his original concepts . Palladio 's work was strongly based on the symmetry , perspective , and values of the formal classical temple architecture of the Ancient Greeks and Romans . From the 17th century Palladio 's interpretation of this classical architecture was adapted as the style known as Palladianism . It continued to develop until the end of the 18th century . In Britain , Palladianism was briefly in vogue during the 17th century , but its flowering was cut short by the onset of the English Civil War and the imposition of austerity which followed . In the early 18th century it returned to fashion , not only in England but also , directly influenced from Britain , in Prussia . Count Francesco Algarotti may have written to Lord Burlington from Berlin that he was recommending to Frederick the Great the adoption in Prussia of the architectural style Burlington had introduced in England , but Knobelsdorff 's opera house on the Unter den Linden boulevard , based on Campbell 's Wanstead House , had been constructed from 1741 . Later in the century , when the style was falling from favour in Europe , it had a surge in popularity throughout the British colonies in North America , highlighted by examples such as Drayton Hall in South Carolina , the Redwood Library in Newport , Rhode Island , the Morris-Jumel Mansion in New York City , the Hammond-Harwood House in Annapolis , Maryland and Thomas Jefferson 's Monticello and Poplar Forest in Virginia . The style continued to be utilized in Europe throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries , where it was frequently employed in the design of public and municipal buildings . From the latter half of the 19th century it was rivalled by the Gothic revival in the English-speaking world , whose champions such as Augustus Pugin , remembering the origins of Palladianism in ancient temples , deemed it too pagan for Anglican and Anglo-Catholic worship . However , as an architectural style it has continued to be popular and to evolve ; its pediments , symmetry and proportions are clearly evident in the design of many modern buildings today .",
  "/wiki/Classicism": "Classicism , in the arts , refers generally to a high regard for a classical period , classical antiquity in the Western tradition , as setting standards for taste which the classicists seek to emulate . In its purest form , classicism is an aesthetic attitude dependent on principles based in the culture , art and literature of ancient Greece and Rome , with the emphasis on form , simplicity , proportion , clarity of structure , perfection , restrained emotion , as well as explicit appeal to the intellect . The art of classicism typically seeks to be formal and restrained : of the Discobolus Sir Kenneth Clark observed , if we object to his restraint and compression we are simply objecting to the classicism of classic art . A violent emphasis or a sudden acceleration of rhythmic movement would have destroyed those qualities of balance and completeness through which it retained until the present century its position of authority in the restricted repertoire of visual images . Classicism , as Clark noted , implies a canon of widely accepted ideal forms , whether in the Western canon that he was examining in The Nude ( 1956 ) , or the literary Chinese classics or Chinese art , where the revival of classic styles is also a recurring feature . Classicism is a force which is often present in post-medieval European and European influenced traditions ; however , some periods felt themselves more connected to the classical ideals than others , particularly the Age of Enlightenment , when Neoclassicism was an important movement in the visual arts .",
  "/wiki/British_Isles": "The British Isles are a group of islands in the North Atlantic off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain , Ireland , the Isle of Man , the Hebrides and over six thousand smaller isles . They have a total area of about 315,159 km2 ( 121,684 sq mi ) and a combined population of almost 72 million , and include two sovereign states , the Republic of Ireland ( which covers roughly five-sixths of Ireland ) , and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland . The islands of Alderney , Jersey , Guernsey , and Sark , and their neighbouring smaller islands , are sometimes also taken to be part of the British Isles , even though , as islands off the coast of France , they do not form part of the archipelago . The oldest rocks in the group are in the north west of Scotland , Ireland , and North Wales and are 2.7 billion years old . During the Silurian period , the north-western regions collided with the south-east , which had been part of a separate continental landmass . The topography of the islands is modest in scale by global standards . Ben Nevis rises to an elevation of only 1,345 metres ( 4,413 ft ) , and Lough Neagh , which is notably larger than other lakes in the island group , covers 390 square kilometres ( 151 sq mi ) . The climate is temperate marine , with cool winters and warm summers . The North Atlantic drift brings significant moisture and raises temperatures 11 \u00b0C ( 20 \u00b0F ) above the global average for the latitude . This led to a landscape which was long dominated by temperate rainforest , although human activity has since cleared the vast majority of forest cover . The region was re-inhabited after the last glacial period of Quaternary glaciation , by 12,000 BC , when Great Britain was still part of a peninsula of the European continent . Ireland , which became an island by 12,000 BC , was not inhabited until after 8000 BC .",

The battle , which began on 13 September 1759 , was fought on a plateau by the British Army and Royal Navy against the French Army , just outside the walls of Quebec City on land that was originally owned by a farmer named Abraham Martin , hence the name of the battle . The battle involved fewer than 10,000 troops in total , but proved to be a deciding moment in the conflict between France and Britain over the fate of New France , influencing the later creation of Canada . The culmination of a three-month siege by the British , the battle lasted about an hour . British troops commanded by General James Wolfe successfully resisted the column advance of French troops and Canadian militia under General Louis-Joseph , Marquis de Montcalm , employing new tactics that proved extremely effective against standard military formations used in most large European conflicts . Both generals were mortally wounded during the battle ; Wolfe received three gunshot wounds that ended his life within minutes of the beginning of the engagement and Montcalm died the next morning after receiving a musket ball wound just below his ribs . In the wake of the battle , the French evacuated the city , and their remaining military force in Canada and the rest of North America came under increasing pressure from British forces . The decisive success of the British forces and the subsequent capture of Quebec was part of what became known as the Annus Mirabilis in Great Britain . In 1763 France would cede most of its possessions in eastern North America to Great Britain in the Treaty of Paris .",

The Gothic Revival period lasted longer and was more thoroughly embraced in Canada than in either Britain or the United States , only falling out of style in the 1930s . The late 19th and early 20th centuries was also the period when many major Canadian institutions were founded . Throughout Canada many of the most prominent religious , civic , and scholastic institutions are housed in Gothic Revival style buildings . In the 1960s and 1970s several scholars , most notably Alan Gowans , embraced Canadian Gothic Revival architecture as one of the nation 's signature styles and as an integral part of Canadian nationalism .

  "/wiki/Province_of_Canada": "The Province of Canada ( or the United Province of Canada or the United Canadas ) was a British colony in North America from 1841 to 1867 . Its formation reflected recommendations made by John Lambton , 1st Earl of Durham in the Report on the Affairs of British North America following the Rebellions of 1837-1838 . The Act of Union 1840 , passed on 23 July 1840 by the British Parliament and proclaimed by the Crown on 10 February 1841 , merged the Colonies of Upper Canada and Lower Canada by abolishing their separate parliaments and replacing them with a single one with two houses , a Legislative Council as the upper chamber and the Legislative Assembly as the lower chamber . In the aftermath of the Rebellions of 1837-1838 , unification of the two Canadas was driven by two factors . Firstly , Upper Canada was near bankruptcy because it lacked stable tax revenues , and needed the resources of the more populous Lower Canada to fund its internal transportation improvements . Secondly , unification was an attempt to swamp the French vote by giving each of the former provinces the same number of parliamentary seats , despite the larger population of Lower Canada . Although Durham 's report had called for the Union of the Canadas and for responsible government ( a government accountable to an independent local legislature ) , only the first of the two recommendations was implemented in 1841 . For the first seven years , the government was led by an appointed governor general accountable only to the British Crown and the Queen 's Ministers . Responsible government was not to be achieved until the second LaFontaine-Baldwin ministry in 1849 , when Governor General James Bruce , 8th Earl of Elgin agreed to request a cabinet be formed on the basis of party , effectively making the elected premier the head of the government and reducing the Governor General to a more symbolic role . The Province of Canada ceased to exist at Canadian Confederation on 1 July 1867 , when it was divided into the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec . Ontario included the area occupied by the pre-1841 British colony of Upper Canada , while Quebec included the area occupied by the pre-1841 British colony of Lower Canada ( which had included Labrador until 1809 , when Labrador was transferred to the British colony of Newfoundland ) .

At the same time , the upper house of the legislature , the Legislative Council , was abolished . Both were initially created by the Constitution Act of 1867 .

The cemetery was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2007 . The impetus for the creation of the 11-hectare ( 26-acre ) cemetery was the need for the provision of an Anglican burying ground for Quebec City 's primarily English language speaking , Anglican community , in the mid-1800s .

The rural cemetery movement mirrored changing attitudes toward death in the nineteenth century . Images of hope and immortality were popular in rural cemeteries in contrast to the puritanical pessimism depicted in earlier cemeteries . Statues and memorials included depictions of angels and cherubs as well as botanical motifs such as ivy representing memory , oak leaves for immortality , poppies for sleep and acorns for life . From their inception , they were intended as civic institutions designed for public use . Before the widespread development of public parks , the rural cemetery provided a place for the general public to enjoy outdoor recreation amidst art and sculpture previously available only for the wealthy . Thoughts about rural cemeteries evolved toward the end of the 1800s due to the high cost of maintenance , development of true public parks and perceived disorderliness of appearance due to independent ownership of family burial plots and different grave markers . Lawn cemeteries became instead an attractive design .",

  "/wiki/Protestantism": "Protestantism is the second-largest form of Christianity with a total of 800 million to 1 billion adherents worldwide or about 37% of all Christians . [ a ] It originated with the 16th century Reformation , [ b ] a movement against what its followers perceived to be errors in the Catholic Church . Protestants reject the Roman Catholic doctrine of papal supremacy and sacraments , but disagree among themselves regarding the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist . They emphasize the priesthood of all believers , justification by faith alone ( sola fide ) rather than also by good works , and the highest authority of the Bible alone ( rather than also with sacred tradition ) in faith and morals ( sola scriptura ) . The five solae summarise basic theological differences in opposition to the Roman Catholic Church . Protestantism began in Germany [ c ] in 1517 when Martin Luther published his Ninety-five Theses as a reaction against abuses in the sale of indulgences by the Roman Catholic Church , which purported to offer the remission of the temporal punishment of sins to their purchasers . However , the term derives from the letter of protestation from German Lutheran princes in 1529 against an edict of the Diet of Speyer condemning the teachings of Martin Luther as heretical . Although there were earlier breaks and attempts to reform the Roman Catholic Church - notably by Peter Waldo , John Wycliffe , and Jan Hus - only Luther succeeded in sparking a wider , lasting , and modern movement . In the 16th century , Lutheranism spread from Germany [ d ] into Denmark , Norway , Sweden , Finland , Latvia , Estonia , and Iceland . Reformed ( or Calvinist ) denominations spread in Germany , [ e ] Hungary , the Netherlands , Scotland , Switzerland and France by reformers such as John Calvin , Huldrych Zwingli , and John Knox . The political separation of the Church of England from the pope under King Henry VIII began Anglicanism , bringing England and Wales into this broad Reformation movement . [ f ] Protestants have developed their own culture , with major contributions in education , the humanities and sciences , the political and social order , the economy and the arts , and many other fields ."
