It opened on October 4 , 1975 , and the last commercial passenger flight took off on October 31 , 2004 . The main role of the airport today is cargo flights , but it is also home to MEDEVAC and general aviation flights , and is a manufacturing base for Bombardier Aerospace and Airbus Canada , where final assembly of regional jet ( CRJ700 , CRJ900 and CRJ1000 ) aircraft and the Airbus A220 ( formerly Bombardier CSeries ) is conducted . The former passenger terminal apron is now a racing course , and the terminal building was demolished in 2016 . Prior to the demolition of the terminal , International Aerocity of Mirabel was classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and was staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency ( CBSA ) . A smaller AOE is still available at the H\u00e9libellule FBO It was one of two airports in Canada with sufficient right-of-way that can be expanded to accommodate 50 million passengers per year , the other being Toronto Pearson International Airport . A lack of traffic meant that Mirabel was never expanded beyond its first phase . It is one of only two non-capital airports with fewer than 200,000 passengers a year to be part of the National Airports System . The airport was intended to replace the existing Dorval Airport as the eastern air gateway to Canada . Accordingly , from 1975 to 1997 , all international flights to and from Montreal ( except for flights to and from the United States ) were required to use Mirabel . However , Mirabel 's distant location , the lack of adequate transport links to urban centres and the continued operation of domestic flights from Dorval Airport made Mirabel very unpopular with travellers and airlines . It did not help that Montreal 's economy declined relative to that of Toronto during the 1970s and 1980s .",
