It was subsequently released by Acclaim Entertainment for nearly every home platform of the time . The game focuses on several characters of various intentions who enter a martial arts tournament with worldly consequences . It introduced many key aspects of the Mortal Kombat series , including the unique five-button control scheme and gory finishing moves called Fatalities . Mortal Kombat became a best-selling game and remains one of the most popular fighting games in the genre 's history , spawning numerous sequels and spin-offs over the following years and decades , beginning with Mortal Kombat II in 1993 , and together with the first sequel was the subject of a successful film adaptation in 1995 . However , it also sparked much controversy for its depiction of extreme violence and gore using realistic digitized graphics , resulting in the introduction of age-specific content descriptor ratings for video games .",
  "/wiki/Arcade_game": "An arcade game or coin-op game is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants , bars and amusement arcades . Most arcade games are video games , pinball machines , electro-mechanical games , redemption games or merchandisers . While exact dates are debated , the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s . Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s , the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home video game consoles such as the Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost . The Eastern Hemisphere retains a strong arcade industry .",

Interactive Entertainment ) . Mortal Kombat II was the second game in the Mortal Kombat series , improving the gameplay and expanding the mythos of the original Mortal Kombat , notably introducing more varied finishing moves ( including several Fatalities per character and new finishers , such as Babality and Friendship ) and several iconic characters , such as Kitana , Mileena , Kung Lao , Noob Saibot , and the series ' recurring villain , Shao Kahn . The game 's plot continues from the first game , featuring the next Mortal Kombat tournament set in the otherdimensional realm of Outworld , with the Outworld and Earthrealm representatives fighting each other on their way to challenge the evil emperor Shao Kahn . The game was an unprecedented commercial success and was acclaimed by most critics , receiving many annual awards and having been featured in various top lists in the years and decades to come , and also caused a major video game controversy due to the series ' continuous depiction of graphic violence . Its legacy includes spawning a spin-off game Mortal Kombat : Shaolin Monks and having the greatest influence on the 2011 reboot game Mortal Kombat , as well as inspiring numerous video game clones .",

The game avoids the tournament storyline of its predecessors , as various warriors instead fight against the returning Shao Kahn , who has resurrected his bride Sindel and started an invasion of Earthrealm . The third installment of the Mortal Kombat series retains the notorious extreme depictions of violence that defined the series . It also introduces new types of the finishing moves , including Animalities . Other features new to the series were combos , predefined sequences used to perform a series of consecutive attacks . A Run button was also added , allowing players to briefly dash toward the opponent , as were Kombat Kodes , an unlockable content system using various symbols that can be entered before two-player matches to achieve certain effects . Some characters from the previous games returned and new characters were introduced into the series . Mortal Kombat 3 notably omitted popular characters from previous games , some of whom were added in an update , Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 , released later in 1995 .

It was first released on 3 December 1994 in Japan , on 9 September 1995 in North America , on 29 September 1995 in Europe , and on 15 November 1995 in Australia , and was the first of the PlayStation lineup of video game consoles . As a fifth generation console , the PlayStation primarily competed with the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn . The PlayStation was the first computer entertainment platform to ship over 100 million units , which it had reached nine years after its initial launch . In July 2000 , a redesigned , slim version called the PS one was released , replacing the original grey console and named appropriately to avoid confusion with its successor , the PlayStation 2 . The PlayStation 2 , which is backwards compatible with the PlayStation 's DualShock controller and games , was announced in 1999 and launched in 2000 . The last PS one units were sold in late 2006 to early 2007 shortly after it was officially discontinued , for a total of 102 million units shipped since its launch eleven years earlier . Games for the PlayStation continued to sell until Sony ceased production of both the PlayStation and PlayStation games on 23 March 2006 - over eleven years after it had been released , and less than a year before the debut of the PlayStation 3 . On 19 September 2018 , Sony unveiled the PlayStation Classic to mark the 24th anniversary of the original console . The new console is a miniature recreation of the original PlayStation , preloaded with 20 titles released on the original console , and was released on 3 December 2018 , the exact date the console was released in Japan in 1994 .",

Named for its 64-bit central processing unit , it was released in June 1996 in Japan , September 1996 in North America , and March 1997 in Europe and Australia . It was the last major home console to use the cartridge as its primary storage format until the Nintendo Switch in 2017 . The Nintendo 64 was discontinued in mid 2002 following the launch of its successor , the GameCube , in 2001 . Codenamed Project Reality , the Nintendo 64 design was mostly complete by mid-1995 , but its launch was delayed until 1996 , when Time named it Machine of the Year . It was launched with three games : Super Mario 64 , Pilotwings 64 ( worldwide ) and Saiky\u014d Habu Sh\u014dgi ( exclusive to Japan ) . As part of the fifth generation of gaming , the system competed primarily with the PlayStation and the Sega Saturn . The suggested retail price at its United States launch was US $ 199.99 , and 32.93 million units were sold worldwide . In 2015 , IGN named it the ninth-greatest video game console of all time .",

The successor to the successful Sega Genesis , the Saturn has a dual-CPU architecture and eight processors . Its games are in CD-ROM format , and its game library contains several arcade ports as well as original games . Development of the Saturn began in 1992 , the same year Sega 's groundbreaking 3D Model 1 arcade hardware debuted . The system was designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company Hitachi . Sega added another video display processor in early 1994 to better compete with Sony 's forthcoming PlayStation . The Saturn was initially successful in Japan , but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after its surprise May 1995 launch , four months before its scheduled release date . After the debut of the Nintendo 64 in late 1996 , the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S. , where it was discontinued in 1998 . Having sold 9.26 million units worldwide , the Saturn is considered a commercial failure . The failure of Sega 's development teams to release a game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series , known in development as Sonic X-treme , has been considered a factor in the console 's poor performance . Although the Saturn is remembered for several well regarded games , including Nights into Dreams , the Panzer Dragoon series , and the Virtua Fighter series , its reputation is mixed due to its complex hardware design and limited third-party support . Sega 's management has been criticized for its decisions during the system 's development and discontinuation .",
  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

The PlayStation version features live-action cutscenes ; the Nintendo 64 version of the game replaced the live-action cutscenes with still images of such , due to limited storage space on the cartridge .

The storyline involves the divine protector of Earth , Raiden , attempting to change the aftermath of the events of Armageddon by contacting his past self as he faces defeat at the hands of the evil emperor of Outworld , Shao Kahn .

However , in the year after the device 's successful launch , sales of the hardware and its bigger budget games stalled , threatening to end its lifespan . A concentrated effort to attract smaller independent developers in the West , combined with strong support from mid-level Japanese companies , helped keep the platform afloat . While this led to less diversity in its game library , it did garner strong support in JRPGs and visual novels , alongside a wealth of Western-developed indie games , leading it to become a moderate seller in Japan , and build a smaller , yet passionate userbase in the West .
