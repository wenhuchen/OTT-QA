  "/wiki/Combined_cycle": "A combined cycle power plant is an assembly of heat engines that work in tandem from the same source of heat , converting it into mechanical energy . On land , when used to make electricity the most common type is called a combined cycle gas turbine ( CCGT ) plant . The same principle is also used for marine propulsion , where it is called a combined gas and steam ( COGAS ) plant . Combining two or more thermodynamic cycles improves overall efficiency , which reduces fuel costs . The principle is that after completing its cycle in the first engine , the working fluid ( the exhaust ) is still hot enough that a second subsequent heat engine can extract energy from the heat in the exhaust . Usually the heat passes through a heat exchanger so that the two engines can use different working fluids . By generating power from multiple streams of work , the overall efficiency of the system can be increased by 50-60% . That is , from an overall efficiency of say 34% ( for a simple cycle ) , to as much as 64% ( for a combined cycle ) . This is more than 84% of the theoretical efficiency of a Carnot cycle . This can be done because heat engines can only use part of the energy from their fuel ( usually less than 50% ) . In an ordinary ( non-combined cycle ) heat engine the remaining heat ( i.e. , hot exhaust gas ) from combustion is wasted .",

Trigeneration or combined cooling , heat and power ( CCHP ) refers to the simultaneous generation of electricity and useful heating and cooling from the combustion of a fuel or a solar heat collector . The terms cogeneration and trigeneration can be also applied to the power systems generating simultaneously electricity , heat , and industrial chemicals - e.g. , syngas or pure hydrogen ( article : combined cycles , chapter : natural gas integrated power & syngas ( hydrogen ) generation cycle ) . Cogeneration is a more efficient use of fuel because otherwise-wasted heat from electricity generation is put to some productive use . Combined heat and power ( CHP ) plants recover otherwise wasted thermal energy for heating . This is also called combined heat and power district heating . Small CHP plants are an example of decentralized energy . By-product heat at moderate temperatures ( 100-180 \u00b0C , 212-356 \u00b0F ) can also be used in absorption refrigerators for cooling . The supply of high-temperature heat first drives a gas or steam turbine-powered generator . The resulting low-temperature waste heat is then used for water or space heating . At smaller scales ( typically below 1 MW ) a gas engine or diesel engine may be used . Trigeneration differs from cogeneration in that the waste heat is used for both heating and cooling , typically in an absorption refrigerator .",

During World War II , the Miri oil fields were destroyed by the Brooke government to sabotage Japanese operations in Southeast Asia but to no avail ; Miri town was the first landing point of Japanese troops in Borneo . The subsequent Japanese occupation led Miri to become a target of Allied air raids which caused the destruction of oil refinery facilities in Miri .
