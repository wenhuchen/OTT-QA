  "/wiki/UNISERVO": "The UNISERVO tape drive was the primary I/O device on the UNIVAC I computer . Its place in history is assured as it was the first tape drive for a commercially sold computer . The UNISERVO used metal tape : a 1\u20442-inch-wide ( 13 mm ) thin strip of nickel-plated phosphor bronze ( called Vicalloy ) 1200 feet long . These metal tape reels were very heavy . Data was recorded in eight channels on the tape ( six for the data value , one parity channel for error checking , and one timing channel ) at a density of 128 bits per inch . The tape could be moved at 100 inches per second , giving a nominal transfer rate of 12,800 characters per second . Data were recorded in fixed size blocks of 60 words of 12 characters each . Making allowance for the empty space between tape blocks , the actual transfer rate was around 7,200 characters per second . The UNISERVO supported both forward and backward modes on read or write operation . This offered significant advantages in data sorting and merging applications . The data transfers to/from the UNIVAC I processor were fully buffered in a one block dedicated memory , permitting instruction execution in parallel with tape movement and data transfer . The internal serial data path permitted inserting a tape data block into main memory in one instruction .",
  "/wiki/Nickel": "Nickel is a chemical element with the symbol Ni and atomic number 28 . It is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge . Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile . Pure nickel , powdered to maximize the reactive surface area , shows a significant chemical activity , but larger pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer forms on the surface and prevents further corrosion ( passivation ) . Even so , pure native nickel is found in Earth 's crust only in tiny amounts , usually in ultramafic rocks , and in the interiors of larger nickel-iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth 's atmosphere . Meteoric nickel is found in combination with iron , a reflection of the origin of those elements as major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis . An iron-nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth 's outer and inner cores . Use of nickel ( as a natural meteoric nickel-iron alloy ) has been traced as far back as 3500 BCE . Nickel was first isolated and classified as a chemical element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt , who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral , in the cobalt mines of Los , H\u00e4lsingland , Sweden . The element 's name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology , Nickel ( similar to Old Nick ) , who personified the fact that copper-nickel ores resisted refinement into copper . An economically important source of nickel is the iron ore limonite , which often contains 1-2% nickel . Nickel 's other important ore minerals include pentlandite and a mixture of Ni-rich natural silicates known as garnierite .",
  "/wiki/Phosphor_bronze": "Phosphor bronze is an alloy of copper with 0.5-11% of tin and 0.01-0.35% phosphorus . The tin increases the corrosion resistance and strength of the alloy . The phosphorus increases the wear resistance and stiffness of the alloy . These alloys are notable for their toughness , strength , low coefficient of friction , and fine grain . The phosphorus reduces the viscosity of the molten alloy , which makes it easier and cleaner to cast and reduces grain boundaries between crystallites . It was originally formulated by the Belgian Georges Montefiore-Levi .",

  "/wiki/IBM_7_track": "IBM 's first magnetic tape data storage devices , introduced in 1952 , use what is now generally known as 7 track tape . The magnetic tape is 1/2 wide and there are six data tracks plus one parity track for a total of seven parallel tracks that span the length of the tape . Data is stored as six-bit characters , with each bit of the character and the additional parity bit stored in a different track . These tape drives were mechanically sophisticated floor-standing drives that used vacuum columns to buffer long U-shaped loops of tape . Between active control of powerful reel motors and vacuum control of these U-shaped tape loops , extremely rapid start and stop of the tape at the tape-to-head interface could be achieved . When active , the two tape reels thus fed tape into or pulled tape out of the vacuum columns , intermittently spinning in rapid , unsynchronized bursts resulting in visually striking action . Stock shots of such vacuum-column tape drives in motion were widely used to represent the computer in films and television .",
  "/wiki/IBM_729": "The IBM 729 Magnetic Tape Unit was IBM 's iconic tape mass storage system from the late 1950s through the mid-1960s . Part of the IBM 7 track family of tape units , it was used on late 700 , most 7000 and many 1400 series computers . Like its predecessor , the IBM 727 and many successors , the 729 used 1/2 inch ( 12.7 mm ) magnetic tape up to 2400 feet ( 730 m ) long wound on reels up to 10\u00bd inch ( 267 mm ) diameter . To allow rapid tape acceleration ( and thus reduced seek/access times ) , long vacuum columns were placed between the tape reels and the read/write heads to absorb sudden increases in tape tension which would otherwise break the tape . Write protection was provided by a removable plastic ring in the back of the tape reel .",

It originated in a symposium sponsored by Byte magazine in November 1975 in Kansas City , Missouri to develop a standard for storage of digital microcomputer data on inexpensive consumer quality cassettes . One variation on the basic standard was CUTS , which was identical at 300 bit/s , but had an optional 1200 bit/s mode as well . CUTS was the default encoding used by several machine families , including those from Acorn and the MSX . The later added an even higher 2400 bit/s mode that was otherwise similar . CUTS ' 1200 bit/s mode was also the standard used for cross-platform BASICODE distribution . Although the KCS standard existed from the earliest days of the microcomputer revolution , it failed to prevent a proliferation of alternative encodings . Most home computers of the era used their own formats that were incompatible with KCS or each other .",
  "/wiki/Compact_Cassette": "The Compact Cassette or Musicassette ( MC ) , also commonly called the cassette tape or simply tape or cassette , is an analog magnetic tape recording format for audio recording and playback . It was developed by Philips in Hasselt , Belgium , and introduced in September 1963 . Compact Cassettes come in two forms , either already containing content as a prerecorded cassette ( Musicassette ) , or as a fully recordable blank cassette . Both forms are reversible by the user . The compact cassette technology was originally designed for dictation machines , but improvements in fidelity led the Compact Cassette to supplant the stereo 8-track cartridge and reel-to-reel tape recording in most non-professional applications . Its uses ranged from portable audio to home recording to data storage for early microcomputers . The first cassette player ( although mono ) designed for use in car dashboards was introduced in 1968 . Between the early 1970s and continuing through the 1990s , the cassette was one of the two most common formats for prerecorded music , first alongside the LP record and later the compact disc ( CD ) . Compact Cassettes contain two miniature spools , between which the magnetically coated , polyester-type plastic film ( magnetic tape ) is passed and wound . These spools and their attendant parts are held inside a protective plastic shell which is 4 by 2.5 by 0.5 inches ( 10 cm \u00d7 6.3 cm \u00d7 1.3 cm ) at its largest dimensions . The tape itself was commonly referred to as eighth-inch tape , supposedly 1\u20448 inch ( 3.17 mm ) wide , but it was slightly larger : 0.15 inches ( 3.81 mm ) . Two stereo pairs of tracks ( four total ) or two monaural audio tracks are available on the tape ; one stereo pair or one monophonic track is played or recorded when the tape is moving in one direction and the second ( pair ) when moving in the other direction .",

  "/wiki/Giant_magnetoresistance": "Giant magnetoresistance ( GMR ) is a quantum mechanical magnetoresistance effect observed in multilayers composed of alternating ferromagnetic and non-magnetic conductive layers . The 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Albert Fert and Peter Gr\u00fcnberg for the discovery of GMR . The effect is observed as a significant change in the electrical resistance depending on whether the magnetization of adjacent ferromagnetic layers are in a parallel or an antiparallel alignment . The overall resistance is relatively low for parallel alignment and relatively high for antiparallel alignment . The magnetization direction can be controlled , for example , by applying an external magnetic field . The effect is based on the dependence of electron scattering on the spin orientation . The main application of GMR is magnetic field sensors , which are used to read data in hard disk drives , biosensors , microelectromechanical systems ( MEMS ) and other devices . GMR multilayer structures are also used in magnetoresistive random-access memory ( MRAM ) as cells that store one bit of information . In literature , the term giant magnetoresistance is sometimes confused with colossal magnetoresistance of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic semiconductors , which is not related to the multilayer structure .",

  "/wiki/Digital_Data_Storage": "Digital Data Storage ( DDS ) is a computer data storage technology that is based upon the digital audio tape ( DAT ) format that was developed during the 1980s . DDS is primarily intended for use as off-line storage , especially for generating backup copies of working data . A DDS cartridge uses tape with a width of 3.81mm , with the exception of the latest formats , DAT-160 and DAT-320 , both which use 8mm wide tape . Initially , the tape was 60 meters ( 197 feet ) or 90 meters ( 295 ft. ) in length . Advancements in materials technology have allowed the length to be increased significantly in successive versions . A DDS tape drive uses helical scan recording , the same process used by a video cassette recorder ( VCR ) . Backward compatibility between newer drives and older cartridges is not assured ; the compatibility matrices provided by manufacturers will need to be consulted . Typically drives can read and write tapes in the prior generation format , with most ( but not all ) also able to read and write tapes from two generations prior . Notice in HP 's article that newer tape standards do not simply consist of longer tapes ; with DDS-2 , for example , the track was narrower than with DDS-1 . At one time , DDS competed against the Linear Tape-Open ( LTO ) , Advanced Intelligent Tape ( AIT ) , VXA , and Travan formats .
