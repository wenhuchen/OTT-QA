  "/wiki/Year": "A year is the orbital period of the Earth moving in its orbit around the Sun . Due to the Earth 's axial tilt , the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons , marked by change in weather , the hours of daylight , and , consequently , vegetation and soil fertility . In temperate and subpolar regions around the planet , four seasons are generally recognized : spring , summer , autumn , and winter . In tropical and subtropical regions , several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons ; but in the seasonal tropics , the annual wet and dry seasons are recognized and tracked . A calendar year is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth 's orbital period as counted in a given calendar . The Gregorian calendar , or modern calendar , presents its calendar year to be either a common year of 365 days or a leap year of 366 days , as do the Julian calendars ; see below . For the Gregorian calendar , the average length of the calendar year ( the mean year ) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days . The ISO standard ISO 80000-3 , Annex C , supports the symbol a ( for Latin annus ) to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days . In English , the abbreviations y and yr are commonly used . In astronomy , the Julian year is a unit of time ; it is defined as 365.25 days of exactly 86,400 seconds ( SI base unit ) , totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year . The word year is also used for periods loosely associated with , but not identical to , the calendar or astronomical year , such as the seasonal year , the fiscal year , the academic year , etc . Similarly , year can mean the orbital period of any planet ; for example , a Martian year and a Venusian year are examples of the time a planet takes to transit one complete orbit .",
  "/wiki/Month": "A month is a unit of time , used with calendars , which is approximately as long as a natural period related to the motion of the Moon ; month and Moon are cognates . The traditional concept arose with the cycle of Moon phases ; such months ( lunations ) are synodic months and last approximately 29.53 days . From excavated tally sticks , researchers have deduced that people counted days in relation to the Moon 's phases as early as the Paleolithic age . Synodic months , based on the Moon 's orbital period with respect to the Earth-Sun line , are still the basis of many calendars today , and are used to divide the year .",
  "/wiki/Day": "A day is approximately the period of time during which the Earth completes one rotation around its axis . A solar day is the length of time which elapses between the Sun reaching its highest point in the sky two consecutive times . Days on other planets are defined similarly and vary in length due to differing rotation periods , that of Mars being slightly longer and sometimes called a sol . In 1960 , the second was redefined in terms of the orbital motion of the Earth in the year 1900 , and was designated the SI base unit of time . The unit of measurement day , was redefined as 86,400 SI seconds and symbolized d. In 1967 , the second and so the day were redefined by atomic electron transition . A civil day is usually 86,400 seconds , plus or minus a possible leap second in Coordinated Universal Time ( UTC ) , and occasionally plus or minus an hour in those locations that change from or to daylight saving time . Day can be defined as each of the twenty-four-hour periods , reckoned from one midnight to the next , into which a week , month , or year is divided , and corresponding to a rotation of the earth on its axis . However , its use depends on its context ; for example , when people say 'day and night ' , 'day ' will have a different meaning : the interval of light between two successive nights , the time between sunrise and sunset ; the time of light between one night and the next . For clarity when meaning 'day ' in that sense , the word daytime may be used instead , though context and phrasing often makes the meaning clear . The word day may also refer to a day of the week or to a calendar date , as in answer to the question , On which day ? The life patterns ( circadian rhythms ) of humans and many other species are related to Earth 's solar day and the day-night cycle .",

It is bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south , while Cyprus is west across the Mediterranean Sea . Lebanon 's location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterland facilitated its rich history and shaped a cultural identity of religious and ethnic diversity . At just 10,452 km2 ( 4,036 mi2 ) , it is the smallest recognized sovereign state on the mainland Asian continent . [ nb 4 ] The earliest evidence of civilization in Lebanon dates back more than seven thousand years , predating recorded history . Lebanon was the home of the Canaanites/Phoenicians and their kingdoms , a maritime culture that flourished for almost three thousand years ( c. 3200-539 BC ) . In 64 BC , the region came under the rule of the Roman Empire , and eventually became one of the Empire 's leading centers of Christianity . In the Mount Lebanon range a monastic tradition known as the Maronite Church was established . As the Arab Muslims conquered the region , the Maronites held onto their religion and identity . However , a new religious group , the Druze , established themselves in Mount Lebanon as well , generating a religious divide that has lasted for centuries . During the Crusades , the Maronites re-established contact with the Roman Catholic Church and asserted their communion with Rome . The ties they established with the Latins have influenced the region into the modern era .",

Located in the northeast of the island of Ireland , Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland . In 2011 , its population was 1,810,863 , constituting about 30% of the island 's total population and about 3% of the UK 's population . Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement , the Northern Ireland Assembly ( colloquially referred to as Stormont after its location ) holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters , while other areas are reserved for the British government . Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in several areas , and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to put forward views and proposals with determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments . On 11 January 2020 , legislators in Northern Ireland formed a government for the first time since the Executive of the 5th Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed in January 2017 , following the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal . Northern Ireland was created in 1921 , when Ireland was partitioned between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 . Unlike Southern Ireland , which would become the Irish Free State in 1922 , the majority of Northern Ireland 's population were unionists , who wanted to remain within the United Kingdom . Most of these were the Protestant descendants of colonists from Great Britain . However , a significant minority , mostly Catholics , were nationalists who wanted a united Ireland independent of British rule . Today , the former generally see themselves as British and the latter generally see themselves as Irish , while a distinct Northern Irish or Ulster identity is claimed both by a large minority of Catholics and Protestants and by many of those who are non-aligned . For most of the 20th century , when it came into existence , Northern Ireland was marked by discrimination and hostility between these two sides in what First Minister of Northern Ireland , David Trimble , called a cold house for Catholics .",
  "/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army": "The Irish Republican Army ( IRA ; Irish : \u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann ) , also known as the Provisional Irish Republican Army ( Provisional IRA or Provos ) , was an Irish republican paramilitary organisation that sought to end British rule in Northern Ireland , facilitate Irish reunification and bring about an independent republic encompassing all of Ireland . It was the most active republican paramilitary group during the Troubles . It saw itself as the sole legitimate successor to the original IRA from the Irish War of Independence , and accordingly referred to itself simply as the Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) , or \u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann in Irish . It was designated a terrorist organisation in the United Kingdom and an illegal organisation in the Republic of Ireland . The Provisional IRA emerged in December 1969 , following a split within the previous incarnation of the IRA and the broader Irish republican movement . It was the minority faction in the split , while the majority continued as the Official IRA . The term provisional was chosen to mirror the 1916 Provisional Government of the Irish Republic , and also to designate it as temporary pending reorganisation of the movement . Although this reorganisation eventually happened in 1970 , the name stuck . The Troubles had begun shortly before when a largely Catholic , nonviolent civil rights campaign was met with violence from both Ulster loyalists and the Royal Ulster Constabulary ( RUC ) , culminating in the August 1969 riots and deployment of British troops . The IRA initially focused on defence of Catholic areas , but it began an offensive campaign in 1971 ( see timeline ) . The IRA 's primary goal was to force the United Kingdom to negotiate a withdrawal from Northern Ireland . It used guerrilla tactics against the British Army and RUC in both rural and urban areas .",

Belfast suffered greatly in the Troubles : in the 1970s and 1980s it was reported to be one of the world 's most dangerous cities , with a homicide rate around 31 per 100,000 . By the early 19th century , Belfast became a major port . It played a key role in the Industrial Revolution , becoming the biggest linen-producer in the world , earning it the nickname Linenopolis . By the time it was granted city status in 1888 , it was a major centre of Irish linen production , tobacco-processing and rope-making . Shipbuilding was also a key industry ; the Harland and Wolff shipyard , which built the RMS Titanic , was the world 's biggest shipyard . Belfast as of 2019 [ update ] has a major aerospace and missiles industry . Industrialisation , and the inward migration it brought , made Belfast Northern Ireland 's biggest city and it became the capital of Northern Ireland following the Partition of Ireland in 1922 .

As the seat of the United States federal government and several international organizations , Washington is an important world political capital . The city , located on the Potomac River bordering Maryland and Virginia , is one of the most visited cities in the world , with more than 20 million tourists annually . The signing of the Residence Act on July 16 , 1790 , approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River on the country 's East Coast . The U.S. Constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress , and the District is therefore not a part of any U.S. state . The states of Maryland and Virginia each donated land to form the federal district , which included the pre-existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria . The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital . In 1846 , Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia , including the city of Alexandria ; in 1871 , it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the District . Washington had an estimated population of 702,455 as of July 2018 [ update ] , making it the 20th most populous city in the United States .

  "/wiki/Official_Irish_Republican_Army": "The Official Irish Republican Army or Official IRA ( OIRA ; Irish : \u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann ) was an Irish republican paramilitary group whose goal was to remove Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom and create a workers ' republic encompassing all of Ireland . It emerged in December 1969 , shortly after the beginning of the Troubles , when the Irish Republican Army split into two factions . The other was the Provisional IRA . Each continued to call itself simply the IRA and rejected the other 's legitimacy . Unlike the Provisionals , the Officials did n't think that Ireland could be unified until the Protestant majority of Northern Ireland and Catholic minority of Northern Ireland were at peace with each other . The Officials were Marxist and worked to form a united front with other Irish communist groups , named the Irish National Liberation Front ( NLF ) . The Officials were called the NLF by the Provisionals and were sometimes nicknamed the Red IRA by others . It waged a limited campaign against the British Army , mainly involving shooting and bombing attacks on troops in urban working-class neighbourhoods . Most notably , it was involved in the 1970 Falls Curfew and carried out the 1972 Aldershot bombing . In May 1972 , it declared a ceasefire and vowed to limit its actions to defence and retaliation . By this time , the Provisional IRA had become the larger and more active faction . Following the ceasefire , the OIRA began to be referred to as Group B within the Official movement .",

  "/wiki/Ulster_Defence_Association": "The Ulster Defence Association ( UDA ) is an Ulster loyalist paramilitary group in Northern Ireland . It was formed in September 1971 as an umbrella group for various loyalist groups and undertook an armed campaign of almost twenty four years as one of the participants of the Troubles . Its declared goal was to defend Ulster Protestant loyalist areas and to combat Irish republicanism , particularly the Provisional Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) . In the 1970s , uniformed UDA members openly patrolled these areas armed with batons and held large marches and rallies . Within the UDA was a group tasked with launching paramilitary attacks ; it used the cover name Ulster Freedom Fighters ( UFF ) so that the UDA would not be outlawed . The British government outlawed the UFF in November 1973 , but the UDA itself was not proscribed as a terrorist group until August 1992 . The UDA/UFF were responsible for more than 400 deaths . The vast majority of its victims were Irish Catholic civilians , killed at random , in what the group called retaliation for IRA actions or attacks on Protestants . High-profile attacks carried out by the group include the Top of the Hill bar shooting , the Milltown massacre , the Sean Graham 's and James Murray 's bookmakers ' shootings , the Castlerock killings , killings of Paddy Wilson and Irene Andrews and the Greysteel massacre . Most of its attacks were in Northern Ireland , but from 1972 onward it also carried out bombings in the Republic of Ireland . The UDA/UFF declared a ceasefire in 1994 and ended its campaign in 2007 , but some of its members have continued to engage in violence . The other main Loyalist paramilitary group during the conflict was the Ulster Volunteer Force ( UVF ) .",
