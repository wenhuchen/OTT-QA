It is the largest city in the United States by total area , whose government is not consolidated with that of a county , parish or borough . Though primarily in Harris County , small portions of the city extend into Fort Bend and Montgomery counties , bordering other principal communities of Greater Houston such as Sugar Land and The Woodlands . The city of Houston was founded by land investors on August 30 , 1836 , at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou ( a point now known as Allen 's Landing ) and incorporated as a city on June 5 , 1837 . The city is named after former General Sam Houston , who was president of the Republic of Texas and had won Texas ' independence from Mexico at the Battle of San Jacinto 25 miles ( 40 km ) east of Allen 's Landing . After briefly serving as the capital of the Texas Republic in the late 1830s , Houston grew steadily into a regional trading center for the remainder of the 19th century . The arrival of the 20th century saw a convergence of economic factors which fueled rapid growth in Houston , including a burgeoning port and railroad industry , the decline of Galveston as Texas ' primary port following a devastating 1900 hurricane , the subsequent construction of the Houston Ship Channel , and the Texas oil boom . In the mid-20th century , Houston 's economy diversified as it became home to the Texas Medical Center - the world 's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions - and NASA 's Johnson Space Center , where the Mission Control Center is located . Houston 's economy since the late 19th century has a broad industrial base in energy , manufacturing , aeronautics , and transportation . Leading in healthcare sectors and building oilfield equipment , Houston has the second most Fortune 500 headquarters of any U.S. municipality within its city limits ( after New York City ) ."
