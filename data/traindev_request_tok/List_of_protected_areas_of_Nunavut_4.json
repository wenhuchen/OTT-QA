In addition , the wildlife sanctuary is home to barren-ground caribou ( Beverly and Bathurst herds ) , Arctic wolf , Arctic fox , wolverine , Arctic squirrel ( sicsic ) , barren ground grizzly bear and waterfowl .

Scientists believe the causes of this unusual proliferation of plants more common to subarctic areas include favorable fine-textured soils and climatic oasis effect , higher summer temperatures due to northward elevation fall and the absence of large lakes .
