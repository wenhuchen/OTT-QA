From paleontological and archaeological evidence , the genus Australopithecus apparently evolved in eastern Africa around 4.2 million years ago before spreading throughout the continent and eventually becoming extinct 1.9 million years ago ( or 1.2 million years ago if the species sometimes separated as Paranthropus are included ) . While none of the groups normally directly assigned to this group survived , Australopithecus does not appear to be literally extinct ( in the sense of having no living descendants ) as the Homo genus probably emerged from late Australopithecus species such as Australopithecus garhi , Australopithecus africanus and/or Australopithecus sediba . During that time , a number of australopithecine species emerged , including the afore-mentioned 3 species , Australopithecus afarensis , Australopithecus anamensis , A. bahrelghazali , and A. deyiremeda ( proposed ) . For some other hominid species of this time - A. robustus , A. boisei and A. aethiopicus - some debate exists whether they truly constitute members of the genus Australopithecus . If so , they would be considered 'robust australopiths ' , while the others would be 'gracile australopiths ' . However , if these more robust species do constitute their own genus , they would be under the genus name Paranthropus , a genus described by Robert Broom when the first discovery was made in 1938 , which makes these species P. robustus , P. boisei and P. aethiopicus . Occasional suggestions have been made ( by Cele-Conde et al 2002 and 2007 ) that A. africanus should also be moved to Paranthropus . Numerous researchers such as Leakey ( 2001 ) , Ward ( 2001 ) , White ( 2002 ) , Alemseged ( 2006 ) and Kimbel ( 2009 ) suggest that A. bahrelghazali is simply a western version of A. Afarensis and not a separate species . On the basis of craniodental evidence , Strait and Grine ( 2004 ) suggest that Australopithecus is paraphyletic and that A. anamensis and A. garhi should be assigned to new genera . Australopithecus species played a significant part in human evolution , with most scientists in the field believing the genus Homo was derived from Australopithecus at some time between three and two million years ago . In addition , they were the first hominids to possess certain genes , known as the duplicated SRGAP2 , which increased the length and ability of neurons in the brain .",

At 580,367 square kilometres ( 224,081 sq mi ) , Kenya is the world 's 48th largest country by total area . With a population of more than 47.6 million people , Kenya is the 29th most populous country . Kenya 's capital and largest city is Nairobi , while its oldest city and first capital is the coastal city of Mombasa . Kisumu City is the third largest city and also an inland port on Lake Victoria . Other important urban centres include Nakuru and Eldoret . Kenya is bordered by South Sudan to the northwest , Ethiopia to the north , Somalia to the east , Uganda to the west , Tanzania to the south , and the Indian Ocean to the southeast . According to archaeological dating of associated artifacts and skeletal material , the Cushites first settled in the lowlands of Kenya between 3,200 and 1,300 BC , a phase referred to as the Lowland Savanna Pastoral Neolithic . Nilotic-speaking pastoralists ( ancestral to Kenya 's Nilotic speakers ) started migrating from present-day southern Sudan into Kenya around 500 BC . European colonisation of Kenya began in the 19th century during the European exploration of the interior . Modern-day Kenya emerged from a protectorate established by the British Empire in 1895 and the subsequent Kenya Colony , which began in 1920 . Numerous disputes between the UK and the colony led to the Mau Mau revolution , which began in 1952 , and the subsequent declaration of independence in 1963 .",

A. ramidus , unlike modern hominids , has adaptations for both walking on two legs ( bipedality ) and life in the trees ( arboreality ) . However , it would not have been as efficient at bipedality as humans , nor arboreality as non-human great apes . Its discovery , along with Miocene apes , has reworked academic understanding of the chimpanzee-human last common ancestor from appearing much like modern day chimps , orangutans , and gorillas to being a creature without a modern anatomical cognate . The facial anatomy suggests that A. ramidus males were less aggressive than those of modern chimps , which is correlated to increased parental care and monogamy in primates . It has also been suggested that it was among the earliest of human ancestors to use some proto-language , possibly capable of vocalizing at the same level as a human infant . A. ramidus appears to have inhabited woodland and bushland corridors between savannas , and was a generalized omnivore .",

It shares borders with Eritrea to the north , Djibouti to the northeast , Somalia , and the de facto state of Somaliland to the east , Kenya to the south , South Sudan to the west and Sudan to the northwest . With over 109 million inhabitants , Ethiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world and the second-most populous nation on the African continent with a total area of 1,100,000 square kilometres ( 420,000 sq mi ) . Its capital and largest city is Addis Ababa , which lies a few miles west of the East African Rift that splits the country into the Nubian and Somali tectonic plates . Some of the oldest skeletal evidence for anatomically modern humans has been found in Ethiopia . It is widely considered as the region from which modern humans first set out for the Middle East and places beyond . According to linguists , the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations settled in the Horn region during the ensuing Neolithic era . Tracing its roots to the 2nd millennium BCE , Ethiopia 's governmental system was a monarchy for most of its history . Oral literature tells that the monarchy was founded by the Solomonic dynasty of the Queen of Sheba , under its first king , Menelik I . In the first centuries , the Kingdom of Aksum maintained a unified civilization in the region , followed by the Ethiopian Empire circa 1137 . During the late 19th-century Scramble for Africa , Ethiopia and Liberia were two nations that preserved their sovereignty from long-term colonisation by a European colonial power and many newly-independent nations on the continent subsequently adopted its flag colours . However , the country was later occupied by Italy in 1936 and became Italian Ethiopia ( part of Italian East Africa ) until it was liberated during World War II .",

  "/wiki/Australopithecus_anamensis": "Australopithecus anamensis is a hominin species that lived approximately between 4.2 and 3.8 million years ago and is the oldest known Australopithecus species . Nearly one hundred fossil specimens are known from Kenya and Ethiopia , representing over 20 individuals . It is usually accepted that A. afarensis emerged within this lineage . However , A. anamensis and A. afarensis appear to have lived side-by-side , and it is not fully settled whether the lineage that led to extant humans emerged in A. afarensis , or directly in A. anamensis . Fossil evidence determines that Australopithecus anamensis is the earliest hominin species in the Turkana Basin , but likely co-existed with afarensis towards the end of its existence . A. Anamensis and A. Afarensis may be treated as a single grouping . Preliminary analysis of the sole upper cranial fossil indicates A. anamensis had a smaller cranial capacity ( estimated 365-370 c.c . ) than A. afarensis . A. anamensis is the earliest known species of Australopithecus and the least studied because of lack of skeletal findings . The first fossils of the A. anamensis are dated to around 3.8 and 4.2 million years ago and were found in Kanapoi and Allia Bay in Northern Kenya . They are the earliest Australopithecus species , living during the Plio-Pleistocene era .",

  "/wiki/Annum": "A year is the orbital period of the Earth moving in its orbit around the Sun . Due to the Earth 's axial tilt , the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons , marked by change in weather , the hours of daylight , and , consequently , vegetation and soil fertility . In temperate and subpolar regions around the planet , four seasons are generally recognized : spring , summer , autumn , and winter . In tropical and subtropical regions , several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons ; but in the seasonal tropics , the annual wet and dry seasons are recognized and tracked . A calendar year is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth 's orbital period as counted in a given calendar . The Gregorian calendar , or modern calendar , presents its calendar year to be either a common year of 365 days or a leap year of 366 days , as do the Julian calendars ; see below . For the Gregorian calendar , the average length of the calendar year ( the mean year ) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days . The ISO standard ISO 80000-3 , Annex C , supports the symbol a ( for Latin annus ) to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days . In English , the abbreviations y and yr are commonly used . In astronomy , the Julian year is a unit of time ; it is defined as 365.25 days of exactly 86,400 seconds ( SI base unit ) , totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year . The word year is also used for periods loosely associated with , but not identical to , the calendar or astronomical year , such as the seasonal year , the fiscal year , the academic year , etc . Similarly , year can mean the orbital period of any planet ; for example , a Martian year and a Venusian year are examples of the time a planet takes to transit one complete orbit .",
  "/wiki/Hominin": "The Hominini , or hominins , form a taxonomic tribe of the subfamily Homininae ( hominines ) . Hominini includes the genus Homo ( humans ) , but excludes the genus Gorilla ( gorillas ) . As of 2020 , there is no consensus on whether it should include the genus Pan ( chimpanzees and bonobos ) , the question being closely tied to the complex speciation process connecting humans and chimpanzees and the development of bipedalism in proto-humans . The tribe was originally introduced by John Edward Gray ( 1824 ) , long before any details on the speciation of Pan and Homo were known . Gray 's tribe Hominini by definition includes both Pan and Homo . This definition is still adhered to in the proposal by Mann and Weiss ( 1996 ) , which divides Hominini into three subtribes , Panina ( containing Pan ) , Hominina ( homininans , containing Homo humans ) , and Australopithecina ( containing several extinct australopithecine genera ) . Alternatively , Hominini is taken to exclude Pan . In this case , Panini ( panins , Delson 1977 ) may be used to refer to the tribe containing Pan as its only genus . Minority dissenting nomenclatures include Gorilla in Hominini and Pan in Homo ( Goodman et al . 1998 ) , or both Pan and Gorilla in Homo ( Watson et al . 2001 ) .",

Mount Kilimanjaro , Africa 's highest mountain , is in northeastern Tanzania . Many important hominid fossils have been found in Tanzania , such as 6-million-year-old Pliocene hominid fossils . The genus Australopithecus ranged all over Africa 4 to 2 million years ago ; and the oldest remains of the genus Homo are found near Lake Olduvai . Following the rise of Homo erectus 1.8 million years ago , humanity spread all over the Old World , and later in the New World and Australia under the species Homo sapiens . Homo sapiens also overtook Africa and absorbed the older archaic species and subspecies of humanity . One of the oldest known ethnic groups still existing , the Hadzabe , appears to have originated in Tanzania , and their oral history recalls ancestors who were tall and were the first to use fire , medicine , and lived in caves , much like Homo erectus or Homo heidelbergensis who lived in the same region before them . Later in the Stone and Bronze Age , prehistoric migrations into Tanzania included Southern Cushitic speakers who moved south from present-day Ethiopia ; Eastern Cushitic people who moved into Tanzania from north of Lake Turkana about 2,000 and 4,000 years ago ; and the Southern Nilotes , including the Datoog , who originated from the present-day South Sudan-Ethiopia border region between 2,900 and 2,400 years ago . : page 18 These movements took place at about the same time as the settlement of the Mashariki Bantu from West Africa in the Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika areas .

Two of these languages are of European origin : Afrikaans developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most coloured and white South Africans ; English reflects the legacy of British colonialism , and is commonly used in public and commercial life , though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language . The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'\u00e9tat , and regular elections have been held for almost a century . However , the vast majority of black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994 . During the 20th century , the black majority sought to claim more rights from the dominant white minority , with this struggle playing a large role in the country 's recent history and politics .",
  "/wiki/Ronald_J._Clarke": "Ronald J. Clarke is a paleoanthropologist most notable for the discovery of Little Foot , an extraordinarily complete skeleton of Australopithecus , in the Sterkfontein Caves . A more technical description of various aspects of his description of the Australopithecus skeleton was published in the Journal of Quaternary Science . He also discovered the Homo ergaster partial cranium SK 847 . He also played a role in the discovery of a new skeleton of Homo habilis related to Homo rudolfensis . He was associated with the University of the Witwatersrand , then joined Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main in Frankfurt , Germany where he continued his work excavating Little Foot . He later rejoined the University of the Witwatersrand 's Institute for Human Evolution , where he remains as of present .",
  "/wiki/Selam_(Australopithecus)": "Selam ( DIK-1/1 ) is the fossilized skull and other skeletal remains of a three-year-old Australopithecus afarensis female hominin , whose bones were first found in Dikika , Ethiopia in 2000 and recovered over the following years . Although she has often been nicknamed Lucy 's baby , the specimen has been dated at 3.3 million years ago , approximately 120,000 years older than Lucy ( dated to about 3.18 mya ) .",
  "/wiki/Zeresenay_Alemseged": "Zeresenay ( Zeray ) Alemseged ( born 4 June 1969 ) is an Ethiopian paleoanthropologist and was Chair of the Anthropology Department at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco , United States . He recently joined the faculty of the University of Chicago . He is best known for his discovery , on December 10 , 2000 , of Selam , also referred to as Lucys child , the almost-complete fossilized remains of a 3.3 million-year-old child of the species Australopithecus afarensis . The worlds oldest child , she is the most complete skeleton of a human ancestor discovered to date . Selam represents a milestone in our understanding of human and pre-human evolution and contributes significantly to our understanding of the biology and childhood of early species in the human lineage ; a subject about which we have very little information . Alemseged discovered Selam while working with the Dikika Research Project ( DRP ) , a multi-national research project , which he both initiated in 1999 and leads . The DRP has thus far made many important paleoanthropological discoveries and returns to the field each year to conduct further important research . Alemseged 's specific research centers on the discovery and interpretation of hominin fossil remains and their environments , with emphasis on fieldwork designed to acquire new data on early hominin skeletal biology , environmental context , and behavior .",
  "/wiki/Lucy_(Australopithecus)": "Lucy is the common name of AL 288-1 , several hundred pieces of bone fossils representing 40 percent of the skeleton of a female of the hominin species Australopithecus afarensis . In Ethiopia , the assembly is also known as Dinkinesh , which means you are marvelous in the Amharic language . Lucy was discovered in 1974 in Africa , at Hadar , a site in the Awash Valley of the Afar Triangle in Ethiopia , by paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History The Lucy specimen is an early australopithecine and is dated to about 3.2 million years ago . The skeleton presents a small skull akin to that of non-hominin apes , plus evidence of a walking-gait that was bipedal and upright , akin to that of humans ( and other hominins ) ; this combination supports the view of human evolution that bipedalism preceded increase in brain size . A 2016 study proposes that Australopithecus afarensis was also to a large extent tree-dwelling , though the extent of this is debated . Lucy acquired her name from the song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds by the Beatles , which was played loudly and repeatedly in the expedition camp all evening after the excavation team 's first day of work on the recovery site . After public announcement of the discovery , Lucy captured much public interest , becoming a household name at the time . Lucy became famous worldwide , and the story of her discovery and reconstruction was published in a book by Johanson . Beginning in 2007 , the fossil assembly and associated artifacts were exhibited publicly in an extended six-year tour of the United States ; the exhibition was called Lucy 's Legacy : The Hidden Treasures of Ethiopia . There was discussion of the risks of damage to the unique fossils , and other museums preferred to display casts of the fossil assembly . The original fossils were returned to Ethiopia in 2013 , and subsequent exhibitions have used casts .",

  "/wiki/Homo": "Homo ( from Latin hom\u014d , meaning 'man ' ) is the genus which emerged in the otherwise extinct genus Australopithecus that encompasses the extant species Homo sapiens ( modern humans ) , plus several extinct species classified as either ancestral to or closely related to modern humans ( depending on the species ) , most notably Homo erectus and Homo neanderthalensis . The genus is taken to emerge with the appearance of Homo habilis , just over two million years ago . Genus Homo , together with the genus Paranthropus is probably sister to A. africanus in the genus Australopithecus , which itself had previously split from the lineage of Pan , the chimpanzees . Homo erectus appeared about two million years ago and , in several early migrations , it spread throughout Africa ( where it is dubbed Homo ergaster ) and Eurasia . It was likely the first human species to live in a hunter-gatherer society and to control fire . An adaptive and successful species , Homo erectus persisted for more than a million years , and gradually diverged into new species by around 500,000 years ago . Homo sapiens ( anatomically modern humans ) emerged close to 300,000 to 200,000 years ago , most likely in Africa , and Homo neanderthalensis emerged at around the same time in Europe and Western Asia . H. sapiens dispersed from Africa in several waves , from possibly as early as 250,000 years ago , and certainly by 130,000 years ago , the so-called Southern Dispersal beginning about 70-50,000 years ago leading to the lasting colonisation of Eurasia and Oceania by 50,000 years ago . Both in Africa and Eurasia , H. sapiens met with and interbred with archaic humans . Separate archaic ( non-sapiens ) human species are thought to have survived until around 40,000 years ago ( Neanderthal extinction ) , with possible late survival of hybrid species as late as 12,000 years ago ( Red Deer Cave people ) ."
