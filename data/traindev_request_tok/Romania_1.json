  "/wiki/Development_regions_of_Romania": "The development regions of Romania ( Romanian Regiunile de dezvoltare ale Rom\u00e2niei ) refer to the eight regional divisions created in Romania in 1998 in order to better co-ordinate regional development as Romania progressed towards accession to the European Union . The development regions correspond to NUTS II-level divisions in European Union member states . Despite becoming increasingly significant in regional development projects , Romania 's development regions do not actually have an administrative status and do not have a legislative or executive council or government . Rather , they serve a function for allocating European Union PHARE funds for regional development , as well as for collection of regional statistics . They also co-ordinate a range of regional development projects and became members of the Committee of the Regions when Romania joined the EU on January 1 , 2007 .",
