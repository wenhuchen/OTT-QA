  "/wiki/Pampanga": "Pampanga ( Kapampangan : Lalau\u00edgan Kapamp\u00e1ngan ; Tagalog : Lalawigan ng Pampanga ) is a province in the Central Luzon region of the Philippines . Lying on the northern shore of Manila Bay , Pampanga is bordered by Tarlac to the north , Nueva Ecija to the northeast , Bulacan to the east , the Manila Bay to the central-south , Bataan to the southwest and Zambales to the west . Its capital is the City of San Fernando . Angeles City , while geographically within Pampanga , is classified as a first-class , highly urbanized city and is governed independently of the province . The name La Pampanga was given by the Spaniards , who encountered natives living along the banks ( pamp\u00e1ng ) of the Pampanga River . Its creation in 1571 makes it the first Spanish province on Luzon Island ( Cebu in Visayas is older as it was founded by the Spaniards in 1565 ) . The town of Villa de Bacolor in the province briefly served as the Spanish colonial capital when Great Britain invaded Manila as part of the Seven Years ' War . At the eve of the Philippine Revolution of 1896 , Pampanga was one of eight provinces placed under martial law for rebellion against the Spanish Empire ; it is thus represented on the Philippine national flag as one of the eight rays of the sun . Pampanga is served by Clark International Airport ( formerly Diosdado Macapagal International Airport ) , which is in Clark Freeport Zone , some 16 kilometres ( 9.9 mi ) north of the provincial capital . The province is home to two Philippine Air Force airbases : Basa Air Base in Floridablanca and the former United States Clark Air Base in Angeles City . Due to its growing population and developments , the Clark Global City is now developed and is located in Clark Freeport Zone . By 2015 , the province has 2,198,110 inhabitants , while it has 1,079,532 registered voters ."
