The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south . Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived on two major river systems , what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system . A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson 's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert 's Land . During the next 200 years , communities continued to grow and evolve , with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg . The assertion of M\u00e9tis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba . There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the M\u00e9tis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion .
