  "/wiki/Atom_probe": "The atom probe was introduced at the 14th Field Emission Symposium in 1967 by Erwin Wilhelm M\u00fcller and J . A. Panitz . It combined a field ion microscope with a mass spectrometer having a single particle detection capability and , for the first time , an instrument could . determine the nature of one single atom seen on a metal surface and selected from neighboring atoms at the discretion of the observer . Atom probes are unlike conventional optical or electron microscopes , in that the magnification effect comes from the magnification provided by a highly curved electric field , rather than by the manipulation of radiation paths . The method is destructive in nature removing ions from a sample surface in order to image and identify them , generating magnifications sufficient to observe individual atoms as they are removed from the sample surface . Through coupling of this magnification method with time of flight mass spectrometry , ions evaporated by application of electric pulses can have their mass-to-charge ratio computed . Through successive evaporation of material , layers of atoms are removed from a specimen , allowing for probing not only of the surface , but also through the material itself . Computer methods are used to rebuild a three-dimensional view of the sample , prior to it being evaporated , providing atomic scale information on the structure of a sample , as well as providing the type atomic species information . The instrument allows the three-dimensional reconstruction of up to billions of atoms from a sharp tip ( corresponding to specimen volumes of 10,000-10,000,000 nm3 ) .",
  "/wiki/Visible_spectrum": "The visible spectrum is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye . Electromagnetic radiation in this range of wavelengths is called visible light or simply light . A typical human eye will respond to wavelengths from about 380 to 740 nanometers . In terms of frequency , this corresponds to a band in the vicinity of 430-770 THz . The spectrum does not contain all the colors that the human eyes and brain can distinguish . Unsaturated colors such as pink , or purple variations like magenta , for example , are absent because they can only be made from a mix of multiple wavelengths . Colors containing only one wavelength are also called pure colors or spectral colors . Visible wavelengths pass largely unattenuated through the Earth 's atmosphere via the optical window region of the electromagnetic spectrum . An example of this phenomenon is when clean air scatters blue light more than red light , and so the midday sky appears blue ( apart from the area around the sun which appears white because the light is not scattered as much ) . The optical window is also referred to as the visible window because it overlaps the human visible response spectrum . The near infrared ( NIR ) window lies just out of the human vision , as well as the medium wavelength infrared ( MWIR ) window , and the long wavelength or far infrared ( LWIR or FIR ) window , although other animals may experience them .",
  "/wiki/Spectral_imaging": "Spectral imaging is imaging that uses multiple bands across the electromagnetic spectrum . While an ordinary camera captures light across three wavelength bands in the visible spectrum , red , green , and blue ( RGB ) , spectral imaging encompasses a wide variety of techniques that go beyond RGB . Spectral imaging may use the infrared , the visible spectrum , the ultraviolet , x-rays , or some combination of the above . It may include the acquisition of image data in visible and non-visible bands simultaneously , illumination from outside the visible range , or the use of optical filters to capture a specific spectral range . It is also possible to capture hundreds of wavelength bands for each pixel in an image . Multispectral imaging captures a small number of spectral bands , typically three to fifteen , through the use of varying filters and illumination . Many off-the-shelf RGB cameras will detect a small amount of Near-Infrared ( NIR ) light . A scene may be illuminated with NIR light , and , simultaneously , an infrared-passing filter may be used on the camera to ensure that visible light is blocked and only NIR is captured in the image . Industrial , military , and scientific work , however , uses sensors built for the purpose . Hyperspectral imaging is another subcategory of spectral imaging , which combines spectroscopy and digital photography . In hyperspectral imaging , a complete spectrum or some spectral information ( such as the Doppler shift or Zeeman splitting of a spectral line ) is collected at every pixel in an image plane . A hyperspectral camera uses special hardware to capture hundreds of wavelength bands for each pixel , which can be interpreted as a complete spectrum .",

  "/wiki/Laser_scanning_confocal_microscopy": "Confocal microscopy , most frequently confocal laser scanning microscopy ( CLSM ) or laser confocal scanning microscopy ( LCSM ) , is an optical imaging technique for increasing optical resolution and contrast of a micrograph by means of using a spatial pinhole to block out-of-focus light in image formation . Capturing multiple two-dimensional images at different depths in a sample enables the reconstruction of three-dimensional structures ( a process known as optical sectioning ) within an object . This technique is used extensively in the scientific and industrial communities and typical applications are in life sciences , semiconductor inspection and materials science . Light travels through the sample under a conventional microscope as far into the specimen as it can penetrate , while a confocal microscope only focuses a smaller beam of light at one narrow depth level at a time . The CLSM achieves a controlled and highly limited depth of focus .",

CryoET is a specialized application of transmission electron cryomicroscopy ( CryoTEM ) in which samples are imaged as they are tilted , resulting in a series of 2D images that can be combined to produce a 3D reconstruction , similar to a CT scan of the human body . In contrast to other electron tomography techniques , samples are immobilized in non-crystalline ( vitreous ) ice and imaged under cryogenic conditions ( < \u2212150 \u00b0C ) , allowing them to be imaged without dehydration or chemical fixation , which could otherwise disrupt or distort biological structures .",
  "/wiki/Cryogenic_transmission_electron_microscopy": "Transmission electron cryomicroscopy ( CryoTEM ) , commonly known as cryo-EM , is a form of cryogenic electron microscopy , more specifically a type of transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) where the sample is studied at cryogenic temperatures ( generally liquid-nitrogen temperatures ) . Cryo-EM is gaining popularity in structural biology . The utility of transmission electron cryomicroscopy stems from the fact that it allows the observation of specimens that have not been stained or fixed in any way , showing them in their native environment . This is in contrast to X-ray crystallography , which requires crystallizing the specimen , which can be difficult , and placing them in non-physiological environments , which can occasionally lead to functionally irrelevant conformational changes . Recent advances in detector technology and software algorithms have allowed for the determination of macromolecular structures at near-atomic resolution by cryo-EM . These include viruses , ribosomes , mitochondria , ion channels , and enzyme complexes . As of 2018 , cryo-EM can be applied to structures as small as hemoglobin ( 64 kDa ) and with resolutions up to 1.8 \u00c5. Cryo-EM structures currently represent just over 2.5% of structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank , although this number is rapidly increasing as more and more cryo-EM structures are published each year . An application of cryo-EM is cryo-electron tomography ( cryo-ET ) , where a 3D reconstruction of the sample is created from tilted 2D images .",
  "/wiki/Electrical_capacitance_tomography": "Electrical capacitance tomography ( ECT ) is a method for determination of the dielectric permittivity distribution in the interior of an object from external capacitance measurements . It is a close relative of electrical impedance tomography and is proposed as a method for industrial process monitoring , although it has yet to see widespread use . Potential applications include the measurement of flow of fluids in pipes and measurement of the concentration of one fluid in another , or the distribution of a solid in a fluid . Although capacitance sensing methods were in widespread use the idea of using capacitance measurement to form images is attributed to Maurice Beck and co-workers at UMIST in the 1980s . Although usually called tomography , the technique differs from conventional tomographic methods , in which high resolution images are formed of slices of a material . The measurement electrodes , which are metallic plates , must be sufficiently large to give a measureable change in capacitance . This means that very few electrodes are used and eight or twelve electrodes is common . An N-electrode system can only provide N ( N\u22121 ) /2 independent measurements . This means that the technique is limited to producing very low resolution images of approximate slices . However , ECT is fast , and relatively inexpensive .",
  "/wiki/Electrical_capacitance": "Capacitance is the ratio of the change in electric charge of a system , to the corresponding change in its electric potential . There are two closely related notions of capacitance : self capacitance and mutual capacitance . Any object that can be electrically charged exhibits self capacitance . A material with a large self capacitance holds more electric charge at a given voltage than one with low capacitance . The notion of mutual capacitance is particularly important for understanding the operations of the capacitor , one of the three elementary linear electronic components ( along with resistors and inductors ) . The capacitance is a function only of the geometry of the design ( e.g . area of the plates and the distance between them ) and the permittivity of the dielectric material between the plates of the capacitor . For many dielectric materials , the permittivity and thus the capacitance , is independent of the potential difference between the conductors and the total charge on them . The SI unit of capacitance is the farad ( symbol : F ) , named after the English physicist Michael Faraday . A 1 farad capacitor , when charged with 1 coulomb of electrical charge , has a potential difference of 1 volt between its plates . The reciprocal of capacitance is called elastance .",
  "/wiki/Electrical_capacitance_volume_tomography": "Electrical capacitance volume tomography ( ECVT ) is a non-invasive 3D imaging technology applied primarily to multiphase flows . It was first introduced by W. Warsito , Q. Marashdeh , and L.-S . Fan as an extension of the conventional electrical capacitance tomography ( ECT ) . In conventional ECT , sensor plates are distributed around a surface of interest . Measured capacitance between plate combinations is used to reconstruct 2D images ( tomograms ) of material distribution . In ECT , the fringing field from the edges of the plates is viewed as a source of distortion to the final reconstructed image and is thus mitigated by guard electrodes . ECVT exploits this fringing field and expands it through 3D sensor designs that deliberately establish an electric field variation in all three dimensions . The image reconstruction algorithms are similar in nature to ECT ; nevertheless , the reconstruction problem in ECVT is more complicated . The sensitivity matrix of an ECVT sensor is more ill-conditioned and the overall reconstruction problem is more ill-posed compared to ECT . The ECVT approach to sensor design allows direct 3D imaging of the outrounded geometry . This is different than 3D-ECT that relies on stacking images from individual ECT sensors . 3D-ECT can also be accomplished by stacking frames from a sequence of time intervals of ECT measurements .",

If the electrodes are suspended in the boreholes , deeper sections can be investigated . It is closely related to the medical imaging technique electrical impedance tomography ( EIT ) , and mathematically is the same inverse problem . In contrast to medical EIT , however , ERT is essentially a direct current method . A related geophysical method , induced polarization ( or spectral induced polarization ) , measures the transient response and aims to determine the subsurface chargeability properties .",
  "/wiki/Electrical_resistivity": "Electrical resistivity ( also called specific electrical resistance or volume resistivity ) and its inverse , electrical conductivity , is a fundamental property of a material that quantifies how strongly it resists or conducts electric current . A low resistivity indicates a material that readily allows electric current . Resistivity is commonly represented by the Greek letter \u03c1 ( rho ) . The SI unit of electrical resistivity is the ohm-meter ( \u03a9\u22c5m ) . For example , if a 1 m \u00d7 1 m \u00d7 1 m solid cube of material has sheet contacts on two opposite faces , and the resistance between these contacts is 1 \u03a9 , then the resistivity of the material is 1 \u03a9\u22c5m . Electrical conductivity or specific conductance is the reciprocal of electrical resistivity . It represents a material 's ability to conduct electric current . It is commonly signified by the Greek letter \u03c3 ( sigma ) , but \u03ba ( kappa ) ( especially in electrical engineering ) and \u03b3 ( gamma ) are sometimes used . The SI unit of electrical conductivity is siemens per metre ( S/m ) .",
  "/wiki/Electrical_impedance_tomography": "Electrical impedance tomography ( EIT ) is a noninvasive type of medical imaging in which the electrical conductivity , permittivity , and impedance of a part of the body is inferred from surface electrode measurements and used to form a tomographic image of that part . Electrical conductivity varies considerably among various biological tissues ( absolute EIT ) or the movement of fluids and gases within tissues ( difference EIT ) . The majority of EIT systems apply small alternating currents at a single frequency , however , some EIT systems use multiple frequencies to better differentiate between normal and suspected abnormal tissue within the same organ ( multifrequency-EIT or electrical impedance spectroscopy ) . Typically , conducting surface electrodes are attached to the skin around the body part being examined . Small alternating currents will be applied to some or all of the electrodes , the resulting equi-potentials being recorded from the other electrodes ( figures 1 and 2 ) . This process will then be repeated for numerous different electrode configurations and finally result in a two-dimensional tomogram according to the image reconstruction algorithms incorporated . Since free ion content determines tissue and fluid conductivity , muscle and blood will conduct the applied currents better than fat , bone or lung tissue . This property can be used to reconstruct static images by morphological or absolute EIT ( a-EIT ) . However , in contrast to linear x-rays used in Computed Tomography , electric currents travel three dimensionally along the path of least resistivity . This means , that a part of the electric current leaves the transverse plane and results in an impedance transfer . This and other factors are the reason why image reconstruction in absolute EIT is so hard , since there is usually more than just one solution for image reconstruction of a three-dimensional area projected onto a two-dimensional plane . Mathematically , the problem of recovering conductivity from surface measurements of current and potential is a non-linear inverse problem and is severely ill-posed .",
  "/wiki/Electrical_impedance": "Electrical impedance is the measure of the opposition that a circuit presents to a current when a voltage is applied . The term complex impedance may be used interchangeably . Quantitatively , the impedance of a two-terminal circuit element is the ratio of the complex representation of a sinusoidal voltage between its terminals to the complex representation of the current flowing through it . In general , it depends upon the frequency of the sinusoidal voltage . Impedance extends the concept of resistance to AC circuits , and possesses both magnitude and phase , unlike resistance , which has only magnitude . When a circuit is driven with direct current ( DC ) , there is no distinction between impedance and resistance ; the latter can be thought of as impedance with zero phase angle . The notion of impedance is useful for performing AC analysis of electrical networks , because it allows relating sinusoidal voltages and currents by a simple linear law . In multiple port networks , the two-terminal definition of impedance is inadequate , but the complex voltages at the ports and the currents flowing through them are still linearly related by the impedance matrix . Impedance is a complex number , with the same units as resistance , for which the SI unit is the ohm ( \u03a9 ) . Its symbol is usually Z , and it may be represented by writing its magnitude and phase in the form |Z|\u2220\u03b8 . However , cartesian complex number representation is often more powerful for circuit analysis purposes . The reciprocal of impedance is admittance , whose SI unit is the siemens , formerly called mho .",

This information is collected and used to assemble a three-dimensional image of the target . For biological applications , the typical resolution of ET systems are in the 5-20 nm range , suitable for examining supra-molecular multi-protein structures , although not the secondary and tertiary structure of an individual protein or polypeptide .",
  "/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy": "Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM , an abbreviation which can also stand for the instrument , a transmission electron microscope ) is a microscopy technique in which a beam of electrons is transmitted through a specimen to form an image . The specimen is most often an ultrathin section less than 100 nm thick or a suspension on a grid . An image is formed from the interaction of the electrons with the sample as the beam is transmitted through the specimen . The image is then magnified and focused onto an imaging device , such as a fluorescent screen , a layer of photographic film , or a sensor such as a scintillator attached to a charge-coupled device . Transmission electron microscopes are capable of imaging at a significantly higher resolution than light microscopes , owing to the smaller de Broglie wavelength of electrons . This enables the instrument to capture fine detail - even as small as a single column of atoms , which is thousands of times smaller than a resolvable object seen in a light microscope . Transmission electron microscopy is a major analytical method in the physical , chemical and biological sciences . TEMs find application in cancer research , virology , and materials science as well as pollution , nanotechnology and semiconductor research , but also in other fields such as paleontology and palynology . TEM instruments boast an enormous array of operating modes including conventional imaging , scanning TEM imaging ( STEM ) , diffraction , spectroscopy , and combinations of these . Even within conventional imaging , there are many fundamentally different ways that contrast is produced , called image contrast mechanisms . Contrast can arise from position-to-position differences in the thickness or density ( mass-thickness contrast ) , atomic number ( Z contrast , referring to the common abbreviation Z for atomic number ) , crystal structure or orientation ( crystallographic contrast or diffraction contrast ) , the slight quantum-mechanical phase shifts that individual atoms produce in electrons that pass through them ( phase contrast ) , the energy lost by electrons on passing through the sample ( spectrum imaging ) and more . Each mechanism tells the user a different kind of information , depending not only on the contrast mechanism but on how the microscope is used - the settings of lenses , apertures , and detectors .",

It remains in use today in a few specialized applications , such as for acquiring orthopantomographs of the jaw in dental radiography .

  "/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional MRI ( fMRI ) measures brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow . This technique relies on the fact that cerebral blood flow and neuronal activation are coupled . When an area of the brain is in use , blood flow to that region also increases . The primary form of fMRI uses the blood-oxygen-level dependent ( BOLD ) contrast , discovered by Seiji Ogawa in 1990 . This is a type of specialized brain and body scan used to map neural activity in the brain or spinal cord of humans or other animals by imaging the change in blood flow ( hemodynamic response ) related to energy use by brain cells . Since the early 1990s , fMRI has come to dominate brain mapping research because it does not require people to undergo injections or surgery , to ingest substances , or to be exposed to ionizing radiation . This measure is frequently corrupted by noise from various sources ; hence , statistical procedures are used to extract the underlying signal . The resulting brain activation can be graphically represented by color-coding the strength of activation across the brain or the specific region studied . The technique can localize activity to within millimeters but , using standard techniques , no better than within a window of a few seconds . Other methods of obtaining contrast are arterial spin labeling and diffusion MRI . The latter procedure is similar to BOLD fMRI but provides contrast based on the magnitude of diffusion of water molecules in the brain . In addition to detecting BOLD responses from activity due to tasks/stimuli , fMRI can measure resting state fMRI , or taskless fMRI , which shows the subjects ' baseline BOLD variance .",
  "/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance": "Nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) is a method of physical observation in which nuclei in a strong constant magnetic field are perturbed by a weak oscillating magnetic field ( in the near field and therefore not involving electromagnetic waves ) and respond by producing an electromagnetic signal with a frequency characteristic of the magnetic field at the nucleus . This process occurs near resonance , when the oscillation frequency matches the intrinsic frequency of the nuclei , which depends on the strength of the static magnetic field , the chemical environment , and the magnetic properties of the isotope involved ; in practical applications with static magnetic fields up to ca . 20 tesla , the frequency is similar to VHF and UHF television broadcasts ( 60-1000 MHz ) . NMR results from specific magnetic properties of certain atomic nuclei . Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is widely used to determine the structure of organic molecules in solution and study molecular physics , crystals as well as non-crystalline materials . NMR is also routinely used in advanced medical imaging techniques , such as in magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . All isotopes that contain an odd number of protons and/or neutrons ( see Isotope ) have an intrinsic nuclear magnetic moment and angular momentum , in other words a nonzero nuclear spin , while all nuclides with even numbers of both have a total spin of zero . The most commonly used nuclei are 1H and 13C , although isotopes of many other elements can be studied by high-field NMR spectroscopy as well . A key feature of NMR is that the resonance frequency of a particular simple substance is usually directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field . It is this feature that is exploited in imaging techniques ; if a sample is placed in a non-uniform magnetic field then the resonance frequencies of the sample 's nuclei depend on where in the field they are located . Since the resolution of the imaging technique depends on the magnitude of the magnetic field gradient , many efforts are made to develop increased gradient field strength . The principle of NMR usually involves three sequential steps :",
  "/wiki/Hydraulic_tomography": "Hydraulic tomography ( HT ) is a sequential cross-hole hydraulic test followed by inversion of all the data to map the spatial distribution of aquifer hydraulic properties . Specifically , HT involves installation of multiple wells in an aquifer , which are partitioned into several intervals along the depth using packers . A sequential aquifer test at selected intervals is then conducted . During the test , water is injected or withdrawn ( i.e . a pressure excitation ) at a selected interval in a given well . Pressure responses of the subsurface are then monitored at other intervals at this well and also in other wells . This test produces a set of pressure excitation/response data of the subsurface . Once a given test has been completed , the pump is moved to another interval and the test is repeated to collect another set of data . The same procedure is then applied to the intervals at other wells . Afterward , the data sets from all tests are processed by a mathematical model to estimate the spatial distribution of hydraulic properties of the aquifer . These pairs of pumping and drawdown data sets at different locations make an inverse problem better posed , because each pair cross-validates the others such that the estimates become less non-unique . In other words , predictions of ground water flow based on the HT estimates will be more accurate and less uncertain than those based on estimates from traditional site-characterization approaches and model calibrations .",

Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications , including calculating forces and moments on aircraft , determining the mass flow rate of petroleum through pipelines , predicting weather patterns , understanding nebulae in interstellar space and modelling fission weapon detonation . Fluid dynamics offers a systematic structure - which underlies these practical disciplines - that embraces empirical and semi-empirical laws derived from flow measurement and used to solve practical problems . The solution to a fluid dynamics problem typically involves the calculation of various properties of the fluid , such as flow velocity , pressure , density , and temperature , as functions of space and time .

  "/wiki/Mid-infrared": "Infrared radiation ( IR ) , sometimes called infrared light , is electromagnetic radiation ( EMR ) with wavelengths longer than those of visible light . It is therefore generally invisible to the human eye , although IR at wavelengths up to 1050 nanometers ( nm ) s from specially pulsed lasers can be seen by humans under certain conditions . IR wavelengths extend from the nominal red edge of the visible spectrum at 700 nanometers ( frequency 430 THz ) , to 1 millimeter ( 300 GHz ) . Most of the thermal radiation emitted by objects near room temperature is infrared . As with all EMR , IR carries radiant energy and behaves both like a wave and like its quantum particle , the photon . Infrared radiation was discovered in 1800 by astronomer Sir William Herschel , who discovered a type of invisible radiation in the spectrum lower in energy than red light , by means of its effect on a thermometer . Slightly more than half of the total energy from the Sun was eventually found to arrive on Earth in the form of infrared . The balance between absorbed and emitted infrared radiation has a critical effect on Earth 's climate . Infrared radiation is emitted or absorbed by molecules when they change their rotational-vibrational movements . It excites vibrational modes in a molecule through a change in the dipole moment , making it a useful frequency range for study of these energy states for molecules of the proper symmetry . Infrared spectroscopy examines absorption and transmission of photons in the infrared range .

An MRI may yield different information compared with CT. Risks and discomfort may be associated with MRI scans . Compared with CT scans , MRI scans typically take longer and are louder , and they usually need the subject to enter a narrow , confining tube . In addition , people with some medical implants or other non-removable metal inside the body may be unable to undergo an MRI examination safely .

The nuclear magnetic moment varies from isotope to isotope of an element . For a nucleus of which the numbers of protons and of neutrons are both even in its ground state ( i.e . lowest energy state ) , the nuclear spin and magnetic moment are both always zero . In cases with odd numbers of either or both protons and neutrons , the nucleus often has nonzero spin and magnetic moment .

The muon flux at the Earth 's surface is such that a single muon passes through an area the size of a human hand per second . Since its development in the 1950s , muon tomography has taken many forms , the most important of which are muon transmission radiography and muon scattering tomography .

  "/wiki/Muon": "The muon ( /\u02c8mju\u02d0\u0252n/ ; from the Greek letter mu ( \u03bc ) used to represent it ) is an elementary particle similar to the electron , with an electric charge of \u22121 e and a spin of 1/2 , but with a much greater mass . It is classified as a lepton . As is the case with other leptons , the muon is not known to have any sub-structure - that is , it is not thought to be composed of any simpler particles . The muon is an unstable subatomic particle with a mean lifetime of 2.2 \u03bcs , much longer than many other subatomic particles . As with the decay of the non-elementary neutron ( with a lifetime around 15 minutes ) , muon decay is slow ( by subatomic standards ) because the decay is mediated by the weak interaction exclusively ( rather than the more powerful strong interaction or electromagnetic interaction ) , and because the mass difference between the muon and the set of its decay products is small , providing few kinetic degrees of freedom for decay . Muon decay almost always produces at least three particles , which must include an electron of the same charge as the muon and two neutrinos of different types . Like all elementary particles , the muon has a corresponding antiparticle of opposite charge ( +1 e ) but equal mass and spin : the antimuon ( also called a positive muon ) . Muons are denoted by \u03bc\u2212 and antimuons by \u03bc+ . Muons were previously called mu mesons , but are not classified as mesons by modern particle physicists ( see \u00a7 History ) , and that name is no longer used by the physics community . Muons have a mass of 105.66 MeV/c2 , which is about 207 times that of the electron . More precisely , it is :",
  "/wiki/Neutron_tomography": "Neutron tomography is a form of computed tomography involving the production of three-dimensional images by the detection of the absorbance of neutrons produced by a neutron source . It created a three-dimensional image of an object by combining multiple planar images with a known separation . It has a resolution of down to 25 \u03bcm . Whilst its resolution is lower than that of X-ray tomography , it can be useful for specimens containing low contrast between the matrix and object of interest ; for instance , fossils with a high carbon content , such as plants or vertebrate remains . Neutron tomography can have the unfortunate side-effect of leaving imaged samples radioactive if they contain appreciable levels of certain elements .",
  "/wiki/Neutron": "The neutron is a subatomic particle , symbol n or n0 , with no net electric charge and a mass slightly greater than that of a proton . Protons and neutrons constitute the nuclei of atoms . Since protons and neutrons behave similarly within the nucleus , and each has a mass of approximately one atomic mass unit , they are both referred to as nucleons . Their properties and interactions are described by nuclear physics . The chemical and nuclear properties of the nucleus are determined by the number of protons , called the atomic number , and the number of neutrons , called the neutron number . The atomic mass number is the total number of nucleons . For example , carbon has atomic number 6 , and its abundant carbon-12 isotope has 6 neutrons , whereas its rare carbon-13 isotope has 7 neutrons . Some elements occur in nature with only one stable isotope , such as fluorine . Other elements occur with many stable isotopes , such as tin with ten stable isotopes . Within the nucleus , protons and neutrons are bound together through the nuclear force . Neutrons are required for the stability of nuclei , with the exception of the single-proton hydrogen atom . Neutrons are produced copiously in nuclear fission and fusion ."
