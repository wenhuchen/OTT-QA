Questions about its authenticity as the Bell of Batoche ensued until April 2014 when Le Mus\u00e9e de Saint-Boniface Museum director acknowledged that there was enough evidence to conclude that the Bell of Batoche which is in the possession of the museum was actually the Bell of Frog Lake taken from the Frog Lake Mission in 1885 .",

This decision was made by Queen Victoria 's daughter Princess Louise , who was the wife of the Governor General of Canada , the Marquess of Lorne . Unlike other planned cities in the Canadian West , on its treeless flat plain Regina has few topographical features other than the small spring run-off , Wascana Creek . Early planners took advantage of such opportunity by damming the creek to create a decorative lake to the south of the central business district with a dam a block and a half west of the later elaborate 260-metre ( 850 ft ) long Albert Street Bridge across the new lake . Regina 's importance was further secured when the new province of Saskatchewan designated the city its capital in 1906 .",
