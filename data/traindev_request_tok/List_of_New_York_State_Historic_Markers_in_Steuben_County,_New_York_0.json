  "/wiki/Pontiac's_Rebellion": "Pontiac 's War ( also known as Pontiac 's Conspiracy or Pontiac 's Rebellion ) was launched in 1763 by a loose confederation of American Indian tribes , primarily from the Great Lakes region , the Illinois Country , and Ohio Country who were dissatisfied with British policies in the Great Lakes region following the French and Indian War ( 1754-1763 ) . Warriors from numerous tribes joined the uprising in an effort to drive British soldiers and settlers out of the region . The war is named after Odawa leader Pontiac , the most prominent of many Indian leaders in the conflict . The war began in May 1763 when American Indians were offended by the policies of British General Jeffrey Amherst and attacked a number of British forts and settlements . Eight forts were destroyed and hundreds of colonists were killed or captured , with many more fleeing the region . Hostilities came to an end after British Army expeditions in 1764 led to peace negotiations over the next two years . The Indians were unable to drive away the British , but the uprising prompted the British government to modify the policies that had provoked the conflict .",
