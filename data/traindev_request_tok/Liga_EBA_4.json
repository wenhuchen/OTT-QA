It is bordered by France ( Occitanie ) and Andorra to the north , the Mediterranean Sea to the east , and the Spanish autonomous communities of Aragon to the west and Valencia to the south . The official languages are Catalan , Spanish , and the Aranese dialect of Occitan . In the late 8th century , the counties of the March of Gothia and the Hispanic March were established by the Frankish kingdom as feudal vassals across and near the eastern Pyrenees as a defensive barrier against Muslim invasions . The eastern counties of these marches were united under the rule of the Frankish vassal , the count of Barcelona . In the 10th century the County of Barcelona became independent de facto . In 1137 , Barcelona and the Kingdom of Aragon were united by marriage under the Crown of Aragon . The de jure end of Frankish rule was ratified by French and Aragonese monarchs in the Treaty of Corbeil in 1258 . The Principality of Catalonia developed its own institutional system , such as courts ( parliament ) , and constitutions , becoming the base for the Crown of Aragon 's naval power , trade and expansionism in the Mediterranean .",
