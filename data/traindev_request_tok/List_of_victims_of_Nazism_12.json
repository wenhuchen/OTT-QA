It is located on the grounds of an abandoned munitions factory northeast of the medieval town of Dachau , about 16 km ( 10 mi ) northwest of Munich in the state of Bavaria , in southern Germany . After its opening by Heinrich Himmler , its purpose was enlarged to include forced labor , and , eventually , the imprisonment of Jews , German and Austrian criminals , and finally foreign nationals from countries that Germany occupied or invaded . The Dachau camp system grew to include nearly 100 sub-camps , which were mostly work camps or Arbeitskommandos , and were located throughout southern Germany and Austria . The camps were liberated by U.S. forces on 29 April 1945 . Prisoners lived in constant fear of brutal treatment and terror detention including standing cells , floggings , the so-called tree or pole hanging , and standing at attention for extremely long periods . There were 32,000 documented deaths at the camp , and thousands that are undocumented . Approximately 10,000 of the 30,000 prisoners were sick at the time of liberation . In the postwar years the Dachau facility served to hold SS soldiers awaiting trial . After 1948 , it held ethnic Germans who had been expelled from eastern Europe and were awaiting resettlement , and also was used for a time as a United States military base during the occupation . It was finally closed in 1960 . There are several religious memorials within the Memorial Site , which is open to the public .",
  "/wiki/Ludwig_Beck": "Ludwig August Theodor Beck ( 29 June 1880 - 20 July 1944 ) was a German general and Chief of the German General Staff during the early years of the Nazi regime in Germany before World War II . Ludwig Beck never became a member of the Nazi Party , though in the early 1930s he supported Adolf Hitler 's forceful denunciation of the Versailles Treaty and his belief in the need for Germany to rearm . Beck had grave misgivings regarding the Nazi demand that all German officers swear an oath of fealty to the person of Hitler in 1934 , though he believed that Germany needed strong government and that Hitler could successfully provide this so long as the F\u00fchrer was influenced by traditional elements within the military rather than by the SA and SS . In serving as Chief of Staff of the German Army between 1935 and 1938 , Beck became increasingly disillusioned , standing in opposition to the increasing totalitarianism of the Nazi regime and to Hitler 's aggressive foreign policy . Due to public foreign-policy disagreements with Hitler , Beck resigned as Chief of Staff in August 1938 . From this point Beck came to believe that Hitler could not be influenced for good , and that both Hitler and the Nazi party needed to be removed from government . He became a major leader within the conspiracy against Hitler , and would have served as head of state - with the title of either President or regent ( Reichsverweser ) , depending on the source - had the 20 July plot succeeded . However , when the plot failed , Beck was arrested . He reportedly made an unsuccessful attempt at suicide , and was then shot dead .",

Unlike other concentration camps it was located in a remote area , in the Fichtel Mountains of Bavaria , adjacent to the town of Flossenb\u00fcrg and near the German border with Czechoslovakia . The camp 's initial purpose was to exploit the forced labor of prisoners for the production of granite for Nazi architecture . In 1943 , the bulk of prisoners switched to producing Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter planes and other armaments for Germany 's war effort . Although originally intended for criminal and asocial prisoners , after Germany 's invasion of the Soviet Union , the camp 's numbers swelled with political prisoners from Eastern Europe . It also developed an extensive subcamp system that eventually outgrew the main camp . Before it was liberated by the United States Army in April 1945 , 89,964 to 100,000 prisoners passed through Flossenb\u00fcrg and its subcamps . Around 30,000 people died there , from malnutrition , overwork , or executions , or during the death marches . Some of the perpetrators were convicted in the Flossenb\u00fcrg trial , and the camp was repurposed for other uses before the opening of a memorial and museum in 2007 .",

Rommel was a highly decorated officer in World War I and was awarded the Pour le M\u00e9rite for his actions on the Italian Front . In 1937 he published his classic book on military tactics , Infantry Attacks , drawing on his experiences in that war . In World War II , he distinguished himself as the commander of the 7th Panzer Division during the 1940 invasion of France . His leadership of German and Italian forces in the North African campaign established his reputation as one of the most able tank commanders of the war , and earned him the nickname der W\u00fcstenfuchs , the Desert Fox . Among his British adversaries he had a reputation for chivalry , and his phrase war without hate has been used to describe the North African campaign . He later commanded the German forces opposing the Allied cross-channel invasion of Normandy in June 1944 . Rommel supported the Nazi seizure of power and Adolf Hitler , although his reluctant stance towards antisemitism and Nazi ideology and his level of knowledge of the Holocaust remain matters of debate among scholars . In 1944 , Rommel was implicated in the 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler . Because of Rommel 's status as a national hero , Hitler desired to eliminate him quietly instead of immediately executing him , as many other plotters were .

Mauthausen and its subcamps included quarries , munitions factories , mines , arms factories and plants assembling Me 262 fighter aircraft . In January 1945 , the camps contained roughly 85,000 inmates . The death toll remains unknown , although most sources place it between 122,766 and 320,000 for the entire complex .
