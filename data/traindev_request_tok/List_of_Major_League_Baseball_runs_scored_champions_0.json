He played in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) for the Philadelphia Phillies , Philadelphia Athletics ( twice ) , and Cleveland Naps between 1896 and 1916 . He managed the Naps from 1905 through 1909 . Lajoie was signed to the National League 's ( NL ) Phillies in 1896 . By the beginning of the twentieth century , however , the upstart American League ( AL ) was looking to rival the supremacy of the NL and in 1901 , Lajoie and dozens of former National League players joined the American League . National League clubs contested the legality of contracts signed by players who jumped to the other league but eventually , Lajoie was allowed to play for Connie Mack 's Athletics . During the season , Lajoie set the all-time American League single-season mark for the highest batting average ( .426 ) . : p.76 : p.88 One year later , Lajoie went to the Cleveland Bronchos where he would play until the 1915 season when he returned to play for Mack and the Athletics . While with Cleveland , Lajoie 's popularity led to locals electing to change the club 's team name from Bronchos to Napoleons ( Naps for short ) , which remained until after Lajoie departed Cleveland and the name was changed to Indians ( the team 's present-day name ) . Lajoie led the AL in batting average five times in his career and four times recorded the highest number of hits . During several of those years with the Naps he and Ty Cobb dominated AL hitting categories and traded batting titles with each other , most notably coming in 1910 , when the league 's batting champion was not decided until well after the last game of the season and after an investigation by American League President Ban Johnson . Lajoie in 1914 joined Cap Anson and Honus Wagner as the only major league players to record 3,000 career hits .",
