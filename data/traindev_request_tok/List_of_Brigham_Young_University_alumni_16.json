  "/wiki/Elizabeth_H._Boyer": "Elizabeth Hall Boyer ( born 1952 ) is an American fantasy author who produced a number of books in the 1980s and early 1990s . Her stories were deeply influenced by Norse mythology , and are set in a fantasy world whose climate and geography resembles that of the Scandinavia of Norse myths . While Norse mythology has been an influence on the fantasy genre , and many authors such as Tolkien and Lewis were influenced by these myths , Boyer 's books followed them much more closely . Her stories are characterized by light and dark elves , dwarves , trolls , sorcerers , ley lines , burial mounds , wizards , and so forth . Boyer tended to follow the Norse versions of these story elements closely without much deviation . Boyer 's early books are dominated by the theme of the heroic quest . Boyer attended Brigham Young University where she studied English literature and Scandinavian mythology . She was last reported living near Atlanta on a farm , and no longer writing . [ citation needed ] Her works have maintained a level of popularity through the years since their publication , however critics have described her later works to have been inferior efforts compared to the original Alfar series . The Skyla series in particular was noted as less ambitious and darker yet slow-paced , patchy , and tentative . Other critics attribute her lack of popular appeal ( compared to contemporaries like Tolkien and Lewis ) to a narrower thematic subtext . As an early contributor to the mass-market fantasy genre , Boyer 's fate is described as similar to her contemporary Niel Hancock in that her books required the reader to be interested in a specialized area of study , in this case , Norse mythology , in order to fully appreciate the books , and thus she did not find the sort of wide acceptance which would have given her a more prominent place as a pioneer in the genre .",
  "/wiki/Norse_mythology": "Norse mythology is the body of myths of the North Germanic peoples , stemming from Norse paganism and continuing after the Christianization of Scandinavia , and into the Scandinavian folklore of the modern period . The northernmost extension of Germanic mythology , Norse mythology consists of tales of various deities , beings , and heroes derived from numerous sources from both before and after the pagan period , including medieval manuscripts , archaeological representations , and folk tradition . The source texts mention numerous gods , such as the hammer-wielding , humanity-protecting thunder-god Thor , who relentlessly fights his foes ; the one-eyed , raven-flanked god Odin , who craftily pursues knowledge throughout the worlds and bestowed among humanity the runic alphabet ; the beautiful , sei\u00f0r-working , feathered cloak-clad goddess Freyja who rides to battle to choose among the slain ; the vengeful , skiing goddess Ska\u00f0i , who prefers the wolf howls of the winter mountains to the seashore ; the powerful god Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r , who may calm both sea and fire and grant wealth and land ; the god Freyr , whose weather and farming associations bring peace and pleasure to humanity ; the goddess I\u00f0unn , who keeps apples that grant eternal youthfulness ; the mysterious god Heimdallr , who is born of nine mothers , can hear grass grow , has gold teeth , and possesses a resounding horn ; the j\u00f6tunn Loki , who brings tragedy to the gods by engineering the death of the goddess Frigg 's beautiful son Baldr ; and numerous other deities . Most of the surviving mythology centres on the plights of the gods and their interaction with various other beings , such as humanity and the j\u00f6tnar , beings who may be friends , lovers , foes or family members of the gods . The cosmos in Norse mythology consists of Nine Worlds that flank a central tree , Yggdrasil . Units of time and elements of the cosmology are personified as deities or beings . Various forms of a creation myth are recounted , where the world is created from the flesh of the primordial being Ymir , and the first two humans are Ask and Embla . These worlds are foretold to be reborn after the events of Ragnar\u00f6k when an immense battle occurs between the gods and their enemies , and the world is enveloped in flames , only to be reborn anew . There the surviving gods will meet , and the land will be fertile and green , and two humans will repopulate the world . Norse mythology has been the subject of scholarly discourse since the 17th century , when key texts were brought to the attention of the intellectual circles of Europe . By way of comparative mythology and historical linguistics , scholars have identified elements of Germanic mythology reaching as far back as Proto-Indo-European mythology . During the modern period , the Romanticist Viking revival re-awoke an interest in the subject matter , and references to Norse mythology may now be found throughout modern popular culture .",

  "/wiki/Video_game": "A video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a two- or three-dimensional video display device such as a touchscreen , virtual reality headset or monitor/TV set . Since the 1980s , video games have become an increasingly important part of the entertainment industry , and whether they are also a form of art is a matter of dispute . The electronic systems used to play video games are called platforms . Video games are developed and released for one or several platforms and may not be available on others . Specialized platforms such as arcade games , which present the game in a large , typically coin-operated chassis , were common in the 1980s in video arcades , but declined in popularity as other , more affordable platforms became available . These include dedicated devices such as video game consoles , as well as general-purpose computers like a laptop , desktop or handheld computing devices . The input device used for games , the game controller , varies across platforms . Common controllers include gamepads , joysticks , mouse devices , keyboards , the touchscreens of mobile devices , or even a person 's body , using a Kinect sensor . Players view the game on a display device such as a television or computer monitor or sometimes on virtual reality head-mounted display goggles . There are often game sound effects , music and voice actor lines which come from loudspeakers or headphones . Some games in the 2000s include haptic , vibration-creating effects , force feedback peripherals and virtual reality headsets . Since the 2010s , the commercial importance of the video game industry has been increasing .",

In some nations , the news media are controlled by government intervention and are not fully independent . In others , the news media are independent of the government but instead operate as private industry motivated by profit . In addition to the varying nature of how media organizations are run and funded , countries may have differing implementations of laws handling the freedom of speech and libel cases . The proliferation of the Internet and smartphones has brought significant changes to the media landscape since the turn of the 21st century . This has created a shift in the consumption of print media channels , as people increasingly consume news through e-readers , smartphones , and other personal electronic devices , as opposed to the more traditional formats of newspapers , magazines , or television news channels . News organizations are challenged to fully monetize their digital wing , as well as improvise on the context in which they publish in print . Newspapers have seen print revenues sink at a faster pace than the rate of growth for digital revenues .",

  "/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time": "The Wheel of Time is a series of high fantasy novels written by American author James Oliver Rigney Jr. , under his pen name of Robert Jordan . Originally planned as a six-book series , The Wheel of Time spanned fourteen volumes , in addition to a prequel novel and two companion books . Jordan began writing the first volume , The Eye of the World , in 1984 , and it was published in January 1990 . Jordan died in 2007 while working on what was planned to be the twelfth and final volume in the series . He prepared extensive notes so another author could complete the book according to his wishes . Fellow fantasy author and long-time Wheel of Time fan Brandon Sanderson was brought in to complete the final book , but during the writing process , it was decided that the book would be far too large to be published in one volume and would instead be published as three volumes : The Gathering Storm ( 2009 ) , Towers of Midnight ( 2010 ) , and A Memory of Light ( 2013 ) . The series draws on numerous elements of both European and Asian mythology , most notably the cyclical nature of time found in Buddhism and Hinduism , the metaphysical concepts of balance and duality , and a respect for nature found in Taoism . Additionally , its creation story has similarities to Christianity 's Creator ( Light ) and Shai'tan , The Dark One ( Shaitan is an Arabic word that , in Islamic contexts , is used as a name for the Devil ) . It was also partly inspired by Leo Tolstoy 's War and Peace ( 1869 ) . The Wheel of Time is notable for its length , detailed imaginary world , well-developed magic system , and large cast of characters . The eighth through fourteenth books each reached number one on the New York Times Best Seller list . After its completion , the series was nominated for a Hugo Award .",

  "/wiki/Ph.D.": "A Doctor of Philosophy ( PhD , Ph.D. , or DPhil ; Latin philosophiae doctor or doctor philosophiae ) is the highest university degree that is conferred after a course of study by universities in most countries . PhDs are awarded for programs across the whole breadth of academic fields . As an earned research degree , those studying for a PhD are usually required to produce original research that expands the boundaries of knowledge , normally in the form of a thesis or dissertation , and defend their work against experts in the field . The completion of a PhD is often a requirement for employment as a university professor , researcher , or scientist in many fields . Individuals who have earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree may , in many jurisdictions , use the title Doctor ( often abbreviated Dr or Dr. ) with their name , although the proper etiquette associated with this usage may also be subject to the professional ethics of their own scholarly field , culture , or society . Those who teach at universities or work in academic , educational , or research fields are usually addressed by this title professionally and socially in a salutation or conversation . Alternatively , holders may use post-nominal letters such as Ph.D. , PhD , or DPhil ( depending on the awarding institution ) . It is , however , considered incorrect to use both the title and post-nominals at the same time . The specific requirements to earn a PhD degree vary considerably according to the country , institution , and time period , from entry-level research degrees to higher doctorates . During the studies that lead to the degree , the student is called a doctoral student or PhD student ; a student who has completed all their coursework and comprehensive examinations and is working on their thesis/dissertation is sometimes known as a doctoral candidate or PhD candidate ( see : all but dissertation ) . A student attaining this level may be granted a Candidate of Philosophy degree at some institutions or may be granted a master 's degree en route to the doctoral degree . Sometimes this status is also colloquially known as PhD ABD , meaning All But Dissertation .",
