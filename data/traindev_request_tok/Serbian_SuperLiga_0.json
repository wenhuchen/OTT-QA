He began playing football as a youngster with AIK Ba\u010dka Topola , and scored 68 goals from 76 first-team matches over a three-year period in the third tier of Yugoslav football . Military service took him to Bar in 2001 , where he was able to continue his goalscoring career with the local second-level club Mornar . A brief spell back in the third tier with Kolubara preceded his turning professional with First League side Red Star Belgrade in January 2003 . He spent time on loan at third-tier Spartak Subotica before making his Red Star debut later that year . Despite suggestions that his height , of 2.02 m ( 6 ft 7 1\u20442 in ) , made him better suited to sports other than football , \u017digi\u0107 ended the season as First League top scorer , domestic player of the year , league champion and scorer of the winning goal in the cup final . He won a second league-cup double in 2005-06 , a second player of the year award , and finished his three-year Red Star career with 70 goals from 109 appearances in all competitions . In August 2006 , \u017digi\u0107 signed for Spanish club Racing Santander ; his goals and his partnership with Pedro Munitis helped them achieve a mid-table finish in La Liga . He then moved to Valencia , but was unable to establish himself as a regular in the starting eleven . He spent the second half of the 2008-09 La Liga season back with Racing on loan , for whom he scored 13 goals in just 19 matches . \u017digi\u0107 joined Birmingham City of the Premier League in 2010 , and in his first season , he scored in their League Cup win .",
