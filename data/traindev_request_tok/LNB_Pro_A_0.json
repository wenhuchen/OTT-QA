The city is located in the heart of the former sovereign Principality of B\u00e9arn , of which it was the capital from 1464 . Bordered by the Gave de Pau , the city is located 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) from the Atlantic Ocean and 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) from Spain . This position gives it an exceptional panorama across the mountain range of the Pyrenees as well as on the hillsides of Juran\u00e7on . The name of Horizons Palois aims to protect this vision , in particular with the famous Boulevard des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es which extends for 1.8 kilometres ( 1.1 miles ) from the Ch\u00e2teau de Pau to the Parc Beaumont . Alphonse de Lamartine said : Pau has the world 's most beautiful view of the earth just as Naples has the most beautiful view of the sea . Archaeology has asserted that the site has been occupied at least since the Gallo-Roman era . [ note 1 ] Nevertheless , it was n't until the first half of the 12th century that the first mentions of Pau as a settlement are found . [ note 2 ] The town originated from the construction of its castle , likely from the 11th century by the Viscounts of B\u00e9arn , to protect the ford which was a strategic point for access to the Bearn valleys and then to Spain . The city thus took its name from the stockade ( pau in Bearnese ) which set the boundaries of the primitive castle . The village which was built around the castle took advantage of its strategic position as well as the protection of the Viscounts of B\u00e9arn to widely develop over the following centuries .
