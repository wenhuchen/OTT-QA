  "/wiki/Manchester": "Manchester ( /\u02c8m\u00e6nt\u0283\u025bst\u0259r/ ) is a major city and metropolitan borough in Greater Manchester , England , with a population of 547,627 as of 2018 ( 5th most populous English district ) . It lies within the United Kingdom 's second-most populous urban area , with a population of 2.9 million , and second-most populous metropolitan area , with a population of 3.3 million . It is fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south , the Pennines to the north and east , and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation . The local authority for the city is Manchester City Council . The recorded history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort of Mamucium or Mancunium , which was established in about AD 79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell . It is historically a part of Lancashire , although areas of Cheshire south of the River Mersey were incorporated in the 20th century . The first to be included , Wythenshawe , was added to the city in 1931 . Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township , but began to expand at an astonishing rate around the turn of the 19th century . Manchester 's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution , and resulted in it becoming the world 's first industrialised city . Manchester achieved city status in 1853 . The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894 , creating the Port of Manchester and directly linking the city to the Irish Sea , 36 miles ( 58 km ) to the west . Its fortune declined after the Second World War , owing to deindustrialisation , but the IRA bombing in 1996 led to extensive investment and regeneration .",

It is situated on a group of 118 small islands that are separated by canals and linked by over 400 bridges . The islands are located in the shallow Venetian Lagoon , an enclosed bay that lies between the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers ( more exactly between the Brenta and the Sile ) . In 2018 , 260,897 people resided in the Comune di Venezia , of whom around 55,000 live in the historical city of Venice ( centro storico ) . Together with Padua and Treviso , the city is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area ( PATREVE ) , which is considered a statistical metropolitan area , with a total population of 2.6 million . The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BC . The city was historically the capital of the Republic of Venice for a millennium and more , from 697 to 1797 . It was a major financial and maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance , and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto , as well as an important center of commerce - especially silk , grain , and spice , and of art from the 13th century to the end of the 17th . The city-state of Venice is considered to have been the first real international financial center , emerging in the 9th century and reaching its greatest prominence in the 14th century . This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history . After the Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna , the Republic was annexed by the Austrian Empire , until it became part of the Kingdom of Italy in 1866 , following a referendum held as a result of the Third Italian War of Independence . Venice has been known as La Dominante , La Serenissima , Queen of the Adriatic , City of Water , City of Masks , City of Bridges , The Floating City , and City of Canals .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_architecture": "Gothic architecture ( Latin : francigenum opus ) is a style that flourished in Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages . It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture . Originating in 12th-century France , it was widely used , especially for cathedrals and churches , until the 16th century . Its most prominent features included the use of the rib vault and the flying buttress , which allowed the weight of the roof to be counterbalanced by buttresses outside the building , giving greater height and more space for windows . Another important feature was the extensive use of stained glass and the rose window , to bring light and color to the interior . Another feature was the use of realistic statuary on the exterior , particularly over the portals , to illustrate biblical stories for the largely illiterate parishioners . Some key architectural features , such as the pointed arch and a decorative kind of rib vault , existed earlier outside Europe , and may have been derived from Islamic architecture . These features had both existed in Romanesque architecture , but they were used more extensively and in more innovative ways to make Gothic cathedrals higher , stronger , and filled with light . The first important example is generally considered to be the Basilica of Saint-Denis , near Paris , whose choir was reconstructed with Gothic rib vaults and large stained glass windows between 1140 and 1144 .",

The shape of the gable and how it is detailed depends on the structural system used , which reflects climate , material availability , and aesthetic concerns . A gable wall or gable end more commonly refers to the entire wall , including the gable and the wall below it . Some types of roofs do not have a gable ( for example hip roofs do not ) . One common type of roof with gables , the gable roof , is named after its prominent gables . A parapet made of a series of curves ( Dutch gable ) or horizontal steps ( crow-stepped gable ) may hide the diagonal lines of the roof . Gable ends of more recent buildings are often treated in the same way as the Classic pediment form . But unlike Classical structures , which operate through trabeation , the gable ends of many buildings are actually bearing-wall structures . Thus , the detailing can be ambiguous or misleading . [ citation needed ] Gable style is also used in the design of fabric structures , with varying degree sloped roofs , dependent on how much snowfall is expected .

  "/wiki/Slate": "Slate is a fine-grained , foliated , homogeneous metamorphic rock derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade regional metamorphism . It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock . Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering , but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression . The foliation in slate is called slaty cleavage . It is caused by strong compression causing fine grained clay flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression . When expertly cut by striking parallel to the foliation , with a specialized tool in the quarry , many slates will display a property called fissility , forming smooth flat sheets of stone which have long been used for roofing , floor tiles , and other purposes . Slate is frequently grey in color , especially when seen , en masse , covering roofs . However , slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality ; for example , slate from North Wales can be found in many shades of grey , from pale to dark , and may also be purple , green or cyan . Slate is not to be confused with shale , from which it may be formed , or schist . The word slate is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock . It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate , or a writing slate . They were traditionally a small , smooth piece of the rock , often framed in wood , used with chalk as a notepad or notice board , and especially for recording charges in pubs and inns .",

  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",

  "/wiki/Timber_framing": "Timber framing and post-and-beam construction are traditional methods of building with heavy timbers , creating structures using squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs . It is commonplace in wooden buildings through the 19th century . If the structural frame of load-bearing timber is left exposed on the exterior of the building it may be referred to as half-timbered , and in many cases the infill between timbers will be used for decorative effect . The country most known for this kind of architecture is Germany . Timber framed houses are spread all over the country except in the southeast . The method comes from working directly from logs and trees rather than pre-cut dimensional lumber . Hewing this with broadaxes , adzes , and draw knives and using hand-powered braces and augers ( brace and bit ) and other woodworking tools , artisans or framers could gradually assemble a building . Since this building method has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world , many styles of historic framing have developed . These styles are often categorized by the type of foundation , walls , how and where the beams intersect , the use of curved timbers , and the roof framing details .",

Merseyside , which was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972 , takes its name from the River Mersey . Merseyside spans 249 square miles ( 645 km2 ) of land which border Lancashire ( to the north-east ) , Greater Manchester ( to the east ) , Cheshire ( to the south and south-east ) and the Irish Sea to the west . North Wales is across the Dee Estuary . There is a mix of high density urban areas , suburbs , semi-rural and rural locations in Merseyside , but overwhelmingly the land use is urban . It has a focused central business district , formed by Liverpool City Centre , but Merseyside is also a polycentric county with five metropolitan districts , each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs . The Liverpool Urban Area is the fifth most populous conurbation in England , and dominates the geographic centre of the county , while the smaller Birkenhead Urban Area dominates the Wirral Peninsula in the south . For the 12 years following 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government ; district councils shared power with the Merseyside County Council . The county council was abolished in 1986 , and so its districts ( the metropolitan boroughs ) are now effectively unitary authority areas . However , the metropolitan county continues to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference , and several county-wide services are co-ordinated by authorities and joint-boards , such as Merseytravel ( for public transport ) , Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service and the Merseyside Police ( for law-enforcement ) ; as a ceremonial county , Merseyside has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff . As the Lancashire county palatine boundaries remain the same as the historic boundaries , the High Sheriff of Merseyside , along with those of Lancashire and Greater Manchester are appointed within the Duchy and County Palatine of Lancaster .",
  "/wiki/Granite": "Granite ( /\u02c8\u0261r\u00e6n\u026at/ ) is a common type of felsic intrusive igneous rock that is granular and phaneritic in texture . Granites can be predominantly white , pink , or gray in color , depending on their mineralogy . The word granite comes from the Latin granum , a grain , in reference to the coarse-grained structure of such a holocrystalline rock . Strictly speaking , granite is an igneous rock with between 20% and 60% quartz by volume , and at least 35% of the total feldspar consisting of alkali feldspar , although commonly the term granite is used to refer to a wider range of coarse-grained igneous rocks containing quartz and feldspar . The term granitic means granite-like and is applied to granite and a group of intrusive igneous rocks with similar textures and slight variations in composition and origin . These rocks mainly consist of feldspar , quartz , mica , and amphibole minerals , which form an interlocking , somewhat equigranular matrix of feldspar and quartz with scattered darker biotite mica and amphibole ( often hornblende ) peppering the lighter color minerals . Occasionally some individual crystals ( phenocrysts ) are larger than the groundmass , in which case the texture is known as porphyritic . A granitic rock with a porphyritic texture is known as a granite porphyry . Granitoid is a general , descriptive field term for lighter-colored , coarse-grained igneous rocks . Petrographic examination is required for identification of specific types of granitoids . The extrusive igneous rock equivalent of granite is rhyolite .",

  "/wiki/City_of_London": "The City of London is a city , county and a local government district [ note 1 ] that contains the historic centre and the primary central business district ( CBD ) of London . It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages , but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City 's borders . The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London , though it remains a notable part of central London . Administratively , it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London ; however , the City of London is not a London borough , a status reserved for the other 32 districts ( including London 's only other city , the City of Westminster ) . It is also a separate ceremonial county , being an enclave surrounded by Greater London , and is the smallest county in the United Kingdom . The City of London is widely referred to simply as the City ( differentiated from the phrase the city of London by capitalising City ) and is also colloquially known as the Square Mile , as it is 1.12 sq mi ( 716.80 acres ; 2.90 km2 ) in area . Both of these terms are also often used as metonyms for the United Kingdom 's trading and financial services industries , which continue a notable history of being largely based in the City . The name London is now ordinarily used for a far wider area than just the City . London most often denotes the sprawling London metropolis , or the 32 London boroughs , in addition to the City of London itself . This wider usage of London is documented as far back as 1888 , when the County of London was created . The local authority for the City , namely the City of London Corporation , is unique in the UK and has some unusual responsibilities for a local council , such as being the police authority . It is also unusual in having responsibilities and ownerships beyond its boundaries .",

The city lies on the River Wear , to the south-west of Sunderland , south of Newcastle upon Tyne and to the north of Darlington .

The cathedral and adjacent 11th-century castle were designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1986 . The castle has been the home of Durham University since 1832 . HM Prison Durham is also located close to the city centre . City of Durham is the name of the civil parish .",
  "/wiki/Battlement": "A battlement in defensive architecture , such as that of city walls or castles , comprises a parapet ( i.e. , a defensive low wall between chest-height and head-height ) , in which gaps or indentations , which are often rectangular , occur at intervals to allow for the launch of arrows or other projectiles from within the defences . These gaps are termed crenels ( also known as carnels , or embrasures ) , and a wall or building with them is called crenellated ; alternative ( older ) terms are castellated and embattled . The act of adding crenels to a previously unbroken parapet is termed crenellation . The function of battlements in war is to protect the defenders by giving them something to hide behind , from which they can pop out to launch their own missiles . A defensive building might be designed and built with battlements , or a manor house might be fortified by adding battlements , where no parapet previously existed , or cutting crenellations into its existing parapet wall . A distinctive feature of late medieval English church architecture is to crenellate the tops of church towers , and often the tops of lower walls . These are essentially decorative rather than functional , as are many examples on secular buildings . The solid widths between the crenels are called merlons . Battlements on walls have protected walkways ( chemin de ronde ) behind them . On tower or building tops , the ( often flat ) roof is used as the protected fighting platform .",
  "/wiki/Parapet": "A parapet is a barrier which is an extension of the wall at the edge of a roof , terrace , balcony , walkway or other structure . The word comes ultimately from the Italian parapetto ( parare to cover/defend and petto breast ) . The German equivalent Br\u00fcstung has the same meaning . Where extending above a roof , a parapet may simply be the portion of an exterior wall that continues above the edge line of the roof surface , or may be a continuation of a vertical feature beneath the roof such as a fire wall or party wall . Parapets were originally used to defend buildings from military attack , but today they are primarily used as guard rails and to prevent the spread of fires . In the Bible the Hebrews are obligated to build a parapet on the roof of their houses to prevent people falling .",

Historically part of Lanarkshire , the city now forms the Glasgow City council area , one of the 32 council areas of Scotland ; the local authority is Glasgow City Council . Glasgow is situated on the River Clyde in the country 's West Central Lowlands . It is the fifth most visited city in the UK . Inhabitants of the city are referred to as Glaswegians or , informally , as Weegies . Glasgow is also known for the Glasgow patter , a distinct dialect of the Scots language that is noted for being difficult to understand by those from outside the city . Glasgow grew from a small rural settlement on the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Scotland , and tenth largest by tonnage in Britain . Expanding from the medieval bishopric and royal burgh , and the later establishment of the University of Glasgow in the fifteenth century , it became a major centre of the Scottish Enlightenment in the eighteenth century . From the eighteenth century onwards , the city also grew as one of Great Britain 's main hubs of transatlantic trade with North America and the West Indies . With the onset of the Industrial Revolution , the population and economy of Glasgow and the surrounding region expanded rapidly to become one of the world 's pre-eminent centres of chemicals , textiles and engineering ; most notably in the shipbuilding and marine engineering industry , which produced many innovative and famous vessels . Glasgow was the Second City of the British Empire for much of the Victorian era and Edwardian period , although many cities argue the title was theirs . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , Glasgow 's population grew rapidly , reaching a peak of 1,127,825 people in 1938 .",
  "/wiki/French_Renaissance_architecture": "French Renaissance architecture is a style which was prominent between the 15th and early 17th centuries in the Kingdom of France . It succeeded French Gothic architecture . The style was originally imported from Italy next after the Hundred Years ' War by the French kings Charles VII , Louis XI , Charles VIII , Louis XII , and Fran\u00e7ois I . Several notable royal ch\u00e2teaux in this style were built in the Loire Valley , notably the Chateau de Montsoreau , the Chateau de Langeais , the Chateau d'Amboise , the Chateau of Blois , the Chateau of Gaillon , and the Chateau of Chambord , and , closer to Paris , the Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau . This style of French architecture had two distinct periods . During the first period , between about 1450 and 1590 , the Italian style was copied directly , often by Italian architects and craftsmen . In the second period , between 1540 and the end of the Valois dynasty in 1589 , French architects and craftsmen gave the style a more distinctive and original French character . The major architects of the style included the royal architects Philibert Delorme , Pierre Lescot and Jean Bullant , and the Italian architect and architectural theorist Sebastiano Serlio .",
  "/wiki/Bolton": "Bolton ( /\u02c8b\u0252lt\u0259n/ ( listen ) , locally /\u02c8bo\u028at\u0259n/ ) is a town in Greater Manchester in North West England . A former mill town , Bolton has been a production centre for textiles since Flemish weavers settled in the area in the 14th century , introducing a wool and cotton-weaving tradition . The urbanisation and development of the town largely coincided with the introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution . Bolton was a 19th-century boomtown , and at its zenith in 1929 its 216 cotton mills and 26 bleaching and dyeing works made it one of the largest and most productive centres of cotton spinning in the world . The British cotton industry declined sharply after the First World War , and by the 1980s cotton manufacture had virtually ceased in Bolton . Close to the West Pennine Moors , Bolton is 10 miles ( 16 km ) northwest of Manchester . It is surrounded by several smaller towns and villages that together form the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton , of which Bolton is the administrative centre . The town of Bolton has a population of 139,403 , whilst the wider metropolitan borough has a population of 262,400 . Historically part of Lancashire , Bolton originated as a small settlement in the moorland known as Bolton le Moors . In the English Civil War , the town was a Parliamentarian outpost in a staunchly Royalist region , and as a result was stormed by 3,000 Royalist troops led by Prince Rupert of the Rhine in 1644 . In what became known as the Bolton Massacre , 1,600 residents were killed and 700 were taken prisoner . Bolton Wanderers football club play home games at the University of Bolton Stadium and the WBA World light-welterweight champion Amir Khan was born in the town ."
