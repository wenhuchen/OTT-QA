Since the foundation of the first Moroccan state by Idris I in 788 AD , the country has been ruled by a series of independent dynasties , reaching its zenith under Almoravid and Almohad rule , when it spanned parts of Iberia and northwestern Africa . The Marinid and Saadi dynasties resisted foreign domination into the 17th century , allowing Morocco to remain the only northwest African country to avoid Ottoman occupation . The Alaouite dynasty , which rules to this day , seized power in 1631 . The country 's strategic location near the mouth of the Mediterranean attracted the interest of Europe , and in 1912 , Morocco was divided into French and Spanish protectorates , with an international zone in Tangier . It regained its independence in 1956 , and has since remained comparatively stable and prosperous by regional standards , with the fifth largest economy in Africa .",
  "/wiki/Biological_passport": "An athlete biological passport is an individual electronic record for professional athletes , in which profiles of biological markers of doping and results of doping tests are collated over a period of time . Doping violations can be detected by noting variances from an athletes established levels outside permissible limits , rather than testing for and identifying illegal substances . Although the terminology athlete passport is recent , the use of biological markers of doping has a long history in anti-doping . Maybe the first marker of doping , that tries to detect a prohibited substance not based on its presence in urine or blood , but through the induced deviations in biological parameters , is the so-called testosterone over epitestosterone ratio ( T/E ) . The T/E has been used by sports authorities since the beginning of the 1980s to detect anabolic steroids in urine samples . A decade later , in 1997 , markers of blood doping were introduced by some international federations , such as the Union Cycliste Internationale ( UCI ) and the Federation Internationale de Ski , to deter the abuse of recombinant erythropoietin that was undetectable by direct means at that time . It is only in 2002 that the concept of using biological markers to detect doping became known by the term athlete passport . The merits of this testing paradigm were exposed in the scientific literature and the terminology adopted by the World Anti-Doping agency . Many believe [ who ? ] that the athlete passport provides an excellent alternative to ensure fairness in elite sports . While a new drug test must be developed and validated for each new drug , the main advantage of the athlete passport is that it is based on the stability of the physiology of the human being . New drugs are produced at an unprecedented pace today and there is often a lag of several years between the availability of a new drug and the application of an effective detection method .",

  "/wiki/Nandrolone": "Nandrolone , also known as 19-nortestosterone , is an androgen and anabolic steroid ( AAS ) which is used in the form of esters such as nandrolone decanoate ( brand name Deca-Durabolin ) and nandrolone phenylpropionate ( brand name Durabolin ) . Nandrolone esters are used in the treatment of anemias , cachexia ( wasting syndrome ) , osteoporosis , breast cancer , and for other indications . They are not used by mouth and instead are given by injection into muscle or fat . Side effects of nandrolone esters include symptoms of masculinization like acne , increased hair growth , voice changes , and increased sexual desire . They are synthetic androgens and anabolic steroids and hence are agonists of the androgen receptor ( AR ) , the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) . Nandrolone esters have strong anabolic effects and weak androgenic effects , which give them a mild side effect profile and make them especially suitable for use in women and children . They are long-lasting prodrugs of nandrolone in the body . Nandrolone esters were first described and introduced for medical use in the late 1950s . They are among the most widely used AAS worldwide . In addition to their medical use , nandrolone esters are used to improve physique and performance , and are said to be the most widely used AAS for such purposes . The drugs are controlled substances in many countries and so non-medical use is generally illicit .",

  "/wiki/Testosterone": "Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone and anabolic steroid . In male humans , testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as testes and prostate , as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass , and the growth of body hair . In addition , testosterone is involved in health and well-being , and the prevention of osteoporosis . Insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty and bone loss . Testosterone is a steroid from the androstane class containing a keto and hydroxyl groups at the three and seventeen positions respectively . It is biosynthesized in several steps from cholesterol and is converted in the liver to inactive metabolites . It exerts its action through binding to and activation of the androgen receptor . In humans and most other vertebrates , testosterone is secreted primarily by the testicles of males and , to a lesser extent , the ovaries of females . On average , in adult males , levels of testosterone are about 7 to 8 times as great as in adult females . As the metabolism of testosterone in males is more pronounced , the daily production is about 20 times greater in men . Females are also more sensitive to the hormone . In addition to its role as a natural hormone , testosterone is used as a medication in the treatment of low testosterone levels in men , transgender hormone therapy for transgender men , and breast cancer in women .",

Low levels of EPO ( around 10 mU/mL ) are constantly secreted sufficient to compensate for normal red blood cell turnover . Common causes of cellular hypoxia resulting in elevated levels of EPO ( up to 10 000 mU/mL ) include any anemia , and hypoxemia due to chronic lung disease . Erythropoietin is produced by interstitial fibroblasts in the kidney in close association with the peritubular capillary and proximal convoluted tubule . It is also produced in perisinusoidal cells in the liver . Liver production predominates in the fetal and perinatal period ; renal production predominates in adulthood . It is homologous with thrombopoietin . Exogenous erythropoietin , recombinant human erythropoietin ( rhEPO ) , is produced by recombinant DNA technology in cell culture and are collectively called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESA ) : two examples are epoetin alfa and epoetin beta . ESAs are used in the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease , anemia in myelodysplasia , and in anemia from cancer chemotherapy . Risks of therapy include death , myocardial infarction , stroke , venous thromboembolism , and tumor recurrence . Risk increases when EPO treatment raises hemoglobin levels over 11 g/dL to 12 g/dL : this is to be avoided . rhEPO has been used illicitly as a performance-enhancing drug .",

  "/wiki/Anabolic_steroids": "Anabolic steroids , also known more properly as anabolic-androgenic steroids ( AAS ) , are steroidal androgens that include natural androgens like testosterone as well as synthetic androgens that are structurally related and have similar effects to testosterone . They are anabolic and increase protein within cells , especially in skeletal muscles , and also have varying degrees of androgenic and virilizing effects , including induction of the development and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characteristics such as the growth of facial and body hair .

Androgens or AAS are one of three types of sex hormone agonists , the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone . AAS were synthesized in the 1930s , and are now used therapeutically in medicine to stimulate muscle growth and appetite , induce male puberty and treat chronic wasting conditions , such as cancer and AIDS . The American College of Sports Medicine acknowledges that AAS , in the presence of adequate diet , can contribute to increases in body weight , often as lean mass increases and that the gains in muscular strength achieved through high-intensity exercise and proper diet can be additionally increased by the use of AAS in some individuals . Health risks can be produced by long-term use or excessive doses of AAS . These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels ( increased low-density lipoprotein and decreased high-density lipoprotein ) , acne , high blood pressure , liver damage ( mainly with most oral AAS ) , and dangerous changes in the structure of the left ventricle of the heart . These risks are further increased when , as they often do , athletes take steroids alongside other drugs , causing significantly more damage to their bodies . The effect of anabolic steroids on the heart can cause myocardial infarction and strokes . Conditions pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as gynecomastia and testicular size reduction may also be caused by AAS . In women and children , AAS can cause irreversible masculinization .",

Originally inhabited by the indigenous Arawak and Ta\u00edno peoples , the island came under Spanish rule following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494 . Many of the indigenous people were either killed or died of diseases to which they had no immunity , and the Spanish thus forcibly transplanted large numbers of African slaves to Jamaica as labourers . The island remained a possession of Spain until 1655 , when England ( later Great Britain ) conquered it , renaming it Jamaica . Under British colonial rule Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter , with a plantation economy dependent on the African slaves and later their descendants . The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838 , and many freedmen chose to have subsistence farms rather than to work on plantations . Beginning in the 1840s , the British began utilising Chinese and Indian indentured labour to work on plantations . The island achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 6 August 1962 .

PPA is also known as \u03b2-hydroxyamphetamine , and is a member of the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes . It is closely related to the cathinones ( \u03b2-ketoamphetamines ) . The compound exists as four stereoisomers , which include d- and l-norephedrine and d- and l-norpseudoephedrine . d-Norpseudoephedrine is also known as cathine , and is found naturally in Catha edulis ( khat ) . Pharmaceutical drug preparations of PPA have varied in their stereoisomer composition in different countries , which may explain differences in misuse and side effect profiles . Analogues of PPA include ephedrine , pseudoephedrine , amphetamine , methamphetamine , and cathinone . Although originally thought to act as a direct agonist of adrenergic receptors , PPA was subsequently found to show only weak or negligible affinity for these receptors , and has been instead characterized as an indirect sympathomimetic which acts by inducing norepinephrine release and thereby activating adrenergic receptors . It was patented in 1938 . In the United States , PPA is no longer sold due to a purported increased risk of stroke in younger women ."
