  "/wiki/Elmira_College": "Elmira College is a private liberal arts college in Elmira , New York . It is among the oldest colleges still in existence which ( as a college for women ) granted degrees to women that were the equivalent of those given to men ( the first to do so was Wesleyan College located in Macon , Georgia , in 1840 ) . Elmira College became coeducational in all of its programs in 1969 . The college , founded in 1855 , has an enrollment of about 1,000 students . The school 's colors , purple and gold , are seen throughout the traditional campus , consisting mainly of ivy-covered buildings of the Victorian and Collegiate Gothic architectural styles . The colors purple and gold come from both the banners of the women 's suffrage movement and the iris , the college flower . Offered are about thirty-five major areas of study , each ultimately leading to either a BS or BA degree upon a successful completion of undergraduate studies . Students attend two full terms in the fall and winter and then enroll in a 6-week , intensive Term III in the spring . This gives students a unique opportunity to study abroad , intern , or take classes not related to their majors so as to enrich the educational experience . Elmira College has an extensive Mark Twain ( Samuel Clemens ) archive and is one of the only two centers for Mark Twain Studies in the world . The octagonal study from Quarry Farm in which Twain wrote many of his most widely read novels : Life on the Mississippi , A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur 's Court , and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , is located on campus . Every four years the college perpetuates his legacy by hosting an international conference on the State of Mark Twain Studies .",
