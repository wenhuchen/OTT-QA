  "/wiki/First_World_War": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Passchendaele": "The Third Battle of Ypres ( German : Dritte Flandernschlacht ; French : Troisi\u00e8me Bataille des Flandres and Dutch : Derde Slag om Vlaanderen ) , also known as the Battle of Passchendaele ( /\u02c8p\u00e6\u0283\u0259nde\u026al/ ) , was a campaign of the First World War , fought by the Allies against the German Empire . [ a ] The battle took place on the Western Front , from July to November 1917 , for control of the ridges south and east of the Belgian city of Ypres in West Flanders , as part of a strategy decided by the Allies at conferences in November 1916 and May 1917 . Passchendaele lies on the last ridge east of Ypres , 5 mi ( 8.0 km ) from Roulers ( now Roeselare ) junction of the Bruges ( Brugge ) to Kortrijk railway . The station at Roulers was on the main supply route of the German 4th Army . Once Passchendaele Ridge had been captured , the Allied advance was to continue to a line from Thourout ( now Torhout ) to Couckelaere ( Koekelare ) . Further operations and a British supporting attack along the Belgian coast from Nieuport ( Nieuwpoort ) , combined with an amphibious landing ( Operation Hush ) , were to have reached Bruges and then the Dutch frontier . The resistance of the 4th Army , unusually wet weather in August , the beginning of the autumn rains in October and the diversion of British and French resources to Italy , enabled the Germans to avoid the general withdrawal which had seemed inevitable in early October . The campaign ended in November , when the Canadian Corps captured Passchendaele , apart from local attacks in December and early in the new year . The Battle of the Lys ( Fourth Battle of Ypres ) and the Fifth Battle of Ypres of 1918 , were fought before the Allies occupied the Belgian coast and reached the Dutch frontier . A campaign in Flanders was controversial in 1917 and has remained so . The British Prime Minister , David Lloyd George , opposed the offensive , as did General Ferdinand Foch , the Chief of Staff of the French Army . Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig , commander of the British Expeditionary Force ( BEF ) , did not receive approval for the Flanders operation from the War Cabinet until 25 July .",

It is also known variously as the Boer War , Anglo-Boer War , or South African War . Initial Boer attacks were successful , and although British reinforcements later reversed these , the war continued for years with Boer guerrilla warfare , until harsh British counter-measures brought the Boers to terms . The war started with the British overconfident and under-prepared . The Boers were well armed and struck first , besieging Ladysmith , Kimberley , and Mafeking in early 1900 , and winning important battles at Colenso , Magersfontein and Stormberg . Staggered , the British brought in large numbers of soldiers and fought back . General Redvers Buller was replaced by Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener . They relieved the three besieged cities , and invaded the two Boer republics in late 1900 . The onward marches of the British Army , well over 400,000 men , were so overwhelming that the Boers did not fight staged battles in defence of their homeland . The British army seized control of all of the Orange Free State and Transvaal , as the civilian leadership went into hiding or exile . In conventional terms , the war was over .

  "/wiki/Indian_Mutiny": "The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major , but ultimately unsuccessful , uprising in India in 1857-58 against the rule of the British East India Company , which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown . The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company 's army in the garrison town of Meerut , 40 mi ( 64 km ) northeast of Delhi ( now Old Delhi ) . It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India , [ a ] [ b ] though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east . [ c ] The rebellion posed a considerable threat to British power in that region , [ d ] and was contained only with the rebels ' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858 . On 1 November 1858 , the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder , though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 1859 . Its name is contested , variously described as the Sepoy Mutiny , the Indian Mutiny , the Great Rebellion , the Revolt of 1857 , the Indian Insurrection , and the First War of Independence . [ e ] The Indian rebellion was fed by resentments born of diverse perceptions , including invasive British-style social reforms , harsh land taxes , summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes , as well as scepticism about the improvements brought about by British rule . [ f ] Many Indians rose against the British ; however , many also fought for the British , and the majority remained seemingly compliant to British rule . [ g ] Violence , which sometimes betrayed exceptional cruelty , was inflicted on both sides , on British officers , and civilians , including women and children , by the rebels , and on the rebels , and their supporters , including sometimes entire villages , by British reprisals ; the cities of Delhi and Lucknow were laid waste in the fighting and the British retaliation . [ h ] After the outbreak of the mutiny in Meerut , the rebels quickly reached Delhi , whose 81-year-old Mughal ruler , Bahadur Shah Zafar , was declared the Emperor of Hindustan . Soon , the rebels had captured large tracts of the North-Western Provinces and Awadh ( Oudh ) . The East India Company 's response came rapidly as well .",

  "/wiki/King's_Regiment_(Liverpool)": "The King 's Regiment ( Liverpool ) was one of the oldest line infantry regiments of the British Army , having been formed in 1685 and numbered as the 8th ( The King 's ) Regiment of Foot in 1751 . Unlike most British Army infantry regiments , which were associated with a county , the King 's represented the city of Liverpool , one of only four regiments affiliated to a city in the British Army . After 273 years of continuous existence , the regiment was amalgamated with the Manchester Regiment in 1958 to form the King 's Regiment ( Liverpool and Manchester ) , which was later amalgamated with the King 's Own Royal Border Regiment and the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment to form the present Duke of Lancaster 's Regiment ( King 's , Lancashire and Border ) . The King 's notably saw active service in the Second Boer War , the two world wars , and the Korean War . In the First World War , the regiment contributed dozens of battalions to the Western Front , Salonika , and the North West Frontier . More than 13,000 men were killed . In the Second World War , the 5th and 8th ( Irish ) battalions landed during Operation Overlord , the 1st and 13th fought as Chindits in the Burma Campaign , and the 2nd Battalion served in Italy and Greece . The King 's later fought in the Korean War , earning the regiment 's last battle honour . Nine Victoria Crosses were awarded to men of the regiment , the first in 1900 and the last in 1918 . An additional two were awarded to Royal Army Medical Corps officer Noel Godfrey Chavasse , who was attached to the 10th ( Scottish ) Battalion during the Great War . In peacetime , the regiment 's battalions were based in the United Kingdom and colonies in the British Empire .

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Guillemont": "The Battle of Guillemont ( 3-6 September 1916 ) was an attack by the British Fourth Army on the village of Guillemont . The village is on the D 20 running east to Combles and the D 64 south-west to Montauban . Longueval and Delville Wood lie to the north-west and Ginchy to the north-east . The village was on the right flank of the British sector , near the boundary with the French Sixth Army . The Fourth Army had advanced close to Guillemont during the Battle of Bazentin Ridge ( 14-17 July ) and the capture of the village was the culmination of British attacks which began on the night of 22/23 July . The attacks were intended to advance the right flank of the Fourth Army and eliminate a salient further north at Delville Wood . German defences ringed the wood and had observation over the French Sixth Army area to the south , towards the Somme river . Preparatory to a general attack intended for mid-September , from the Somme north to Courcelette ( beyond the Albert-Bapaume road ) , the French Sixth Army , the Fourth Army and the Reserve Army conducted numerous attacks to capture the rest of the German second line and to gain observation over the German third line . The German defences around Guillemont were based on the remaining parts of the second line and fortified villages and farms northwards from Hem , Maurepas and Combles , to Falfemont Farm , Guillemont , Ginchy , Delville Wood and High Wood , which commanded the ground in between . [ a ] Numerous attempts were made by Joseph Joffre , Sir Douglas Haig , Ferdinand Foch and the army commanders Henry Rawlinson and \u00c9mile Fayolle to co-ordinate joint attacks , which failed due to the recovery of the German 2nd Army from the disorganisation caused by the defeats in early July , disagreements over tactics by Haig and Joffre in July and August and organisational constraints caused by congestion behind the front , roads and tracks obliterated by Anglo-French artillery-fire becoming swamps when it rained and increasing German artillery-fire on targets behind the front line . Inexperience , unreliable machinery , guns , ammunition and an unpredictable flow of supplies from Britain , reduced the effectiveness of the British armies . Difficulty in co-ordinating attacks by the Entente armies and the large number of piecemeal attacks resorted to by the British , have been criticised as costly failures and evidence of muddle and incompetence by the generals .",

British forces under Lieutenant General Lord Methuen were advancing north along the railway line from the Cape in order to relieve the Siege of Kimberley , but their path was blocked at Magersfontein by a Boer force that was entrenched in the surrounding hills . The British had already fought a series of battles with the Boers , most recently at Modder River , where the advance was temporarily halted . Lord Methuen failed to perform adequate reconnaissance in preparation for the impending battle , and was unaware that Boer Vecht-generaal ( Combat General ) De la Rey had entrenched his forces at the foot of the hills rather than the forward slopes as was the accepted practice . This allowed the Boers to survive the initial British artillery bombardment ; when the British troops failed to deploy from a compact formation during their advance , the defenders were able to inflict heavy casualties . The Highland Brigade suffered the worst casualties , while on the Boer side , the Scandinavian Corps was destroyed . The Boers attained a tactical victory and succeeded in holding the British in their advance on Kimberley .

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Khuweilfe": "The Third Battle of Gaza was fought on the night of 1/2 November 1917 between British and Ottoman forces during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I , and came after the Egyptian Expeditionary Force ( EEF ) victory at the Battle of Beersheba had ended the Stalemate in Southern Palestine . The fighting occurred at the beginning of the Southern Palestine Offensive , and together with attacks on Hareira and Sheria on 6-7 November and the continuing Battle of Tel el Khuweilfe which had been launched by General Edmund Allenby on 1 November , it eventually broke the Gaza to Beersheba line defended by the Yildirim Army Group . Despite having held this line since March 1917 , the Ottoman Army was forced to evacuate Gaza and Tel el Khuweilfe during the night of 6/7 November . Only Sheria held out for most of the 7 November before it too was captured . [ Note 1 ] Following British defeats at the First and Second Battles of Gaza in March and April 1917 , Lieutenant General Philip Chetwode commanding the EEF 's Eastern Force and Kress von Kressenstein 's Ottoman Empire force had each adopted a defensive posture and a stalemate had developed in Southern Palestine . Entrenched defences approximately on the lines held at the end of the second battle were strengthened , and both sides undertook regular mounted reconnaissances into the open eastern flank . In late June , Allenby replaced General Archibald Murray as commander of the EEF , which he quickly reorganised . At about the same time , the Ottoman Fourth Army was also restructured . As the stalemate continued in terrible conditions through the summer , reinforcements began to arrive to replace the large number of casualties suffered by the EEF during the previous fighting for Gaza , while several additional divisions also arrived . The Ottoman defenders were also reinforced at this time , and both sides carried out training while manning the front lines and monitoring the open eastern flank . By mid-October , as the Battle of Passchendaele continued on the Western Front , the last of the British reinforcements arrived as Allenby 's preparations to commence a campaign of manoeuvre neared completion . Prior to the Second Battle of Gaza , the town had been developed into a strong modern fortress , with entrenchments , wire entanglements and a glacis on its south and south-eastern edges .",

'Eastern War ' ; Turkish : K\u0131r\u0131m Sava\u015f\u0131 ; Italian : Guerra di Crimea ) was a military conflict fought from October 1853 to February 1856 in which the Russian Empire lost to an alliance made up of the Ottoman Empire , France , Britain and Sardinia . The immediate cause of the war involved the rights of Christian minorities in the Holy Land , which was a part of the Ottoman Empire . The French promoted the rights of Roman Catholics , while Russia promoted those of the Eastern Orthodox Church . The longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of Britain and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at the Ottoman Empire 's expense . It has widely been noted that the causes , in one case involving an argument over a key , have never revealed a greater confusion of purpose , yet they led to a war noted for its notoriously incompetent international butchery . While the churches worked out their differences and came to an agreement , Nicholas I of Russia and the French Emperor Napoleon III refused to back down . Nicholas issued an ultimatum that the Orthodox subjects of the Ottoman Empire be placed under his protection . Britain attempted to mediate and arranged a compromise that Nicholas agreed to . When the Ottomans demanded changes to the agreement , Nicholas recanted and prepared for war . Having obtained promises of support from France and Britain , the Ottomans declared war on Russia in October 1853 . The war started in the Balkans in July 1853 , when Russian troops occupied the Danubian Principalities ( now part of Romania ) , which were under Ottoman suzerainty , then began to cross the Danube .",
  "/wiki/Siege_of_Sevastopol_(1854\u20131855)": "The siege of Sevastopol ( at the time called in English the siege of Sebastopol ) lasted from October 1854 until September 1855 , during the Crimean War . The allies ( French , Ottoman , and British ) landed at Eupatoria on 14 September 1854 , intending to make a triumphal march to Sevastopol , the capital of the Crimea , with 50,000 men . The 56-kilometre ( 35 mi ) traverse took a year of fighting against the Russians . Major battles along the way were Alma ( September 1854 ) , Balaklava ( October 1854 ) , Inkerman ( November 1854 ) , Tchernaya ( August 1855 ) , Redan ( September 1855 ) , and , finally , Malakoff ( September 1855 ) . During the siege , the allied navy undertook six bombardments of the capital , on 17 October 1854 ; and on 9 April , 6 June , 17 June , 17 August , and 5 September 1855 . Sevastopol is one of the classic sieges of all time . The city of Sevastopol was the home of the Tsar 's Black Sea Fleet , which threatened the Mediterranean . The Russian field army withdrew before the allies could encircle it . The siege was the culminating struggle for the strategic Russian port in 1854-55 and was the final episode in the Crimean War . During the Victorian Era , these battles were repeatedly memorialized . The siege of Sevastopol was the subject of Crimean soldier Leo Tolstoy 's Sebastopol Sketches and the subject of the first Russian feature film , Defence of Sevastopol .

  "/wiki/Second_World_War": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan .

  "/wiki/New_South_Wales_Army_Medical_Corps": "Until Australia became a Federation in 1901 , each of the six colonial governments was responsible for the defence of their own colony . From 1788 until 1870 this was done with British regular forces . In all , 24 British infantry regiments served in the Australian colonies . Each of the Australian colonies gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890 , and while the Colonial Office in London retained control of some affairs , and the colonies were still firmly within the British Empire , the Governors of the Australian colonies were required to raise their own colonial militia . To do this , the colonial Governors had the authority from the British crown to raise military and naval forces . Initially these were militias in support of British regulars , but British military support for the colonies ended in 1870 , and the colonies assumed their own defence . The separate colonies maintained control over their respective militia forces and navies until 1 March 1901 , when the colonial forces were all amalgamated into the Commonwealth Forces following the creation of the Commonwealth of Australia . Colonial forces , including home raised units , saw action in many of the conflicts of the British Empire during the 19th century . Members from British regiments stationed in Australia saw action in India , Afghanistan , the New Zealand Wars , the Sudan conflict , and the Boer War in South Africa . Despite an undeserved reputation of colonial inferiority , many of the locally raised units were highly organised , disciplined , professional , and well trained . For most of the time from settlement until Federation , military defences in Australia revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery , based on garrisoned coastal forts ; however , in the 1890s improved railway communications between all of the eastern mainland colonies ( Queensland , New South Wales , Victoria , and South Australia ) , led Major General Bevan Edwards , who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces , to state his belief that the colonies could be defended by the rapid mobilisation of standard brigades . He called for a restructure of colonial defences , and defensive agreements to be made between the colonies .",
