  "/wiki/The_Life_and_Times_of_Grizzly_Adams": "The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams is a 1974 independent feature film inspired by a 1972 historical fiction novella written by Charles E. Sellier Jr . The film 's popularity led to an NBC television series of the same name . The title character , played by Dan Haggerty , was loosely based on California mountain man James Grizzly Adams ( 1812-1860 ) . The film and TV series portrayed the fictional Grizzly Adams as a frontier woodsman who fled into the mountains after he was wrongly accused of murder . While struggling to survive , Adams saves an orphaned grizzly bear cub he adopts and names Ben . The bear , while growing to its huge adult size , becomes Adams ' closest companion . Consistently kind and gentle , Adams discovers and demonstrates an uncanny ability to gain the trust of most of the indigenous wildlife of the region , and he helps , sometimes rescues , takes in and tames many species . Originally a hunter , with his learned affection for wildlife Adams resolves never to harm another animal whenever possible . In the television series , Adams had two human friends , an old mountain man trader named Mad Jack played by Denver Pyle who was often featured with his mule ( Number Seven ) , and a Native American by the name of Nakoma played by Don Shanks . Adams , Mad Jack , and Nakoma helped myriad mountain visitors while protecting wildlife at the same time . NBC aired the series finale on February 21 , 1982 by way of a two-hour TV movie called The Capture of Grizzly Adams where a bounty hunter used Adams ' daughter , who was not seen or mentioned since the 1974 film , in a kidnap-extortion ploy to lure the fugitive mountain man back to civilization . In the end Adams proves his innocence .",

  "/wiki/Broadcast_syndication": "Broadcasting syndication is the license to broadcast television programs and radio programs by multiple television stations and radio stations , without going through a broadcast network . It is common in the United States where broadcast programming is scheduled by television networks with local independent affiliates .
