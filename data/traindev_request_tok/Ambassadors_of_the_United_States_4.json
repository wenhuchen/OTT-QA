Afghanistan is bordered by Pakistan to the east and south ; [ b ] Iran to the west ; Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , and Tajikistan to the north ; and China to the northeast . Occupying 652,000 square kilometers ( 252,000 sq mi ) , it is a mountainous country with plains in the north and southwest . Kabul is the capital and largest city . The population is 32 million , mostly composed of ethnic Pashtuns , Tajiks , Hazaras and Uzbeks . Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the Middle Paleolithic Era , and the country 's strategic location along the Silk Road connected it to the cultures of the Middle East and other parts of Asia . The land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed numerous military campaigns , including those by Alexander the Great , Mauryas , Muslim Arabs , Mongols , British , Soviets , and by the United States with allied countries . The land also served as the source from which the Kushans , Hephthalites , Samanids , Saffarids , Ghaznavids , Ghorids , Khaljis , Mughals , Hotaks , Durranis , and others have risen to form major empires . The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan began with the Hotak and Durrani dynasties in the 18th century . In the late 19th century , Afghanistan became a buffer state in the Great Game between British India and the Russian Empire . Its border with British India , the Durand Line , was formed in 1893 but it is not recognized by the Afghan government and it has led to strained relations with Pakistan since the latter 's independence in 1947 . Following the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919 the country was free of foreign influence , eventually becoming a monarchy under Amanullah Khan , until almost 50 years later when Zahir Shah was overthrown and a republic was established .",
  "/wiki/Pakistan": "Pakistan , [ b ] officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan , [ c ] is a country in South Asia . It is the world 's sixth-most populous country with a population exceeding 207.8 million . In area , it is the 33rd-largest country , spanning 881,913 square kilometres ( 340,509 square miles ) . Pakistan has a 1,046-kilometre ( 650-mile ) coastline along the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east , Afghanistan to the west , Iran to the southwest , and China in the northeast . It is separated narrowly from Tajikistan by Afghanistan 's Wakhan Corridor in the northwest , and also shares a maritime border with Oman . The territory that now constitutes Pakistan was the site of several ancient cultures and intertwined with the history of the broader Indian subcontinent . The ancient history involves the Neolithic site of Mehrgarh and the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilisation , and was later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures , including Hindus , Indo-Greeks , Muslims , Turco-Mongols , Afghans and Sikhs . The area has been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties , including the Persian Achaemenid Empire , Alexander III of Macedon , the Seleucid Empire , the Indian Maurya Empire , the Gupta Empire , the Arab Umayyad Caliphate , the Delhi Sultanate , the Mongol Empire , the Mughal Empire , the Afghan Durrani Empire , the Sikh Empire ( partially ) and , most recently , the British Indian Empire . Pakistan is the only country to have been created in the name of Islam . It is an ethnically and linguistically diverse country , with similarly diverse geography and wildlife . Initially a dominion , Pakistan adopted a constitution in 1956 , becoming an Islamic republic . An ethnic civil war and Indian military intervention in 1971 resulted in the secession of East Pakistan as the new country of Bangladesh .",

The Convention was the result of prolonged efforts by the international community to establish a new instrument that would supplement the 1925 Geneva Protocol . The Geneva Protocol prohibits use but not possession or development of chemical and biological weapons . A draft of the BWC , submitted by the British was opened for signature on 10 April 1972 and entered into force 26 March 1975 when twenty-two governments had deposited their instruments of ratification . It commits the 183 states which are party to it as of August 2019 to prohibit the development , production , and stockpiling of biological and toxin weapons . However , the absence of any formal verification regime to monitor compliance has limited the effectiveness of the Convention . An additional five states have signed the BWC but have yet to ratify the treaty . The scope of the BWC 's prohibition is defined in Article 1 ( the so-called general purpose criterion ) . This includes all microbial and other biological agents or toxins and their means of delivery ( with exceptions for medical and defensive purposes in small quantities ) . Subsequent Review Conferences have reaffirmed that the general purpose criterion encompasses all future scientific and technological developments relevant to the Convention . It is not the objects themselves ( biological agents or toxins ) , but rather certain purposes for which they may be employed which are prohibited ; similar to Art.II , 1 in the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) . Permitted purposes under the BWC are defined as prophylactic , protective and other peaceful purposes .",

In the 9th century , the Bamar people entered the upper Irrawaddy valley and , following the establishment of the Pagan Kingdom in the 1050s , the Burmese language , culture and Theravada Buddhism slowly became dominant in the country . The Pagan Kingdom fell due to the Mongol invasions and several warring states emerged . In the 16th century , reunified by the Taungoo dynasty , the country was for a brief period the largest empire in the history of Mainland Southeast Asia . The early 19th century Konbaung dynasty ruled over an area that included modern Myanmar and briefly controlled Manipur and Assam as well .

After gaining independence from France in 1960 , the Central African Republic was ruled by a series of autocratic leaders , including an abortive attempt at a monarchy ; by the 1990s , calls for democracy led to the first multi-party democratic elections in 1993 .

Neither proposal would prohibit the production of fissile material for non-weapons purposes , including use in civil or naval nuclear reactors . In a 27 September 1993 speech before the UN , President Clinton called for a multilateral convention banning the production of fissile materials for nuclear explosives or outside international safeguards . In December 1993 the UN General Assembly adopted resolution 48/75L calling for the negotiation of a non-discriminatory , multilateral and international effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .

However , substantive negotiations have not taken place . In 2004 , the United States announced that it opposed the inclusion of a verification mechanism in the treaty on the grounds that the treaty could not be effectively verified .

Later , there were also minor interventions by some states against ISIL-affiliated groups in Nigeria and Libya . In mid-June 2014 , Iran , according to American and British information , started flying drones over Iraq , and , according to Reuters , Iranian soldiers were in Iraq fighting ISIL . Simultaneously , the United States ordered a small number of troops to Iraq and started flying crewed aircraft over Iraq . In July 2014 , according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies , Iran sent Sukhoi Su-25 aircraft to Iraq , and Hezbollah purportedly sent trainers and advisers to Iraq to monitor ISIL 's movements . In August 2014 , the US and Iran separately began a campaign of airstrikes on ISIL targets in Iraq . Since then , fourteen countries in a US-led coalition have also executed airstrikes on ISIL in Iraq and in Syria . In September 2015 , Russian forces , with the permission of the Syrian government , began thousands of bombing raids against ISIL , al-Nusra Front , and the Free Syrian Army ( FSA ) . In the months following the beginning of both air campaigns , ISIL began to lose ground in both Iraq and Syria . Civilian deaths from airstrikes began to mount in 2015 and 2016 . In mid-2016 , the US and Russia planned to begin coordinating their airstrikes ; however , this coordination did not materialize .
