Illinois has been noted as a microcosm of the entire United States . With Chicago in northeastern Illinois , small industrial cities and immense agricultural productivity in the north and center of the state , and natural resources such as coal , timber , and petroleum in the south , Illinois has a diverse economic base , and is a major transportation hub . Chicagoland , Chicago 's metropolitan area , encompasses over 65% of the state 's population . The Port of Chicago connects the state to international ports via two main routes : from the Great Lakes , via the Saint Lawrence Seaway , to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River , via the Illinois Waterway to the Illinois River . The Mississippi River , the Ohio River , and the Wabash River form parts of the boundaries of Illinois . For decades , Chicago 's O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world 's busiest airports .

The capital of Illinois is Springfield , which is located in the central part of the state . Although today Illinois 's largest population center is in its northeast , the state 's European population grew first in the west as the French settled lands near the Mississippi River , when the region was known as Illinois Country and was part of New France . Following the American Revolutionary War , American settlers began arriving from Kentucky in the 1780s via the Ohio River , and the population grew from south to north .",

Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States .

Upstream 8 miles ( 13 km ) to the east is Warrington , and 4 miles downstream to the west is Speke , part of the city of Liverpool . Before the Industrial Revolution , Widnes was a small settlement on marsh and moorland . In 1847 , the chemist and industrialist John Hutchinson established a chemical factory at Spike Island . The town grew in population and rapidly became a major centre of the chemical industry . The demand for labour was met by large-scale immigration from the Republic of Ireland , Poland , Lithuania and Wales . The town continues to be a major manufacturer of chemicals , although many of the chemical factories have closed and the economy is predominantly based upon service industries .

  "/wiki/Runcorn": "Runcorn is an industrial town and cargo port in the Borough of Halton in Cheshire , England . Its population in 2011 was 61,789 . The town is in the southeast of the Liverpool City Region on the southern bank of the River Mersey where the estuary narrows to form the Runcorn Gap . To the north across the River Mersey is Widnes , with Warrington 7 miles ( 11 km ) to the northeast and Liverpool 11 miles ( 18 km ) to the northwest . Runcorn was founded by Ethelfleda in 915 AD as a fortification to guard against Viking invasion at a narrowing of the River Mersey . Under Norman rule , Runcorn fell under the Barony of Halton and an Augustinian abbey was established here in 1115 . It remained a small , isolated settlement until the Industrial Revolution when the extension of the Bridgewater Canal to Runcorn in 1776 established it as a port which would link Liverpool with inland Manchester and Staffordshire . The docks enabled the growth of industry , initially shipwrights and sandstone quarries . In the late 18th and early 19th centuries , it was a spa and health resort but this ended with the growth of polluting industries , especially soap and chemical works . In 1964 , Runcorn was designated a new town and expanded eastward , swallowing neighbouring settlements and more than doubling its population . Three bridges span the River Mersey and the Manchester Ship Canal at Runcorn : the Silver Jubilee Bridge , Mersey Gateway , and Runcorn Railway Bridge . Its location between Liverpool and Manchester and its links to the rail , motorway and canal networks have made it a centre for logistics , manufacturing , energy , and wholesale and retail ."
