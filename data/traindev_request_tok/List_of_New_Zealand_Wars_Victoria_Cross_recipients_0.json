  "/wiki/Second_Taranaki_War": "The Second Taranaki War is a term used by some historians for the period of hostilities between M\u0101ori and the New Zealand Government in the Taranaki district of New Zealand between 1863 and 1866 . The term is avoided by some historians , who either describe the conflicts as merely a series of West Coast campaigns that took place between the Taranaki War ( 1860-1861 ) and Titokowaru 's War ( 1868-69 ) , or an extension of the First Taranaki War . The conflict , which overlapped the wars in Waikato and Tauranga , was fuelled by a combination of factors : lingering M\u0101ori resentment over the sale of land at Waitara in 1860 and government delays in resolving the issue ; a large-scale land confiscation policy launched by the government in late 1863 ; and the rise of the so-called Hauhau movement , an extremist part of the Pai Marire syncretic religion , which was strongly opposed to the alienation of M\u0101ori land and eager to strengthen M\u0101ori identity . The Hauhau movement became a unifying factor for Taranaki M\u0101ori in the absence of individual M\u0101ori commanders . The style of warfare after 1863 differed markedly from that of the 1860-61 conflict , in which M\u0101ori had taken set positions and challenged the army to an open contest . From 1863 the army , working with greater numbers of troops and heavy artillery , systematically took possession of M\u0101ori land by driving off the inhabitants , adopting a scorched earth strategy of laying waste to M\u0101ori villages and cultivations , with attacks on villages , whether warlike or otherwise . As the troops advanced , the Government built an expanding line of redoubts , behind which settlers built homes and developed farms . The effect was a creeping confiscation of almost a million acres ( 4,000 km\u00b2 ) of land , with little distinction between the land of loyal or rebel M\u0101ori owners . The Government 's war policy was opposed by the British commander , General Duncan Cameron , who clashed with Governor Sir George Grey and offered his resignation in February 1865 . He left New Zealand six months later . Cameron , who viewed the war as a form of land plunder , had urged the Colonial Office to withdraw British troops from New Zealand and from the end of 1865 the Imperial forces began to leave , replaced by an expanding New Zealand military force . Among the new colonial forces were specialist Forest Ranger units , which embarked on lengthy search-and-destroy missions deep into the bush .",
  "/wiki/Charles_Heaphy": "Charles Heaphy VC ( 1820 - 3 August 1881 ) was an English-born New Zealand explorer and recipient of the Victoria Cross ( VC ) , the highest military award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces . He was the first soldier of the New Zealand armed forces to be awarded the VC . He was also a noted artist and executed several works of early colonial life in New Zealand . Born in England , Heaphy joined the New Zealand Company in 1839 . He arrived in New Zealand later that year and was commissioned to create art for advertising the country to potential English migrants . Much of the next two and half years was spent travelling and executing paintings of landscapes and life around the centre of the country . When his contract with the company ended in 1842 , he lived in Nelson for several years and explored large parts of the West Coast . He later moved north to Auckland to take up employment as a surveyor . During the Invasion of the Waikato , his militia unit was mobilised and it was his conduct at Paterangi , where he rescued British soldiers under fire , that saw him awarded the VC . As well as being the first soldier of New Zealand armed forces to receive the VC , he was the first recipient to be a militiaman . After his military service ended , Heaphy served a term as Member of Parliament for Parnell . From 1870 to 1881 , he held a variety of civil service positions .",
  "/wiki/Invasion_of_Waikato": "The Invasion of the Waikato was the biggest and most important campaign of the 19th century New Zealand Wars , fought in the North Island of New Zealand between the military forces of the colonial government and a federation of M\u0101ori tribes known as the Kingitanga Movement . The Waikato is a territorial region with a northern boundary somewhat south of the city of Auckland . Hostilities lasted for nine months , from July 1863 to April 1864 . The invasion was aimed at crushing Kingite power , which was seen as a threat to British authority , and also at driving Waikato M\u0101ori from their territory in readiness for occupation and settlement by Europeans . The campaign was fought by a peak of about 14,000 Imperial and colonial troops and about 4,000 M\u0101ori warriors drawn from more than half the major North Island tribal groups . Plans for the invasion were drawn up at the close of the First Taranaki War in 1861 but were opposed by the Colonial Office and New Zealand General Assembly and suspended by incoming Governor Sir George Grey in December of that year . Grey reactivated the invasion plans in June 1863 amid mounting tension between Kingites and the colonial government and fears of a violent raid on Auckland by Kingite M\u0101ori . Grey used as the trigger for the invasion Kingite rejection of his ultimatum on 9 July 1863 that all M\u0101ori living between Auckland and the Waikato take an oath of allegiance to Queen Victoria or be expelled south of the Waikato River . Troops crossed into Waikato territory three days later and launched their first attack on 17 July at Koheroa , but were unable to advance for another 14 weeks . The subsequent war included the Battle of Rangiriri - which cost both sides more men than any other engagement of the New Zealand Wars - and the three-day-long Battle of \u014cr\u0101kau , probably the best-known engagement of the New Zealand Wars and which inspired two films called Rewi 's Last Stand . The campaign ended with the retreat of the Kingitanga M\u0101ori into the rugged interior of the North Island and the confiscation of about 12,000 km2 of M\u0101ori land . The defeat and confiscations left the King Movement tribes with a legacy of poverty and bitterness that was partly assuaged in 1995 when the government conceded that the 1863 invasion and confiscation was wrongful and apologised for its actions .",

  "/wiki/First_Taranaki_War": "The First Taranaki War ( also known as the North Taranaki War ) was an armed conflict over land ownership and sovereignty that took place between M\u0101ori and the New Zealand Government in the Taranaki district of New Zealand 's North Island from March 1860 to March 1861 . The war was sparked by a dispute between the government and M\u0101ori landowners over the sale of a property at Waitara , but spread throughout the region . It was fought by more than 3,500 imperial troops brought in from Australia , as well as volunteer soldiers and militia , against M\u0101ori forces that fluctuated between a few hundred and about 1,500 . Total losses among the imperial , volunteer and militia troops are estimated to have been 238 , while M\u0101ori casualties totalled about 200 , although the proportion of M\u0101ori casualties was higher . The war ended in a ceasefire , with neither side explicitly accepting the peace terms of the other . Although there were claims by the British that they had won the war , there were widely held views at the time they had suffered an unfavourable and humiliating result . Historians have also been divided on the result . Historian James Belich has claimed that the M\u0101ori succeeded in thwarting the British bid to impose sovereignty over them , and had therefore been victorious . But he said the M\u0101ori victory was a hollow one , leading to the invasion of the Waikato . In its 1996 report to the Government on Taranaki land claims , the Waitangi Tribunal observed that the war was begun by the Government , which had been the aggressor and unlawful in its actions in launching an attack by its armed forces . An opinion sought by the tribunal from a senior constitutional lawyer stated that the Governor , Thomas Gore Browne , and certain officers were liable for criminal and civil charges for their actions . The term First Taranaki War is opposed by some historians , who refer only to the Taranaki Wars , rejecting suggestions that post-1861 conflict was a second war .",
