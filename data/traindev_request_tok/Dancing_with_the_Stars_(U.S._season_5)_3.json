  "/wiki/Cha-cha-cha_(dance)": "The Cha Cha Cha ( sometimes called cha-cha ) , is a dance of Cuban origin . It is danced to the music of the same name introduced by Cuban composer and violinist Enrique Jorrin in the early 1950s . This rhythm was developed from the danz\u00f3n-mambo . The name of the dance is an onomatopoeia derived from the shuffling sound of the dancers ' feet when they dance two consecutive quick steps ( correctly , on the fourth count of each measure ) that characterize the dance . In the early 1950s , Enrique Jorr\u00edn worked as a violinist and composer with the charanga group Orquesta Am\u00e9rica . The group performed at dance halls in Havana where they played danz\u00f3n , danzonete , and danzon-mambo for dance-oriented crowds . Jorr\u00edn noticed that many of the dancers at these gigs had difficulty with the syncopated rhythms of the danz\u00f3n-mambo . To make his music more appealing to dancers , Jorr\u00edn began composing songs where the melody was marked strongly on the first downbeat and the rhythm was less syncopated . When Orquesta Am\u00e9rica performed these new compositions at the Silver Star Club in Havana , it was noticed that the dancers had improvised a triple step in their footwork producing the sound cha-cha-cha . Thus , the new style came to be known as cha-cha-ch\u00e1 and became associated with a dance where dancers perform a triple step . The basic footwork pattern of cha-cha-ch\u00e1 ( one , two , three , cha-cha ) is also found in several Afro-Cuban dances from the Santer\u00eda religion . For example , one of the steps used in the dance for the orisha Ogun uses an identical footwork pattern .",

  "/wiki/Viennese_waltz": "Viennese waltz ( German : Wiener Walzer ) is a genre of ballroom dance . At least four different meanings are recognized . In the historically first sense , the name may refer to several versions of the waltz , including the earliest waltzes done in ballroom dancing , danced to the music of Viennese waltz . What is now called the Viennese waltz is the original form of the waltz . It was the first ballroom dance performed in the closed hold or waltz position . The dance that is popularly known as the waltz is actually the English or slow waltz , danced at approximately 90 beats per minute with 3 beats to the bar ( the international standard of 30 measures per minute ) , while the Viennese waltz is danced at about 180 beats ( 58-60 measures ) per minute . To this day however , in Germany , Austria , Scandinavia , and France , the words Walzer ( German ) , vals ( Danish , Norwegian , and Swedish ) , and valse ( French ) still implicitly refer to the original dance and not the slow waltz . The Viennese waltz is a rotary dance where the dancers are constantly turning either toward the leader 's right ( natural ) or toward the leader 's left ( reverse ) , interspersed with non-rotating change steps to switch between the direction of rotation . As the waltz evolved , some of the versions that were done at about the original fast tempo came to be called specifically Viennese waltz to distinguish them from the slower waltzes . In the modern ballroom dance , two versions of Viennese waltz are recognized : International Style and American Style . Today the Viennese waltz is a ballroom and partner dance that is part of the International Standard division of contemporary ballroom dance .",

  "/wiki/Street_dance": "A street dance is a dance style that evolved outside dance studios in any available open space such as streets , dance parties , block parties , parks , school yards , raves , and nightclubs . A street dance is a vernacular dance in an urban context . Vernacular dances are often improvisational and social in nature , encouraging interaction and contact with spectators and other dancers . These dances are a part of the vernacular culture of the geographical area that they come from . Examples of street dance include b-boying ( or breakdancing ) , which originated in New York City . Clogging is a very early form of street dance , since it evolved in the streets and factories of Northern England in the mid-19th century . Various street dances have lent themselves to the style of urban dance , which arose from the collegiate dance scene . Urban dance is choreography-oriented but is inspired by different street dance styles and fundamental moves , such as house , locking , and popping . Urban dance should not be mistaken with hip hop , the culture and art movement that began in the Bronx in New York City during the late 1970s ."
