  "/wiki/African_American": "African Americans ( also referred to as Black Americans or Afro-Americans ) are an ethnic group of Americans with total or partial ancestry from any of the black racial groups of Africa . The phrase generally refers to descendants of enslaved black people who are from the United States . African Americans constitute the third largest ethnic group and the second largest racial group in the US , after White Americans and Hispanic and Latino Americans . Most African Americans are descendants of enslaved peoples within the boundaries of the present United States . On average , African Americans are of West/Central African and European descent , and some also have Native American ancestry . According to U.S. Census Bureau data , African immigrants generally do not self-identify as African American . The overwhelming majority of African immigrants identify instead with their own respective ethnicities ( \u224895% ) . Immigrants from some Caribbean , Central American , and South American nations and their descendants may or may not also self-identify with the term . African-American history starts in the 16th century , with peoples from West Africa forcibly taken as slaves to Latin America , and in the 17th century with West African slaves taken to English colonies in North America . After the founding of the United States , black people continued to be enslaved , and the last four million black slaves were only liberated after the Civil War in 1865 . Due to notions of white supremacy , they were treated as second-class citizens . The Naturalization Act of 1790 limited U.S. citizenship to whites only , and only white men who owned property could vote .",

  "/wiki/Dodge_Brothers": "Dodge is an American brand of automobile manufactured by FCA US LLC ( formerly known as Fiat Chrysler Group LLC ) , based in Auburn Hills , Michigan . Dodge vehicles currently include performance cars , though for much of its existence Dodge was Chrysler 's mid-priced brand above Plymouth . Founded as the Dodge Brothers Company machine shop by brothers Horace Elgin Dodge and John Francis Dodge in the early 1900s , Dodge was originally a supplier of parts and assemblies for Detroit-based automakers and began building complete automobiles under the Dodge Brothers brand in 1914 , predating the founding of Chrysler Corporation . The factory was located in Hamtramck , Michigan , and was called the Dodge Main factory from 1910 until its closing in January 1980 . Both the Dodge brothers died in 1920 , and the company was sold by their families to Dillon , Read & Co. in 1925 before being sold to Chrysler in 1928 . Dodge branded vehicles mainly consisted of trucks and full-sized passenger cars through the 1970s , though it made compact cars ( such as the 1963-76 Dart ) and midsize cars ( such as the B-Body Coronet and Charger from 1966-78 ) . The 1973 oil crisis and its subsequent impact on the American automobile industry led Chrysler to develop the K platform of compact to midsize cars for the 1981 model year . The K platform and its derivatives are credited with reviving Chrysler 's business in the 1980s ; one such derivative became the Dodge Caravan . The Dodge brand has withstood the multiple ownership changes at Chrysler from 1998 to 2009 , including its short-lived merger with Daimler-Benz AG from 1998 to 2007 , its subsequent sale to Cerberus Capital Management , its 2009 bailout by the United States government , and its subsequent Chapter 11 bankruptcy and acquisition by Fiat . In 2011 , Dodge and its model sub-brands , Dodge Ram , and Dodge Viper were separated . Dodge said that the Viper would be an SRT product and Ram will be a standalone marque . In 2014 , SRT was merged back into Dodge .",

The history of human activity on Polish soil spans almost 500,000 years . Throughout the Iron Age the area became extensively diverse , with various cultures and tribes settling on the vast Central European Plain . However , it was the Western Polans who dominated the region and gave Poland its name . The establishment of Polish statehood can be traced to AD 966 , when Mieszko I , ruler of the realm coextensive with the territory of present-day Poland , converted to Christianity . The Kingdom of Poland was founded in 1025 , and in 1569 it cemented its longstanding political association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the Union of Lublin . This union formed the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , one of the largest ( over 1,000,000 square kilometres - 400,000 square miles ) and most populous countries of 16th and 17th century Europe , with a uniquely liberal political system which adopted Europe 's first written national constitution , the Constitution of 3 May 1791 .",

A wide-ranging Polish diaspora ( the Polonia ) exists throughout Europe , the Americas , and in Australasia . Today , the largest urban concentrations of Poles are within the Warsaw and Silesian metropolitan areas . Poland 's history dates back over a thousand years , to c. 930-960 AD , when the Western Polans - an influential tribe in the Greater Poland region , now home to such cities as Pozna\u0144 , Gniezno , Kalisz , Konin and Wrze\u015bnia - united various Lechitic clans under what became the Piast dynasty , thus creating the first Polish state . The subsequent Christianization of Poland by the Catholic Church , in 966 CE , marked Poland 's advent to the community of Western Christendom . However , throughout its existence , the Polish state followed a tolerant policy towards minorities resulting in numerous ethnic and religious identities of the Poles , such as Polish Jews . Poles have made important contributions to the world in every major field of human endeavor , among them Copernicus , Marie Curie , Joseph Conrad , Fryderyk Chopin and Pope John Paul II . Notable Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9s - many of them forced from their homeland by historic vicissitudes - have included physicist Joseph Rotblat , mathematician Stanis\u0142aw Ulam , pianist Arthur Rubinstein , actresses Helena Modjeska and Pola Negri , military leaders Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko and Casimir Pulaski , U.S. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski , politician Rosa Luxemburg , painter Tamara de Lempicka , filmmakers Samuel Goldwyn and the Warner Brothers , cartoonist Max Fleischer , and cosmeticians Helena Rubinstein and Max Factor .",

Ford Motor Company also established a presence in Milwaukee Junction when it opened the Piquette Avenue Plant . This was the factory where the Ford Model T was first built before being mass-produced in neighboring Highland Park at the Highland Park Ford Plant . Henry Ford also conducted experiments in assembly line production at the Piquette Avenue Plant , which was used later in Highland Park . Earlier models of the Ford line were also conceived and produced there , including the Ford Model N. The dominance of Milwaukee Junction in the auto industry lasted until the 1920s . It is now considered the cradle of the Detroit auto industry . The attraction of this railroad junction continues into even modern times , with Cadillac building the Poletown Plant adjacent to the junction in the early 1980s . It is almost on the site of the original 1908 Cadillac Motor Car Assembly Plant assembly plant , and less than 5 miles away from the Cadillac Main Detroit Assembly built in 1920 within the V of another railroad junction ( at Junction Street ) on the same Grand Trunk Western line .",

New Center , and the surrounding areas north of I-94 , are sometimes seen as coterminous with the North End , while in fact separate districts . The heart of New Center was developed in the 1920s as a business hub that would offer convenient access to both downtown resources and outlying factories . Some historians believe that New Center may be the original edge city - a sub-center remote from , but related to , a main urban core . The descriptor New Center derived its name from the New Center News , an automotive-focused free newspaper begun in 1933 that continues to operate under the name Detroit Auto Scene . From 1923 to 1996 , General Motors maintained its world headquarters in New Center ( in what is now Cadillac Place ) before relocating downtown to the Renaissance Center ; before becoming a division of GM , Fisher Body was headquartered in the Fisher Building . Both Cadillac Place and the Fisher Building are National Historic Landmarks .

  "/wiki/Outer_Drive": "Outer Drive is a bypass road which encircles both the eastern and western portions of the Detroit , Michigan region . It resembles a jagged horseshoe and was not originally intended to move traffic as much as it was to provide a pleasurable drive around the City of Detroit and some of its suburbs . A boulevard for the vast majority of its length , Outer Drive includes travel through beautiful subdivisions , school sites , and park areas . First proposed in 1918 , it immediately won acceptance and eventually evolved into the thoroughfare which exists today . A 1929 article in Michigan Women magazine , predicted a .great pleasure boulevard . that would be .like a necklace around Detroit . However , in an article dated August 4 , 2004 , in the Metro Times , Michigan author Curt Guyette described Outer Drive as .one of the oddest city thoroughfares in the country . Outer Drive was once famous for the elm trees that lined the wandering roadway at one time , but in a circa-1983 WXYZ-TV report about Outer Drive , reporter Erik Smith of the local ABC affiliate , declared that .now , it may be more famous for its potholes . While mostly within the Detroit city limits , Outer Drive also ventures into the cities of Allen Park , Dearborn , Dearborn Heights , Ecorse , Lincoln Park , and Melvindale . At its western starting point at Jefferson Avenue in Ecorse near the Detroit River , the thoroughfare meanders northwesterly to Michigan Avenue , where it makes a northeast bend along the River Rouge ; it then continues northeasterly with several 90 degree angle turns until Outer Drive ends at Livernois Avenue . Outer Drive then resumes on Detroit 's east side , over-taking State Fair Avenue , Conner Avenue , Alter Road , Chandler Park Drive , and Whittier Avenue , with its eastern terminus at Mack Avenue at the northern edge of the City of Grosse Pointe Park , but not actually entering that city . Outer Drive is notable for having several isolated divided portions .",

  "/wiki/Tudors": "The House of Tudor was an English royal house of Welsh origin , descended from the Tudors of Penmynydd . Tudor monarchs ruled the Kingdom of England and its realms , including their ancestral Wales and the Lordship of Ireland ( later the Kingdom of Ireland ) from 1485 until 1603 , with five monarchs in that period : Henry VII , Henry VIII , Edward VI , Mary I and Elizabeth I . The Tudors succeeded the House of Plantagenet as rulers of the Kingdom of England , and were succeeded by the House of Stuart . The first Tudor monarch , Henry VII of England , descended through his mother from a legitimised branch of the English royal House of Lancaster . The Tudor family rose to power in the wake of the Wars of the Roses ( 1455-1487 ) , which left the House of Lancaster , with which the Tudors were aligned , extinct in the male line . Henry VII succeeded in presenting himself as a candidate not only for traditional Lancastrian supporters , but also for discontented supporters of their rival House of York , and he took the throne by right of conquest . Following his victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field ( 22 August 1485 ) , he reinforced his position in 1486 by fulfilling his 1483 vow to marry Elizabeth of York , daughter of Edward IV , thus symbolically uniting the former warring factions under the new dynasty . The Tudors extended their power beyond modern England , achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542 ( Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 ) , and successfully asserting English authority over the Kingdom of Ireland ( proclaimed by the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 ) . They also maintained the nominal English claim to the Kingdom of France ; although none of them made substance of it , Henry VIII fought wars with France trying to reclaim that title . After him , his daughter Mary I lost control of all territory in France permanently with the fall of Calais in 1558 . In total , the Tudor monarchs ruled their domains for just over a century . Henry VIII ( r. 1509-1547 ) was the only son of Henry VII to live to the age of maturity .",
