  "/wiki/Bethune:_The_Making_of_a_Hero": "Bethune : The Making of a Hero is a 1990 Canadian biographical period drama film about the life and death of Dr. Norman Bethune , a Canadian-born physician who served as a combat surgeon during the Chinese Civil War . It was directed by Phillip Borsos , written by Ted Allan , and starred Donald Sutherland as Bethune , alongside Helen Mirren , Helen Shaver , Colm Feore , James Pax , Guo Da , Anouk Aim\u00e9e , and Ronald Pickup . It was nominated for numerous awards in 1991 and 1993 . A rare Canadian epic , Bethune : The Making of a Hero is more famous for its arduous production in China ( it was the first Canada-China co-production , and one of the first large-scale Western productions in that country ) and the bickering between the star and the writer than for anything else . Right from the start Donald Sutherland and Ted Allan clashed over the interpretation of Bethune 's legacy . Sutherland ( who somewhat resembles Bethune ) passionately believed that despite his drinking and womanizing , Bethune became a saintly hero in China , whereas Allan ( who had served with Bethune in Spain ) equally passionately believed he might have been a hero but remained a deeply flawed man until the end . Director Phillip Borsos was caught in the middle of these conflicting visions , and ultimately lost control of the film 's direction during post-production . Despite these setbacks , the film was a critical and financial success , and was nominated for four Genie Awards , winning one for Best Costume Design .",

Originally founded in 1642 as Ville-Marie , or City of Mary , it is named after Mount Royal , the triple-peaked hill in the heart of the city . The city is centred on the Island of Montreal , which got its name from the same origin as the city , and a few much smaller peripheral islands , the largest of which is \u00cele Bizard . It has a distinct four-season continental climate with warm to hot summers and cold , snowy winters .

Bethune came to international prominence first for his service as a frontline surgeon supporting the Republican faction during the Spanish Civil War . But it was his service with the Communist Eighth Route Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War that would earn him enduring acclaim . Dr. Bethune effectively brought modern medicine to rural China and often treated sick villagers as much as wounded soldiers . His selfless commitment made a profound impression on the Chinese people , especially CPC 's leader , Mao Zedong . Mao wrote a eulogy to him , which was memorized by generations of Chinese people . Bethune is credited for saving millions of Chinese soldiers and civilians during the Second-Sino Japanese War , and is known worldwide as one of the most influential doctors of all time . While Bethune was the man responsible for developing a mobile blood-transfusion service for frontline operations in the Spanish Civil War , he himself died of blood poisoning . A prominent communist and veteran of the First World War , he wrote that wars were motivated by profits , not principles . Statues in his honour can be found in cities throughout China .",
  "/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War": "The Spanish Civil War ( Spanish : Guerra Civil Espa\u00f1ola ) [ note 2 ] was a civil war in Spain fought from 1936 to 1939 . Republicans loyal to the left-leaning Second Spanish Republic , in alliance with anarchists and communists , fought against a revolt by the Nationalists , an alliance of Falangists , monarchists , conservatives and Catholics , led by a military group among whom General Francisco Franco soon achieved a preponderant role . Due to the international political climate at the time , the war had many facets and was variously viewed as class struggle , a war of religion , a struggle between dictatorship and republican democracy , between revolution and counterrevolution , and between fascism and communism . It has been frequently called the dress rehearsal for World War II . The Nationalists won the war , which ended in early 1939 , and ruled Spain until Franco 's death in November 1975 . The war began after a pronunciamiento ( a declaration of military opposition ) against the Republican government by a group of generals of the Spanish Republican Armed Forces , originally under the leadership of Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo . The government at the time was a coalition of Republicans , supported in the Cortes by communist and socialist parties , under the leadership of centre-left President Manuel Aza\u00f1a . The Nationalist group was supported by a number of conservative groups , including CEDA , monarchists , including both the opposing Alfonsists and the religious conservative Carlists , and the FE de las JONS , a fascist political party . After the deaths of Sanjurjo , Emilio Mola and Manuel Goded Llopis , Franco emerged as the remaining leader of the Nationalist side . The coup was supported by military units in the Spanish protectorate in Morocco , Pamplona , Burgos , Zaragoza , Valladolid , C\u00e1diz , C\u00f3rdoba , and Seville . However , rebelling units in some important cities - such as Madrid , Barcelona , Valencia , Bilbao , and M\u00e1laga - did not gain control , and those cities remained under the control of the government . This left Spain militarily and politically divided .",

Ideologically a Marxist-Leninist , his theories , military strategies , and political policies are collectively known as Maoism . Mao was the son of a prosperous peasant in Shaoshan , Hunan . He had a Chinese nationalist and an anti-imperialist outlook early in his life , and was particularly influenced by the events of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 and May Fourth Movement of 1919 . He later adopted Marxism-Leninism while working at Peking University , and became a founding member of the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) , leading the Autumn Harvest Uprising in 1927 . During the Chinese Civil War between the Kuomintang ( KMT ) and the CPC , Mao helped to found the Chinese Workers ' and Peasants ' Red Army , led the Jiangxi Soviet 's radical land policies , and ultimately became head of the CPC during the Long March . Although the CPC temporarily allied with the KMT under the United Front during the Second Sino-Japanese War ( 1937-1945 ) , China 's civil war resumed after Japan 's surrender and in 1949 Mao 's forces defeated the Nationalist government , which withdrew to Taiwan . On October 1 , 1949 , Mao proclaimed the foundation of the PRC , a single-party state controlled by the CPC . In the following years he solidified his control through campaigns against landlords , suppression of counter-revolutionaries , Three-anti and Five-anti Campaigns and through a psychological victory in the Korean War , which altogether caused the deaths of several-million Chinese . From 1953-1958 , Mao played an important role in enforcing planned economy in China , constructing the first Constitution of the PRC , launching the industrialisation program , and initiating the Two Bombs , One Satellite project . On the other hand , in 1957 , Mao launched the Anti-Rightist Campaign , which persecuted at least 550,000 people , most of whom were intellectuals and dissidents , and in 1958 he launched the Great Leap Forward that aimed to rapidly transform China 's economy from agrarian to industrial . The latter led to the deadliest famine in history and the deaths of 20-46 million people between 1958 and 1962 .",

Although psychological gratification is the usual motive for serial killing , and most serial killings involve sexual contact with the victim , the FBI states that the motives of serial killers can include anger , thrill-seeking , financial gain , and attention seeking . The murders may be attempted or completed in a similar fashion . The victims may have something in common , for example , demographic profile , appearance , gender or race .

  "/wiki/Occupied_France": "The Military Administration in France ( German : Milit\u00e4rverwaltung in Frankreich ; French : Occupation de la France par l'Allemagne ) was an interim occupation authority established by Nazi Germany during World War II to administer the occupied zone in areas of northern and western France . This so-called zone occup\u00e9e was renamed zone nord ( north zone ) in November 1942 , when the previously unoccupied zone in the south known as zone libre ( free zone ) was also occupied and renamed zone sud ( south zone ) . Its role in France was partly governed by the conditions set by the Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne after the blitzkrieg success of the Wehrmacht leading to the Fall of France ; at the time both French and Germans thought the occupation would be temporary and last only until Britain came to terms , which was believed to be imminent . For instance , France agreed that its soldiers would remain prisoners of war until the cessation of all hostilities . Replacing the French Third Republic that had dissolved during France 's defeat was the French State ( \u00c9tat fran\u00e7ais ) , with its sovereignty and authority limited to the free zone . As Paris was located in the occupied zone , its government was seated in the spa town of Vichy in Auvergne , and therefore it was more commonly known as Vichy France . While the Vichy government was nominally in charge of all of France , the military administration in the occupied zone was a de facto Nazi dictatorship . Its rule was extended to the free zone when it was invaded by Germany and Italy during Case Anton on 11 November 1942 in response to Operation Torch , the Allied landings in French North Africa on 8 November 1942 . The Vichy government remained in existence , even though its authority was now severely curtailed . The military administration in France ended with the Liberation of France after the Normandy and Provence landings .

The two bombings killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people , most of whom were civilians , and remain the only use of nuclear weapons in armed conflict . In the final year of World War II , the Allies prepared for a very costly invasion of the Japanese mainland . This undertaking was preceded by a conventional and firebombing campaign which devastated 67 Japanese cities . The war in Europe had concluded when Germany signed its instrument of surrender on May 8 , 1945 , and the Allies turned their full attention to the Pacific theater . The Allies called for the unconditional surrender of the Imperial Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on July 26 , 1945 , the alternative being prompt and utter destruction . Japan ignored the ultimatum and the war continued . By August 1945 , the Allies ' Manhattan Project had produced two types of atomic bombs , and the 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) was equipped with the specialized Silverplate version of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress that could deliver them from Tinian in the Mariana Islands . The Allies issued orders for atomic bombs to be used on four Japanese cities on July 25 . On August 6 , one of the modified B-29s dropped a uranium gun-type bomb ( Little Boy ) on Hiroshima .

On 6 August 1945 , during the final stages of World War II , piloted by Tibbets and Robert A. Lewis it became the first aircraft to drop an atomic bomb . The bomb , code-named Little Boy , was targeted at the city of Hiroshima , Japan , and caused the near-complete destruction of the city . Enola Gay participated in the second atomic attack as the weather reconnaissance aircraft for the primary target of Kokura . Clouds and drifting smoke resulted in a secondary target , Nagasaki , being bombed instead . After the war , the Enola Gay returned to the United States , where it was operated from Roswell Army Air Field , New Mexico . In May 1946 , it was flown to Kwajalein for the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in the Pacific , but was not chosen to make the test drop at Bikini Atoll . Later that year it was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution , and spent many years parked at air bases exposed to the weather and souvenir hunters , before being disassembled and transported to the Smithsonian 's storage facility at Suitland , Maryland , in 1961 . In the 1980s , veterans groups engaged in a call for the Smithsonian to put the aircraft on display , leading to an acrimonious debate about exhibiting the aircraft without a proper historical context .

Tibbets , Jr. , commander of the 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces and Captain Robert A. Lewis . It exploded with an energy of approximately 15 kilotons of TNT ( 63 TJ ) and caused widespread death and destruction throughout the city . The Hiroshima bombing was the second man-made nuclear explosion in history , after the Trinity test . Little Boy was developed by Lieutenant Commander Francis Birch 's group at the Manhattan Project 's Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II , a development of the unsuccessful Thin Man nuclear bomb . Like Thin Man , it was a gun-type fission weapon , but it derived its explosive power from the nuclear fission of uranium-235 , whereas Thin Man was based on fission of plutonium-239 . Fission was accomplished by shooting a hollow cylinder of enriched uranium ( the bullet ) onto a solid cylinder of the same material ( the target ) by means of a charge of nitrocellulose propellant powder . It contained 64 kg ( 141 lb ) of enriched uranium , although less than a kilogram underwent nuclear fission . Its components were fabricated at three different plants so that no one would have a copy of the complete design . After the war ended , it was not expected that the inefficient Little Boy design would ever again be required , and many plans and diagrams were destroyed . However , by mid-1946 , the Hanford Site reactors began suffering badly from the Wigner effect , the dislocation of atoms in a solid caused by neutron radiation , and plutonium became scarce , so six Little Boy assemblies were produced at Sandia Base .",

Over the centuries , Tobruk also served as a waystation along the coastal caravan route . By 1911 , Tobruk had become an Italian military post , but during World War II , Allied forces , mainly the Australian 6th Division , took Tobruk on 22 January 1941 . The Australian 9th Division ( The Rats of Tobruk ) pulled back to Tobruk to avoid encirclement after actions at Er Regima and Mechili and reached Tobruk on 9 April 1941 where prolonged fighting against German and Italian forces followed . Although the siege was lifted by Operation Crusader in November 1941 , a renewed offensive by Axis forces under Erwin Rommel the following year resulted in Tobruk being captured in June 1942 and held by the Axis forces until November 1942 , when it was recaptured by the Allies .

  "/wiki/B-17_bomber": "The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress is a four-engined heavy bomber developed in the 1930s for the United States Army Air Corps ( USAAC ) . Competing against Douglas and Martin for a contract to build 200 bombers , the Boeing entry ( prototype Model 299/XB-17 ) outperformed both competitors and exceeded the air corps ' performance specifications . Although Boeing lost the contract ( to the Douglas B-18 Bolo ) because the prototype crashed , the air corps ordered 13 more B-17s for further evaluation . From its introduction in 1938 , the B-17 Flying Fortress evolved through numerous design advances , becoming the third-most produced bomber of all time , behind the four-engined B-24 and the multirole , twin-engined Ju 88 . The B-17 was primarily employed by the USAAF in the daylight strategic bombing campaign of World War II against German industrial and military targets . The United States Eighth Air Force , based at many airfields in central , eastern and southern England , and the Fifteenth Air Force , based in Italy , complemented the RAF Bomber Command 's nighttime area bombing in the Combined Bomber Offensive to help secure air superiority over the cities , factories and battlefields of Western Europe in preparation for the invasion of France in 1944 . The B-17 also participated to a lesser extent in the War in the Pacific , early in World War II , where it conducted raids against Japanese shipping and airfields . From its prewar inception , the USAAC ( by June 1941 , the USAAF ) promoted the aircraft as a strategic weapon ; it was a relatively fast , high-flying , long-range bomber with heavy defensive armament at the expense of bombload . It developed a reputation for toughness based upon stories and photos of badly damaged B-17s safely returning to base . The B-17 dropped more bombs than any other U.S. aircraft in World War II . Of approximately 1.5 million tons of bombs dropped on Nazi Germany and its occupied territories by U.S. aircraft , over 640,000 tons were dropped from B-17s . In addition to its role as a bomber , the B-17 was also employed as a transport , antisubmarine aircraft , drone controller , and search-and-rescue aircraft .",

Due to the initially lenient arrangements , in which the Nazi occupation authority allowed the democratic government to stay in power , the resistance movement was slower to develop effective tactics on a wide scale than in some other countries . Members of the Danish resistance movement were involved in underground activities , ranging from producing illegal publications to spying and sabotage . Major groups included the communist BOPA ( Danish : Borgerlige Partisaner , Civil Partisans ) and Holger Danske , both based in Copenhagen . Some small resistance groups such as the Samsing Group and the Churchill Club also contributed to the sabotage effort . Resistance agents killed an estimated 400 Danish Nazis , informers and collaborators until 1944 . After that date , they also killed some German nationals . In the postwar period , the Resistance was supported by politicians within Denmark and there was little effort to closely examine the killings . Studies were made in the late 20th and early 21st centuries , and people learned that there was sometimes improvised and contingent decision making about the targets , with some morally ambiguous choices .

Under the leadership of 15-year-old Knud Pedersen , their activities began at the end of 1941 when they began to target the German occupation forces in Aalborg to imitate the resistance of Norwegian soldiers . They succeeded in carrying out 25 acts of sabotage before they were arrested by the police in May 1942 . Some of those acts of sabotage included stealing weapons and destroying vehicles , blueprints , and plane parts .

Contrary to the situation in other countries under German occupation , most Danish institutions continued to function relatively normally until 1945 . Both the Danish government and king remained in the country in an uneasy relationship between a democratic and a totalitarian system until the Danish government stepped down in a protest against the German demands to institute the death penalty for sabotage Just over 3,000 Danes died as a direct result of the occupation . ( A further 2,000 volunteers of Free Corps Denmark and Waffen SS , of which most originated from the German minority of southern Denmark , died fighting on the German side on the Eastern Front while 1,072 merchant sailors died in Allied service . ) Overall this represents a very low mortality rate when compared to other occupied countries and most belligerent countries .

  "/wiki/Anime": "Anime ( US : /\u02c8\u00e6n\u0259\u02ccme\u026a/ , UK : /\u02c8\u00e6n\u026a\u02ccme\u026a/ ) ( Japanese : \u30a2\u30cb\u30e1 , Hepburn : anime , [ a\u0272ime ] ( listen ) , plural : anime ) [ a ] is hand-drawn and computer animation originating from or associated with Japan . The word anime is the Japanese term for animation , which means all forms of animated media . Outside Japan , anime refers specifically to animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics , vibrant characters and fantastical themes . The culturally abstract approach to the word 's meaning may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan . Many Westerners strictly view anime as a Japanese animation product . Some scholars suggest defining anime as specifically or quintessentially Japanese may be related to a new form of Orientalism . The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917 , and Japanese anime production has since continued to increase steadily . The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century , developing a large domestic and international audience . Anime is distributed theatrically , by way of television broadcasts , directly to home media , and over the Internet . It is classified into numerous genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences . Anime is a diverse art form with distinctive production methods and techniques that have been adapted over time in response to emergent technologies . It combines graphic art , characterization , cinematography , and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques .",
  "/wiki/Bombing_of_Tokyo_(10_March_1945)": "On the night of 9/10 March 1945 the United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) conducted a devastating firebombing raid on Tokyo , the Japanese capital city . This attack was code-named Operation Meetinghouse by the USAAF and is known as the Great Tokyo Air Raid in Japan . Bombs dropped from 279 Boeing B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers burned out much of eastern Tokyo . More than 90,000 and possibly over 100,000 Japanese , mostly civilians , were killed and one million left homeless , making it the most destructive single air attack of World War II . The Japanese air and civil defenses proved inadequate , and only 14 American aircraft and 96 airmen were lost . The attack on Tokyo was an intensification of the air raids on Japan which had commenced in June 1944 . Prior to this operation , the USAAF had focused on a precision bombing campaign against Japanese industrial facilities . These attacks were generally unsuccessful , which contributed to the decision to shift to firebombing . The operation during the early hours of 10 March was the first major firebombing raid against a Japanese city , and the USAAF units employed significantly different tactics than those used in precision raids including bombing by night with the aircraft flying at low altitudes . The extensive destruction caused by the raid led these tactics to become standard for the USAAF 's B-29s until the end of the war . There has been a long-running debate over the morality of the 10 March firebombing of Tokyo . The raid is often cited as a key example in criticisms of the Allies ' strategic bombing campaigns , with some historians and commentators arguing that it was not acceptable for the USAAF to deliberately target civilians .",
