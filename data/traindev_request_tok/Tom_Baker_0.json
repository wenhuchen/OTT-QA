Rasputin was born to a peasant family in the Siberian village of Pokrovskoye in the Tyumensky Uyezd of Tobolsk Governorate ( now Yarkovsky District of Tyumen Oblast ) . He had a religious conversion experience after taking a pilgrimage to a monastery in 1897 . He has been described as a monk or as a strannik ( wanderer or pilgrim ) , though he held no official position in the Russian Orthodox Church . He traveled to St. Petersburg in 1903 or the winter of 1904-05 , where he captivated some church and social leaders . He became a society figure and met the Tsar in November 1905 . In late 1906 , Rasputin began acting as a healer for the only son of Tsar Nicholas II , Alexei , who suffered from hemophilia . He was a divisive figure at court , seen by some Russians as a mystic , visionary , and prophet , and by others as a religious charlatan . The high point of Rasputin 's power was in 1915 when Nicholas II left St. Petersburg to oversee Russian armies fighting World War I , increasing both Alexandra and Rasputin 's influence . Russian defeats mounted during the war , however , and both Rasputin and Alexandra became increasingly unpopular .",

Born into the prominent political and banking Medici family of Florence , Giovanni was the second son of Lorenzo de ' Medici , ruler of the Florentine Republic , and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1489 . Following the death of Pope Julius II , Giovanni was elected pope after securing the backing of the younger members of the Sacred College . Early on in his rule he oversaw the closing sessions of the Fifth Council of the Lateran , but struggled to implement the reforms agreed . In 1517 he led a costly war that succeeded in securing his nephew as Duke of Urbino , but which reduced papal finances . In Protestant circles , Leo is associated with granting indulgences for those who donated to reconstruct St. Peter 's Basilica , a practice that was soon challenged by Martin Luther 's 95 Theses . He refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the demands of what would become the Protestant Reformation , and his Papal Bull of 1520 , Exsurge Domine , condemned Martin Luther 's condemnatory stance , rendering ongoing communication difficult . He borrowed and spent money without circumspection and was a significant patron of the arts . Under his reign , progress was made on the rebuilding of St. Peter 's Basilica and artists such as Raphael decorated the Vatican rooms . Leo also reorganised the Roman University , and promoted the study of literature , poetry and antiquities . He died in 1521 and is buried in Santa Maria sopra Minerva , Rome . He was the last pope not to have been in priestly orders at the time of his election to the papacy .",
