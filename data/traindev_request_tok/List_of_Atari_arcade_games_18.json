The game is the sequel of 1989 's Hard Drivin ' and was part of a new generation of games that featured 3D polygon environments . Unlike most racing games of its time , it attempted to model real world car physics in the simulation of the movement of the player 's car . Like Hard Drivin ' , the game was unique among video games in that it included a true force feedback steering wheel , an ignition key , a four-speed shifter , and three foot pedals : an accelerator , a brake , and a clutch , the clutch being a control seldom seen in any video game , then or now ) . Released in August 1990 , approximately 1200 units were produced at the time of its release for roughly $ 9000 each .

  "/wiki/Rebound_(video_game)": "Rebound is a two-player sports arcade video game developed by Atari , Inc. and released in February 1974 . In the game , two players each control paddles on either side of a volleyball net , with a ball dropped from the top of the screen . The players bounce the ball back and forth across the net with the goal of scoring points by having the ball reach the bottom or side of the other player 's half of the screen , with the trajectory of the ball dependent on where it strikes the paddle . The winner is the first player to reach eleven or fifteen points , depending on the game settings . Development of Rebound began in late 1973 , as one of several variations they produced in 1974 on the gameplay of the successful Pong ( 1972 ) , Atari 's first game and the fourth-ever arcade game . Around the same time , Atari launched Kee Games , a subsidiary meant to produce clone games of Atari 's products and act as a competitor in order to expand into more distribution channels in the same region than the industry typically supported . Kee 's first game , released in March 1974 , was Spike , a clone of Rebound , which added a spike button to the game that made the paddle jump up and attempt to bounce the ball downwards instead of up . In addition to the base game , Atari sold a conversion kit to convert any Atari two-player Pong variant into Rebound , and in 1977 Rebound was included in Video Olympics for the Atari 2600 , a collection of Pong variants .",

  "/wiki/Volleyball": "Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net . Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team 's court under organized rules . It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964 . The complete set of rules are extensive , but play essentially proceeds as follows : a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally ' by serving the ball ( tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm ) , from behind the back boundary line of the court , over the net , and into the receiving team 's court . The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court . The team may touch the ball up to 3 times , but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively . Typically , the first two touches are used to set up for an attack , an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court . The rally continues , with each team allowed as many as three consecutive touches , until either ( 1 ) : a team makes a kill , grounding the ball on the opponent 's court and winning the rally ; or ( 2 ) : a team commits a fault and loses the rally . The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next rally . A few of the most common faults include :",

  "/wiki/World_War_I": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",

  "/wiki/Baseball": "Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding . The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team , called the pitcher , throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat . The objective of the offensive team ( batting team ) is to hit the ball into the field of play , allowing its players to run the bases , having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called runs . The objective of the defensive team ( fielding team ) is to prevent batters from becoming runners , and to prevent runners ' advance around the bases . A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate ( the place where the player started as a batter ) . The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner . The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely . A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called out can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner , either immediately or during teammates ' turns batting . The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners out , which forces them out of the field of play . Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team 's players out . The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding ; the batting team 's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs . One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning .",

  "/wiki/Raster_graphics": "In computer graphics , a raster graphics or bitmap image is a dot matrix data structure that represents a generally rectangular grid of pixels ( points of color ) , viewable via a monitor , paper , or other display medium . Raster images are stored in image files with varying formats . A bitmap is a rectangular grid of pixels , with each pixel 's color being specified by a number of bits . A bitmap might be created for storage in the display 's video memory or as a device-independent bitmap file . A raster is technically characterized by the width and height of the image in pixels and by the number of bits per pixel ( or color depth , which determines the number of colors it can represent ) . The printing and prepress industries know raster graphics as contones ( from continuous tones ) . The opposite to contones is line work , usually implemented as vector graphics in digital systems . Vector images can be rasterized ( converted into pixels ) , and raster images vectorized ( raster images converted into vector graphics ) , by software . In both cases some information is lost , although vectorizing can also restore some information back to machine readability , as happens in optical character recognition .",

Well known examples of power-ups that have entered popular culture include the power pellets from Pac-Man ( regarded as the first power-up ) and the Super Mushroom from Super Mario Bros. , which ranked first in UGO Networks ' Top 11 Video Game Powerups . Items that confer power-ups are usually pre-placed in the game world , spawned randomly , dropped by beaten enemies or picked up from opened or smashed containers . They can be differentiated from items in other games , such as role-playing video games , by the fact that they take effect immediately , feature designs that do not necessarily fit into the game world ( often used letters or symbols emblazoned on a design ) , and are found in specific genres of games .

Instead of his animal instincts , the Coyote uses absurdly complex contraptions ( sometimes in the manner of Rube Goldberg ) to try to catch his prey , which backfire comically , with the Coyote often getting injured in slapstick fashion . Many of the items for these contrivances are mail-ordered from a variety of companies that are all named Acme . One running gag running gag involves the Coyote falling from a high cliff . After he goes over the edge , the rest of the scene , shot from a bird's-eye view , shows him falling into a canyon so deep , that his figure is eventually lost to sight . This is followed , a second or two later , by the rising of a dust cloud from the canyon floor as the Coyote hits . Most of the cartoons identify the characters and show a fake Latin species name . The Road Runner is called by such names as Accelerati incredibilus , Velocitus tremenjus , Birdibus zippibus , Speedipus rex and Morselus babyfatious tastius . Species names for Wile E. Coyote include Carnivorous slobbius , Eatius birdius , Overconfidentii vulgaris , Poor schinookiusor Caninus nervousrex . The characters were created by animation director Chuck Jones and writer Michael Maltese in 1948 for Warner Bros. , while the template for their adventures was the work of writer Michael Maltese .

  "/wiki/Train": "A train is a form of rail transport consisting of a series of connected vehicles that generally run along a railroad ( or railway ) track to transport passengers or cargo ( also known as freight or goods ) . The word train comes from the Old French trahiner , derived from the Latin trahere meaning to pull or to draw . Motive power for a train is provided by a separate locomotive or individual motors in a self-propelled multiple unit . The term engine is often used as an alternative to locomotive . Although historically steam propulsion dominated , the most common types of locomotive are diesel and electric , the latter supplied by overhead wires or additional rails . Trains can also be hauled by horses , pulled by engine or water-driven cable or wire winch , run downhill using gravity , or powered by pneumatics , gas turbines or batteries . The track usually consists of two running rails with a fixed spacing , which may be supplemented by additional rails such as electric conducting rails and rack rails . Monorails and maglev guideways are also used occasionally . A passenger train includes passenger-carrying vehicles and can often be very long and fast . High-speed rail service began expanding rapidly in the late 20th century , and is also a major subject of further development . The term light rail is sometimes used to refer to a modern tram system , but it may also mean an intermediate form between a tram and a train , similar to a heavy rail rapid transit system . A freight train ( or goods train ) uses freight cars ( or wagons/trucks ) to transport goods or materials ( cargo ) ."
