  "/wiki/Fallout_3": "Fallout 3 is a post-apocalyptic action role-playing open world video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks . The third major installment in the Fallout series , it is the first game to be created by Bethesda since it bought the franchise from Interplay Entertainment . The game marks a major shift in the series by using 3D graphics and real-time combat , replacing the 2D isometric graphics and turn-based combat of previous installments . It was released worldwide in October 2008 for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 3 , and Xbox 360 . The game is set within a post-apocalyptic , open world environment that encompasses a scaled region consisting of the ruins of Washington , D.C. and much of the countryside to the north and west of it , referred to as the Capital Wasteland . It takes place within Fallout 's usual setting of a world that deviated into an alternate timeline thanks to atomic age technology , which eventually led to its devastation by a nuclear apocalypse in the year 2077 ( referred to as The Great War ) , caused by a major international conflict between the United States and China over natural resources and the last remaining supplies of untapped uranium . The main story takes place in the year 2277 , around 36 years after the events of Fallout 2 , of which it is not a direct sequel . Players take control of an inhabitant of Vault 101 , one of several underground shelters created before the Great War to protect around 1,000 humans from the nuclear fallout , who is forced to venture out into the Capital Wasteland to find their father after he disappears from the Vault under mysterious circumstances . They find themselves seeking to complete their father 's work while fighting against the Enclave , the corrupt remnants of the former U.S. government that seeks to use it for their own purposes . Fallout 3 was met with critical acclaim and received a number of Game of the Year awards , praising the game 's open-ended gameplay and flexible character-leveling system , and is considered one of the greatest video games of all time . The NPD Group estimated that Fallout 3 sold over 610,000 units during its initial month of release in October 2008 , performing better than Bethesda 's previous game , The Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion , which sold nearly 500,000 units in its first month . The game received post-launch support , with Bethesda releasing five downloadable add-ons .",

  "/wiki/BioShock": "BioShock is a 2007 first-person shooter game developed by 2K Boston ( later Irrational Games ) and 2K Australia , and published by 2K Games . It is the first game in the Bioshock series . The game 's concept was developed by Irrational 's creative lead , Ken Levine , and incorporates ideas by 20th century dystopian and utopian thinkers such as Ayn Rand , George Orwell , and Aldous Huxley , as well as historical figures such as John D.

BioShock is set in 1960 . The player guides the protagonist , Jack , after his airplane crashes in the ocean near the bathysphere terminus that leads to the underwater city of Rapture . Built by the business magnate Andrew Ryan , the city was intended to be an isolated utopia , but the discovery of ADAM , a genetic material which can be used to grant superhuman powers , initiated the city 's turbulent decline . Jack tries to find a way to escape , fighting through hordes of ADAM-obsessed enemies , and the iconic , deadly Big Daddies , while engaging with the few sane humans that remain and eventually learning of Rapture 's past .

  "/wiki/Underwater_habitat": "Underwater habitats are underwater structures in which people can live for extended periods and carry out most of the basic human functions of a 24-hour day , such as working , resting , eating , attending to personal hygiene , and sleeping . In this context 'habitat ' is generally used in a narrow sense to mean the interior and immediate exterior of the structure and its fixtures , but not its surrounding marine environment . Most early underwater habitats lacked regenerative systems for air , water , food , electricity , and other resources . However , recently some new underwater habitats allow for these resources to be delivered using pipes , or generated within the habitat , rather than manually delivered . An underwater habitat has to meet the needs of human physiology and provide suitable environmental conditions , and the one which is most critical is breathing air of suitable quality . Others concern the physical environment ( pressure , temperature , light , humidity ) , the chemical environment ( drinking water , food , waste products , toxins ) and the biological environment ( hazardous sea creatures , microorganisms , marine fungi ) . Much of the science covering underwater habitats and their technology designed to meet human requirements is shared with diving , diving bells , submersible vehicles and submarines , and spacecraft . Numerous underwater habitats have been designed , built and used around the world since the early 1960s , either by private individuals or by government agencies . They have been used almost exclusively for research and exploration , but in recent years at least one underwater habitat has been provided for recreation and tourism . Research has been devoted particularly to the physiological processes and limits of breathing gases under pressure , for aquanaut and astronaut training , as well as for research on marine ecosystems .",

The city also briefly appears in BioShock Infinite , and is featured in its downloadable content , Burial at Sea . The game 's back-story describes the city as envisioned by business tycoon Andrew Ryan in the mid-1940s as a means to create a utopia for mankind 's greatest artists and thinkers to prosper in a laissez-faire environment outside of increasing oppression by the world 's governments . However , the lack of government made many people uneasy , and the masses turned toward political activists like Atlas who advocated stability under a government , turning the city into a dystopia ; and on the eve of 1959 , a civil war broke out , leaving much of Rapture 's population dead . The remaining citizens either became psychotic Splicers due to the effects of ADAM , a substance that can alter genetic material , or have barricaded themselves from the Splicers to protect themselves , leaving the city to fail and fall apart around them . The player first experiences Rapture in BioShock , in 1960 , a year after the fateful riots , as a man named Jack that has come to Rapture after a plane accident over the mid-Atlantic Ocean where the city was located ; during this , the player comes to learn more about Ryan 's motives and those that he struggled against to keep the city 's ideals until the very end . In BioShock 2 , the player takes the role of a Big Daddy , a heavily modified humanoid in an armored diving suit , designed to maintain the city , and would soon come to serve the purpose of protecting the Little Sisters as they collect ADAM from Angels , which are dead bodies that harbor significant amounts of ADAM ; this takes place eight years after the events of the first game , and while Ryan has been killed , there remain those that vie for the vacuum left in his position of power .

  "/wiki/Altruism": "Altruism is the principle and moral practice of concern for happiness of other human beings and/or animals , resulting in a quality of life both material and spiritual . It is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews , though the concept of others toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions . In an extreme case , altruism may become a synonym of selflessness , which is the opposite of selfishness . The word altruism was coined by the French philosopher Auguste Comte in French , as altruisme , for an antonym of egoism . He derived it from the Italian altrui , which in turn was derived from Latin alteri , meaning other people or somebody else . Altruism in biological observations in field populations of the day organisms is an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves ( e.g. , pleasure and quality of life , time , probability of survival or reproduction ) , but benefits , either directly or indirectly , another third-party individual , without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action . Steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting , that is intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards . In one sense , the opposite of altruism is spite ; a spiteful action harms another with no self-benefit . Altruism can be distinguished from feelings of loyalty , in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships , altruism does not consider relationships . Much debate exists as to whether true altruism is possible in human psychology . The theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing , helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic , as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification . The validity of this argument depends on whether intrinsic rewards qualify as benefits .",

These attributes are used either in way of analogy or are taken literally . God is most often held to be incorporeal ( immaterial ) .

He was ordained deacon and made a cardinal in 1456 after the election of his uncle as Pope Callistus III , and a year later he became vice-chancellor of the Catholic Church . He proceeded to serve in the Curia under the next four popes , acquiring significant influence and wealth in the process . In 1492 , Rodrigo was elected Pope , taking the name Alexander VI .

During the second Italian war , Alexander VI supported his son Cesare Borgia as a condottiero for the French King . The scope of his foreign policy was to gain the most advantageous terms for his family . Alexander is considered one of the most controversial of the Renaissance popes , partly because he acknowledged fathering several children by his mistresses . As a result , his Italianized Valencian surname , Borgia , became a byword for libertinism and nepotism , which are traditionally considered as characterizing his pontificate .

  "/wiki/Yugoslav_Wars": "The Yugoslav Wars were a series of separate but related ethnic conflicts , wars of independence and insurgencies fought in the former Yugoslavia [ note 1 ] from 1991 to 2001 , which led to the breakup of the Yugoslav state . Its constituent republics declared independence , despite unresolved tensions between ethnic minorities in the new countries , fueling the wars . Most of the wars ended through peace accords , involving full international recognition of new states , but with a massive human cost and economic damage to the region . Initially the Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) sought to preserve the unity of the whole of Yugoslavia by crushing the secessionist governments , but it increasingly came under the influence of the Serbian government of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 , which evoked Serbian nationalist rhetoric and was willing to use the Yugoslav cause to preserve the unity of Serbs in one state . As a result , the JNA began to lose Slovenes , Croats , Kosovar Albanians , Bosniaks , and ethnic Macedonians , and effectively became a Serb army . According to a 1994 United Nations report , the Serb side did not aim to restore Yugoslavia , but to create a Greater Serbia from parts of Croatia and Bosnia . Other irredentist movements have also been brought into connection with the wars , such as Greater Albania ( from Kosovo , though it was abandoned following international diplomacy ) and Greater Croatia ( from parts of Herzegovina , until 1994 when the Washington Agreement ended it ) . Often described as Europe 's deadliest conflicts since World War II , the wars were marked by many war crimes , including genocide , crimes against humanity and rape . The Bosnian genocide was the first European crime to be formally judged as genocidal in character since World War II , and many key individual participants were subsequently charged with war crimes . The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) was established by the UN to prosecute these crimes .

  "/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_V": "Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games . It is the first main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series since 2008 's Grand Theft Auto IV . Set within the fictional state of San Andreas , based on Southern California , the single-player story follows three criminals and their efforts to commit heists while under pressure from a government agency and powerful crime figures . The open world design lets players freely roam San Andreas ' open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos , based on Los Angeles . The game is played from either a third-person or first-person perspective , and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle . Players control the three lead protagonists throughout single-player and switch among them , both during and outside missions . The story is centred on the heist sequences , and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay . A wanted system governs the aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit crimes . Grand Theft Auto Online , the game 's online multiplayer mode , lets up to 30 players engage in a variety of different cooperative and competitive game modes . The game 's development began soon after Grand Theft Auto IV 's release and was shared between many of Rockstar 's studios worldwide . The development team drew influence from many of their previous projects such as Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3 and designed the game around three lead protagonists to innovate on the core structure of its predecessors . Much of the development work constituted the open world 's creation , and several team members conducted field research around California to capture footage for the design team .",
  "/wiki/List_of_Grand_Theft_Auto_V_characters": "Rockstar North 's 2013 open world action-adventure video game Grand Theft Auto V , published by Rockstar Games , deals with a trio of criminals and their efforts to commit heists while under pressure from a corrupt government agency . The game 's use of three protagonists is a break from series tradition . Three days after its release , Grand Theft Auto V had earned more than US $ 1 billion in sales , making it the fastest selling video game in history . Additionally , Grand Theft Auto V was voted Game of the Year from several gaming publications . The game 's characters were created by writers Dan Houser and Rupert Humphries . The use of multiple protagonists , as well as the cast in general , has received critical and popular acclaim from gaming magazines , players and websites . The three main playable characters in Grand Theft Auto V are Michael De Santa , a retired bank robber who lives with his dysfunctional family on the proceeds of his former life ; Franklin Clinton , a gang member who is working as a repo man at the start of the game for an unscrupulous Armenian car dealership ; and Trevor Philips , Michael 's former partner-in-crime , who lives alone in a trailer in the desert town of Sandy Shores , where his reckless and psychotic behaviours are fuelled by substance abuse . The three acquaintances are drawn into Los Santos ' criminal underworld in the pursuit of the almighty American dollar . According to Houser , each of the protagonists is unlike any primary character that has appeared in a Grand Theft Auto title to date : Michael represents a protagonist who won in life , and is now trying to readjust to a normal one after his story has come to an end ; Trevor is a supporting psychopathic , bloodthirsty character recast as a central protagonist ; and Franklin is someone who has had no real exposure to a life of crime until the events of the game , and his attempts to avoid such a life end up launching him right into the heart of it ."
