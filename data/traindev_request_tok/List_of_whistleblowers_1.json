As a uniformed military service , the U.S. Army is part of the Department of the Army , which is one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense . The U.S. Army is headed by a civilian senior appointed civil servant , the secretary of the Army ( SECARMY ) and by a chief military officer , the chief of staff of the Army ( CSA ) who is also a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . It is the largest military branch , and in the fiscal year 2017 , the projected end strength for the Regular Army ( USA ) was 476,000 soldiers ; the Army National Guard ( ARNG ) had 343,000 soldiers and the U.S. Army Reserve ( USAR ) had 199,000 soldiers ; the combined-component strength of the U.S. Army was 1,018,000 soldiers .

  "/wiki/Struggle_against_political_abuse_of_psychiatry_in_the_Soviet_Union": "In the Soviet Union , systematic political abuse of psychiatry took place and was based on the interpretation of political dissent as a psychiatric problem . It was called psychopathological mechanisms of dissent . During the leadership of General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev , psychiatry was used as a tool to eliminate political opponents ( dissidents ) who openly expressed beliefs that contradicted official dogma . The term philosophical intoxication was widely used to diagnose mental disorders in cases where people disagreed with leaders and made them the target of criticism that used the writings by Karl Marx , Friedrich Engels , and Vladimir Lenin . Article 58-10 of the Stalin Criminal Code - which as Article 70 had been shifted into the RSFSR Criminal Code of 1962 - and Article 190-1 of the RSFSR Criminal Code along with the system of diagnosing mental illness , developed by academician Andrei Snezhnevsky , created the very preconditions under which non-standard beliefs could easily be transformed into a criminal case , and it , in its turn , into a psychiatric diagnosis . Anti-Soviet political behavior , in particular , being outspoken in opposition to the authorities , demonstrating for reform , writing books were defined in some persons as being simultaneously a criminal act ( e.g. , violation of Articles 70 or 190-1 ) , a symptom ( e.g. , delusion of reformism ) , and a diagnosis ( e.g. , sluggish schizophrenia ) . Within the boundaries of the diagnostic category , the symptoms of pessimism , poor social adaptation and conflict with authorities were themselves sufficient for a formal diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia . The psychiatric incarceration was conducted to suppress emigration , distribution of prohibited documents or books , participation in civil rights actions and demonstrations , and involvement in forbidden religious activity . The religious faith of prisoners , including well-educated former atheists who adopted a religion , was determined to be a form of mental illness that needed to be cured . The KGB routinely sent dissenters to psychiatrists for diagnosing to avoid embarrassing publi\u0441 trials and to discredit dissidence as the product of ill minds . Formerly highly classified extant documents from Special file of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union published after the dissolution of the Soviet Union demonstrate that the authorities of the country quite consciously used psychiatry as a tool to suppress dissent . In the 1960s , a vigorous movement grew up protesting against abuse of psychiatry in the USSR .",

Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization .

Typically a criminal code will contain offences which are recognised in the jurisdiction , penalties which might be imposed for these offences and some general provisions ( such as definitions and prohibitions on retroactive prosecution ) . Criminal codes are relatively common in civil law jurisdictions , which tend to build legal systems around codes and principles which are relatively abstract and apply them on a case by case basis . Conversely they are not as common in common law jurisdictions . The proposed introduction of a criminal code in England and Wales was a significant project of the Law Commission from 1968 to 2008 . Due to the strong tradition of legal precedent in the jurisdiction and consequently the large number of binding legal judgements and ambiguous 'common law offences ' , as well as the often inconsistent nature of English law , [ citation needed ] the creation of a satisfactory code became very difficult . The project was officially abandoned in 2008 although as of 2009 it has been revived . A statutory Criminal Law Codification Advisory Committee for Irish criminal law met from 2007 to 2010 and its Draft Criminal Code and Commentary was published in 2011 . In the United States , a Model Penal Code exists which is not itself law but which provides the basis for the criminal law of many states . Individual states often choose to make use of criminal codes which are often based , to a varying extent on the model code . Title 18 of the United States Code is the criminal code for federal crimes . However , Title 18 does not contain many of the general provisions concerning criminal law that are found in the criminal codes of many so-called civil law countries .",

Felt worked in several FBI field offices prior to his promotion to the Bureau 's headquarters . In 1980 he was convicted of having violated the civil rights of people thought to be associated with members of the Weather Underground , by ordering FBI agents to break into their homes and search the premises as part of an attempt to prevent bombings . He was ordered to pay a fine , but was pardoned by President Ronald Reagan during his appeal . In 2005 , at age 91 , Felt revealed that during his tenure as associate director of the FBI he had been the notorious anonymous source known as Deep Throat who provided The Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein with critical information about the Watergate scandal , which ultimately led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon in 1974 . Though Felt 's identity as Deep Throat was suspected , including by Nixon himself , it had generally remained a secret for 30 years .

A leading U.S. counter-terrorism , counterintelligence , and criminal investigative organization , the FBI has jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes . Although many of the FBI 's functions are unique , its activities in support of national security are comparable to those of the British MI5 and the Russian FSB . Unlike the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , which has no law enforcement authority and is focused on intelligence collection abroad , the FBI is primarily a domestic agency , maintaining 56 field offices in major cities throughout the United States , and more than 400 resident agencies in smaller cities and areas across the nation .

The scandal stemmed from the June 17 , 1972 , break-in of the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) headquarters at the Watergate Office Building in Washington , D.C. , by five men and the Nixon administration 's subsequent attempts to cover up its involvement in the crime . Soon after the perpetrators were arrested , the press and the Justice Department discovered a connection between cash found on them at the time and a slush fund used by the Nixon re-election campaign committee . Further investigations , along with revelations during subsequent trials of the burglars in January 1973 , led the House of Representatives to grant its Judiciary Committee additional investigation authority to probe into certain matters within its jurisdiction , and the Senate to create a special investigative committee to look into the scandal . The resultant Senate Watergate hearings commenced in May 1973 . Broadcast gavel-to-gavel nationwide , by PBS , the hearings aroused great public interest . Senators heard testimony that the president had approved plans to cover up administration involvement in the Watergate break-in , and learned of the existence of a voice-activated taping system in the Oval Office . Meanwhile , Nixon 's administration resisted its probes , which led to a constitutional crisis . Several major revelations and egregious presidential action against the investigation later in 1973 prompted the House to commence an impeachment process against Nixon in February 1974 . On July 24 , 1974 , while the impeachment process was under way , the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in United States v. Nixon that Nixon was obligated to release the Oval Office tapes to government investigators . The tapes revealed that Nixon had conspired to cover up activities that took place after the break-in and had attempted to use federal officials to deflect the investigation .

The defining characteristic of price fixing is any agreement regarding price , whether expressed or implied . Price fixing requires a conspiracy between sellers or buyers . The purpose is to coordinate pricing for mutual benefit of the traders . For example , manufacturers and retailers may conspire to sell at a common retail price ; set a common minimum sales price , where sellers agree not to discount the sales price below the agreed-to minimum price ; buy the product from a supplier at a specified maximum price ; adhere to a price book or list price ; engage in cooperative price advertising ; standardize financial credit terms offered to purchasers ; use uniform trade-in allowances ; limit discounts ; discontinue a free service or fix the price of one component of an overall service ; adhere uniformly to previously-announced prices and terms of sale ; establish uniform costs and markups ; impose mandatory surcharges ; purposefully reduce output or sales in order to charge higher prices ; or purposefully share or pool markets , territories , or customers . Price fixing is permitted in some markets but not others ; where allowed , it is often known as resale price maintenance or retail price maintenance . In neo-classical economics , price fixing is inefficient . The anti-competitive agreement by producers to fix prices above the market price transfers some of the consumer surplus to those producers and also results in a deadweight loss . International price fixing by private entities can be prosecuted under the antitrust laws of many countries . Examples of prosecuted international cartels are those that controlled the prices and output of lysine , citric acid , graphite electrodes , and bulk vitamins .",

All are composed of long and thin fibrous crystals , each fiber being composed of many microscopic 'fibrils ' that can be released into the atmosphere by abrasion and other processes . Asbestos is an excellent electrical insulator and is highly heat-resistant , so for many years it was used as a building material . However , it is a well-known health and safety hazard , and today , the use of asbestos as a building material is now illegal in many countries . Inhalation of asbestos fibres can lead to various serious lung conditions , including asbestosis and cancer . Archaeological studies have found evidence of asbestos being used as far back as the Stone Age to strengthen ceramic pots , but large-scale mining began at the end of the 19th century when manufacturers and builders began using asbestos for its desirable physical properties . Asbestos was widely used during the 20th century until the 1970s , when public recognition of the health hazards of asbestos dust led to its prohibition in mainstream construction and fireproofing in most countries . Despite this , and in part because the consequences of exposure can take decades to arise , at least 100,000 people per year are thought to die from diseases related to asbestos exposure . Despite the severity of asbestos-related diseases , the material has been widely used all around the world , and most pre-1980s buildings are thought to contain asbestos . Many developing countries still support the use of asbestos as a building material , and mining of asbestos is ongoing , with top producer Russia having produced about one million tonnes in 2015 .",

  "/wiki/United_States_Atomic_Energy_Commission": "The United States Atomic Energy Commission , commonly known as the AEC , was an agency of the United States government established after World War II by U.S. Congress to foster and control the peacetime development of atomic science and technology . President Harry S. Truman signed the McMahon/Atomic Energy Act on August 1 , 1946 , transferring the control of atomic energy from military to civilian hands , effective on January 1 , 1947 . This shift gave the members of the AEC complete control of the plants , laboratories , equipment , and personnel assembled during the war to produce the atomic bomb . During its initial establishment and subsequent operationalization , the AEC played a key role in the institutional development of Ecosystem ecology . Specifically , it provided crucial financial resources , allowing for ecological research to take place . Perhaps even more importantly , it enabled ecologists with a wide range of groundbreaking techniques for the completion of their research . In the late 1950s and early 1960s , the AEC also approved funding for numerous bioenvironmental projects in the arctic and subarctic regions . These projects were designed to examine the effects of nuclear energy upon the environment and were a part of the AEC 's attempt at creating peaceful applications of atomic energy . :22-25 An increasing number of critics during the 1960s charged that the AEC 's regulations were insufficiently rigorous in several important areas , including radiation protection standards , nuclear reactor safety , plant siting , and environmental protection . By 1974 , the AEC 's regulatory programs had come under such strong attack that the U.S. Congress decided to abolish the AEC . The AEC was abolished by the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 , which assigned its functions to two new agencies : the Energy Research and Development Administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission .

  "/wiki/Silkwood": "Silkwood is a 1983 American biographical drama film directed by Mike Nichols and starring Meryl Streep , Cher and Kurt Russell . The screenplay by Nora Ephron and Alice Arlen was inspired by the life of Karen Silkwood . Silkwood was a nuclear whistleblower and a labor union activist who died in a car collision while investigating alleged wrongdoing at the Kerr-McGee plutonium plant where she worked . In real life , her death gave rise to a 1979 lawsuit , Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee , led by attorney Gerry Spence . The jury rendered its verdict of $ 10 million in damages to be paid to the Silkwood estate ( her children ) , the largest amount in damages ever awarded for that kind of case at the time . The Silkwood estate eventually settled for $ 1.3 million . Silkwood was shot largely in both New Mexico and Texas on a budget of $ 10 million . Factual accuracy was maintained throughout the script , with some incidents exactly parallel to the real-life experiences of Karen Silkwood . One scene in particular involved the activation of a radiation alarm at the plant . Silkwood herself had forty times the legal limit of radioactive contamination in her system . Streep had just finished filming Sophie 's Choice ( 1982 ) when production began . The film marked a departure for some of its stars : it is noted for being one of the first serious works of Cher , who had been previously known mostly for her singing , and for Russell , who was at the time widely known for his work in the action genre .",

  "/wiki/Whistleblowing": "A whistleblower ( also written as whistle-blower or whistle blower ) is a person who exposes secretive information or activity that is deemed illegal , unethical , or not correct within a private or public organization . The information of alleged wrongdoing can be classified in many ways : violation of company policy/rules , law , regulation , or threat to public interest/national security , as well as fraud , and corruption . Those who become whistleblowers can choose to bring information or allegations to surface either internally or externally . Internally , a whistleblower can bring his/her accusations to the attention of other people within the accused organization such as an immediate supervisor . Externally , a whistleblower can bring allegations to light by contacting a third party outside of an accused organization such as the media , government , law enforcement , or those who are concerned . Whistleblowers , however , take the risk of facing stiff reprisal and retaliation from those who are accused or alleged of wrongdoing . Because of this , a number of laws exist to protect whistleblowers . Some third-party groups even offer protection to whistleblowers , but that protection can only go so far . Whistleblowers face legal action , criminal charges , social stigma , and termination from any position , office , or job . Two other classifications of whistleblowing are private and public .

The airlift resulted in a number of enduring images . Evacuation plans already existed as a standard procedure for American embassies . At the beginning of March , fixed-wing aircraft began evacuating civilians from Tan Son Nhat Airport through neighboring countries . By mid-April , contingency plans were in place and preparations were underway for a possible helicopter evacuation . As the imminent collapse of Saigon became evident , Task Force 76 was assembled off the coast near V\u0169ng T\u00e0u to support a helicopter evacuation and provide air support if required . In the event , air support was not needed as the North Vietnamese paused for a week at the outskirts of Saigon , possibly waiting for the South Vietnamese government to collapse and avoiding a possible confrontation with the U.S. by allowing the mostly-unopposed evacuation of Americans from Saigon . :14 On 28 April , Tan Son Nhut Air Base ( lying adjacent to the airport ) came under artillery fire and attack from Vietnamese People 's Air Force aircraft .

Breach occurs when a party to a contract fails to fulfill its obligation ( s ) as described in the contract , or communicates an intent to fail the obligation or otherwise appears not to be able to perform its obligation under the contract . Where there is breach of contract , the resulting damages will have to be paid by the party breaching the contract to the aggrieved party . If a contract is rescinded , parties are legally allowed to undo the work unless doing so would directly charge the other party at that exact time . It is important to bear in mind that contract law is not the same from country to country . Each country has its own independent , free standing law of contract . Therefore , it makes sense to examine the laws of the country to which the contract is governed before deciding how the law of contract ( of that country ) applies to any particular contractual relationship .",

Doctor-patient confidentiality ( physician-patient privilege ) , attorney-client privilege , priest-penitent privilege , bank-client confidentiality , and Kickback agreements are examples , often not enshrined in a written contract between the parties . It is a contract through which the parties agree not to disclose information covered by the agreement . An NDA creates a confidential relationship between the parties , typically to protect any type of confidential and proprietary information or trade secrets . As such , an NDA protects non-public business information . Like all contracts , they can not be enforced if the contracted activities are felonies . NDAs are commonly signed when two companies , individuals , or other entities ( such as partnerships , societies , etc . ) are considering doing business and need to understand the processes used in each other 's business for the purpose of evaluating the potential business relationship . NDAs can be mutual , meaning both parties are restricted in their use of the materials provided , or they can restrict the use of material by a single party . An employee can be required to sign an NDA or NDA-like agreement with an employer , protecting trade secrets . In fact , some employment agreements include a clause restricting employees ' use and dissemination of company-owned confidential information . In legal disputes resolved by settlement , the parties often sign a confidentiality agreement relating to the terms of the settlement ."
