  "/wiki/Tiberius": "Tiberius ( /ta\u026a\u02c8b\u026a\u0259ri\u0259s/ ty-BEER-ee-\u0259s ; Latin : Tiberius Caesar Divi Augusti filius Augustus ; [ a ] [ b ] 16 November 42 BC - 16 March 37 AD ) was the second Roman emperor , reigning from 14 AD to 37 AD . He succeeded his stepfather , Augustus . Born to Tiberius Claudius Nero and Livia Drusilla in a Claudian family , he was given the personal name Tiberius Claudius Nero . His mother divorced Nero and married Octavian - later to ascend to Emperor as Augustus - who officially became his stepfather . Tiberius would later marry Augustus ' daughter ( from his marriage to Scribonia ) , Julia the Elder , and even later be adopted by Augustus . Through the adoption , he officially became a Julian , assuming the name Tiberius Julius Caesar . The emperors after Tiberius would continue this blended dynasty of both families for the following thirty years ; historians have named it the Julio-Claudian dynasty . His relationship to the other emperors of this dynasty was as follows : he was the stepson of Augustus , grand-uncle of Caligula , paternal uncle of Claudius , and great-grand uncle of Nero . Tiberius ' 22-and-a-half-year reign would be the longest after that of Augustus until that of Antoninus Pius , who surpassed his reign by a few months . Tiberius was one of the greatest Roman generals ; his conquest of Pannonia , Dalmatia , Raetia , and ( temporarily ) parts of Germania , laid the foundations for the northern frontier . Even so , he came to be remembered as a dark , reclusive and sombre ruler who never really desired to be emperor ; Pliny the Elder called him the gloomiest of men . After the death of his son Drusus Julius Caesar in 23 AD , Tiberius became more reclusive and aloof .",

  "/wiki/Nero": "Nero ( /\u02c8n\u026a\u0259ro\u028a/ NEER-oh ; Latin : Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus ; [ i ] 15 December 37 - 9 June 68 AD ) was the last Roman emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty . He was adopted by his great-uncle Claudius and became Claudius ' heir and successor . Like Claudius , Nero became emperor with the consent of the Praetorian Guard . Nero 's mother , Agrippina the Younger , dominated Nero 's early life and decisions until he cast her off and had her killed five years into his reign . During the early years of his reign , Nero was content to be guided by his mother , his tutor Lucius Annaeus Seneca , and his Praetorian prefect Sextus Afranius Burrus . As time passed , he started to play a more active and independent role in government and foreign policy . During his reign , the redoubtable general Corbulo conducted a successful war and negotiated peace with the Parthian Empire . His general Suetonius Paulinus crushed a major revolt in Britain , led by the Iceni Queen Boudica . The Bosporan Kingdom was briefly annexed to the empire , and the First Jewish-Roman War began . Nero focused much of his attention on diplomacy , trade and the cultural life of the empire , ordering theatres built and promoting athletic games . He made public appearances as an actor , poet , musician and charioteer . In the eyes of traditionalists , this undermined the dignity and authority of his person , status , and office .",

Officially declared by the Senate optimus princeps ( best ruler ) , Trajan is remembered as a successful soldier-emperor who presided over the greatest military expansion in Roman history , leading the empire to attain its maximum territorial extent by the time of his death . He is also known for his philanthropic rule , overseeing extensive public building programs and implementing social welfare policies , which earned him his enduring reputation as the second of the Five Good Emperors who presided over an era of peace and prosperity in the Mediterranean world . Trajan was born in Italica , close to modern Seville in present-day Spain , an Italic settlement in the Roman province of Hispania Baetica . Although misleadingly designated by some later writers as a provincial , his family came from Umbria and he was born a Roman citizen . Trajan rose to prominence during the reign of emperor Domitian . Serving as a legatus legionis in Hispania Tarraconensis , in 89 Trajan supported Domitian against a revolt on the Rhine led by Antonius Saturninus . In September 96 , Domitian was succeeded by the old and childless Nerva , who proved to be unpopular with the army . After a brief and tumultuous year in power , culminating in a revolt by members of the Praetorian Guard , he was compelled to adopt the more popular Trajan as his heir and successor . Nerva died in 98 and was succeeded by his adopted son without incident . As a civilian administrator , Trajan is best known for his extensive public building program , which reshaped the city of Rome and left numerous enduring landmarks such as Trajan 's Forum , Trajan 's Market and Trajan 's Column . Early in his reign , he annexed the Nabataean Kingdom , creating the province of Arabia Petraea .",
  "/wiki/Hadrian": "Hadrian ( /\u02c8he\u026adri\u0259n/ ; Latin : Publius Aelius Hadrianus Augustus ; 24 January 76 - 10 July 138 ) was Roman emperor from 117 to 138 . [ note 1 ] He was born Publius Aelius Hadrianus in Italica , Hispania Baetica , into a Roman Italo-Hispanic family that settled in Spain from the Italian city of Atri in Picenum . His father was of senatorial rank and was a first cousin of Emperor Trajan . He married Trajan 's grand-niece Vibia Sabina early in his career , before Trajan became emperor and possibly at the behest of Trajan 's wife Pompeia Plotina . Plotina and Trajan 's close friend and adviser Lucius Licinius Sura were well disposed towards Hadrian . When Trajan died , his widow claimed that he had nominated Hadrian as emperor immediately before his death . Rome 's military and Senate approved Hadrian 's succession , but four leading senators were unlawfully put to death soon after . They had opposed Hadrian or seemed to threaten his succession , and the senate held him responsible for it and never forgave him . He earned further disapproval among the elite by abandoning Trajan 's expansionist policies and territorial gains in Mesopotamia , Assyria , Armenia , and parts of Dacia . Hadrian preferred to invest in the development of stable , defensible borders and the unification of the empire 's disparate peoples . He is known for building Hadrian 's Wall , which marked the northern limit of Britannia . Hadrian energetically pursued his own Imperial ideals and personal interests .",

Vitellius was proclaimed emperor following the quick succession of the previous emperors Galba and Otho , in a year of civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors . Vitellius was the first to add the honorific cognomen Germanicus to his name instead of Caesar upon his accession . Like his direct predecessor , Otho , Vitellius attempted to rally public support to his cause by honoring and imitating Nero who remained widely popular in the empire . His claim to the throne was soon challenged by legions stationed in the eastern provinces , who proclaimed their commander Vespasian emperor instead . War ensued , leading to a crushing defeat for Vitellius at the Second Battle of Bedriacum in northern Italy . Once he realised his support was wavering , Vitellius prepared to abdicate in favor of Vespasian . He was not allowed to do so by his supporters , resulting in a brutal battle for Rome between Vitellius ' forces and the armies of Vespasian . He was executed in Rome by Vespasian 's soldiers on 22 December 69 .",
  "/wiki/Augustus": "Augustus ( Latin : Imperator Caesar Divi filius Augustus ; [ nb 1 ] 23 September 63 BC - 19 August AD 14 ) was a Roman statesman and military leader who became the first emperor of the Roman Empire , reigning from 27 BC until his death in AD 14 . [ nb 2 ] His status as the founder of the Roman Principate has consolidated an enduring legacy as one of the most effective and controversial leaders in human history . The reign of Augustus initiated an era of relative peace known as the Pax Romana . The Roman world was largely free from large-scale conflict for more than two centuries , despite continuous wars of imperial expansion on the Empire 's frontiers and the year-long civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors over the imperial succession . Augustus was born Gaius Octavius into an old and wealthy equestrian branch of the plebeian gens Octavia . His maternal great-uncle Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC , and Octavius was named in Caesar 's will as his adopted son and heir . Along with Mark Antony and Marcus Lepidus , he formed the Second Triumvirate to defeat the assassins of Caesar . Following their victory at the Battle of Philippi , the Triumvirate divided the Roman Republic among themselves and ruled as de facto dictators . The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members . Lepidus was driven into exile and stripped of his position , and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the Battle of Actium by Octavian in 31 BC . After the demise of the Second Triumvirate , Augustus restored the outward fa\u00e7ade of the free Republic , with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate , the executive magistrates , and the legislative assemblies . In reality , however , he retained his autocratic power over the Republic .",

A member of the Flavian dynasty , Titus succeeded his father Vespasian upon his death , thus becoming the first Roman emperor to come to the throne after his own biological father . Before becoming emperor , Titus gained renown as a military commander , serving under his father in Judea during the First Jewish-Roman War . The campaign came to a brief halt with the death of emperor Nero in 68 , launching Vespasian 's bid for the imperial power during the Year of the Four Emperors . When Vespasian was declared Emperor on 1 July 69 , Titus was left in charge of ending the Jewish rebellion . In 70 , he besieged and captured Jerusalem , and destroyed the city and the Second Temple . For this achievement Titus was awarded a triumph ; the Arch of Titus commemorates his victory to this day . During his father 's rule , Titus gained notoriety in Rome serving as prefect of the Praetorian Guard , and for carrying on a controversial relationship with the Jewish queen Berenice . Despite concerns over his character , Titus ruled to great acclaim following the death of Vespasian in 79 , and was considered a good emperor by Suetonius and other contemporary historians . As emperor , Titus is best known for completing the Colosseum and for his generosity in relieving the suffering caused by two disasters , the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 and a fire in Rome in 80 . After barely two years in office , Titus died of a fever on 13 September 81 . He was deified by the Roman Senate and succeeded by his younger brother Domitian .",

He was the second emperor of the Year of the Four Emperors . A member of a noble Etruscan family , Otho was initially a friend and courtier of the young emperor Nero until he was effectively banished to the governorship of the remote province of Lusitania in 58 following his wife Poppaea Sabina 's affair with Nero . After a period of moderate rule in the province , he allied himself with Galba , the governor of neighbouring Hispania Tarraconensis , during the revolts of 68 . He accompanied Galba on his march to Rome , but revolted and murdered Galba at the start of the next year . Inheriting the problem of the rebellion of Vitellius , commander of the army in Germania Inferior , Otho led a sizeable force which met Vitellius ' army at the Battle of Bedriacum . After initial fighting resulted in 40,000 casualties , and a retreat of his forces , Otho committed suicide rather than fight on and Vitellius was proclaimed emperor .",

Born into a wealthy family , Galba held at various times the offices of praetor , consul , and governor of the provinces Aquitania , Upper Germany , and Africa during the first half of the first century AD . He retired during the latter part of Claudius ' reign but Nero later granted him the governorship of Hispania . Taking advantage of the defeat of Vindex 's rebellion and Nero 's suicide , he became emperor with the support of the Praetorian Guard . His physical weakness and general apathy led to him being dominated by favorites . Unable to gain popularity with the people or maintain the support of the Praetorian Guard , Galba was murdered by Otho , who then became emperor .",
  "/wiki/Julius_Caesar": "Gaius Julius Caesar [ a ] ( /\u02c8si\u02d0z\u0259r/ SEE-z\u0259r , Latin : [ \u02c8\u0261a\u02d0\u026a.\u028as \u02c8ju\u02d0l\u026a.\u028as \u02c8kae\u032fsar ] ; 12 July 100 BC [ b ] - 15 March 44 BC ) , [ c ] better known by his nomen gentilicium and cognomen Julius Caesar , was a Roman dictator , politician , and military general who played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire . He was also a historian and wrote Latin prose . In 60 BC , Caesar , Crassus and Pompey formed the First Triumvirate , a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years . Their attempts to amass power as Populares were opposed by the Optimates within the Roman Senate , among them Cato the Younger with the frequent support of Cicero . Caesar rose to become one of the most powerful politicians in the Roman Republic through a number of his accomplishments , notably his victories in the Gallic Wars , completed by 51 BC . During this time , Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both the English Channel and the Rhine River , when he built a bridge across the Rhine and crossed the Channel to invade Britain . Caesar 's wars extended Rome 's territory to Britain and past Gaul . These achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey , who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53 BC . With the Gallic Wars concluded , the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome . Leaving his command in Gaul meant losing his immunity from being charged as a criminal for waging unsanctioned wars . As a result , Caesar found himself with no other options but to cross the Rubicon with the 13th Legion in 49 BC , leaving his province and illegally entering Roman Italy under arms . This began Caesar 's civil war , and his victory in the war by 45 BC put him in an unrivaled position of power and influence ."
