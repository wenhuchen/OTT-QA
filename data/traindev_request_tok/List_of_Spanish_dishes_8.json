These are obtained from quality grapes and produced according to the highest standards and are replacing the traditional homemade liquor , nowadays only available in small villages .",
  "/wiki/Pressing_(wine)": "Pressing in winemaking is the process where the juice is extracted from the grapes with the aid of a wine press , by hand , or even by the weight of the grape berries and clusters . Historically , intact grape clusters were trodden by feet but in most wineries today the grapes are sent through a crusher/destemmer , which removes the individual grape berries from the stems and breaks the skins , releasing some juice , prior to being pressed . There are exceptions , such as the case of sparkling wine production in regions such as Champagne where grapes are traditionally whole-cluster pressed with stems included to produce a lighter must that is low in phenolics . In white wine production , pressing usually takes place immediately after crushing or/and before primary fermentation . In red wine production , the grapes are also crushed but pressing usually does n't take place till after or near the end of fermentation with the time of skin contact between the juice and grapes leaching color , tannins and other phenolics from the skin . Approximately 60-70% of the available juice within the grape berry , the free-run juice , can be released by the crushing process and does n't require the use of the press . The remaining 30-40% that comes from pressing can have higher pH levels , lower titratable acidity , potentially higher volatile acidity and higher phenolics than the free-run juice depending on the amount of pressure and tearing of the skins and will produce more astringent , bitter wine . Winemakers often keep their free-run juice and pressed wine separate ( and perhaps even further isolate the wine produced by different pressure levels/stages of pressing ) during much of the winemaking process to either bottle separately or later blend portions of each to make a more complete , balanced wine . In practice the volume of many wines are made from 85-90% of free-run juice and 10-15% pressed juice .",

Central Europe also has its own types of cider with Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse producing a particularly tart version known as Apfelwein . In the U.S. , varieties of fermented cider are often called hard cider to distinguish alcoholic cider from non-alcoholic apple cider or sweet cider , also made from apples . In Canada , cider can not be called cider if there are no apples . Furthermore , according to the Food and Drug Regulations in Canada , cider can not contain less than 2.5% or over 13% absolute alcohol by volume . The juice of most varieties of apple can be used to make cider , but cider apples are best . The addition of sugar or extra fruit before a second fermentation increases the ethanol content of the resulting beverage . Cider alcohol content varies from 1.2% to 8.5% ABV or more in traditional English ciders , and 3.5% to 12% in continental ciders .",
