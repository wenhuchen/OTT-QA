He is one of the foremost composers of the Post-Romantic era who also had a significant influence on his contemporaries and younger composers . He is best known for his piano works based on Spanish folk music idioms . Transcriptions of many of his pieces , such as Asturias ( Leyenda ) , Granada , Sevilla , Cadiz , C\u00f3rdoba , Catalu\u00f1a , Mallorca , and Tango in D , are important pieces for classical guitar , though he never composed for the guitar .

  "/wiki/Piano": "The piano is an acoustic , stringed musical instrument invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700 ( the exact year is uncertain ) , in which the strings are struck by felt hammers . It is played using a keyboard , which is a row of keys ( small levers ) that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings . The word piano is a shortened form of pianoforte , the Italian term for the early 1700s versions of the instrument , which in turn derives from gravicembalo col piano e forte and fortepiano . The Italian musical terms piano and forte indicate soft and loud respectively , in this context referring to the variations in volume ( i.e. , loudness ) produced in response to a pianist 's touch or pressure on the keys : the greater the velocity of a key press , the greater the force of the hammer hitting the strings , and the louder the sound of the note produced and the stronger the attack . The name was created as a contrast to harpsichord , a musical instrument that does not allow variation in volume ; compared to the harpsichord , the first fortepianos in the 1700s had a quieter sound and smaller dynamic range . An acoustic piano usually has a protective wooden case surrounding the soundboard and metal strings , which are strung under great tension on a heavy metal frame . Pressing one or more keys on the piano 's keyboard causes a padded hammer ( typically padded with firm felt ) to strike the strings . The hammer rebounds from the strings , and the strings continue to vibrate at their resonant frequency . These vibrations are transmitted through a bridge to a soundboard that amplifies by more efficiently coupling the acoustic energy to the air . When the key is released , a damper stops the strings ' vibration , ending the sound . Notes can be sustained , even when the keys are released by the fingers and thumbs , by the use of pedals at the base of the instrument . The sustain pedal enables pianists to play musical passages that would otherwise be impossible , such as sounding a 10-note chord in the lower register and then , while this chord is being continued with the sustain pedal , shifting both hands to the treble range to play a melody and arpeggios over the top of this sustained chord .",
  "/wiki/Iberia_(Alb\u00e9niz)": "Iberia is a suite for piano composed between 1905 and 1909 by the Spanish composer Isaac Alb\u00e9niz . It is composed of four books of three pieces each ; a complete performance lasts about 90 minutes . It is Alb\u00e9niz 's best-known work and considered his masterpiece . It was highly praised by Claude Debussy and Olivier Messiaen , who said : Iberia is the wonder for the piano ; it is perhaps on the highest place among the more brilliant pieces for the king of instruments . Stylistically , this suite falls squarely in the school of Impressionism , especially in its musical evocations of Spain .",

  "/wiki/Gustav_Mahler": "Gustav Mahler ( German : [ \u02c8ma\u02d0l\u0250 ] ; 7 July 1860 - 18 May 1911 ) was an Austro-Bohemian Romantic composer , and one of the leading conductors of his generation . As a composer he acted as a bridge between the 19th century Austro-German tradition and the modernism of the early 20th century . While in his lifetime his status as a conductor was established beyond question , his own music gained wide popularity only after periods of relative neglect , which included a ban on its performance in much of Europe during the Nazi era . After 1945 his compositions were rediscovered by a new generation of listeners ; Mahler then became one of the most frequently performed and recorded of all composers , a position he has sustained into the 21st century . In 2016 , a BBC Music Magazine survey of 151 conductors ranked three of his symphonies in the top ten symphonies of all time . Born in Bohemia ( then part of the Austrian Empire ) to Jewish parents of humble origins , the German-speaking Mahler displayed his musical gifts at an early age . After graduating from the Vienna Conservatory in 1878 , he held a succession of conducting posts of rising importance in the opera houses of Europe , culminating in his appointment in 1897 as director of the Vienna Court Opera ( Hofoper ) . During his ten years in Vienna , Mahler - who had converted to Catholicism to secure the post - experienced regular opposition and hostility from the anti-Semitic press . Nevertheless , his innovative productions and insistence on the highest performance standards ensured his reputation as one of the greatest of opera conductors , particularly as an interpreter of the stage works of Wagner , Mozart , and Tchaikovsky . Late in his life he was briefly director of New York 's Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic . Mahler 's \u0153uvre is relatively limited ; for much of his life composing was necessarily a part-time activity while he earned his living as a conductor . Aside from early works such as a movement from a piano quartet composed when he was a student in Vienna , Mahler 's works are generally designed for large orchestral forces , symphonic choruses and operatic soloists .",
  "/wiki/Symphony": "A symphony is an extended musical composition in Western classical music , most often written by composers for orchestra . Although the term has had many meanings from its origins in the ancient Greek era , by the late 18th century the word had taken on the meaning common today : a work usually consisting of multiple distinct sections or movements , often four , with the first movement in sonata form . Symphonies are almost always scored for an orchestra consisting of a string section ( violin , viola , cello , and double bass ) , brass , woodwind , and percussion instruments which altogether number about 30 to 100 musicians . Symphonies are notated in a musical score , which contains all the instrument parts . Orchestral musicians play from parts which contain just the notated music for their own instrument . Some symphonies also contain vocal parts ( e.g. , Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony ) .",

  "/wiki/Piano_concerto": "A piano concerto is a type of concerto , a solo composition in the Classical music genre which is composed for a piano player , which is typically accompanied by an orchestra or other large ensemble . Piano concertos are typically virtuoso showpieces which require an advanced level of technique on the instrument , including melodic lines interspersed with rapid scales , arpeggios , chords , complex contrapuntal parts and other challenging material . When piano concertos are performed by a professional concert pianist , a large grand piano is almost always used , as the grand piano has a fuller tone and more projection than an upright piano . Piano concertos are typically written out in music notation , including sheet music for the pianist ( which they typically memorize so that they can play the concert without sheet music ) , orchestra parts for the orchestra members , and a full score for the conductor , who leads the orchestra in the accompaniment of the soloist . Depending on the era in which a piano concerto was composed , the orchestra parts may provide a fairly subordinate accompaniment role , setting out the bassline and chord progression over which the piano plays solo parts ( more typical during the Baroque music era , from 1600 to 1750 and the Classical music period , from 1730 to 1800 ) , or the orchestra may be given an almost equal role to the piano soloist , with orchestra instrumentalists and sections introducing key musical themes and playing virtuostic parts for their instruments and in which there is a dialogue or conversation between the piano soloist and the orchestra . When music students and music competition auditionees play piano concertos , the orchestra part may be performed in an orchestral reduction , a conversion of the orchestra parts into a part for an accompanist playing piano or pipe organ , as it is very expensive to hire a full orchestra . Keyboard concerti were common in the time of Johann Sebastian Bach in the Baroque music era , during the Classical music period and during the Romantic music era ( 1800-1910 ) . Keyboard concertos are also written by contemporary classical music composers . Twentieth- and 21st-century piano concertos may include experimental or unusual performance techniques . In the 20th and 21st century , J.S . Bach 's harpsichord concertos are sometimes played on piano . There are variant types of piano concertos , including double piano concertos , for two solo pianists and orchestra , and double or triple ( or larger solo groups ) concertos in which the piano soloist is joined by a violinist , cellist , or another instrumentalist .",

Though he had several bursts of extraordinary productivity , particularly in 1888 and 1889 , depression frequently interrupted his creative periods , and his last composition was written in 1898 , before he suffered a mental collapse caused by syphilis .",

Unlike most opera composers , Wagner wrote both the libretto and the music for each of his stage works . Initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works in the romantic vein of Carl Maria von Weber and Giacomo Meyerbeer , Wagner revolutionised opera through his concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk ( total work of art ) , by which he sought to synthesise the poetic , visual , musical and dramatic arts , with music subsidiary to drama . He described this vision in a series of essays published between 1849 and 1852 . Wagner realised these ideas most fully in the first half of the four-opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen ( The Ring of the Nibelung ) . His compositions , particularly those of his later period , are notable for their complex textures , rich harmonies and orchestration , and the elaborate use of leitmotifs - musical phrases associated with individual characters , places , ideas , or plot elements . His advances in musical language , such as extreme chromaticism and quickly shifting tonal centres , greatly influenced the development of classical music . His Tristan und Isolde is sometimes described as marking the start of modern music . Wagner had his own opera house built , the Bayreuth Festspielhaus , which embodied many novel design features . The Ring and Parsifal were premiered here and his most important stage works continue to be performed at the annual Bayreuth Festival , run by his descendants . His thoughts on the relative contributions of music and drama in opera were to change again , and he reintroduced some traditional forms into his last few stage works , including Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg ( The Mastersingers of Nuremberg ) . Until his final years , Wagner 's life was characterised by political exile , turbulent love affairs , poverty and repeated flight from his creditors .",

Born in Bradford , West Yorkshire to a prosperous mercantile family , he resisted attempts to recruit him to commerce . He was sent to Florida in the United States in 1884 to manage an orange plantation . He soon neglected his managerial duties and in 1886 returned to Europe . Having been influenced by African-American music during his short stay in Florida , he began composing . After a brief period of formal musical study in Germany beginning in 1886 , he embarked on a full-time career as a composer in Paris and then in nearby Grez-sur-Loing , where he and his wife Jelka lived for the rest of their lives , except during the First World War . Delius 's first successes came in Germany , where Hans Haym and other conductors promoted his music from the late 1890s . In Delius 's native Britain , his music did not make regular appearances in concert programmes until 1907 , after Thomas Beecham took it up . Beecham conducted the full premiere of A Mass of Life in London in 1909 ( he had premiered Part II in Germany in 1908 ) ; he staged the opera A Village Romeo and Juliet at Covent Garden in 1910 ; and he mounted a six-day Delius festival in London in 1929 , as well as making gramophone recordings of many of the composer 's works . After 1918 , Delius began to suffer the effects of syphilis , contracted during his earlier years in Paris . He became paralysed and blind , but completed some late compositions between 1928 and 1932 with the aid of an amanuensis , Eric Fenby . The lyricism in Delius 's early compositions reflected the music he had heard in America and the influences of European composers such as Edvard Grieg and Richard Wagner .",

  "/wiki/Pietro_Mascagni": "Pietro Mascagni [ a ] ( 7 December 1863 - 2 August 1945 ) was an Italian composer primarily known for his operas . His 1890 masterpiece Cavalleria Rusticana caused one of the greatest sensations in opera history and single-handedly ushered in the Verismo movement in Italian dramatic music . While it was often held that Mascagni , like Ruggiero Leoncavallo , was a one-opera man who could never repeat his first success , L'amico Fritz and Iris have remained in the repertoire in Europe ( especially Italy ) since their premieres . Mascagni wrote fifteen operas , an operetta , several orchestral and vocal works , and also songs and piano music . He enjoyed immense success during his lifetime , both as a composer and conductor of his own and other people 's music . He created a variety of styles in his operas : a Sicilian passion and warmth of Cavalleria , the exotic flavor of Iris , the idylls of L'amico Fritz and Lodoletta , the Gallic chiaroscuro of Isabeau , the steely , Veristic power of Il piccolo Marat and the over-ripe post-romanticism of the lush Parisina .",
