The clan , originally known as the Kakizaki clan ( \u8823\u5d0e\u6c0f ) , had settled in Kakizaki , Kawauchi , Mutsu on the Shimokita Peninsula . Claiming descent from the Takeda clan of Wakasa Province , the family later took the name Matsumae . In exchange for their service in defending the country , the Matsumae were made exempt from owing rice to the shogunate in tribute , and from the sankin-k\u014dtai system , under which most daimy\u014ds ( feudal lords of Edo period Japan ) were required to spend half the year at Edo , while their families spent the entire year at Edo and were , essentially , held hostage to prevent rebellion .

Shinto is polytheistic and revolves around the kami ( gods or spirits ) , supernatural entities believed to inhabit all things .

The latter are staffed by priests who oversee offerings to the kami and the provision of religious paraphernalia such as amulets to the religion 's adherents . Other common rituals include the kagura ritual dances , age specific celebrations , and seasonal festivals . These festivals and rituals are collectively called matsuri .

Shinto does not emphasize specific moral codes other than ritual purity , reverence for kami , and regular communion following seasonal practices .

  "/wiki/\u014cdaiko": "The origin of the instruments is unclear , though there have been many suggestions . Historical accounts , of which the earliest date from 588 CE , note that young Japanese men traveled to Korea to study the kakko , a drum that originated in South China . This study and appropriation of Chinese instruments may have influenced the emergence of taiko . Certain court music styles , especially gigaku and gagaku , arrived in Japan through both Korea and China . In both traditions , dancers were accompanied by several instruments that included drums similar to taiko . Certain percussive patterns and terminology in togaku , an early dance and music style in Japan , in addition to physical features of the kakko , also reflect influence from both China and India on drum use in gagaku performance . Archaeological evidence shows that taiko were used in Japan as early as the 6th century CE , during the latter part of the Kofun period , and were likely used for communication , in festivals , and in other rituals . This evidence was substantiated by the discovery of haniwa statues in the Sawa District of Gunma Prefecture . Two of these figures are depicted playing drums ; one of them , wearing skins , is equipped with a barrel-shaped drum hung from his shoulder and uses a stick to play the drum at hip height . This statue is titled Man Beating the Taiko and is considered the oldest evidence of taiko performance in Japan . Similarities between the playing style demonstrated by this haniwa and known music traditions in Korea and China further suggest influences from these regions .

Originally called kamukura or kamikura ( \u795e\u5ea7 ) , kagura began as sacred dances performed at the Imperial court by shrine maidens ( miko ) who were supposedly descendants of Ame-no-Uzume . Over time , however , these Mikagura ( \u5fa1\u795e\u697d ) performed within the sacred and private precincts of the Imperial courts , inspired popular ritual dances , called satokagura ( \u91cc\u795e\u697d ) , which , being popular forms , practiced in villages all around the country , were adapted into various other folk traditions and developed into a number of different forms . Among these are miko kagura , shishi kagura , and Ise-style and Izumo-style kagura dances . Many more variations have developed over the centuries , including some which are fairly new , and most of which have become highly secularized folk traditions .

  "/wiki/Saibara": "Saibara ( \u50ac\u99ac\u697d ) is a genre of accompanied vocal Japanese court music that existed during the Heian period in the Nara and Kyoto regions . It draws from traditional folk music ( f\u016bzokuuta ( \u98a8\u4fd7\u6b4c ) ) of the Nara period accompanied by togaku instruments , with the exception of the uchimono ( \u6253\u7269 , percussion instruments ) , which are replaced by shakubyoshi ( \u7b0f\u62cd\u5b50 ) , wooden sticks used for rhythm . It may have developed out of music to drive horses along , as the Chinese characters that compose its name seem to indicate but , according to German musicologist Eta Harich-Schneider , there are several other theories . Song texts are short and simple in character and describe scenes of life . The repertoire was once estimated at some 400 songs . In the late Nara period the aristocracy became more interested in complex foreign musical imports . Emperor Horikawa ( 1079-1107 ) , despite the taste for Chinese culture since the Nara period , also cultivated an interest in f\u016bzokuuta . Courtiers sang saibara songs for entertainment . A fashionable aristocrat was not regarded \u00e0 jour if he did not know of the latest Chinese imports , such as toka music . In the 14th century , because of the many wars , the repertoire of saibara declined , as many were lost due to the turmoil , and it was only at the crowning ceremony ( Daij\u014de ( \u5927\u5617\u4f1a ) ) of emperor Emperor Go-Mizunoo , who ruled from 1611 to 1629 , at Nijo Palace that a reconstruction of the old saibara pieces was attempted and the famous saibara piece Ise no umi was performed at the Imperial palace in Ky\u014dto . The emperor 's wife , Fujiwara no Fusahi , tells in her court chronicles how little old material could be found .

Like other celebrated dramas such as the Maodori-hasi and Ibaraki , it is based on the legend of Watanabe no Tsuna and the demon of Rash\u014dmon . The title is a pun , which involves the Raj\u014dmon outer castle gate but Kanze changed it by using the kanji sh\u014d for life rather than the original j\u014d for castle . It is one of the few Noh plays where the supporting waki ( \u8107 ) rather than the normally leading shite ( \u4ed5\u624b ) dominates the action . It is suggested that this can be attributed to the fact that Nobumitsu used to play waki roles when he was an actor . The shite character in this play only makes an appearance at the end and has no dialogue . Rash\u014dmon is also a play which follows characters from one venue to another . Act 1 takes place in the dining hall of a general , but in Act 2 the waki character , Tsuna , climbs the Rasho Gate to determine the truth of a story that a demon resides on the gate top .",

Developed by Kan'ami and his son Zeami , it is the oldest major theatre art that is still regularly performed today . Although the terms Noh and n\u014dgaku are sometimes used interchangeably , n\u014dgaku encompasses both Noh and ky\u014dgen . Traditionally , a full n\u014dgaku program includes five Noh plays with comedic ky\u014dgen plays in between ; an abbreviated program of two Noh plays with one ky\u014dgen piece has become common today . Optionally , an okina play may be presented in the very beginning of n\u014dgaku presentation . Noh is often based on tales from traditional literature with a supernatural being transformed into human form as a hero narrating a story . Noh integrates masks , costumes and various props in a dance-based performance , requiring highly trained actors and musicians . Emotions are primarily conveyed by stylized conventional gestures while the iconic masks represent the roles such as ghosts , women , children , and the elderly . Written in late middle Japanese , the text vividly describes the ordinary people of the twelfth to sixteenth centuries .
