  "/wiki/Ivory-billed_woodpecker": "The ivory-billed woodpecker ( Campephilus principalis ) is one of the largest woodpeckers in the world , at roughly 20 inches ( 51 cm ) long and 30 inches ( 76 cm ) in wingspan . It is native to the bottomland hardwood forests and temperate coniferous forests of the southeastern United States and Cuba . Habitat destruction and , to a lesser extent , hunting has reduced populations so thoroughly that the species is listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature , and the American Birding Association lists the ivory-billed woodpecker as a class 6 species , a category it defines as definitely or probably extinct . The last universally accepted sighting of an American ivory-billed woodpecker occurred in Louisiana in 1944 . However , sporadic reports of sightings and other evidence of the birds ' persistence have continued ever since . In the 21st century reported sightings and analyses of audio and visual recordings have been published in peer reviewed scientific journals as evidence the species persists in Arkansas , Louisiana , and Florida . Various land purchases and habitat restoration efforts have been initiated in areas where sightings and other evidence have suggested a relatively high probability the species exists , to protect any surviving individuals .",

  "/wiki/Tom_Dooley_(song)": "Tom Dooley is a North Carolina folk song based on the 1866 murder of a woman named Laura Foster in Wilkes County , North Carolina , allegedly by Tom Dula . The song is best known today because of a hit version recorded in 1958 by The Kingston Trio . This version was a multi-format hit , which reached # 1 in Billboard and the Billboard R & B listing , and appeared in the Cashbox Country Music Top 20 . The song was selected as one of the American Songs of the Century by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , the National Endowment for the Arts , and Scholastic Inc. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time . Tom Dooley fits within the wider genre of Appalachian sweetheart murder ballads . A local poet named Thomas Land wrote a song about the tragedy , titled Tom Dooley ( which was how Dula 's name was pronounced ) , shortly after Dula was hanged . In the documentary Appalachian Journey ( 1991 ) , folklorist Alan Lomax describes Frank Proffitt as the original source for the song , which was misleading only in that he did n't write it . There are several earlier known recordings , notably one that Grayson and Whitter made in 1929 , approximately 10 years before Proffitt cut his own recording . The Kingston Trio took their version from Frank Warner 's singing . Warner had learned the song from Proffitt , who learned it from his Aunt Nancy Prather , whose parents had known both Laura Foster and Tom Dula . In a 1967 interview , Nick Reynolds of the Kingston Trio recounts first hearing the song from another performer , and then being criticized and sued for taking credit for the song . Supported by the testimony of Anne and Frank Warner , Frank Proffitt was eventually acknowledged by the courts as the preserver of the original version of the song , and the Kingston Trio were ordered to pay royalties to him for their uncredited use of it .",

He grew tobacco , worked as a carpenter , and in a spark plug factory . He was known for his skills as a carpenter and luthier ; Proffitt 's fretless banjos and dulcimers were homemade . In 1937 , Frank Proffitt met folksong collectors Anne and Frank Warner . Frank Warner was searching for a dulcimer builder and thus began a 30-year friendship and song swapping . Warner collected his songs and shared them with Alan Lomax , who included many , including the ballad Tom Dooley that Warner had learned from Proffitt , in his book , Folksong U.S.A. Proffitt had learned the song from his aunt Nancy Prather , who had in turn learnt it from her mother Edy Adeline ( Pardue ) Proffitt , who had known both Dula ( locally pronounced Dooley ) and Laura Foster . The Kingston Trio learned Tom Dooley from a recording by Warner , and were eventually required by court judgement to acknowledge their debt to Proffitt and pay him royalties for the use of the song . Proffitt recorded Tom Dooley and other ballad songs in 1961 , on the album Frank Proffitt Sings Folk Songs , edited by Warner and issued by Folkways Records .

The song was his debut record release and in 1949 , it became the first down-home electric blues song to reach number one in the R & B records chart . Hooker 's song was part of a trend in the late 1940s to a new style of urban electric blues based on earlier Delta blues idioms . Although it is called a boogie , it resembles early North Mississippi Hill country blues rather than the boogie-woogie piano-derived style of the 1930s and 1940s . Hooker gave credit to his stepfather , Will Moore , who taught him the rhythm of Boogie Chillen ' ( chillen ' is a phonetic approximation of Hooker 's pronunciation of children ) when he was a teenager . Some of the song 's lyrics are derived from earlier blues songs . Hooker 's guitar work on the song inspired several well-known guitarists to take up the instrument .

  "/wiki/Play_of_Daniel": "The Play of Daniel , or Ludus Danielis , is either of two medieval Latin liturgical dramas based on the biblical Book of Daniel , one of which is accompanied by monophonic music . Two medieval plays of Daniel survive . The first is one of the plays in the Fleury Playbook , a 13th-century manuscript containing ten liturgical dramas ; the text is by Hilarius , and no music accompanies it . The play itself dates from c. 1140 . The second is a 13th-century drama with monophonic music , written about 1227 to 1234 by students at the school of Beauvais Cathedral , located in northern France . A large portion of the text is poetic rather than strictly liturgical in origin ; it closely follows the narrative of the biblical story of Daniel at the court of Belshazzar . In the US the latter play was revived in the 1950s by Noah Greenberg , director of the New York Pro Musica ; a commentary in English , written and performed by W. H. Auden , was used in some of their performances . A recorded 1958 performance by the group at the Metropolitan Museum of Art , and featuring boy choristers of the Church of the Transfiguration as satraps and soldiers , was released by Decca , with sleeve notes by Paul Henry Lang and Dom Rembert Weakland , O.S.B. , who had discovered the text at the British Library . Since the New York Pro Musica production it has enjoyed many performances among early music troupes . Also important in the history of modern revivals of the Beauvais Cathedral version , Daniel was the 1985 production of the Boston Camerata , staged by Andrea von Ramm , with musical direction by Joel Cohen . In 2008 , The Dufay Collective and William Lyons released their CD , The Play of Daniel on the Harmonia Mundi usa label . A new production of the Play of Daniel by the Boston Camerata , this time under the direction of French-born medievalist Anne Az\u00e9ma , was presented in Boston in November , 2014 .",
  "/wiki/New_York_Pro_Musica": "New York Pro Musica was a vocal and instrumental ensemble that specialized in medieval and Renaissance music . It was co-founded in 1952 , under the name Pro Musica Antiqua , by Noah Greenberg , a choral director , and Bernard Krainis , a recorder player who studied with Erich Katz . Other prominent musicians who joined included Russell Oberlin ( the first American counter-tenor ) and Martha Blackman ( the first American gambist ) and Frederick Renz , who founded Early Music Foundation after Pro Musica disbanded . The ensemble is perhaps best known for reviving the medieval Play of Daniel in the 1950s , which has since become a popular liturgical drama among early music groups . The group gave its first concert at the New School for Social Research in New York City on April 26 , 1953 . The ensemble performed in 1960 for the Peabody Mason Concert series in Boston . The group continued after Greenberg 's death in 1966 and disbanded in 1974 . Greenberg 's successor , musicologist John Reeves White , took over the direction of the ensemble in 1966 ; the last director was George Houle , who tried to bring the group more in line with trends in Europe at a time when the United States was not ready for such changes . Houle went on to teach musicology at Stanford University ."
