Apart from a brief period of ministerial office during the Labour government of 1929-31 , he spent his political life campaigning against established authority and vested interests , his main causes being the promotion of social justice , women 's rights and world disarmament . Originally a radical Liberal , Lansbury became a socialist in the early 1890s , and thereafter served his local community in the East End of London in numerous elective offices . His activities were underpinned by his Christian beliefs which , except for a short period of doubt , sustained him through his life . Elected to Parliament in 1910 , he resigned his seat in 1912 to campaign for women 's suffrage , and was briefly imprisoned after publicly supporting militant action . In 1912 , Lansbury helped to establish the Daily Herald newspaper , and became its editor . Throughout the First World War the paper maintained a strongly pacifist stance , and supported the October 1917 Russian Revolution . These positions contributed to Lansbury 's failure to be elected to Parliament in 1918 . He devoted himself to local politics in his home borough of Poplar , and went to prison with 30 fellow-councillors for his part in the Poplar rates revolt of 1921 . After his return to Parliament in 1922 , Lansbury was denied office in the brief Labour government of 1924 , although he served as First Commissioner of Works in the Labour government of 1929-31 . After the political and economic crisis of August 1931 , Lansbury did not follow his leader , Ramsay MacDonald , into the National Government , but remained with the Labour Party . As the most senior of the small contingent of Labour MPs that survived the 1931 general election , Lansbury became the Leader of the Labour Party .",
