  "/wiki/Viceroyalty_of_New_Spain": "The Viceroyalty of New Spain ( Spanish : Virreinato de Nueva Espa\u00f1a Spanish pronunciation : [ \u03b2irej\u02c8nato \u00f0e \u02c8nwe\u03b2a es\u02c8pa\u0272a ] ( listen ) ) was an integral territorial entity of the Spanish Empire , established by Habsburg Spain during the Spanish colonization of the Americas . It covered a huge area that included territories in North America , South America , Asia and Oceania . It originated in 1521 after the fall of Tenochtitlan , the main event of the Spanish conquest , which did not properly end until much later , as its territory continued to grow to the north . It was officially created on 8 March 1535 as a Kingdom ( Spanish : reino ) , the first of four viceroyalties Spain created in the Americas . Its first viceroy was Antonio de Mendoza y Pacheco , and the capital of the kingdom was Mexico City , established on the ancient Tenochtitlan . It included what is now Mexico plus the current U.S. states of California , Nevada , Colorado , Utah , New Mexico , Arizona , Texas , Oregon , Washington , Florida and parts of Idaho , Montana , Wyoming , Kansas , Oklahoma , Alabama , Mississippi and Louisiana ; as well as the southwestern part of British Columbia of present-day Canada ; plus the Captaincy General of Guatemala ( which included the current countries of Guatemala , the Mexican state of Chiapas , Belize , Costa Rica , El Salvador , Honduras , Nicaragua ) ; the Captaincy General of Cuba ( current Cuba , Dominican Republic , Puerto Rico and Trinidad and Tobago ) ; and the Captaincy General of the Philippines ( including the Philippines , Guam , the Northern Mariana Islands , the Caroline Islands , the Federated States of Micronesia , Palau , the Marshall Islands and the short lived Spanish Formosa in modern-day northern Taiwan , as well as during a century the island of Tidore and the briefly occupied Sultanate of Ternate , both in modern-day Indonesia ) . Other kingdoms of the Spanish Empire bordered New Spain and were given the right of appeal to the most senior representative of the king . These kingdoms were independent of New Spain ( separate from New Spain itself ) : Nueva Galicia ( 1530 ) ; Captaincy General of Guatemala ( 1540 ) ; Nueva Vizcaya ( 1562 ) ; New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n ( 1569 ) ; Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico ( 1598 ) ; Nueva Extremadura ( 1674 ) and Nuevo Santander ( 1746 ) . New Spain proper was itself organized in captaincies general . There were four captaincies : Captaincy General of the Philippines ( 1574 ) , Captaincy General of Cuba , Captaincy General of Puerto Rico and Captaincy General of Santo Domingo . These independent kingdoms and territorial subdivisions each had their own governor and captain generals ( who in New Spain was the viceroy himself , who added this title to his other dignities ) . In Guatemala , Santo Domingo and Nueva Galicia , these officials were called presiding governors , since they were leading royal audiences .",
  "/wiki/History_of_New_Mexico": "The history of New Mexico was based on both archeological evidence , attesting to varying cultures of humans occupying the area of New Mexico since approximately 9200 BC , and written records . The earliest peoples had migrated from northern areas of North America after leaving Siberia via the Bering Land Bridge . Artifacts and architecture demonstrate ancient complex cultures in this region . The first written records of the region were made by the Spanish Conquistadors , who encountered Native American Pueblos when they explored the area in the 16th century . Since that time , the Spanish Empire , Mexico , and the United States ( since 1848 ) have claimed control of the area . The area was governed as New Mexico Territory until 1912 , when it was admitted as a state . The relatively isolated state had an economy dependent on mining . Its residents and government suffered from a reputation for corruption and extreme traditionalism . New Mexico introduced the atomic age in 1945 , as the first nuclear weapons were developed by the federal government in the research center it established at Los Alamos . Ethnically the state has historically been divided among Native American , Hispanic and Anglo elements - the latter mostly migrants from Texas in the late years .",
  "/wiki/Santa_Fe_de_Nuevo_M\u00e9xico": "Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico ( English : Saint Faith of New Mexico ; shortened as Nuevo M\u00e9xico or Nuevo M\u00e9jico , and translated as New Mexico in English ) was a province of the Viceroyalty of New Spain , and later a territory of independent Mexico . The first capital was San Juan de los Caballeros ( at San Gabriel de Yungue-Ouinge ) from 1598 until 1610 , and from 1610 onward the capital was La Villa Real de la Santa Fe de San Francisco de As\u00eds . The naming , capital , the Palace of the Governors , and rule of law were retained as the New Mexico Territory , and the subsequent U.S. State of New Mexico , became a part of the United States . The New Mexican citizenry , primarily consisting of Hispano , Pueblo , Navajo , Apache , and Comanche peoples , became citizens of the United States as a result of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo . Nuevo M\u00e9xico is often incorrectly believed to have taken its name from the nation of Mexico . However , it was named by Spanish explorers who believed the area contained wealthy Amerindian cultures similar to those of the Aztec Empire ( centered in the Valley of Mexico ) , and called the land the Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico .",
  "/wiki/Territory_of_Colorado": "The Territory of Colorado was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from February 28 , 1861 , until August 1 , 1876 , when it was admitted to the Union as the State of Colorado . The territory was organized in the wake of the Pike 's Peak Gold Rush of 1858-1861 , which brought the first large concentration of white settlement to the region . The organic act creating the territory was passed by Congress and signed by President James Buchanan on February 28 , 1861 , during the secessions by Southern states that precipitated the American Civil War . The boundaries of the Colorado Territory were identical with those of the current State of Colorado . The organization of the territory helped solidify Union control over a mineral-rich area of the Rocky Mountains . Statehood was regarded as fairly imminent , but territorial ambitions for statehood were thwarted at the end of 1865 by a veto by President Andrew Johnson . Statehood for the territory was a recurring issue during the Ulysses Grant administration , with Grant advocating statehood against a less willing Congress during Reconstruction . The Colorado Territory ceased to exist when the State of Colorado was admitted to the Union in 1876 . East of the divide , the new territory included the western portion of the Kansas Territory , as well as some of the southwestern Nebraska Territory , and a small parcel of the northeastern New Mexico Territory . On the western side of the divide , the territory included much of the eastern Utah Territory , all of which was strongly controlled by the Ute and Shoshoni . The Eastern Plains were held much more loosely by the intermixed Cheyenne and Arapaho , as well as by the Pawnee , Comanche and Kiowa . In 1861 , ten days before the establishment of the territory , the Arapaho and Cheyenne agreed with the U.S. to give up most their areas of the plains to white settlement but were allowed to live in their larger traditional areas , so long as they could tolerate homesteaders near their camps .",

The Territory of Colorado was created to govern this western region of the former Kansas Territory on February 28 , 1861 . The question of whether Kansas was to be a free or a slave state was , according to the Compromise of 1850 and the Kansas-Nebraska Act , to be decided by popular sovereignty , that is , by vote of the Kansans . The question of who were the Kansans who were eligible to vote ended up causing armed conflict , called the Bleeding Kansas period . Both pro-slavery and free-state partisans encouraged and sometimes supported financially emigration to Kansas , so as to influence the vote . During part of the territorial period there were two different territorial legislatures , with two different constitutions , meeting in two different cities ( one capital was burned by partisans of the other capital ) , and two different applications for statehood , one free and one slave , were sent to the U.S. Congress .",
  "/wiki/Kansas": "Kansas /\u02c8k\u00e6nz\u0259s/ ( listen ) is a U.S. state in the Midwestern United States . Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita , with its most populated county and largest employment center being Johnson County . Kansas is bordered by Nebraska on the north ; Missouri on the east ; Oklahoma on the south ; and Colorado on the west . Kansas is named after the Kansas River , which in turn was named after the Kansa Native Americans who lived along its banks . The tribe 's name ( natively kk\u0105 : ze ) is often said to mean people of the ( south ) wind although this was probably not the term 's original meaning . For thousands of years , what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes . Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys . Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison . Kansas was first settled by Americans in 1827 with the establishment of Fort Leavenworth . The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s , in the midst of political wars over the slavery debate . When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the Kansas-Nebraska Act , abolitionist Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a free state or a slave state . Thus , the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided , and was known as Bleeding Kansas .",
