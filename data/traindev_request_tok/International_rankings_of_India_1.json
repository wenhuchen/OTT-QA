  "/wiki/Apple": "An apple is a sweet , edible fruit produced by an apple tree ( Malus domestica ) . Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus . The tree originated in Central Asia , where its wild ancestor , Malus sieversii , is still found today . Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists . Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures , including Norse , Greek and European Christian tradition . Apple trees are large if grown from seed . Generally , apple cultivars are propagated by grafting onto rootstocks , which control the size of the resulting tree . There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples , resulting in a range of desired characteristics . Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and use , including cooking , eating raw and cider production . Trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal , bacterial and pest problems , which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means . In 2010 , the fruit 's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production . Worldwide production of apples in 2017 was 83.1 million tonnes , with China accounting for half of the total .",
  "/wiki/Bananas": "A banana is an edible fruit - botanically a berry - produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa . In some countries , bananas used for cooking may be called plantains , distinguishing them from dessert bananas . The fruit is variable in size , color , and firmness , but is usually elongated and curved , with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind , which may be green , yellow , red , purple , or brown when ripe . The fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant . Almost all modern edible seedless ( parthenocarp ) bananas come from two wild species - Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana . The scientific names of most cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata , Musa balbisiana , and Musa \u00d7 paradisiaca for the hybrid Musa acuminata \u00d7 M. balbisiana , depending on their genomic constitution . The old scientific name for this hybrid , Musa sapientum , is no longer used . Musa species are native to tropical Indomalaya and Australia , and are likely to have been first domesticated in Papua New Guinea . They are grown in 135 countries , primarily for their fruit , and to a lesser extent to make fiber , banana wine , and banana beer and as ornamental plants . The world 's largest producers of bananas in 2017 were India and China , which together accounted for approximately 38% of total production . Worldwide , there is no sharp distinction between bananas and plantains . Especially in the Americas and Europe , banana usually refers to soft , sweet , dessert bananas , particularly those of the Cavendish group , which are the main exports from banana-growing countries .",
  "/wiki/Bean": "A bean is the seed of one of several genera of the flowering plant family Fabaceae , which are used for human or animal food . They are a part of the vegetable family , and can be cooked in many different ways , including boiling , frying , and baking , and are used in several traditional dishes throughout the world .",
  "/wiki/Water_buffalo": "The water buffalo ( Bubalus bubalis ) or domestic water buffalo is a large bovid originating in the Indian subcontinent , Southeast Asia , and China . Today , it is also found in Europe , Australia , North America , South America and some African countries . The wild water buffalo ( Bubalus arnee ) native to Southeast Asia is considered a different species , but most likely represents the ancestor of the domestic water buffalo . Two extant types of water buffalo are recognized , based on morphological and behavioural criteria - the river buffalo of the Indian subcontinent and further west to the Balkans , Egypt , and Italy , and the swamp buffalo , found from Assam in the west through Southeast Asia to the Yangtze valley of China in the east . The origins of the water buffalo types are debated , although results of a phylogenetic study indicate that the swamp-type may have originated in China and was domesticated about 4,000 years ago , while the river-type may have originated in India and was domesticated about 5,000 years ago . After the domestication of the water buffalo in Southeast Asia , the swamp buffalo dispersed up to the Yangtze River valley between 3,000 and 7,000 years ago . Water buffaloes were traded from the Indus Valley Civilisation to Mesopotamia , in modern Iraq , 2500 BC by the Meluhhas . The seal of a scribe employed by an Akkadian king shows the sacrifice of water buffaloes . At least 130 million water buffaloes exist , and more people depend on them than on any other domestic animal . They are especially suitable for tilling rice fields , and their milk is richer in fat and protein than that of dairy cattle . A large feral population became established in northern Australia in the late 19th century , and there are smaller feral herds in Papua New Guinea , Tunisia , and northeastern Argentina . Feral herds are also present in New Britain , New Ireland , Irian Jaya , Colombia , Guyana , Suriname , Brazil , and Uruguay .",
  "/wiki/Black_pepper": "Black pepper ( Piper nigrum ) is a flowering vine in the family Piperaceae , cultivated for its fruit , known as a peppercorn , which is usually dried and used as a spice and seasoning . When fresh and fully mature , it is about 5 mm ( 0.20 in ) in diameter and dark red , and contains a single seed , like all drupes . Peppercorns and the ground pepper derived from them may be described simply as pepper , or more precisely as black pepper ( cooked and dried unripe fruit ) , green pepper ( dried unripe fruit ) , or white pepper ( ripe fruit seeds ) .",
  "/wiki/Broccoli": "Broccoli is an edible green plant in the cabbage family ( family Brassicaceae , genus Brassica ) whose large flowering head and stalk is eaten as a vegetable . The word broccoli comes from the Italian plural of broccolo , which means the flowering crest of a cabbage , and is the diminutive form of brocco , meaning small nail or sprout . Broccoli is classified in the Italica cultivar group of the species Brassica oleracea . Broccoli has large flower heads , usually dark green in color , arranged in a tree-like structure branching out from a thick stalk which is usually light green . The mass of flower heads is surrounded by leaves . Broccoli resembles cauliflower , which is a different cultivar group of the same Brassica species . Combined in 2017 , China and India produced 73% of the world 's broccoli and cauliflower crops . Broccoli resulted from breeding of cultivated Brassica crops in the northern Mediterranean starting in about the sixth century BC . Since the time of the Roman Empire , broccoli has been commonly consumed , and is eaten raw or cooked . Broccoli is a particularly rich source of vitamin C and vitamin K. Contents of its characteristic sulfur-containing glucosinolate compounds , isothiocyanates and sulforaphane , are diminished by boiling , but are better preserved by steaming , microwaving or stir-frying . Rapini , sometimes called broccoli raab among other names , forms similar but smaller heads , and is actually a type of turnip ( Brassica rapa ) .",
  "/wiki/Cardamom": "Cardamom ( /\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0rd\u0259m\u0259m/ ) , sometimes cardamon or cardamum , is a spice made from the seeds of several plants in the genera Elettaria and Amomum in the family Zingiberaceae . Both genera are native to the Indian subcontinent and Indonesia . They are recognized by their small seed pods : triangular in cross-section and spindle-shaped , with a thin , papery outer shell and small , black seeds ; Elettaria pods are light green and smaller , while Amomum pods are larger and dark brown . Species used for cardamom are native throughout tropical and subtropical Asia . The first references to cardamom are found in Sumer , and in the Ayurvedic literatures of India . Nowadays , it is also cultivated in some other countries , such as Guatemala , Malaysia and Tanzania . The German coffee planter Oscar Majus Kloeffer introduced Indian cardamom ( kerala ) to cultivation in Guatemala before World War I ; by 2000 , that country had become the biggest producer and exporter of cardamom in the world , followed by India . Cardamom is the world 's third-most expensive spice , surpassed in price per weight only by vanilla and saffron .",
  "/wiki/Cashew_apple": "The cashew tree ( Anacardium occidentale ) is a tropical evergreen tree that produces the cashew seed and the cashew apple . The tree can grow as high as 14 m ( 46 ft ) , but the dwarf cashew , growing up to 6 m ( 20 ft ) , has proved more profitable , with earlier maturity and higher yields . The cashew seed is often considered a nut in the culinary sense ; this cashew nut is eaten on its own , used in recipes , or processed into cashew cheese or cashew butter . Like the tree , the nut is often simply called a cashew . The species is native to Central America , the Caribbean Islands , and northern South America , including northeastern Brazil . Portuguese colonists in Brazil began exporting cashew nuts as early as the 1550s . In 2017 , Vietnam , India , and Ivory Coast were the major producers . The shell of the cashew seed yields derivatives that can be used in many applications including lubricants , waterproofing , paints , and arms production , starting in World War II . The cashew apple is a light reddish to yellow fruit , whose pulp can be processed into a sweet , astringent fruit drink or distilled into liquor .",
  "/wiki/Poultry_Farming": "Poultry farming is the form of animal husbandry which raises domesticated birds such as chickens , ducks , turkeys and geese to produce meat or eggs for food . Poultry - mostly chickens - are farmed in great numbers . More than 60 billion chickens are killed for consumption annually . Chickens raised for eggs are known as layers , while chickens raised for meat are called broilers . In the United States , the national organization overseeing poultry production is the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) . In the UK , the national organisation is the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) .",
  "/wiki/Chickpea": "The chickpea or chick pea ( Cicer arietinum ) is an annual legume of the family Fabaceae , subfamily Faboideae . Its different types are variously known as gram or Bengal gram , garbanzo or garbanzo bean , Egyptian pea , chana , and chole . Chickpea seeds are high in protein . It is one of the earliest cultivated legumes , and 7500-year-old remains have been found in the Middle East . Chickpea is a key ingredient in hummus and chana masala , and it can be ground into flour to make falafel . It is also used in salads , soups and stews , curry and other meal products like channa . The chickpea is important in Indian , Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine . In 2017 , India produced 67% of the world total for chickpeas .",
  "/wiki/Coconut": "The coconut tree ( Cocos nucifera ) is a member of the palm tree family ( Arecaceae ) and the only known living species of the genus Cocos . The term coconut ( or the archaic cocoanut ) can refer to the whole coconut palm , the seed , or the fruit , which botanically is a drupe , not a nut . The term is derived from the 16th-century Portuguese and Spanish word coco , meaning 'head ' or 'skull ' after the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features . Coconuts are known for their versatility of uses , ranging from food to cosmetics . The inner flesh of the mature seed , as well as the coconut milk extracted from it , forms a regular part of the diets of many people in the tropics and subtropics . Coconuts are distinct from other fruits because their endosperm contains a large quantity of clear liquid , called coconut water or coconut juice . Mature , ripe coconuts can be used as edible seeds , or processed for oil and plant milk from the flesh , charcoal from the hard shell , and coir from the fibrous husk . Dried coconut flesh is called copra , and the oil and milk derived from it are commonly used in cooking - frying in particular - as well as in soaps and cosmetics . The hard shells , fibrous husks and long pinnate leaves can be used as material to make a variety of products for furnishing and decorating . The coconut also has cultural and religious significance in certain societies , particularly in India , where it is used in Hindu rituals .",
  "/wiki/Coffee": "Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans , the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species . The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa ( specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan ) and Madagascar , the Comoros , Mauritius , and R\u00e9union in the Indian Ocean . Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries , primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas , Southeast Asia , Indian subcontinent , and Africa . The two most commonly grown are C. arabica and C. robusta . Once ripe , coffee berries are picked , processed , and dried . Dried coffee seeds ( referred to as beans ) are roasted to varying degrees , depending on the desired flavor . Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee . Coffee is darkly colored , bitter , slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans , primarily due to its caffeine content . It is one of the most popular drinks in the world , and it can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways ( e.g. , espresso , French press , caff\u00e8 latte ) . It is usually served hot , although iced coffee is a popular alternative . Clinical studies indicate that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial in healthy adults , with continuing research on whether long-term consumption reduces the risk of some diseases , although those long-term studies are generally of poor quality . While coffee is native to Ethiopia and Sudan , the earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking as the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen in southern Arabia in the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines .",
  "/wiki/Cotton": "Cotton is a soft , fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll , or protective case , around the seeds of the cotton plants of the genus Gossypium in the mallow family Malvaceae . The fiber is almost pure cellulose . Under natural conditions , the cotton bolls will increase the dispersal of the seeds . The plant is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world , including the Americas , Africa , Egypt and India . The greatest diversity of wild cotton species is found in Mexico , followed by Australia and Africa . Cotton was independently domesticated in the Old and New Worlds . The fiber is most often spun into yarn or thread and used to make a soft , breathable textile . The use of cotton for fabric is known to date to prehistoric times ; fragments of cotton fabric dated to the fifth millennium BCE have been found in the Indus Valley Civilization , as well as fabric remnants dated back to 6000 BCE in Peru . Although cultivated since antiquity , it was the invention of the cotton gin that lowered the cost of production that led to its widespread use , and it is the most widely used natural fiber cloth in clothing today . Current estimates for world production are about 25 million tonnes or 110 million bales annually , accounting for 2.5% of the world 's arable land . India is the world 's largest producer of cotton . The United States has been the largest exporter for many years .",
  "/wiki/Cow": "Cattle , or cows , are the most common type of large domesticated ungulates . They are a prominent modern member of the subfamily Bovinae , are the most widespread species of the genus Bos , and are most commonly classified collectively as Bos taurus . Cattle are commonly raised as livestock for meat ( beef or veal , see beef cattle ) , for milk ( see dairy cattle ) , and for hides , which are used to make leather . They are used as riding animals and draft animals ( oxen or bullocks , which pull carts , plows and other implements ) . Another product of cattle is dung , which can be used to create manure or fuel . In some regions , such as parts of India , cattle have significant religious meaning . Cattle , mostly small breeds such as the Miniature Zebu , are also kept as pets . Around 10,500 years ago , cattle were domesticated from as few as 80 progenitors in central Anatolia , the Levant and Western Iran . According to an estimate from 2011 , there are 1.4 billion cattle in the world . In 2009 , cattle became one of the first livestock animals to have a fully mapped genome .",

  "/wiki/Ginger": "Ginger ( Zingiber officinale ) is a flowering plant whose rhizome , ginger root or ginger , is widely used as a spice and a folk medicine . It is a herbaceous perennial which grows annual pseudostems ( false stems made of the rolled bases of leaves ) about one meter tall bearing narrow leaf blades . The inflorescences bear pale yellow with purple flowers and arise directly from the rhizome on separate shoots . Ginger is in the family Zingiberaceae , which also includes turmeric ( Curcuma longa ) , cardamom ( Elettaria cardamomum ) , and galangal . Ginger originated in Island Southeast Asia and was likely domesticated first by the Austronesian peoples . It was transported with them throughout the Indo-Pacific during the Austronesian expansion ( c. 5,000 BP ) , reaching as far as Hawaii . Ginger is one of the first spices to have been exported from Asia , arriving in Europe with the spice trade , and was used by ancient Greeks and Romans . The distantly related dicots in the genus Asarum are commonly called wild ginger because of their similar taste .",
  "/wiki/Goat": "The domestic goat or simply goat ( Capra aegagrus hircus ) is a subspecies of C. aegagrus domesticated from the wild goat of Southwest Asia and Eastern Europe . The goat is a member of the animal family Bovidae and the subfamily Caprinae , meaning it is closely related to the sheep . There are over 300 distinct breeds of goat . Goats are one of the oldest domesticated species of animal , and have been used for milk , meat , fur and skins across much of the world . Milk from goats is often turned into goat cheese . Female goats are referred to as does or nannies , intact males are called bucks or billies and juvenile goats of both sexes are called kids . Castrated males are called wethers . While the words hircine and caprine both refer to anything having a goat-like quality , hircine is used most often to emphasize the distinct smell of domestic goats . In 2011 , there were more than 924 million goats living in the world , according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization ."
