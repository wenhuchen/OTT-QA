It is part of the American Mafia originating in South Side , Chicago . The Outfit rose to power in the 1920s under the control of Johnny Torrio and Al Capone , and the period was marked by bloody gang wars for control of the distribution of illegal alcohol during Prohibition . Since then , the Outfit has been involved in a wide range of criminal activities , including loansharking , gambling , prostitution , extortion , political corruption , and murder . Capone was convicted of income tax evasion in 1931 , and the Outfit was next run by Paul Ricca . He shared power with Tony Accardo from 1943 until his death in 1972 ; Accardo became the sole power in the Outfit upon Ricca 's death and was one of the longest-sitting bosses of all time upon his death in the early 1990s . The Outfit did not have a monopoly on organized crime in Chicago , but it was the most powerful , violent , and largest criminal organization in the Midwest . Its influence at its peak stretched as far as California and Florida . Higher law enforcement attention and general attrition has led to its gradual decline since the late 20th century . From 1997 to 2018 , the Chicago Outfit was believed to be led by John DiFronzo .",

He is considered to have been the most powerful drug trafficker in the world . Guzm\u00e1n was born in Sinaloa and raised in a poor farming family . He endured physical abuse at the hands of his father , and also entered the drug trade through his father , helping him grow marijuana for local dealers during his early adulthood . Guzm\u00e1n began working with H\u00e9ctor Luis Palma Salazar by the late 1970s , one of the nation 's rising drug lords .

  "/wiki/Extradition": "Extradition is an act where one jurisdiction delivers a person accused or convicted of committing a crime in another jurisdiction , over to their law enforcement . It is a cooperative law enforcement process between the two jurisdictions and depends on the arrangements made between them . Besides the legal aspects of the process , extradition also involves the physical transfer of custody of the person being extradited to the legal authority of the requesting jurisdiction . Through the extradition process , one sovereign jurisdiction typically makes a formal request to another sovereign jurisdiction ( the requested state ) . If the fugitive is found within the territory of the requested state , then the requested state may arrest the fugitive and subject him or her to its extradition process . The extradition procedures to which the fugitive will be subjected are dependent on the law and practice of the requested state . Between countries , extradition is normally regulated by treaties . Where extradition is compelled by laws , such as among sub-national jurisdictions , the concept may be known more generally as rendition . It is an ancient mechanism , dating back to at least the 13th century BC , when an Egyptian pharaoh , Ramesses II , negotiated an extradition treaty with a Hittite king , Hattusili III .",

  "/wiki/Money_laundering": "Money laundering is the illegal process of concealing the origins of money obtained illegally by passing it through a complex sequence of banking transfers or commercial transactions . The overall scheme of this process returns the money to the launderer in an obscure and indirect way . One problem of criminal activities is accounting for the proceeds without raising the suspicion of law enforcement agencies . Considerable time and effort may be put into strategies which enable the safe use of those proceeds without raising unwanted suspicion . Implementing such strategies is generally called money laundering . After money has been laundered , it can be used for legitimate purposes . Law enforcement agencies of many jurisdictions have set up sophisticated systems in an effort to detect suspicious transactions or activities , and many have set up international cooperative arrangements to assist each other in these endeavors . The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) estimates that The estimated amount of money laundered globally in one year is 2-5% of global GDP , or $ 800 billion - $ 2 trillion in current US dollars . In a number of legal and regulatory systems , the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial and business crime , and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system ( involving things such as securities , digital currencies , credit cards , and traditional currency ) , including terrorism financing and evasion of international sanctions . Most anti-money laundering laws openly conflate money laundering ( which is concerned with source of funds ) with terrorism financing ( which is concerned with destination of funds ) when regulating the financial system . Some countries treat obfuscation of sources of money as also constituting money laundering , whether it is intentional or by merely using financial systems or services that do not identify or track sources or destinations . Other countries define money laundering in such a way as to include money from activity that would have been a crime in that country , even if the activity was legal where the actual conduct occurred .",
  "/wiki/Murder": "Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse , especially the unlawful killing of another human with malice aforethought . This state of mind may , depending upon the jurisdiction , distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide , such as manslaughter . Manslaughter is a killing committed in the absence of malice , brought about by reasonable provocation , or diminished capacity . Involuntary manslaughter , where it is recognized , is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent , recklessness . Most societies consider murder to be an extremely serious crime , and thus that a person convicted of murder should receive harsh punishments for the purposes of retribution , deterrence , rehabilitation , or incapacitation . In most countries , a person convicted of murder generally faces a long-term prison sentence , possibly a life sentence ; and in a few , the death penalty may be imposed .",
  "/wiki/Organized_crime": "Organized crime is a category of transnational , national , or local groupings of highly centralized enterprises run by criminals to engage in illegal activity , most commonly for profit . Some criminal organizations , such as terrorist groups , are politically motivated . Sometimes criminal organizations force people to do business with them , such as when a gang extorts money from shopkeepers for protection . Gangs may become disciplined enough to be considered organized . A criminal organization or gang can also be referred to as a mafia , mob , ring , or syndicate ; the network , subculture and community of criminals may be referred to as the underworld . European sociologists ( e.g . Diego Gambetta ) define the mafia as a type of organized crime group that specializes in the supply of extra-legal protection and quasi law enforcement . Gambetta 's classic work on the Sicilian mafia generates an economic study of the mafia , which exerts great influence on studies of the Russian mafia , the Chinese triads , Hong Kong mafia and the Japanese yakuza . Other organizations - including states , churches , militarist , police forces , and corporations - may sometimes use organized-crime methods to conduct their activities , but their powers derive from their status as formal social institutions . There is a tendency to distinguish organized crime from other forms of crime , such as white-collar crime , financial crimes , political crimes , war crime , state crimes , and treason . This distinction is not always apparent and academics continue to debate the matter . For example , in failed states that can no longer perform basic functions such as education , security , or governance ( usually due to fractious violence or to extreme poverty ) , organized crime , governance and war sometimes complement each other .",

  "/wiki/Life_imprisonment_in_the_United_States": "In the United States , 1 in every 2,000 inhabitants are imprisoned for life . There are many U.S. states in which a convict can be released on parole after a decade or more has passed , but in California , people sentenced to life imprisonment can normally apply for parole after seven years . The laws in the United States divide life sentences between determinate life sentences and indeterminate life sentences . For example , sentences of 15 years to life , 25 years to life , or life with mercy may be given , which is called an indeterminate life sentence . A sentence of life without the possibility of parole or life without mercy is called a determinate life sentence because a sentence of 15 years to life means that it is a life sentence with a non-parole period of 15 years . Parole is not guaranteed but discretionary and so that is an indeterminate sentence . Even if a sentence specifically denies the possibility of parole , government officials may have the power to grant an amnesty , to reprieve , or to commute a sentence to time served ."
