  "/wiki/Canberra-class_Landing_Helicopter_Dock": "The Canberra class is a ship class of two landing helicopter dock ( LHD ) ships built for the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . Planning to upgrade the navy 's amphibious fleet began in 2000 , based on Australian experiences leading the International Force for East Timor peacekeeping operation . With a new climate for growing Australian Navy spending , a desire existed for forward defence capability for landing and supporting troops on Asian territory , that had never existed in Australian history , even with the old Majestic-class light fleet carriers , HMAS Melbourne and HMAS Sydney in the 1970s . In 2004 , French company Direction des Constructions Navales ( DCN ) and Spanish company Navantia were invited to tender proposals , with DCN offering the Mistral-class amphibious assault ship and Navantia proposing the Buque de Proyecci\u00f3n Estrat\u00e9gica design ( later commissioned as Juan Carlos I ) . The Spanish design was selected in 2007 , with Navantia responsible for construction of the ships from the keel to the flight deck , and BAE Systems Australia handling the fabrication of the superstructure and fitting out . Construction of the first ship , HMAS Canberra , commenced in late 2008 , with the hull launched in early 2011 , and sea trials in early 2014 . Canberra was commissioned in November 2014 . Work on the second vessel , HMAS Adelaide , started in early 2010 . Adelaide was commissioned in December 2015 . They are the largest vessels ever operated by the RAN , with a displacement of 27,500 tonnes ( 27,100 long tons ; 30,300 short tons ) . The ships are home-ported at Fleet Base East in Sydney ( which has prompted complaints from nearby residents about machinery noise , exhaust fumes , and blocked views ) and will regularly operate out of Townsville , the location of Lavarack Barracks , home of the Australian Army 's 3rd Brigade . In addition to being located in North Queensland close to Asia and the Pacific Islands , one of the 3rd Brigade 's infantry battalions , the 2nd Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( 2 RAR ) , was selected to become the Army 's specialist amphibious infantry battalion .",

  "/wiki/Armidale-class_patrol_boat": "The Armidale class is a class of patrol boats built for the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . Planning for a class of vessels to replace the fifteen Fremantle-class patrol boats began in 1993 as a joint project with the Royal Malaysian Navy , but was cancelled when Malaysia pulled out of the process . The project was reopened in 1999 under the designation SEA 1444 , with the RAN as the sole participant . Of the seven proposals tendered , the Austal Ships/Defence Maritime Services ( DMS ) proposal for twelve vessels based on an enlarged Bay-class patrol boat was selected . Two additional patrol boats were ordered in 2005 to provide a dedicated patrol force for the North West Shelf Venture . All fourteen vessels were constructed by Austal Ships at Henderson , Western Australia . The first vessel , HMAS Armidale , was commissioned into the RAN in June 2005 , and the last , HMAS Glenelg , entered service in February 2008 . The Armidale-class ships are operated by the Australian Patrol Boat Group , and based in Cairns and Darwin . They are primarily tasked with border protection , fisheries patrols , and the interception of unauthorised arrivals by sea . The Armidales are longer and heavier than their Fremantle-class predecessors , with improved seakeeping ability and increased range , allowing them to reach Australia 's offshore territories . The ships are multi-crewed , with three ship 's companies available for every two vessels , allowing the patrol boats to spend more time at sea without cutting into sailors ' rest or training time . During their early service life , there were problems with the fuel systems across the class , and a 20-bunk auxiliary accommodation compartment has been banned from use after toxic fumes were found in the compartment on multiple occasions .",

  "/wiki/Anzac-class_frigate": "The Anzac class ( also identified as the ANZAC class and the MEKO 200 ANZ type ) is a ship class of ten frigates ; eight operated by the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) and two operated by the Royal New Zealand Navy ( RNZN ) . During the 1980s , the RAN began plans to replace the River-class destroyer escorts ( based on the British Leander Class ) with a mid-capability patrol frigate , and settled on the idea of modifying a proven foreign design for Australian conditions . Around the same time , the RNZN was seeking to replace their Leander-class frigates while maintaining blue-water capabilities . A souring of relations between New Zealand and the United States of America in relation to New Zealand 's nuclear-free zone and the ANZUS security treaty prompted New Zealand to seek improved ties with other nations , particularly Australia . As both nations were seeking warships of similar capabilities , the decision was made in 1987 to collaborate on their acquisition . The project name ( and later , the class name ) is taken from the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps of the First World War . Twelve ship designs were tendered in 1986 . By 1989 , the project had selected a proposal by Germany 's Blohm + Voss , based on their MEKO 200 design , to be built in Australia by AMECON at Williamstown , Victoria . The modular design of the frigates allowed sections to be constructed at Whangarei , New Zealand and Newcastle , New South Wales in addition to Williamstown . The RAN ordered eight ships , while the RNZN ordered two and had the option to add two more . The frigate acquisition was controversial and widely opposed in New Zealand , and as a result , the additional ships were not ordered . In 1992 , work started on the frigates ; 3,600-tonne ( 3,500-long-ton ) ships capable of a 27-knot ( 50 km/h ; 31 mph ) top speed , and a range of 6,000 nautical miles ( 11,000 km ; 6,900 mi ) at 18 knots ( 33 km/h ; 21 mph ) .",

  "/wiki/Hobart-class_destroyer": "The Hobart class is a ship class of three air warfare destroyers ( AWDs ) being built for the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . Planning for ships to replace the Adelaide-class frigates and restore the capability last exhibited by the Perth-class destroyers began by 2000 , initially under acquisition project SEA 1400 , which was re-designated SEA 4000 . Although the designation Air Warfare Destroyer is used to describe ships dedicated to the defence of a naval force ( plus assets ashore ) from aircraft and missile attack , the planned Australian destroyers are expected to also operate in anti-surface , anti-submarine , and naval gunfire support roles . Planning for the Australian Air Warfare Destroyer ( as the class was known until 2006 ) continued through the mid-2000s , with the selection of the Aegis combat system as the intended combat system and ASC as the primary shipbuilder in 2005 . In late 2005 , the AWD Alliance was formed as a consortium of the Defence Materiel Organisation ( DMO ) , ASC , and Raytheon . Between 2005 and 2007 , Gibbs & Cox 's Evolved Arleigh Burke-class destroyer concept and Navantia 's \u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n-class frigate competed for selection as the AWD design . Although the Arleigh Burke design was larger and more capable , the \u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n design was selected in June 2007 as it was an existing design , and would be cheaper , quicker , and less risky to build . Three ships were ordered in October 2007 , and will be assembled at ASC 's facility in Osborne , South Australia , from 31 pre-fabricated modules ( or 'blocks ' ) . An option to build a fourth destroyer was included in the original contract , but has not been exercised . ASC , NQEA Australia , and the Forgacs Group were selected in May 2009 to build the blocks , but within two months , NQEA was replaced by BAE Systems Australia . Construction errors and growing delays led the AWD Alliance to redistribute the construction workload in 2011 , with some modules to be built by Navantia . Increasing slippage has pushed the original planned 2014-2016 commissioning dates out by at least three years , with lead ship Hobart to be completed by June 2017 , Brisbane in September 2018 , and Sydney by March 2020 .",

The boat was launched in August 1993 , but was not completed until ten months later . Numerous problems with the class were exposed by the lengthy sea trials period undertaken by the boat ; Collins was not commissioned into the RAN until mid-1996 , eighteen months behind schedule , and the submarine was not cleared for operational deployments until 2000 .",
  "/wiki/Collins-class_submarine": "The Collins class of six Australian-built diesel-electric submarines is operated by the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . The Collins class takes its name from Australian Vice Admiral John Augustine Collins ; all six submarines are named after significant RAN personnel who distinguished themselves in action during World War II . The boats were the first submarines to be constructed in Australia , prompting widespread improvements in Australian industry and delivering a sovereign ( Australian controlled ) sustainment/maintenance capability . Planning for a new design to replace the RAN 's Oberon-class submarines began in the late 1970s and early 1980s . Proposals were received from seven companies ; two were selected for a funded study to determine the winning design , which was announced in mid-1987 . The submarines , enlarged versions of Swedish shipbuilder Kockums ' V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland class and originally referred to as the Type 471 , were constructed between 1990 and 2003 in South Australia by the Australian Submarine Corporation ( ASC ) . The submarines have been the subject of many incidents and technical problems since the design phase , including accusations of foul play and bias during the design selection , improper handling of design changes during construction , major capability deficiencies in the first submarines , and ongoing technical problems throughout the early life of the class . These problems have been compounded by the inability of the RAN to retain sufficient personnel to operate the submarines - by 2008 , only three could be manned , and between 2009 and 2012 , on average two or fewer were fully operational . The resulting negative press has led to a poor public perception of the Collins class . After 20 years of service issues , the boats have finally provided high availability to the RAN since 2016 . The Collins class was expected to be retired about 2026 , however , the 2016 Defence White Paper extended this into the 2030s .
