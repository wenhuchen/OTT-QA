  "/wiki/Methodist": "Methodism is an umbrella term used to describe denominations of Protestant Christianity which follow the line of the Methodist movement . Methodist denominations are historically related and derive their doctrine of practice and belief from the life and teachings of John Wesley . George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . [ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals , collectively known as the Social Gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people .",

  "/wiki/Modern_History": "The history of the world , in common parlance , is the history of humanity ( or human history ) , as determined from archeology , anthropology , genetics , linguistics , and other disciplines ; and , for periods since the invention of writing , from recorded history and from secondary sources and studies . Humanity 's written history was preceded by its prehistory , beginning with the Palaeolithic Era ( Old Stone Age ) , followed by the Neolithic Era ( New Stone Age ) . The Neolithic saw the Agricultural Revolution begin , between 8000 and 5000 BCE , in the Near East 's Fertile Crescent . During this period , humans began the systematic husbandry of plants and animals . As agriculture advanced , most humans transitioned from a nomadic to a settled lifestyle as farmers in permanent settlements . The relative security and increased productivity provided by farming allowed communities to expand into increasingly larger units , fostered by advances in transportation . Whether in prehistoric or historic times , people always needed to be near reliable sources of potable water . Settlements developed on river banks as early as 3000 BCE in Mesopotamia , on the banks of Egypt 's Nile River , in the Indus River valley , and along China 's rivers . As farming developed , grain agriculture became more sophisticated and prompted a division of labour to store food between growing seasons . Labour divisions led to the rise of a leisured upper class and the development of cities , which provided the foundation for civilization . The growing complexity of human societies necessitated systems of accounting and writing . With civilizations flourishing , ancient history ( Antiquity , including the Classical Age , up to about 500 CE ) saw the rise and fall of empires .",

Originally inhabited by the indigenous Arawak and Ta\u00edno peoples , the island came under Spanish rule following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494 . Many of the indigenous people were either killed or died of diseases to which they had no immunity , and the Spanish thus forcibly transplanted large numbers of African slaves to Jamaica as labourers . The island remained a possession of Spain until 1655 , when England ( later Great Britain ) conquered it , renaming it Jamaica . Under British colonial rule Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter , with a plantation economy dependent on the African slaves and later their descendants . The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838 , and many freedmen chose to have subsistence farms rather than to work on plantations . Beginning in the 1840s , the British began utilising Chinese and Indian indentured labour to work on plantations . The island achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 6 August 1962 .

The title can be traced back to the foundation of the diocese in the year 680 . From then until the 16th century , the bishops were in full communion with the Roman Catholic Church . During the Reformation , the church in England broke away from the authority of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church , at first temporarily and later more permanently . Since the Reformation , the Bishop and Diocese of Worcester has been part of the Church of England and the Anglican Communion . The diocese covers most of the county of Worcestershire , the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley and parts of the City of Wolverhampton . The Episcopal see is in the city of Worcester where the bishop 's throne is located at the Cathedral Church of Christ and the Blessed Virgin Mary . The bishop 's official residence is the Old Palace , Worcester . The bishops had two residences outside the city : Hartlebury Castle near Kidderminster from the 13th century to 2007 and a palace at Alvechurch until it was pulled down in the 17th century . From the elevations of Oswald of Worcester in 961 at Worcester and 972 at York , until 1023 the see was usually held jointly with the ( then rather poorer ) Archbishopric of York . The current Bishop of Worcester is John Inge .",

  "/wiki/John_Owen_(bishop_of_St_David's)": "John Owen ( 24 August 1854 - 4 November 1926 ) was the Professor of Welsh at the St David 's College , as well as the Dean of St Asaph . He became the Bishop of St David 's in 1897 . Born at Ysgubor Wen , Caernarfonshire ( Gwynedd ) , his father Griffith Owen was a Welsh Calvinistic Methodist . Though he never deviated from his own loyalties , he watched his sons career as an Anglican with great pride . Owens mother , Ann Jones from Aberdaron , could not easily reconcile herself to her son becoming an Anglican , however , nor could she wholly accept the fact that he married an English wife . In 1872 , Owen was awarded a mathematical scholarship at Jesus College , Oxford , where he read classics and mathematics . As a graduate , he began a teaching career at Botwnnog grammar school . Whilst at Botwnnog , Owen discovered an interest in the Anglicanism and was gradually drawn towards ordination , though he decided to teach for a few years until he was sure of his vocation . As a respected educator , Owen was appointed Professor of Welsh at St Davids College , Lampeter ( now the University of Wales Trinity Saint David ) in 1879 and committed himself in two respects : he would advance the study of the Welsh language at the college and would aim to be ordained before , or soon after , joining the college . In both respects he was successful and was ordained deacon in 1879 and priest in 1880 . In 1889 , A. G. Edwards , newly appointed Bishop of St Asaph , invited Owen to join him as dean . At St Asaph , Owen maintained an interest in education and his colleagues nominated him to serve on the charter committee of the nascent University of Wales , established in 1891 , which gave him a new emphasis to his existing interest in higher education .",
  "/wiki/Honour_Moderations": "Honour Moderations ( or Mods ) are a set of examinations at the University of Oxford at the end of the first part of some degree courses ( e.g. , Greats or Literae Humaniores ) . Honour Moderations candidates have a class awarded ( hence the 'honours ' ) . However , this does not count towards the final degree . In other courses , Prelims ( i.e. , preliminary examinations ) are the first set of examinations but have no class awarded for them . These first examinations are termed 'First Public Examinations ' . Having passed the First Public Examinations , students take a course leading to the 'Second Public Examinations ' , more commonly known as Finals . Finals are held at the end of all first degree courses at Oxford for arts subjects and may be split into examinations after the second , third and , if applicable , fourth year for some science subjects . Honour Moderations in Classics has been called one of the hardest examinations in the world . However , in recent years , the subject matter has been changed so that proficiency in both Latin and Greek languages is no longer required and the number of papers in the exam has been reduced , along with an extension in the time allowed to finish .",
