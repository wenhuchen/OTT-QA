  "/wiki/The_Football_League": "The English Football League ( EFL ) is a league competition featuring professional association football clubs from England and Wales . Founded in 1888 as the Football League , the league is the oldest such competition in world football . It was the top-level football league in England from its foundation until 1992 , when the top 22 clubs split away to form the Premier League . The three leagues below the Premier League are known as the Championship , League One and League Two , normally with 24 clubs in each division ( 72 in total ; in the 2019-2020 season , League One was reduced to 23 following the expulsion of Bury ) . Promotion and relegation between these divisions is a central feature of the League and is further extended to allow the top Championship clubs to exchange places with the lowest-placed clubs in the Premier League , and the bottom clubs of League Two to switch with the top clubs of the National League , thus integrating the League into the English football league system . Although primarily a competition for English clubs , clubs from Wales - currently Cardiff City , Swansea City and Newport County - also take part , while in the past Wrexham , Merthyr Town and Aberdare Athletic have been members . The Football League was associated with a title sponsor between 1983 and 2016 . As this sponsor changed over the years the league too has been known by various names . Starting with the 2016-17 season , the league has moved away from having a title sponsor , rebranding itself as the English Football League ( EFL ) , in much the same way the Premier League is known as the EPL internationally . The English Football League is also the name of the governing body of the league competition , and this body also organises two knock-out cup competitions , the EFL Cup and the EFL Trophy . The operations centre of the Football League is in Preston , while its commercial office is in London . The commercial office was formerly based in Lytham St Annes , after its original spell in Preston .",

Though he had an undistinguished playing career , he went on to become one of the most successful and influential managers in early 20th-century English football , before his sudden death in 1934 . As a player , Chapman played for a variety of clubs , at Football League and non-League levels . His record was generally unremarkable as a player ; he made fewer than 40 League appearances over the course of a decade and did not win any major honours . Instead , he found success as a manager , first at Northampton Town between 1908 and 1912 , whom he led to a Southern League title . This attracted the attention of larger clubs and he moved to Leeds City , where he started to improve the team 's fortunes before the First World War intervened . After the war ended , City were implicated in an illegal payments scandal and were eventually disbanded . Chapman was initially banned from football but successfully appealed . He took over at Huddersfield Town , winning an FA Cup and two First Division titles in the period of four years . In 1925 , Arsenal successfully tempted Chapman to join them , and he led the club to its first FA Cup success and two First Division titles . His work at Arsenal resulted in them becoming the dominant team of the 1930s - they would win five League titles in the decade - but he did not live to see them do so , dying suddenly from pneumonia in 1934 , at the age of 55 . Not only credited with turning round the fortunes of both Huddersfield Town and Arsenal , he is regarded as one of the game 's first modernisers .",
