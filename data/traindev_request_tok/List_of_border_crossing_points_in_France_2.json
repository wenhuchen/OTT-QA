The White Cliffs of Dover can easily be seen on a clear day from Calais . Calais is a major port for ferries between France and England , and since 1994 , the Channel Tunnel has linked nearby Coquelles to Folkestone by rail . Due to its position , Calais since the Middle Ages has been a major port and a very important centre for transport and trading with England . Calais came under English control after Edward III of England captured the city in 1347 , followed by a treaty in 1360 that formally assigned Calais to English rule . Calais grew into a thriving centre for wool production , and came to be called the brightest jewel in the English crown owing to its great importance as the gateway for the tin , lead , lace and wool trades ( or staples ) . Calais remained under English control until its capture by France in 1558 . The town was virtually razed to the ground during World War II , when in May 1940 , it was a strategic bombing target of the invading German forces who took the town during the Siege of Calais .

Roscoff is also a traditional departure point for Onion Johnnies . After lobbying by local economic leaders headed by Alexis Gourvennec , the French government agreed in 1968 to provide a deep-water port at Roscoff . Existing ferry operators were reluctant to take on the relatively long Plymouth/Roscoff crossing , so Gourvennec and colleagues founded Brittany Ferries . Since the early 1970s , Roscoff has been developed as a ferry port for the transport of Breton agricultural produce , and for motor tourism . Brittany Ferries and Irish Ferries link Roscoff with both Ireland and the United Kingdom . Due to the richness of iodine in the surrounding waters and the mild climate maintained by a sea current that only varies between 8 and 18 \u00b0C ( 46 and 64 \u00b0F ) , Roscoff is also a centre of post-cure which gave rise to the concept of thalassotherapy in the latter half of the 19th century . A French doctor , Louis-Eug\u00e8ne Bagot , opened the Institut marin in Roscoff in 1899 , the first centre for thalassotherapy in Europe . Since then many important centres of thalassotherapy such as the Institut de Rockroum ( originally Institut marin ) , the clinic Kerl\u00e9na , and a heliomarin hospital founded in 1900 , the Perharidy Centre , can be found on the edges of the sea at Roscoff . The nearby \u00cele de Batz , called Enez Vaz in Breton , is a small island that can be reached by launch from the harbour .",
  "/wiki/Cork_(city)": "Cork ( /k\u0254\u02d0rk/ ; Irish : Corcaigh , pronounced [ \u02c8ko\u027ek\u026a\u025f ] , from corcach , meaning marsh ) is the second largest city in Ireland .

  "/wiki/Plymouth": "Plymouth ( /\u02c8pl\u026am\u0259\u03b8/ ( listen ) ) is a port city situated on the south coast of Devon , England , approximately 37 miles ( 60 km ) south-west of Exeter and 190 miles ( 310 km ) west-south-west of London . Enclosing the city are the mouths of the river Plym and river Tamar , which are naturally incorporated into Plymouth Sound to form a boundary with Cornwall . Plymouth 's early history extends to the Bronze Age when a first settlement emerged at Mount Batten . This settlement continued as a trading post for the Roman Empire , until it was surpassed by the more prosperous village of Sutton founded in the ninth century , now called Plymouth . In 1620 , the Pilgrim Fathers departed Plymouth for the New World and established Plymouth Colony , the second English settlement in what is now the United States of America . During the English Civil War , the town was held by the Parliamentarians and was besieged between 1642 and 1646 . Throughout the Industrial Revolution , Plymouth grew as a commercial shipping port , handling imports and passengers from the Americas , and exporting local minerals ( tin , copper , lime , china clay and arsenic ) . The neighbouring town of Devonport became a strategic Royal Naval shipbuilding and dockyard town . In 1914 three neighbouring independent towns , viz. , the county borough of Plymouth , the county borough of Devonport , and the urban district of East Stonehouse were merged to form a single County Borough . The combined town took the name of Plymouth which , in 1928 , achieved city status . The city 's naval importance later led to its being targeted by the German military and partially destroyed by bombing during World War II , an act known as the Plymouth Blitz . After the war the city centre was completely rebuilt and subsequent expansion led to the incorporation of Plympton and Plymstock along with other outlying suburbs in 1967 .",
