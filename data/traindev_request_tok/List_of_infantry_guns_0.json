  "/wiki/Caliber": "In guns , particularly firearms , caliber ( or calibre in British English ) is the specified nominal internal diameter of the gun barrel bore regardless of how or where the bore is measured and whether or not the finished bore matches that specification . It is measured in inches to an accuracy of hundredths or thousandths of an inch or in millimeters . For example , a .45 caliber firearm has a barrel diameter of roughly 0.45 inches ( 11 mm ) . Barrel diameters can also be expressed using metric dimensions . For example , a 9 mm pistol has a barrel diameter of about 9 millimeters . Due to the inaccuracy and imprecision of imperial dimensions converted to metric units , metric designations are typically far out of specifications published in decimal inches . True caliber specifications require imperial measure , and even when cartridge designations ( often mistakenly referred to as caliber ) only specify caliber to even tenths or hundredths of an inch , actual barrel/chamber/projectile dimensions are published to at least thousandths of an inch and frequently tolerances extend into ten-thousandths of an inch . In a rifled barrel , the distance is measured between opposing lands or between opposing grooves ; groove measurements are common in cartridge designations originating in the United States , while land measurements are more common elsewhere in the world . Measurements across the grooves are used for maximum precision because rifling and the specific caliber so-measured is the result of final machining process which cuts grooves into the rough bore leaving the lands behind . Good performance requires a concentric , straight bore that accurately centers the projectile within , in preference to a tight fit which can be achieved even with off-center , crooked bores that cause excessive friction , fouling and an out-of-balance , wobbling projectile in flight . While modern firearms are generally referred to by the name of the cartridge the gun is chambered for , they are still categorized together based on bore diameter . For example , a firearm might be described as a 30 caliber rifle , which could be any of a wide range of cartridges using a roughly 0.30 inches ( 7.6 mm ) projectile ; or a 22 rimfire , referring to any rimfire firearms firing cartridges with a .22 caliber projectile .",

  "/wiki/Austria-Hungary": "Austria-Hungary , often referred to as the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Dual Monarchy , was a constitutional monarchy in Central and Eastern Europe between 1867 and 1918 . It was formed when the Austrian Empire adopted a new constitution ; as a result Austria ( Cisleithania ) and Hungary ( Transleithania ) were placed on equal footing . It dissolved when its member states proclaimed sovereignty and independence following the First World War . The union was established by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 on 30 March 1867 in the aftermath of the Austro-Prussian War . It consisted of two monarchies ( Austria and Hungary ) , and one autonomous region : the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia under the Hungarian crown , which negotiated the Croatian-Hungarian Settlement in 1868 . It was ruled by the House of Habsburg , and constituted the last phase in the constitutional evolution of the Habsburg Monarchy . Following the 1867 reforms , the Austrian and Hungarian states were co-equal in power . Foreign and military affairs came under joint oversight , but all other governmental faculties were divided between respective states . Austria-Hungary was a multinational state and one of Europe 's major powers at the time . Austria-Hungary was geographically the second-largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire , at 621,538 km2 ( 239,977 sq mi ) , and the third-most populous ( after Russia and the German Empire ) . The Empire built up the fourth-largest machine building industry of the world , after the United States , Germany , and the United Kingdom . Austria-Hungary also became the world 's third largest manufacturer and exporter of electric home appliances , electric industrial appliances and power generation apparatus for power plants , after the United States and the German Empire .",

The third-largest empire in history , at its greatest extent stretching over three continents , Europe , Asia , and North America , the Russian Empire was surpassed in size only by the British and Mongol empires . The rise of the Russian Empire coincided with the decline of neighboring rival powers : the Swedish Empire , the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , Persia and the Ottoman Empire . It played a major role in 1812-1814 in defeating Napoleon 's ambitions to control Europe and expanded to the west and south . The House of Romanov ruled the Russian Empire from 1721 until 1762 . Its matrilineal branch of patrilineal German descent , the House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov , ruled from 1762 to the end of the empire . At the beginning of the 19th century , the Russian Empire extended from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea in the south , from the Baltic Sea on the west into Alaska and Northern California in America on the east . With 125.6 million subjects registered by the 1897 census , it had the third-largest population in the world at the time , after Qing China and India . Like all empires , it featured great diversity in terms of economies , ethnicities , languages , and religion . There were many dissident elements that launched numerous rebellions and assassinations over the centuries . In the 19th century , they were closely watched by the imperial secret police , and thousands were exiled to Siberia .

  "/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America": "The Confederate States of America ( CSA or C.S . ) - commonly referred to as the Confederacy - was an unrecognized republic in North America that existed from 1861 to 1865 . The Confederacy was originally formed by seven secessionist slave-holding states - South Carolina , Mississippi , Florida , Alabama , Georgia , Louisiana , and Texas - in the Lower South region of the United States , whose economy was heavily dependent upon agriculture , particularly cotton , and a plantation system that relied upon the labor of African-American slaves . Convinced that the institution of slavery was threatened by the November 1860 election of Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln to the U.S. presidency on a platform which opposed the expansion of slavery into the western territories , the Confederacy declared its secession in rebellion against the United States , with the loyal states becoming known as the Union during the ensuing American Civil War . Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens described its ideology as being centrally based upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man ; that slavery , subordination to the superior race , is his natural and normal condition . Before Lincoln took office in March , a new Confederate government was established in February 1861 which was considered illegal by the government of the United States . States volunteered militia units , and the new government hastened to form its own Confederate States Army from nothing practically overnight . After the American Civil War began in April , four slave states of the Upper South - Virginia , Arkansas , Tennessee , and North Carolina - also seceded and joined the Confederacy . The Confederacy later accepted Missouri and Kentucky as members , although neither officially declared secession nor were they ever largely controlled by Confederate forces ; Confederate shadow governments attempted to control the two states but were later exiled from them . The government of the United States ( the Union ) rejected the claims of secession , considering it illegitimate . The war began April 12 , 1861 , when the Confederates attacked Fort Sumter , a Union fort in the harbor of Charleston , South Carolina . No foreign government ever officially recognized the Confederacy as an independent country , although Great Britain and France granted it belligerent status , which allowed Confederate agents to contract with private concerns for arms and other supplies .",

Berlin remained its capital , and Otto , Prince of Bismarck , Minister-President of Prussia became Chancellor , the head of government . As these events occurred , the Prussian-led North German Confederation and its southern German allies were still engaged in the Franco-Prussian War .

Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",

The first 84 guns were delivered in June 1944 . By the end of the war 1,304 guns were operational . While the gun carriage was an old design , the gun itself was a new design created by Krupp , though the design had been shelved at the time of its conception . The gun has two distinctive features : the first is the large four-baffle muzzle brake and the second is the vertical sliding-block breech that was considered unusual for a Krupp designed gun .

It covers an area of 30,689 km2 ( 11,849 sq mi ) and has a population of more than 11.5 million , making it the 22nd most densely populated country in the world and the 6th most densely populated country in Europe , with a density of 376 per square kilometre ( 970/sq mi ) . The capital and largest city is Brussels ; other major cities are Antwerp , Ghent , Charleroi and Li\u00e8ge . The sovereign state is a federal constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system . Its institutional organization is complex and is structured on both regional and linguistic grounds . It is divided into three highly autonomous regions : the Flemish Region in the north , Wallonia in the south , and the Brussels-Capital Region . Brussels is the smallest and most densely populated region , as well as the richest region in terms of GDP per capita . Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups or communities : the Dutch-speaking Flemish Community , which constitutes about 60 percent of the population , and the French-speaking Community , which comprises about 40 percent of all Belgians . A small German-speaking Community , numbering around one percent , exists in the East Cantons . The Brussels-Capital Region is officially bilingual ( French and Dutch ) , although French is the dominant language . Belgium 's linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in its political history and complex system of governance , made up of six different governments .",
  "/wiki/7.62_cm_Infanteriegesch\u00fctz_L/16.5": "The 7.62 cm Infanteriegesch\u00fctz L/16.5 was an infantry gun used by Germany in World War I. German field guns had proven too heavy to accompany the infantry in the assault and the Germans resorted to a variety of solutions in an effort to find something that could help the infantry deal with bunkers and other obstacles . Enormous numbers of Russian 7.62 cm Model 1910 Putilov fortress guns had been captured early in the war and Krupp was told to adapt them for use as infantry guns . They mounted the barrel and breech of the Russian guns on a new solid box-trail carriage with two narrow seats behind the gunshield , facing to the rear . The gun retained its extraordinary depression of -18.6\u00b0 , which was a legacy of its original purpose to fire down into fortress ditches , although its limited elevation prevented it from ranging past 2.7 kilometres ( 3,000 yd ) without digging in the trail . It used captured Russian canister ammunition for short-range engagements , but Rheinmetall manufactured its HE shell . It proved to be popular with its crews , who appreciated its light weight , accuracy and good effect of the shell . Unfortunately the gun wore out quickly due to the poor-quality steel used by the Russians , and this degraded its accuracy significantly . In their desire to save weight , Krupp had lightened the carriage a bit too much and it proved to be rather fragile in normal use . The 7.7 cm Infanteriegesch\u00fctz L/20 was intended to rectify its shortcomings , but it remained in use for the remainder of the war .",
  "/wiki/7.7_cm_Infanteriegesch\u00fctz_L/20": "The 7.7 cm Infanteriegesch\u00fctz L/20 was an infantry gun used by Germany in World War I . It was designed by Krupp to rectify the shortcomings of the 7.62 cm Infanteriegesch\u00fctz L/16.5 . Krupp mounted a shortened 7.7 cm Feldkanone 96 n.A on one of their mountain howitzer carriages . It fired the full range of ammunition of the FK 96 n.A. , but generally only with a reduced charge , although it retained the capacity to fire the old full-power charges that gave a maximum muzzle velocity of 435 m/s ( 1427 ft/s ) . It also used a new full-power anti-tank round . Generally , it broke down into two loads for transport , although it could break down into a maximum of eight loads . While generally liked by the troops , it was thought to be too heavy and slow to break down and reassemble . The German search for a better infantry gun that maximized the use of existing components continued with Krupp 's 7.7 cm Infanteriegesch\u00fctz L/27 .",
  "/wiki/7.7_cm_Infanteriegesch\u00fctz_L/27": "The 7.7 cm Infanteriegesch\u00fctz L/27 was an infantry gun used by Germany in World War I . It was intended to replace the 7.7 cm Infanteriegesch\u00fctz L/20 , but only saw limited service . It was another variant of the 7.7 cm FK 96 n.A . using the tube , breech and carriage of the older gun . The carriage was modified with smaller wheels set closer together and lacked the crew seats and lower part of the shield . It was transported in two loads . Only enough guns for eighteen batteries had been ordered and delivered in the Spring of 1917 as the Germans continued their search for the ideal infantry gun by ordering the Austrian Skoda 7.5 cm Gebirgskanone 15 .",
  "/wiki/15_cm_sIG_33": "The 15 cm sIG 33 ( schweres Infanterie Gesch\u00fctz 33 , lit . Heavy Infantry Gun ) was the standard German heavy infantry gun used in the Second World War . It was the largest weapon ever classified as an infantry gun by any nation . Sources differ on the development history , but the gun itself was of conventional design . Early production models were horse-drawn , with wooden wheels . Later production models had pressed steel wheels , with solid rubber tires and air brakes for motor towing , albeit at a low speed ( only carriages with pneumatic tires and suspension system could be towed at highway speeds ) . As with most German artillery carriages , the solid rubber tires and lack of springing meant that the gun could n't safely be towed above 10 mph , and horse-drawing was still extensively employed . The sIG 33 was rather heavy for its mission , and it was redesigned in the late 1930s to incorporate light alloys . This saved about 150 kilograms ( 330 lb ) , but the outbreak of war forced the return to the original design before more than a few hundred were made , as the Luftwaffe had a higher priority for light alloys . A new carriage , made entirely of light alloys , was tested around 1939 , but was not accepted for service .",

The gun was produced in limited numbers in the Soviet Union and saw action with the Soviet Army in World War II . A modified version of the design was also adopted in Germany , as 15 cm sIG 33 .",
  "/wiki/Soviet_Union": "The Soviet Union , [ b ] officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR or \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 ) , [ c ] was a federal sovereign state in northern Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991 . Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas ."
