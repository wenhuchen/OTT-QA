  "/wiki/The_Beatles": "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960 . With a line-up comprising John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison and Ringo Starr , they are regarded as the most influential band of all time . The group were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music 's recognition as an art form . Rooted in skiffle , beat and 1950s rock and roll , their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways ; the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock . As pioneers in recording , songwriting and artistic presentation , the group revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era 's youth and sociocultural movements . Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney , the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960 , initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass . The core trio of Lennon , McCartney and Harrison , together since 1958 , went through a succession of drummers , including Pete Best , before asking Starr to join them in 1962 . Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings , greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit , Love Me Do , in late 1962 . As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed Beatlemania , the band acquired the nickname the Fab Four , with Epstein , Martin and other members of the band 's entourage sometimes given the informal title of fifth Beatle . By early 1964 , the Beatles were international stars , leading the British Invasion of the United States pop market and breaking numerous sales records . They soon made their film debut with A Hard Day 's Night ( 1964 ) . From 1965 onwards , they produced increasingly innovative recordings , including the albums Rubber Soul ( 1965 ) , Revolver ( 1966 ) and Sgt .",
  "/wiki/Lennon\u2013McCartney": "Lennon-McCartney ( sometimes McCartney-Lennon ) was the songwriting partnership between English musicians John Lennon ( 1940-1980 ) and Paul McCartney ( born 1942 ) of the Beatles . It is the best known and most successful musical collaboration ever by records sold , with the Beatles selling over 600 million records worldwide as of 2004 . Between 5 October 1962 and 8 May 1970 , the partnership published approximately 180 jointly credited songs , of which the vast majority were recorded by the Beatles , forming the bulk of their catalogue . Unlike many songwriting partnerships that comprise separate lyricist and composer , such as Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller , Rodgers and Hammerstein , Hal David and Burt Bacharach or Elton John and Bernie Taupin , both Lennon and McCartney wrote lyrics and music . Sometimes , especially early on , they would collaborate extensively when writing songs , working eyeball to eyeball as Lennon phrased . Later , it was more common for one of the two credited authors to write all or most of a song with limited input from the other . By an agreement made before the Beatles became famous , Lennon and McCartney were credited equally with songs that either one of them wrote while their partnership lasted . Lennon-McCartney compositions have been the subject of numerous cover versions . According to Guinness World Records , Yesterday has been recorded by more musicians than any other song .",

In the mid-1960s , he had two books published : In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works , both collections of nonsensical writings and line drawings .

His lyrics during this period incorporated a wide range of political , social , philosophical , and literary influences , defied pop-music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture .

The album featured Blowin ' in the Wind and the thematically complex A Hard Rain 's a- Gon na Fall . For many of these songs , he adapted the tunes and phraseology of older folk songs . He went on to release the politically charged The Times They Are a-Changin ' and the more lyrically abstract and introspective Another Side of Bob Dylan in 1964 . In 1965 and 1966 , Dylan encountered controversy when he adopted electrically amplified rock instrumentation , and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most important and influential rock albums of the 1960s : Bringing It All Back Home ( 1965 ) , Highway 61 Revisited ( 1965 ) and Blonde on Blonde ( 1966 ) .
