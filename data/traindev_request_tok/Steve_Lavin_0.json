Leading up to the draft , there was no doubt that Tim Duncan would be selected at No . 1 by the Spurs , and the rest of the draft was regarded with some skepticism . The Celtics had the third and sixth picks , selecting Chauncey Billups and Ron Mercer , both of whom were traded in the next two years . The Washington Wizards forfeited their 1997 first-round pick in connection with the signing of Juwan Howard .

By the end of the 1997 season , all three players were traded and it was time to rebuild . With the sixth selection in 1998 , they drafted Robert Traylor and quickly traded him to the Milwaukee Bucks for Dirk Nowitzki and Pat Garrity . They then traded Garrity in a package to the Phoenix Suns for Steve Nash . With Nash and Nowitzki , the Mavericks quickly went from a lottery team in the late 1990s to a perennial playoff contender throughout the 2000s . Nowitzki went on to win the 2011 NBA Finals with Dallas without Nash , but with Kidd . Meanwhile , the Raptors were a recent expansion team that had failed to win more than 30 games in its first three seasons .

The Kings , having been a perennial lottery bound franchise , skyrocketed in popularity with the addition of Chris Webber and 7th pick Jason Williams .

This was the last NBA draft for which high school players were eligible .

International players , defined in the NBA 's collective bargaining agreement as non-US nationals who did not complete athletic eligibility at a U.S. high school , must turn 19 ( or older ) in the calendar year of the draft , up from 18 . As of 2016 , the only players to have declared for the NBA draft straight out of high school ever since these restrictions took place were Satnam Singh Bhamara ( 2015 ) , Thon Maker ( 2016 ) , and Anfernee Simons ( 2018 ) .
