  "/wiki/Brig": "A brig is a sailing vessel with two square-rigged masts . During the Age of Sail , brigs were seen as fast and maneuverable and were used as both naval warships and merchant vessels . They were especially popular in the 18th and early 19th centuries . Brigs fell out of use with the arrival of the steam ship because they required a relatively large crew for their small size and were difficult to sail into the wind . Their rigging differs from that of a brigantine which has a gaff-rigged mainsail , while a brig has a square mainsail with an additional gaff-rigged spanker behind the mainsail .",

  "/wiki/Robert_C_Hammond_(sternwheeler)": "The Robert C Hammond was the last sternwheeler built for service on the upper Fraser and Nechako Rivers . She was owned by the Fort George Lake and River Transportation Company , a partnership of George Hammond and his brother . She was launched at the Central Fort George town-site of Fort George on May 22 , 1913 . She was built so that George Hammond , the promoter of Central Fort George , could claim that his community had steamer service . Central Fort George was on the Nechako River and the large sternwheelers owned by the BC Express Company , despite a $ 50 per trip inducement , could rarely call there , as there often were sandbars unless the water was very high . The rival sternwheelers of the South Fort George town-site owned by the Fort George Lumber and Navigation Company were not interested in helping George Hammond promote Central . In 1913 , the Robert C Hammond made several trips on the Nechako as well as working on the route from Soda Creek to Fort George . For one auspicious moment in her short career , she was going to be a Royal Mail Ship for the newly formed Imperial Express Company which had been formed by Mayor JT Robinson of Kamloops and JC Shields of Vancouver , which had won the government mail contract from the BC Express Company .",

Its southern border with the United States , stretching some 8,891 kilometres ( 5,525 mi ) , is the world 's longest bi-national land border . Canada 's capital is Ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . As a whole , Canada is sparsely populated , with most of its land area dominated by forest and tundra . Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",
