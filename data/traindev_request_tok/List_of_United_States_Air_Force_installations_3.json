  "/wiki/Rockwell_B-1_Lancer": "The Rockwell B-1 Lancer [ N 1 ] is a supersonic variable-sweep wing , heavy bomber used by the United States Air Force . It is commonly called the Bone ( from B-One ) . It is one of three strategic bombers in the U.S. Air Force fleet as of 2020 [ update ] , the other two being the B-2 Spirit and the B-52 Stratofortress . The B-1 was first envisioned in the 1960s as a platform that would combine the Mach 2 speed of the B-58 Hustler with the range and payload of the B-52 , and was meant to ultimately replace both bombers . After a long series of studies , Rockwell International ( now part of Boeing ) won the design contest for what emerged as the B-1A . This version had a top speed of Mach 2.2 at high altitude and the capability of flying for long distances at Mach 0.85 at very low altitudes . The combination of the high cost of the aircraft , the introduction of the AGM-86 cruise missile that flew the same basic profile , and early work on the stealth bomber all significantly affected the need for the B-1 . This led to the program being canceled in 1977 , after the B-1A prototypes had been built . The program was restarted in 1981 , largely as an interim measure due to delays in the B-2 stealth bomber program , with the B-2 eventually reaching initial operational capability in 1997 . This led to a redesign as the B-1B , which differed from the B-1A by having a lower top speed at high altitude of Mach 1.25 , but improved low-altitude performance of Mach 0.96 . The electronics were also extensively improved during the redesign , and the airframe was improved to allow takeoff with the maximum possible fuel and weapons load . The B-1B began deliveries in 1986 and formally entered service with Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) as a nuclear bomber in that same year .",
  "/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_B-2_Spirit": "The Northrop ( later Northrop Grumman ) B-2 Spirit , also known as the Stealth Bomber , is an American heavy strategic bomber , featuring low observable stealth technology designed for penetrating dense anti-aircraft defenses ; it is a flying wing design with a crew of two . The bomber can deploy both conventional and thermonuclear weapons , such as up to eighty 500-pound class ( 230 kg ) Mk 82 JDAM Global Positioning System-guided bombs , or sixteen 2,400-pound ( 1,100 kg ) B83 nuclear bombs . The B-2 is the only acknowledged aircraft that can carry large air-to-surface standoff weapons in a stealth configuration . Development started under the Advanced Technology Bomber ( ATB ) project during the Carter administration ; its expected performance was one of the President 's reasons for the cancellation of the Mach 2 capable B-1A bomber . The ATB project continued during the Reagan administration , but worries about delays in its introduction led to the reinstatement of the B-1 program . Program costs rose throughout development . Designed and manufactured by Northrop , later Northrop Grumman , the cost of each aircraft averaged US $ 737 million ( in 1997 dollars ) . Total procurement costs averaged $ 929 million per aircraft , which includes spare parts , equipment , retrofitting , and software support . The total program cost , which included development , engineering and testing , averaged $ 2.1 billion per aircraft in 1997 . Because of its considerable capital and operating costs , the project was controversial in the U.S. Congress . The winding-down of the Cold War in the latter portion of the 1980s dramatically reduced the need for the aircraft , which was designed with the intention of penetrating Soviet airspace and attacking high-value targets . During the late 1980s and 1990s , Congress slashed plans to purchase 132 bombers to 21 .",
  "/wiki/Boeing_B-52_Stratofortress": "The Boeing B-52 Stratofortress is an American long-range , subsonic , jet-powered strategic bomber . The B-52 was designed and built by Boeing , which has continued to provide support and upgrades . It has been operated by the United States Air Force ( USAF ) since the 1950s . The bomber is capable of carrying up to 70,000 pounds ( 32,000 kg ) of weapons , and has a typical combat range of more than 8,800 miles ( 14,080 km ) without aerial refueling . Beginning with the successful contract bid in June 1946 , the B-52 design evolved from a straight wing aircraft powered by six turboprop engines to the final prototype YB-52 with eight turbojet engines and swept wings . The B-52 took its maiden flight in April 1952 . Built to carry nuclear weapons for Cold War-era deterrence missions , the B-52 Stratofortress replaced the Convair B-36 . A veteran of several wars , the B-52 has dropped only conventional munitions in combat . The B-52 's official name Stratofortress is rarely used ; informally , the aircraft has become commonly referred to as the BUFF ( Big Ugly Fat Fucker/Fella ) . [ Note 1 ] The B-52 has been in active service with the USAF since 1955 . As of June 2019 [ update ] , 58 are in active service , 18 in reserves , and approximately 12 more aircraft in long term storage . The bombers flew under the Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) until it was disestablished in 1992 and its aircraft absorbed into the Air Combat Command ( ACC ) ; in 2010 , all B-52 Stratofortresses were transferred from the ACC to the newly created Air Force Global Strike Command ( AFGSC ) .",

The RQ-4 provides a broad overview and systematic surveillance using high-resolution synthetic aperture radar ( SAR ) and long-range electro-optical/infrared ( EO/IR ) sensors with long loiter times over target areas . It can survey as much as 40,000 square miles ( 100,000 km2 ) of terrain a day , an area the size of South Korea or Iceland . The Global Hawk is operated by the United States Air Force ( USAF ) . It is used as a High-Altitude Long Endurance platform covering the spectrum of intelligence collection capability to support forces in worldwide military operations . According to the USAF , the superior surveillance capabilities of the aircraft allow more precise weapons targeting and better protection of friendly forces . Cost overruns led to the original plan to acquire 63 aircraft being cut to 45 , and to a 2013 proposal to mothball the 21 Block 30 signals intelligence variants . The initial flyaway cost of each of the first 10 aircraft was US $ 10 million in 1994 . By 2001 this had risen to US $ 60.9 million , and then to $ 131.4 million ( flyaway cost ) in 2013 .

The failure of Operation Eagle Claw during the Iran hostage crisis in 1980 underscored the requirement for a new long-range , high-speed , vertical-takeoff aircraft for the United States Department of Defense . In response , the Joint-service Vertical take-off/landing Experimental ( JVX ) aircraft program started in 1981 . A partnership between Bell Helicopter and Boeing Helicopters was awarded a development contract in 1983 for the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft . The Bell Boeing team jointly produce the aircraft . The V-22 first flew in 1989 , and began flight testing and design alterations ; the complexity and difficulties of being the first tiltrotor for military service led to many years of development . The United States Marine Corps began crew training for the MV-22B Osprey in 2000 , and fielded it in 2007 ; it supplemented and then replaced their Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knights . The U.S. Air Force fielded their version of the tiltrotor , CV-22B , in 2009 . Since entering service with the U.S. Marine Corps and Air Force , the Osprey has been deployed in transportation and medevac operations over Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya , and Kuwait .

It is designed to combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter with the long-range , high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft . The failure of Operation Eagle Claw during the Iran hostage crisis in 1980 underscored the requirement for a new long-range , high-speed , vertical-takeoff aircraft for the United States Department of Defense . In response , the Joint-service Vertical take-off/landing Experimental ( JVX ) aircraft program started in 1981 . A partnership between Bell Helicopter and Boeing Helicopters was awarded a development contract in 1983 for the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft . The Bell Boeing team jointly produce the aircraft . The V-22 first flew in 1989 , and began flight testing and design alterations ; the complexity and difficulties of being the first tiltrotor for military service led to many years of development . The United States Marine Corps began crew training for the MV-22B Osprey in 2000 , and fielded it in 2007 ; it supplemented and then replaced their Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knights . The U.S. Air Force fielded their version of the tiltrotor , CV-22B , in 2009 . Since entering service with the U.S. Marine Corps and Air Force , the Osprey has been deployed in transportation and medevac operations over Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya , and Kuwait . The U.S. Navy plan to use the CMV-22B for carrier onboard delivery ( COD ) duties beginning in 2021 ."
