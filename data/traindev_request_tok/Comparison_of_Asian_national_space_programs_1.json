  "/wiki/Soviet_Union": "The Soviet Union , [ b ] officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR or \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 ) , [ c ] was a federal sovereign state in northern Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991 . Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas .",

  "/wiki/Satellite": "In the context of spaceflight , a satellite is an object that has been intentionally placed into orbit . These objects are called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as Earth 's Moon . On 4 October 1957 the Soviet Union launched the world 's first artificial satellite , Sputnik 1 . Since then , about 8,900 satellites from more than 40 countries have been launched . According to a 2018 estimate , some 5,000 remain in orbit . Of those about 1,900 were operational , while the rest have lived out their useful lives and become space debris . Approximately 63% of operational satellites are in low-Earth orbit , 6% are in medium-Earth orbit ( at 20,000 km ) , 29% are in geostationary orbit ( at 36,000 km ) and the remaining 2% are in elliptic orbit . A few large space stations have been launched in parts and assembled in orbit . Over a dozen space probes have been placed into orbit around other bodies and become artificial satellites of the Moon , Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , a few asteroids , a comet and the Sun . Satellites are used for many purposes . Among several other applications , they can be used to make star maps and maps of planetary surfaces , and also take pictures of planets they are launched into . Common types include military and civilian Earth observation satellites , communications satellites , navigation satellites , weather satellites , and space telescopes .",
  "/wiki/Launch_pad": "A launch pad is an above-ground facility from which a rocket-powered missile or space vehicle is vertically launched . The term launch pad can be used to describe just the central launch platform , or the entire complex ( launch complex ) . The entire complex will include a launch mount or launch platform to physically support the vehicle , a service structure with umbilicals , and the infrastructure required to provide propellants , cryogenic fluids , electrical power , communications , telemetry , rocket assembly , payload processing , storage facilities for propellants and gases , equipment , access roads , and drainage . Most launch pads include fixed service structures to provide one or more access platforms to assemble , inspect , and maintain the vehicle and to allow access to the spacecraft , including the loading of crew . The pad may contain a flame deflection structure to prevent the intense heat of the rocket exhaust from damaging the vehicle or pad structures , and a sound suppression system spraying large quantities of water may be employed . The pad may also be protected by lightning arresters . A spaceport typically includes multiple launch complexes and other supporting infrastructure . A launch pad is distinct from a missile launch facility ( or missile silo or missile complex ) , which also launches a missile vertically but is located underground in order to help harden it against enemy attack . Cryogenic propellants ( liquid oxygen oxidizer , and liquid hydrogen or liquid methane fuel ) need to be continuously topped off ( i.e. , boil-off replaced ) during the launch sequence ( countdown ) , as the vehicle awaits liftoff . This becomes particularly important as complex sequences may be interrupted by planned or unplanned holds to fix problems . Most rockets need to be supported for a few seconds after ignition while the engines build up to full thrust . The vehicle is commonly held on the pad by hold-down arms or explosive bolts , which are triggered when the vehicle is stable and ready to fly , at which point all umbilical connections with the pad are released .",

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",

China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty .

  "/wiki/Extra-vehicular_activity": "Extravehicular activity ( EVA ) is any activity done by an astronaut or cosmonaut outside a spacecraft beyond the Earth 's appreciable atmosphere . The term most commonly applies to a spacewalk made outside a craft orbiting Earth ( such as the International Space Station ) . On March 18 , 1965 , Alexei Leonov became the first human to perform a spacewalk , exiting the capsule during the Voskhod 2 mission for 12 minutes and 9 seconds . The term also applied to lunar surface exploration ( commonly known as moonwalks ) performed by six pairs of American astronauts in the Apollo program from 1969 to 1972 . On July 21 , 1969 , Neil Armstrong became the first human to perform a moonwalk , outside his lunar lander on Apollo 11 for 2 hours and 31 minutes . On the last three Moon missions astronauts also performed deep-space EVAs on the return to Earth , to retrieve film canisters from the outside of the spacecraft . Astronauts Pete Conrad , Joseph Kerwin , and Paul Weitz also used EVA in 1973 to repair launch damage to Skylab , the United States ' first space station . A Stand-up EVA ( SEVA ) is when an astronaut does not fully leave a spacecraft , but is completely reliant on the spacesuit for environmental support . Its name derives from the astronaut standing up in the open hatch , usually to record or assist a spacewalking astronaut . EVAs may be either tethered ( the astronaut is connected to the spacecraft ; oxygen and electrical power can be supplied through an umbilical cable ; no propulsion is needed to return to the spacecraft ) , or untethered . Untethered spacewalks were only performed on three missions in 1984 using the Manned Maneuvering Unit ( MMU ) , and on a flight test in 1994 of the Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue ( SAFER ) , a safety device worn on tethered U.S. EVAs . The Soviet Union/Russia , the United States , and China have conducted EVAs .",
  "/wiki/STS-87": "STS-87 was a Space Shuttle mission launched from Launch Complex 39B of the Kennedy Space Center on 19 November 1997 . It was the 88th flight of the Space Shuttle , and the 24th flight of Columbia . The mission goals were to conduct experiments using the United States Microgravity Payload ( USMP-4 ) , conduct two EVAs , and to deploy the SPARTAN-201 experiment . This mission marked the first time an EVA was performed from Columbia . An EVA from Columbia was originally planned for STS-5 in 1982 , but was cancelled due to spacesuit problems . It also marked the first EVA conducted by a Japanese astronaut , Takao Doi .",
  "/wiki/ETS-VII": "The ETS-VII , or Engineering Test Satellite No . 7 , was a satellite developed and launched by the National Space Development Agency of Japan ( NASDA ) . It is also known as KIKU-7 . It was launched aboard an H-II rocket from Tanegashima Space Center , on 28 November 1997 . The ETS-VII was equipped with a 2 metre long robotic arm , which was used to carry out several experiments related to rendezvous docking and space robotics . It was the world 's first satellite to be equipped with a robotic arm , and also the first unmanned spacecraft to conduct autonomous rendezvous docking operations successfully . Although it was originally intended to be used for 1.5 years , the satellite was functional for a period of almost five years . ETS-VII eventually decayed from orbit on 13 November 2015 .",
  "/wiki/Space_rendezvous": "A space rendezvous is an orbital maneuver during which two spacecraft , one of which is often a space station , arrive at the same orbit and approach to a very close distance ( e.g . within visual contact ) . Rendezvous requires a precise match of the orbital velocities and position vectors of the two spacecraft , allowing them to remain at a constant distance through orbital station-keeping . Rendezvous may or may not be followed by docking or berthing , procedures which bring the spacecraft into physical contact and create a link between them . The same rendezvous technique can be used for spacecraft landing on natural objects with a weak gravitational field , e.g . landing on one of the Martian moons would require the same matching of orbital velocities , followed by a descent that shares some similarities with docking .",
  "/wiki/Nozomi_(probe)": "Nozomi ( Japanese : \u306e\u305e\u307f , lit . Wish or Hope , and known before launch as Planet-B ) was a Mars orbiter that failed to reach Mars due to electrical failures . The mission was terminated on December 31 , 2003 . [ citation needed ] It was constructed by the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science , University of Tokyo and launched on July 4 , 1998 , at 03:12 JST ( July 3 , 1998 , at 18:12 UTC ) with an on-orbit dry mass of 258 kg and 282 kg of propellant . [ citation needed ] Nozomi was designed to study the upper Martian atmosphere and its interaction with the solar wind and to develop technologies for use in future planetary missions . Specifically , instruments on the spacecraft were to measure the structure , composition and dynamics of the ionosphere , aeronomy effects of the solar wind , the escape of atmospheric constituents , the intrinsic magnetic field , the penetration of the solar-wind magnetic field , the structure of the magnetosphere , and dust in the upper atmosphere and in orbit around Mars . The mission would have also returned images of Mars ' surface . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/Exploration_of_Mars": "The planet Mars has been explored remotely by spacecraft . Probes sent from Earth , beginning in the late 20th century , have yielded a large increase in knowledge about the Martian system , focused primarily on understanding its geology and habitability potential . Engineering interplanetary journeys is complicated and the exploration of Mars has experienced a high failure rate , especially the early attempts . Roughly sixty percent of all spacecraft destined for Mars failed before completing their missions and some failed before their observations could begin . Some missions have met with unexpected success , such as the twin Mars Exploration Rovers , which operated for years beyond their specification .",
  "/wiki/Satellite_navigation_system": "A satellite navigation or satnav system is a system that uses satellites to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning . It allows small electronic receivers to determine their location ( longitude , latitude , and altitude/elevation ) to high precision ( within a few centimeters to metres ) using time signals transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites . The system can be used for providing position , navigation or for tracking the position of something fitted with a receiver ( satellite tracking ) . The signals also allow the electronic receiver to calculate the current local time to high precision , which allows time synchronisation . These uses are collectively known as Positioning , Navigation and Timing ( PNT ) . Satnav systems operate independently of any telephonic or internet reception , though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the positioning information generated . A satellite navigation system with global coverage may be termed a global navigation satellite system ( GNSS ) . As of October 2018 [ update ] , the United States ' Global Positioning System ( GPS ) and Russia 's Global Navigation Satellite System ( GLONASS ) are fully operational GNSSs , with China 's BeiDou Navigation Satellite System ( BDS ) and the European Union 's Galileo scheduled to be fully operational by 2020 . Japan 's Quasi-Zenith Satellite System ( QZSS ) is a GPS satellite-based augmentation system to enhance GPS 's accuracy , with satellite navigation independent of GPS scheduled for 2023 . India has the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System ( IRNSS ) , also known as Navigation with Indian Constellation ( NAVIC ) , an autonomous regional satellite navigation system that provides accurate real-time positioning and timing services , with plans to expand to a global version in long term . Global coverage for each system is generally achieved by a satellite constellation of 18-30 medium Earth orbit ( MEO ) satellites spread between several orbital planes . The actual systems vary , but use orbital inclinations of > 50\u00b0 and orbital periods of roughly twelve hours ( at an altitude of about 20,000 kilometres or 12,000 miles ) .",
  "/wiki/TDRS": "A tracking and data relay satellite ( TDRS ) is a type of communications satellite that forms part of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System ( TDRSS ) used by NASA and other United States government agencies for communications to and from independent User Platforms such as satellites , balloons , aircraft , the International Space Station , and remote bases like the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station . This system was designed to replace an existing worldwide network of ground stations that had supported all of NASA 's crewed flight missions and uncrewed satellites in low-Earth orbits . The primary system design goal was to increase the amount of time that these spacecraft were in communication with the ground and improve the amount of data that could be transferred . These TDRSS satellites are all designed and built to be launched to and function in geosynchronous orbit , 35,786 km ( 22,236 mi ) above the surface of the Earth . The first seven TDRSS satellites were built by the TRW corporation . The three later versions have been manufactured by the Boeing corporation 's Satellite Systems division . Ten satellites have been launched ; however , one was destroyed in the Challenger disaster . TDRS-1 was decommissioned in October 2009 . TDRS-4 was decommissioned in December 2011 . Ten TDRSS satellites are currently in service . All of the TDRSS satellites have been managed by NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center . The contract for TDRS versions L & K was awarded to Boeing on December 20 , 2007 .",
