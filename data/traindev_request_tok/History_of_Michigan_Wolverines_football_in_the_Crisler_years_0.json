Unlike the Cleveland Browns , San Francisco 49ers , and Baltimore Colts , the franchise was not one of the three AAFC teams that merged with the National Football League prior to the 1950 season . It was named after Buffalo Bill . After only one year , owner James Breuil held a name-the-team contest in hopes of choosing a more distinctive nickname ; Bisons had been the traditional nickname for Buffalo teams for many years . The winning choice was Bills , which was a play on the name of the famed Wild West showman Buffalo Bill Cody . Coincidentally a barbershop quartet who would achieve fame a few years later was formed with the same name that year . The team was the successor to the Buffalo Tigers/Indians team from the 1940 American Football League ; that league had folded as a result of World War II . There was some controversy over Buffalo 's exclusion from the enlarged NFL . Buffalo had experienced more success on the field and at the gate than Baltimore , and was also a larger market at the time ( and would not have to share their territory with an established team as Baltimore would with the Washington Redskins ) . Additionally , the original three-team plan would have left the league with 13 teams , not only an odd number and prime number that made making equal divisions impossible , but also one considered to be bad luck . The move had left Buffalo as the only AAFC market without an NFL team post-merger , and one that had outdrawn the NFL average in fan attendance .",

Crisler Center was designed by Dan Dworsky , a member of the 1948 Rose Bowl team . Among other structures that he has designed is the Federal Reserve Bank of Los Angeles . The arena is often called The House that Cazzie Built , a reference to player Cazzie Russell , who starred on Michigan teams that won three consecutive Big Ten Conference titles from 1964 to 1966 . Russell 's popularity caused the team 's fan base to outgrow Yost Fieldhouse ( now Yost Ice Arena ) and prompted the construction of the current facility .

Additionally , the proposal was opposed by influential area residents and politicians . By February 1966 UCLA had scaled back the project to the Drake Stadium configuration . Although the football stadium never became a reality , there have been UCLA Bruin football scrimmage games played in the stadium . Drake Stadium has hosted the Pacific-10 ( now Pac-12 ) Track and Field Championships , the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships in 1976-77-78 , the Pacific-8 Championships in 1970 and 1977 and the CIF California State Meet for high schools in 1969-71-77 .
