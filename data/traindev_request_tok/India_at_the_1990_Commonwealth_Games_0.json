  "/wiki/Shooting_sports": "Shooting sports is a collective group of competitive and recreational sporting activities involving proficiency tests of accuracy , precision and speed in shooting - the art of using various types of ranged weapons , mainly referring to human-portable guns ( firearms and airguns , in forms such as handguns , rifles and shotguns ) and bows/crossbows . Different disciplines of shooting sports can be categorized by equipment , shooting distances , targets , time limits and degrees of athleticism involved . Shooting sports may involve both team and individual competition , and team performance is usually assessed by summing the scores of the individual team members . Due to the noise of shooting and the high ( and often lethal ) impact energy of the projectiles , shooting sports are typically conducted at either designated permanent shooting ranges or temporary shooting fields in the area away from settlements .",

  "/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting": "Olympic weightlifting , or Olympic-style weightlifting , often simply referred to as weightlifting , is a sport in which the athlete attempts a maximum-weight single lift of a barbell loaded with weight plates . The two competition lifts in order are the snatch and the clean and jerk . The snatch is a wide-grip , one-move lift . The clean and jerk is a close-grip , two-move lift . Each weightlifter receives three attempts in each , and the combined total of the highest two successful lifts determines the overall result within a bodyweight category . Bodyweight categories are different for male and female competitors . A lifter who fails to complete at least one successful snatch and one successful clean and jerk also fails to total , and therefore receives an incomplete entry for the competition . The clean and press was once a competition lift , but was discontinued due to difficulties in judging proper form . In comparison with other strength sports , which test limit strength ( with or without lifting aids ) , weightlifting tests aspects of human ballistic limits ( explosive strength ) ; the lifts are therefore executed faster - and with more mobility and a greater range of motion during their execution - than other strength movements . The lifts performed in the sport of weightlifting , and in particular their component lifts ( e.g . squats , deadlifts , cleans ) , are commonly used by elite athletes in other sports to train for both explosive and functional strength .",
