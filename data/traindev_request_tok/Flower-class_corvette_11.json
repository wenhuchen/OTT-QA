Their first ships were wooden sailing vessels . A schooner built in 1839 , The Scottish Maid , first used the 'Aberdeen bow ' which was designed to improve speed and performance . When he died in 1849 , Alexander Hall left the shipyard to his sons James and William - William taking care of ship design and James running the business . They built many famous clippers , including Torrington and Stornoway , used on the opium and tea routes . One ship later developed was the Jho Sho Maru , a barque-rigged steamer , built in the 1860s for the Japanese Navy . This vessel carried a belt of iron armour plating at the waterline together with eight 64 pounder and two 100 pounder guns . James suffered a fatal heart attack when a fire broke out in the yard during the ship 's construction . As well as building sailing ships , the firm also constructed steamers . Their first marine engine was produced in 1887 , and installed in the launch Petrel . Their first trawler , Maggie Walker , was built in 1888 , followed by more trawlers , coasters , tugs and dredgers . During the years of World War II Hall built 26 steam tugs , a large number going to the Admiralty .",

It is Scotland 's third most populous city , one of Scotland 's 32 local government council areas and the United Kingdom 's 39th most populous built-up area , with an official population estimate of 196,670 for the city of Aberdeen and 227,560 for the local council area . During the mid-18th to mid-20th centuries , Aberdeen 's buildings incorporated locally quarried grey granite , which can sparkle like silver because of its high mica content . Since the discovery of North Sea oil in the 1970s , Aberdeen has been known as the off-shore oil capital of Europe . The area around Aberdeen has been settled for at least 8,000 years , when prehistoric villages lay around the mouths of the rivers Dee and Don . The city has a long , sandy coastline and a marine climate , the latter resulting in chilly summers and mild winters . Aberdeen received Royal burgh status from David I of Scotland ( 1124-1153 ) , transforming the city economically . The city has two universities , the University of Aberdeen , founded in 1495 , and Robert Gordon University , which was awarded university status in 1992 , making Aberdeen the educational centre of north-east Scotland . The traditional industries of fishing , paper-making , shipbuilding , and textiles have been overtaken by the oil industry and Aberdeen 's seaport . Aberdeen Heliport is one of the busiest commercial heliports in the world and the seaport is the largest in the north-east of Scotland . Aberdeen used to host the Aberdeen International Youth Festival , a major international event which attracted up to 1000 of the most talented young performing arts companies but the council ended funding in 2017 and the festival was wound up in 2018 . In 2015 , Mercer named Aberdeen the 57th most liveable city in the world , as well as the fourth most liveable city in Britain .",

It is the seventh-largest country by area , the second-most populous country , and the most populous democracy in the world . Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south , the Arabian Sea on the southwest , and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast , it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west ; [ e ] China , Nepal , and Bhutan to the north ; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east . In the Indian Ocean , India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives ; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia . Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",

The capital and largest city is Bangkok , a special administrative area . Thailand is bordered to the north by Myanmar and Laos , to the east by Laos and Cambodia , to the south by the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia , and to the west by the Andaman Sea and the southern extremity of Myanmar . Its maritime boundaries include Vietnam in the Gulf of Thailand to the southeast , and Indonesia and India on the Andaman Sea to the southwest . It is a unitary state . Although nominally the country is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy , the most recent coup , in 2014 , established a de facto military dictatorship under a junta . Tai peoples migrated from southwestern China to mainland Southeast Asia from the 11th century ; the oldest known mention of their presence in the region by the exonym Siamese dates to the 12th century . Various Indianised kingdoms such as the Mon kingdoms , Khmer Empire and Malay states ruled the region , competing with Thai states such as the Kingdoms of Ngoenyang , Sukhothai , Lan Na and Ayutthaya , which rivaled each other . Documented European contact began in 1511 with a Portuguese diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya , now one of the great powers in the region . Ayutthaya reached its peak during cosmopolitan Narai 's reign ( 1656-1688 ) , gradually declining thereafter until being ultimately destroyed in the 1767 Burmese-Siamese War .

  "/wiki/Korea": "Korea is a region in East Asia consisting of the Korean Peninsula , Jeju Island , and several minor islands near the peninsula . Korea has been divided since 1948 between two distinct sovereign states , North Korea and South Korea . Korea is bordered by Russia to the northeast , China to the northwest , and neighbours Japan to the east via the Korea Strait and the Sea of Japan ( East Sea ) . During the first half of the 1st millennium , Korea was divided between the three competing states of Goguryeo , Baekje , and Silla , together known as the Three Kingdoms of Korea . In the second half of the 1st millennium , Silla defeated and conquered Baekje and Goguryeo , leading to the Unified Silla period . Meanwhile , Balhae formed in the north , superseding former Goguryeo . Unified Silla eventually collapsed into three separate states due to civil war , ushering in the Later Three Kingdoms . Toward the end of the 1st millennium , Goguryeo was resurrected as Goryeo , which defeated the two other states and unified the Korean Peninsula as a single sovereign state . Around the same time , Balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to Goryeo . Goryeo ( also spelled as Kory\u014f ) , whose name developed into the modern exonym Korea , was a highly cultured state that created the world 's first metal movable type in 1234 . However , multiple incursions by the Mongol Empire during the 13th century greatly weakened the nation , which eventually agreed to become a vassal state after decades of fighting . Following military resistance under King Gongmin that ended Mongol political influence in Goryeo , severe political strife followed , and Goryeo eventually fell to a coup led by General Yi Seong-gye , who established Joseon in July 17 , 1392 .",

  "/wiki/Sunderland,_Tyne_and_Wear": "Sunderland ( /\u02c8s\u028cnd\u0259rl\u0259nd/ ( listen ) ) is a city at the centre of the City of Sunderland metropolitan borough , in Tyne and Wear , England , 12 miles northeast of Durham and 10 miles southeast of Newcastle upon Tyne , at the mouth of the River Wear . Historically in County Durham , there were three original settlements by the mouth of the River Wear on the site of modern-day Sunderland . On the north side of the river , Monkwearmouth was settled in 674 when King Ecgfrith of Northumbria granted land to Benedict Biscop to found Monkwearmouth Monastery . In 685 , Ecgfrith further granted Biscop the land adjacent to the monastery on the south side of the river . As the river separated this land from the monastic community , it was henceforth referred to as the sunder-land , and would grow as a fishing settlement before being granted a charter in 1179 . West of the medieval village of Sunderland on the south bank , Bishopwearmouth was founded in 930 . Sunderland grew as a port , trading coal and salt . Ships began to be built on the river in the 14th century . By the 19th century , the port of Sunderland had absorbed Bishopwearmouth and Monkwearmouth , owing to the growing economic importance of the shipbuilding docks . Following the decline of the city 's traditional industries in the late 20th century , the area grew into a commercial centre for the automotive industry , science and technology and the service sector . Bede , sometimes called the father of English history , began his monastic career at Monkwearmouth monastery in Sunderland , before moving to the newly founded Jarrow monastery in 685 ( these monasteries together formed the dual Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey ) . It therefore seems likely that he was born in or near Sunderland .",

  "/wiki/Port_Glasgow": "The origins of Port Glasgow go back to the construction by Sir George Maxwell between 1450 and 1477 of the New Werke of Finlastoun , which became Newark Castle . At a good anchorage near the castle , a small fishing hamlet known as Newark formed , like other scattered hamlets along the shores of the River Clyde . After 1589 the village of Greenock formed just under 4 miles ( 6 kilometres ) to the west of Newark , and gradually became a market town with growing fishing and sea trade , although it had only a jetty in the bay to unload ships . Since seagoing ships could not go further up the Clyde due to sandbanks , the Glasgow merchants such as the Tobacco Lords wanted harbour access , but got into arguments with Greenock over harbour dues and warehouses . They put a bid in for the Easter Greenock estate for a harbour , but were outbid and the lands became the Barony of Cartsburn . They then negotiated with Sir Patrick Maxwell of Newark Estate , and in 1668 he agreed to lease the City of Glasgow 13 acres ( 5.3 hectares ) of land to the west of the castle , for payment of 1,300 merks and an annual feu duty of four merks . Construction of piers and breakwaters enclosing the harbour began promptly , and Newport Glasgow was constituted as a free port . Trade prospered quickly , and by 1710 Newport Glasgow had the principal Clyde custom house , initially in Customhouse Lane , then after 1754 in a new building constructed on the west quay of the harbour . Through that century the town became known simply as Port Glasgow . Ships , mostly owned by Glasgow merchants , imported tobacco , sugar , rum , cotton and mahogany from the Americas , as well as timber , iron and hemp from the Baltic . These goods were then taken by road to Glasgow , as was market garden produce from farms around Port Glasgow . A change began in 1773 when the Lang Dyke was constructed to deepen the upper river , and ships increasingly went upriver straight to Glasgow .",

Inhabitants of the city are referred to as Glaswegians or , informally , as Weegies . Glasgow is also known for the Glasgow patter , a distinct dialect of the Scots language that is noted for being difficult to understand by those from outside the city . Glasgow grew from a small rural settlement on the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Scotland , and tenth largest by tonnage in Britain . Expanding from the medieval bishopric and royal burgh , and the later establishment of the University of Glasgow in the fifteenth century , it became a major centre of the Scottish Enlightenment in the eighteenth century . From the eighteenth century onwards , the city also grew as one of Great Britain 's main hubs of transatlantic trade with North America and the West Indies . With the onset of the Industrial Revolution , the population and economy of Glasgow and the surrounding region expanded rapidly to become one of the world 's pre-eminent centres of chemicals , textiles and engineering ; most notably in the shipbuilding and marine engineering industry , which produced many innovative and famous vessels . Glasgow was the Second City of the British Empire for much of the Victorian era and Edwardian period , although many cities argue the title was theirs .

The city is midway between Toronto , Ontario and Montreal , Quebec . The Thousand Islands tourist region is nearby to the east . Kingston is nicknamed the Limestone City because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local limestone . Growing European exploration in the 17th century , and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade , led to the founding of a French trading post and military fort at a site known as Cataraqui ( generally pronounced kah-tah-ROCK-way ) in 1673 . This outpost , called Fort Cataraqui , and later Fort Frontenac , became a focus for settlement . Cataraqui would be renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort , and Loyalists began settling the region in the 1780s . Kingston was named the first capital of the United Province of Canada on February 10 , 1841 . While its time as a capital city was short ( ending in 1844 ) , the community has remained an important military installation . Kingston was the county seat of Frontenac County until 1998 .
