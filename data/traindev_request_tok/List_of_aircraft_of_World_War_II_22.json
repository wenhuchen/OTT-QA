  "/wiki/Culver_PQ-14_Cadet": "The Culver PQ-14 Cadet is a modified version of the Culver LFA Cadet used as a target drone . In 1940 , the U.S. Army Air Corps drew up a requirement for a radio-controlled target drone for training anti-aircraft artillery gunners . The first aircraft in a series of target drones was a modification of the Culver LFA Cadet which eventually led to the PQ-14 series used throughout World War II and beyond .",
  "/wiki/De_Havilland_DH.82_Tiger_Moth": "The de Havilland DH.82 Tiger Moth is a 1930s British biplane designed by Geoffrey de Havilland and built by the de Havilland Aircraft Company . It was operated by the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) and many other operators as a primary trainer aircraft . In addition to the type 's principal use for ab-initio training , the Second World War saw RAF Tiger Moths operating in other capacities , including maritime surveillance and defensive anti-invasion preparations ; some aircraft were even outfitted to function as armed light bombers . The Tiger Moth remained in service with the RAF until it was succeeded and replaced by the de Havilland Chipmunk during the early 1950s . Many of the military surplus aircraft subsequently entered into civil operation . Many nations have used the Tiger Moth in both military and civil applications , and it remains in widespread use as a recreational aircraft in several countries . It is still occasionally used as a primary training aircraft , particularly for those pilots wanting to gain experience before moving on to other tailwheel aircraft . Many Tiger Moths are now employed by various companies offering trial lesson experiences . The de Havilland Moth club , founded in 1975 , is now an owners ' association offering a mutual club and technical support .",
  "/wiki/Fieseler_Fi_103R_Reichenberg": "The Fieseler Fi 103R , code-named Reichenberg , was a late-World War II German crewed version of the V-1 flying bomb ( more correctly known as the Fieseler Fi 103 ) produced for attacks in which the pilot was likely to be killed ( as actually intended , for use of the Imperial Japanese Naval Air Service 's Ohka rocket-powered kamikaze suicide anti-ship missile ) or at best to parachute down at the attack site , which were to be carried out by the Leonidas Squadron , V. Gruppe of the Luftwaffe 's Kampfgeschwader 200 .",

  "/wiki/Interstate_TDR": "The Interstate TDR was an early unmanned combat aerial vehicle - referred to at the time as an assault drone - developed by the Interstate Aircraft and Engineering Corporation during the Second World War for use by the United States Navy . Capable of being armed with bombs or torpedoes , 2000 aircraft were ordered , but only around 200 were built . The type saw some service in the Pacific Theater against the Japanese , but continuing developmental issues affecting the aircraft , along with the success of operations using more conventional weapons , led to the decision being made to cancel the assault drone program in October 1944 .",
  "/wiki/UCAV": "An unmanned combat aerial vehicle ( UCAV ) , also known as a combat drone or simply a drone , is an unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAV ) that usually carries aircraft ordnance such as missiles , ATGMs , and/or bombs and is used for drone strikes . These drones are usually under real-time human control , with varying levels of autonomy . Aircraft of this type have no onboard human pilot . As the operator runs the vehicle from a remote terminal , equipment necessary for a human pilot is not needed , resulting in a lower weight and a smaller size than a manned aircraft . China , Israel , Turkey and the United States are widely recognized as industry leaders in UCAV technology . Several other countries have operational domestic UCAVs and many more have imported armed drones or have development programs underway .",

  "/wiki/Naval_Aircraft_Factory_TDN": "The Naval Aircraft Factory TDN was an early unmanned combat aerial vehicle - referred to at the time as an assault drone - developed by the United States Navy 's Naval Aircraft Factory during the Second World War . Developed and tested during 1942 and 1943 , the design proved moderately successful , but development of improved drones saw the TDN-1 relegated to second-line duties , and none were used in operational service .",

  "/wiki/V-1_Flying_Bomb": "The V-1 flying bomb ( German : Vergeltungswaffe 1 Vengeance Weapon 1 [ a ] ) - also known to the Allies as the buzz bomb , or doodlebug , [ b ] and in Germany as Kirschkern ( cherry stone ) [ c ] or Maik\u00e4fer ( maybug ) [ d ] , as well as by its official RLM aircraft designation of Fi 103 - was an early cruise missile and the only production aircraft to use a pulsejet for power . The V-1 was the first of the so-called Vengeance weapons series ( V-weapons or Vergeltungswaffen ) deployed for the terror bombing of London . It was developed at Peenem\u00fcnde Army Research Center in 1939 by the Nazi German Luftwaffe at the beginning of the Second World War , and during initial development was known by the codename Cherry Stone . Because of limited range , thousands of V-1 missiles launched into England were fired from launch facilities along the French ( Pas-de-Calais ) and Dutch coasts . The Wehrmacht first launched the V-1 to target London on 13 June 1944 , one week after ( and prompted by ) the successful Allied landings in Europe . At peak , more than one hundred V-1s a day were fired at south-east England , 9,521 in total , decreasing in number as sites were overrun until October 1944 , when the last V-1 site in range of Britain was overrun by Allied forces . After this , the Germans directed V-1s at the port of Antwerp and at other targets in Belgium , launching 2,448 V-1s . The attacks stopped only a month before the war in Europe ended , when the last launch site in the Low Countries was overrun on 29 March 1945 . As part of Operation Crossbow , the British operated an arrangement of air defences , including anti-aircraft guns and fighter aircraft , to intercept the bombs before they reached their targets , while the launch sites and underground V-1 storage depots became targets for Allied strategic bombing .",
  "/wiki/V-2_rocket": "The V-2 ( German : Vergeltungswaffe 2 , Retribution Weapon 2 ) , technical name Aggregat 4 ( A4 ) , was the world 's first long-range guided ballistic missile . The missile , powered by a liquid-propellant rocket engine , was developed during the Second World War in Germany as a vengeance weapon , assigned to attack Allied cities as retaliation for the Allied bombings against German cities . The V-2 rocket also became the first artificial object to travel into space by crossing the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line with the vertical launch of MW 18014 on 20 June 1944 . Research into military use of long-range rockets began when the studies of graduate student Wernher von Braun attracted the attention of the German Army . A series of prototypes culminated in the A-4 , which went to war as the V-2 . Beginning in September 1944 , over 3,000 V-2s were launched by the German Wehrmacht against Allied targets , first London and later Antwerp and Li\u00e8ge . According to a 2011 BBC documentary , the attacks from V-2s resulted in the deaths of an estimated 9,000 civilians and military personnel , and a further 12,000 forced laborers and concentration camp prisoners died as a result of their forced participation in the production of the weapons . As Germany collapsed , teams from the Allied forces - the United States , the United Kingdom , and the Soviet Union - raced to capture key German manufacturing sites and technology . Wernher von Braun and over 100 key V-2 personnel surrendered to the Americans and many of the original V-2 team ended up working at the Redstone Arsenal . The US also captured enough V-2 hardware to build approximately 80 of the missiles . The Soviets gained possession of the V-2 manufacturing facilities after the war , re-established V-2 production , and moved it to the Soviet Union .",
