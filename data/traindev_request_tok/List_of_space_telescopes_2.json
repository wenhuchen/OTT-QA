Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas .",

The orbit was sun-synchronous , and the attitude of the spacecraft could be controlled through reaction wheels . The momentum stored in the reaction wheels throughout the orbit was regularly dumped via magnetic coils that interacted with the Earth 's magnetic field . The satellite also had two masses that were released shortly after orbit injection , to remove most of the satellite 's angular momentum induced by the launcher . The attitude could be measured by a variety of techniques , including solar sensors , horizon sensors , star sensors and a magnetometer . ANS could measure X-ray photons in the energy range 2 to 30 keV , with a 60 cm2 detector , and was used to find the positions of galactic and extragalactic X-ray sources .

The mission lifetime was initially set for 3 years , but in the end it lasted almost 18 years , with the satellite being shut down in 1996 . The switch-off occurred for financial reasons , while the telescope was still functioning at near original efficiency . It was the first space observatory to be operated in real time by astronomers who visited the groundstations in the United States and Europe . Astronomers made over 104,000 observations using the IUE , of objects ranging from solar system bodies to distant quasars . Among the significant scientific results from IUE data were the first large scale studies of stellar winds , accurate measurements of the way interstellar dust absorbs light , and measurements of the supernova SN1987A which showed that it defied stellar evolution theories as they then stood .

  "/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope": "The Hubble Space Telescope ( often referred to as HST or Hubble ) is a space telescope that was launched into low Earth orbit in 1990 and remains in operation . It was not the first space telescope but it is one of the largest and most versatile , well known both as a vital research tool and as a public relations boon for astronomy . The Hubble telescope is named after astronomer Edwin Hubble and is one of NASA 's Great Observatories , along with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory , the Chandra X-ray Observatory , and the Spitzer Space Telescope . Hubble features a 2.4-meter ( 7.9 ft ) mirror , and its four main instruments observe in the ultraviolet , visible , and near infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum . Hubble 's orbit outside the distortion of Earth 's atmosphere allows it to capture extremely high-resolution images with substantially lower background light than ground-based telescopes . It has recorded some of the most detailed visible light images , allowing a deep view into space . Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in astrophysics , such as determining the rate of expansion of the universe . The Hubble telescope was built by the United States space agency NASA with contributions from the European Space Agency . The Space Telescope Science Institute ( STScI ) selects Hubble 's targets and processes the resulting data , while the Goddard Space Flight Center controls the spacecraft . Space telescopes were proposed as early as 1923 . Hubble was funded in the 1970s with a proposed launch in 1983 , but the project was beset by technical delays , budget problems , and the 1986 Challenger disaster . It was finally launched by Space Shuttle Discovery in 1990 , but its main mirror had been ground incorrectly , resulting in spherical aberration that compromised the telescope 's capabilities .",
