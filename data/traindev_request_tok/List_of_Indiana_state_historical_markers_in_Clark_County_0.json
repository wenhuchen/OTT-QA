Davis ' distinguished service in Mexico earned him high prestige at the outbreak of the Civil War , when he led Union troops through Southern Missouri to Pea Ridge , Arkansas , being promoted to Brigadier General after that significant victory . Following the Siege of Corinth , he was granted home leave on account of exhaustion , but returned to duty on hearing of Union defeats in Kentucky , where he reported to General William Bull Nelson at Louisville in September 1862 . Nelson was dissatisfied with his performance , and insulted him in front of witnesses . A few days later , Davis demanded a public apology , but instead the two officers argued noisily and physically , concluding in Davis mortally wounding Nelson with a pistol . Davis avoided conviction , due to the shortage of experienced commanders in the Union Army , but the incident hampered his chances for promotion . He served as a corps commander under William Tecumseh Sherman during his March to the Sea in 1864 . After the war , Davis was the first commander of the Department of Alaska from 1867 to 1870 , and assumed field command during the Modoc War of 1872-1873 .",

Born in either Hunterdon County , New Jersey , or Rockbridge County , Virginia , he studied law before immigrating to the Indiana Territory in 1806 . Jennings initially intended to practice law , but took jobs as an assistant at the federal land office at Vincennes and assistant to the clerk of the territorial legislature to support himself and pursued interests in land speculation and politics . Jennings became involved in a dispute with the territorial governor , William Henry Harrison , that soon led him to enter politics and set the tone for his early political career . In 1808 Jennings moved to the eastern part of the Indiana Territory and settled near Charlestown , in Clark County . He was elected as the Indiana Territory 's delegate to the U.S. Congress by dividing the pro-Harrison supporters and running as an anti-Harrison candidate . By 1812 he was the leader of the anti-slavery and pro-statehood faction of the territorial government . Jennings and his political allies took control of the territorial assembly and dominated governmental affairs after the resignation of Governor Harrison in 1812 . As a congressional delegate Jennings aided passage of the Enabling Act in 1816 , which authorized the organization of Indiana 's state government and state constitution . He was elected president of the Indiana constitutional convention , held in Corydon in June 1816 , where he helped draft the state 's first constitution .

  "/wiki/Colonel_Sanders": "Colonel Harland David Sanders [ a ] ( September 9 , 1890 - December 16 , 1980 ) was an American businessman , best known for founding fast food chicken restaurant chain Kentucky Fried Chicken ( also known as KFC ) and later acting as the company 's brand ambassador and symbol . His name and image are still symbols of the company . The title 'colonel ' was honorary - a Kentucky Colonel - not the military rank . Sanders held a number of jobs in his early life , such as steam engine stoker , insurance salesman and filling station operator . He began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in North Corbin , Kentucky , during the Great Depression . During that time Sanders developed his secret recipe and his patented method of cooking chicken in a pressure fryer . Sanders recognized the potential of the restaurant franchising concept , and the first KFC franchise opened in South Salt Lake , Utah in 1952 . When his original restaurant closed , he devoted himself full-time to franchising his fried chicken throughout the country . The company 's rapid expansion across the United States and overseas became overwhelming for Sanders . In 1964 , then 73 years old , he sold the company to a group of investors led by John Y . Brown Jr. and Jack C. Massey for $ 2 million ( $ 16.5 million today ) . However , he retained control of operations in Canada , and he became a salaried brand ambassador for Kentucky Fried Chicken .",
