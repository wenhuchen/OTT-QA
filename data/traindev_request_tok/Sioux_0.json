  "/wiki/Prairie_Island_Indian_Community": "Prairie Island Indian Community ( Dakota : Tinta Winta ) is a Mdewakanton Sioux Indian reservation in Goodhue County , Minnesota , along the Mississippi River . Most of the reservation now lies within the city of Red Wing , which developed after this land was set aside . The reservation was established in 1889 , with boundaries modified after that time . The federally recognized tribe has lost much reservation land to the requirements of two major federal projects of the 20th century . The United States Army Corps of Engineers was authorized by Congress to construct Lock and Dam No . 3 along the river to improve navigation , and took over reservation land to support this . Later , the federal government authorized construction in 1973 of the Prairie Island Nuclear Power Plant nearby , taking more reservation land for this project . The main reservation lies within the city of Red Wing . Off-reservation trust lands are located both within Red Wing and in Welch Township in northern Goodhue County , as well as in Ravenna Township in eastern Dakota County . These nearly double the total landholdings of the tribe . The reservation had 199 residents as of the 2000 census , including its trust lands . Its total land area is 1.6689 sq mi ( 4.3225 km\u00b2 , or 1,068.1 acres ) .",

  "/wiki/Manitoba": "Manitoba ( /\u02ccm\u00e6n\u026a\u02c8to\u028ab\u0259/ ( listen ) ) is a province at the longitudinal centre of Canada . It is often considered one of the three prairie provinces ( with Alberta and Saskatchewan ) and is Canada 's fifth-most populous province with its estimated 1.369 million people . Manitoba covers 649,950 square kilometres ( 250,900 sq mi ) with a widely varied landscape , stretching from the northern oceanic coastline to the southern border with the United States . The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south . Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived on two major river systems , what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system . A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson 's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert 's Land . During the next 200 years , communities continued to grow and evolve , with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg . The assertion of M\u00e9tis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba . There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the M\u00e9tis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion . The resolution of the assertion of the right to representation led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 that created the province . Manitoba 's capital and largest city , Winnipeg , is the eighth-largest census metropolitan area in Canada .",

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean , covering 9.98 million square kilometres ( 3.85 million square miles ) , making it the world 's second-largest country by total area . Its southern border with the United States , stretching some 8,891 kilometres ( 5,525 mi ) , is the world 's longest bi-national land border . Canada 's capital is Ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . As a whole , Canada is sparsely populated , with most of its land area dominated by forest and tundra . Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",
