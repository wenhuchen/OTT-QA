  "/wiki/Tortuguitas": "Tortuguitas is a city in Greater Buenos Aires , Argentina , located 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) northwest of Buenos Aires . The city is located in Malvinas Argentinas Partido ( county ) , and its population was 41,390 inhabitants as of the 2001 Census . Part of a vast estancia in colonial times owned by Alonso de Escobar , the land was bought in 1925 by the Blas Pa\u00eds family when the C\u00f3rdoba Central Railway was built though the area in 1925 . The establishment of the Tortugas Country Club by Antonio Maura in 1930 was followed by a stop nearby along the line known simply as Apeadero km 40 ( Km . 40 Stop ) . The stop was upgraded as a station along the General Belgrano Railway on June 9 , 1947 . The Blas Pa\u00eds family began selling lots to developers as early as 1942 , and the numerous dairy farms in the area were gradually developed into residential subdivisions that gave Tortuguitas its bedroom community character . Despite being located near the northwest end of the Greater Buenos Aires metro area , Tortuguitas benefited from direct access to the city via Route 8 , which was converted into a freeway in the 1980s . This also promoted the development of a sizable manufacturing base in the eastern end of Tortuguitas , along Route 8 . The 88 hectares ( 220 acres ) Tortuguitas Industrial Park , formally designated in 1999 , includes the local affiliates of BASF , GE Plastics , and Unilever , as well as Molinos R\u00edo de la Plata 's Lucchetti pasta plant .
