  "/wiki/Chambertin": "Chambertin is an Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e ( AOC ) and Grand Cru vineyard for red wine in the C\u00f4te de Nuits subregion of Burgundy , with Pinot noir as the main grape variety . Chambertin is located within the commune of Gevrey-Chambertin , and it is situated approximately in the centre of a group of nine Grand Cru vineyards all having Chambertin as part of their name . The other eight vineyards , which all are separate AOCs , have hyphenated names where Chambertin appears together with something else , such as Chapelle-Chambertin . Chambertin itself is situated above ( to the west of ) the Route des Grands Crus . It borders on Chambertin-Clos de B\u00e8ze in the north , Griotte-Chambertin and Charmes-Chambertin in the east ( across the road ) and the Latrici\u00e8res-Chambertin in the south . The AOC was created in 1937 . Of the surrounding vineyards , wines from Chambertin-Clos de B\u00e8ze may also be sold under the Chambertin AOC . However , Chambertin-Clos de B\u00e8ze has a very good reputation on its own , so this is not widely practiced . The other seven hyphenated Chambertin Grand Cru vineyards do not have this right to use the Chambertin AOC .",
  "/wiki/Burgundy_wine": "Burgundy wine ( French : Bourgogne or vin de Bourgogne ) is wine made in the Burgundy region in eastern France , in the valleys and slopes west of the Sa\u00f4ne , a tributary of the Rh\u00f4ne . The most famous wines produced here - those commonly referred to as Burgundies - are dry red wines made from Pinot noir grapes and white wines made from Chardonnay grapes . Red and white wines are also made from other grape varieties , such as Gamay and Aligot\u00e9 , respectively . Small amounts of ros\u00e9 and sparkling wines are also produced in the region . Chardonnay-dominated Chablis and Gamay-dominated Beaujolais are formally part of the Burgundy wine region , but wines from those subregions are usually referred to by their own names rather than as Burgundy wines . Burgundy has a higher number of appellations d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e ( AOCs ) than any other French region , and is often seen as the most terroir-conscious of the French wine regions . The various Burgundy AOCs are classified from carefully delineated Grand Cru vineyards down to more non-specific regional appellations . The practice of delineating vineyards by their terroir in Burgundy goes back to medieval times , when various monasteries played a key role in developing the Burgundy wine industry .",

A peculiarity of Mazoy\u00e8res-Chambertin is that the appellations Charmes-Chambertin ( of the neighbouring Grand Cru vineyard ) may be used interchangeably with that of Mazoy\u00e8res-Chambertin . As Charmes-Chambertin is the more popular to use , relatively little wine is bottled as Mazoy\u00e8res-Chambertin , which is only around 10 per cent of the production . Another grand cru vineyard in Gevrey Chambertin with a similar name , but no other connection is Mazis-Chambertin which is also known as Mazy-Chambertin .",
