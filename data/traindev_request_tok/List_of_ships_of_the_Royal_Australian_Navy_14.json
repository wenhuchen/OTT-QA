  "/wiki/River-class_frigate": "The River class was a class of 151 frigates launched between 1941 and 1944 for use as anti-submarine convoy escorts in the North Atlantic . The majority served with the Royal Navy ( RN ) and Royal Canadian Navy ( RCN ) , with some serving in the other Allied navies : the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , the Free French Navy ( FFN ) , the Royal Netherlands Navy and , post-war , the South African Navy ( SAN ) . The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 , and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom , giving name to the class . In Canada , they were named for towns and cities , though they kept the same designation . Originally called a twin-screw corvette , the name frigate was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy . Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941 . The design was too big for the locks on the Lachine Canal so it was not built by the shipyards on the Great Lakes and therefore all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the West Coast or along the St. Lawrence River below Montreal . In all , Canada ordered the construction of 70 frigates , including ten for the Royal Navy , which transferred two to the United States Navy . Twelve were built in Australia for the RAN ( four to a modified design ) . After World War II , they found employment in many other navies the world over ; several RCN ships were sunk as breakwaters . One , HMCS Stormont , was purchased by Aristotle Onassis and converted into the luxury yacht Christina O .",

  "/wiki/Royal_Navy": "The Royal Navy ( RN ) is the United Kingdom 's naval warfare force . Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels .",

She operated on the Inter-Island trade route for Burns Philp & Company , and at the outbreak of World War II , she was engaged in the evacuation of civilians ahead of advancing Japanese forces . She was sunk in 1942 by a Japanese submarine in the Gulf of Papua near Murray Island , Torres Strait .",
  "/wiki/HMAS_Manoora_(1935)": "HMAS Manoora was a passenger liner that served in the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) during World War II . She was built in Scotland in 1935 for the Cairns to Fremantle coastal passenger run for the Adelaide Steamship Company . She was requisitioned by the RAN for naval service in 1939 . Manoora was initially converted into an armed merchant cruiser ( AMC ) , operating primarily in Australian , New Guinea , and Pacific waters , with deployments to Singapore and the Bay of Bengal . In 1942 , the ship was converted into the RAN 's first landing ship , infantry ( LSI ) . After extensive training , Manoora was involved in most of the Allied amphibious operations in the Pacific during 1944 and 1945 . After the war 's end , the ship was used to transport occupation forces and refugees until 1947 , when she was decommissioned from naval service and returned to the Adelaide Steamship Company . Manoora continued to operate in Australian waters until 1961 , when she was sold to an Indonesian company and renamed Albulombo . The ship was sold for scrap in 1972 .",
  "/wiki/Armed_merchantmen": "An armed merchantman is a merchant ship equipped with guns , usually for defensive purposes , either by design or after the fact . In the days of sail , piracy and privateers , many merchantmen would be routinely armed , especially those engaging in long distance and high value trade . In more modern times , auxiliary cruisers were used offensively as merchant raiders to disrupt trade chiefly during both World War I and World War II , particularly by Germany . While armed merchantmen are clearly inferior to regular warships , sometimes they have scored successes in combat against them . Examples include East Indiamen mimicking ships of the line and chasing off regular French warships in the Battle of Pulo Aura in 1804 , and the German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran sinking the Australian light cruiser HMAS Sydney in their battle in 1941 , although Kormoran was also destroyed and had to be scuttled .",
  "/wiki/HMAS_Manoora_(L_52)": "HMAS Manoora ( L 52 ) was a Kanimbla-class landing platform amphibious ship operated by the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . Originally built for the United States Navy ( USN ) as the Newport-class tank landing ship USS Fairfax County ( LST-1193 ) , the ship was decommissioned in 1994 and sold to the RAN . Although commissioned into Australian service in that year , the vessel was heavily modified from her original design , and did not begin operations until the end of the decade . During her Australian career , Manoora saw wartime service during the War in Afghanistan , and non-combat service in the Solomon Islands and East Timor . In 2001 , the ship was involved in the Tampa affair , a diplomatic incident involving a Norwegian cargo ship and a group of asylum seekers . In late 2010 , Manoora and sister ship Kanimbla were placed in an 'operational pause ' after several problems were identified with the ships . In early 2011 , it was announced that repairing Manoora was cost-prohibitive , and she was decommissioned on 27 May 2011 . The ship was sold for breaking in 2013 .",
  "/wiki/Kanimbla-class_landing_platform_amphibious": "The Kanimbla class was a class of amphibious transport ships ( designated Landing Platform Amphibious ) operated by the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . Two ships ( originally built as Newport-class tank landing ships for the United States Navy ) were purchased by Australia in 1994 and modified . Problems during the handover process and the need to repair previously unidentified defects meant the ships did not enter operational service until the end of the decade . Between them , the two ships have deployed to the Solomon Islands in 2000-01 , Vanuatu in 2001 , and participated in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars , the Australian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami , the Australian deployment to East Timor following the 2006 political crisis , and Operation Quickstep off Fiji . After a large number of defects were found in both ships during late 2010 , the vessels were docked . It was decided that Manoora was beyond economic repair , and she was decommissioned in May 2011 . Kanimbla was to be repaired and returned to service , but the estimated cost and time to do this , plus the successful acquisition of the British landing ship dock RFA Largs Bay as an interim capability replacement , prompted the government to decommission Kanimbla in November 2011 . Both ships were sold in 2013 and broken up for scrap .",

The LST was launched in 1970 and was commissioned into the USN in 1971 . Fairfax County was alternated deployments between the Caribbean Sea and the Mediterranean Sea . During the Gulf War , Fairfax County was deployed off the northern African coast as part of a deterrent force . The ship was decommissioned from the USN in 1994 . The LST was sold to Australia and commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy as HMAS Manoora ( L 52 ) in 1994 . The ship underwent a significant refit , altering the vessel 's ability to land ships over its bow . The ship remained in service until 2011 , when it was decommissioned .

Melbourne was laid down for the Royal Navy as the lead ship of the Majestic class in April 1943 , and was launched as HMS Majestic ( R77 ) in February 1945 . At the end of the Second World War , work on the ship was suspended until she was purchased by the RAN in 1947 . At the time of purchase , it was decided to incorporate new aircraft carrier technologies into the design , making Melbourne the third ship to be constructed with an angled flight deck . Delays in construction and integrating the enhancements meant that the carrier was not commissioned until 1955 . Melbourne never fired a shot in anger during her service career , having only peripheral , non-combat roles in relation to the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation and the Vietnam War . She was , however , involved in two major collisions with allied vessels ; though Melbourne was found not to be the primary cause of either incident . The first collision occurred on the evening of 10 February 1964 , in which Melbourne rammed and sank the RAN destroyer HMAS Voyager , when the latter altered course across her bow . 82 of Voyager 's personnel were killed , and two Royal Commissions were held to investigate the incident .

Sixteen Light Fleet carriers were ordered , and all were laid down to the Colossus class design during 1942 and 1943 . However , only eight were completed to this design ; of these , four entered service before the end of the war , and none saw front line operations . Two more were fitted with maintenance and repair facilities instead of aircraft catapults and arresting gear , and entered service as aircraft maintenance carriers . The final six were modified during construction to handle larger and faster aircraft , and were redesignated the Majestic class . The construction of the six ships was suspended at the end of the war . Five were eventually completed with the last commissioning in 1961 ; however , the sixth , Leviathan , was dismantled for spare parts and scrap . Although not completed in time to fight in the war , the carriers in Royal Navy service participated in the Korean War and the Suez Crisis .
