  "/wiki/American_Dad!": "American Dad ! is an American animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane , Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman that originally premiered on Fox . American Dad ! is the first television series to have its inception on the network 's Animation Domination block . The series premiered on February 6 , 2005 , following Super Bowl XXXIX , with the rest of the first season airing three months later beginning May 1 , 2005 . The series is produced by Underdog Productions , Fuzzy Door Productions , and 20th Century Fox Television and syndicated by 20th Television . Creative direction of American Dad ! has largely been guided by Barker ( prior to his exit from the show in season 10 ) and Weitzman as opposed to MacFarlane , resulting in a series that is different from its counterparts . Unlike MacFarlane 's other shows , Family Guy and , to a lesser extent , The Cleveland Show , American Dad ! does not lean as heavily on the use of cutaway gags , and is less concerned with conventional setup-punchline jokes , instead deriving its humor mostly from the quirky characters , the relationships between family members , and the relatively relatable plots . While the core issues and resolutions are relatable in most episodes , the show nonetheless weaves in fantastical elements , pitching the tone of the show somewhere between observational comedy and farce . The plots are often absurd , but they are grounded by family stories and real-world issues .",
