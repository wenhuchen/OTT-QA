The competition consisted of men 's and women 's team events , and what had been billed as one of the most open tournaments certainly lived up to expectations . In the women 's gold medal game , the lead changed hands five times , with the USA outlasting China by a score of 6-5 , with never more than one goal in it . The winning goal came from Asya Miller with less than a minute to go . The gold medal in the men 's game was even more dramatic . Lithuania , the current world champions , took advantage of a clutch of penalties in the first half to jump ahead of China by 6 goals to 2 at the half , and looked to be holding on despite a steady comeback . With only 50 seconds on the clock , the Chinese were two goals behind ( 6-8 ) but managed to overturn the deficit with three goals in 30 seconds to take the gold 9-8 , sending the packed BIT Gymnasium into rapture ."
