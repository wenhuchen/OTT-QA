  "/wiki/Japan": "Japan ( Japanese : \u65e5\u672c , Nippon [ \u0272ippo\ua71c\u0274 ] ( listen ) or Nihon [ \u0272iho\ua71c\u0274 ] ( listen ) ) is an island country located in East Asia . It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",

Brazil saw only unlicensed clones until the official local release in 1993 . The console 's South Korean release was packaged as the Hyundai Comboy [ c ] and distributed by Hyundai Electronics ( now SK Hynix ) . As one of the best-selling gaming consoles of its time , the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983 . With the NES , Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers , authorizing them to produce and distribute games for Nintendo 's platform . It had been preceded by Nintendo 's first home video game console , the Color TV-Game , and was succeeded by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System ( SNES ) .",

  "/wiki/Future": "The future is the time after the present . Its arrival is considered inevitable due to the existence of time and the laws of physics . Due to the apparent nature of reality and the unavoidability of the future , everything that currently exists and will exist can be categorized as either permanent , meaning that it will exist forever , or temporary , meaning that it will end . In the Occidental view , which uses a linear conception of time , the future is the portion of the projected timeline that is anticipated to occur . In special relativity , the future is considered absolute future , or the future light cone . In the philosophy of time , presentism is the belief that only the present exists and the future and the past are unreal . Religions consider the future when they address issues such as karma , life after death , and eschatologies that study what the end of time and the end of the world will be . Religious figures such as prophets and diviners have claimed to see into the future . Future studies , or futurology , is the science , art , and practice of postulating possible futures . Modern practitioners stress the importance of alternative and plural futures , rather than one monolithic future , and the limitations of prediction and probability , versus the creation of possible and preferable futures . The concept of the future has been explored extensively in cultural production , including art movements and genres devoted entirely to its elucidation , such as the 20th-century movement futurism .",
  "/wiki/World_map": "A world map is a map of most or all of the surface of Earth . World maps form a distinctive category of maps due to the problem of projection . Maps by necessity distort the presentation of the earth 's surface . These distortions reach extremes in a world map . The many ways of projecting the earth reflect diverse technical and aesthetic goals for world maps . World maps are also distinct for the global knowledge required to construct them . A meaningful map of the world could not be constructed before the European Renaissance because less than half of the earth 's coastlines , let alone its interior regions , were known to any culture . New knowledge of the Earth 's surface has been accumulating ever since and continues to this day . Maps of the world generally focus either on political features or on physical features . Political maps emphasize territorial boundaries and human settlement . Physical maps show geographic features such as mountains , soil type or land use . Geological maps show not only the surface , but characteristics of the underlying rock , fault lines , and subsurface structures .",
  "/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_(video_games)": "In video games , artificial intelligence ( AI ) is used to generate responsive , adaptive or intelligent behaviors primarily in non-player characters ( NPCs ) similar to human-like intelligence . Artificial intelligence has been an integral part of video games since their inception in the 1950s . AI in video games is a distinct subfield and differs from academic AI . It serves to improve the game-player experience rather than machine learning or decision making . During the golden age of video arcade games , the idea of AI opponents was largely popularized , which sported an increasing difficulty level , distinct movement patterns , and in-game events dependent on hash functions based on the player 's input . [ citation needed ] Modern games often implement existing techniques such as pathfinding and decision trees to guide the actions of NPCs . AI is often used in mechanisms which are not immediately visible to the user , such as data mining and procedural-content generation .",
  "/wiki/Senior_citizen": "Old age refers to ages nearing or surpassing the life expectancy of human beings , and is thus the end of the human life cycle . Terms and euphemisms include old people , the elderly ( worldwide usage ) , OAPs ( British usage which stands Old Age Pensioner ) , seniors ( American usage ) , senior citizens ( American usage ) , older adults ( in the social sciences ) , and the elders ( in many cultures - including the cultures of aboriginal people ) . Old people often have limited regenerative abilities and are more susceptible to disease , syndromes , injuries and sickness than younger adults . The organic process of ageing is called senescence , the medical study of the aging process is called gerontology , and the study of diseases that afflict the elderly is called geriatrics . The elderly also face other social issues around retirement , loneliness , and ageism . Old age is not a definite biological stage , as the chronological age denoted as old age varies culturally and historically . In 2011 , the United Nations proposed a human rights convention that would specifically protect older persons .",
  "/wiki/Playing_card": "A playing card is a piece of specially prepared card stock , heavy paper , thin cardboard , plastic-coated paper , cotton-paper blend , or thin plastic that is marked with distinguishing motifs . Often the front ( face ) and back of each card has a finish to make handling easier . They are most commonly used for playing card games , and are also used to perform magic tricks , for cardistry , in card throwing , and for building card houses and/or card dragons . Some types of cards such as tarot cards are also used for divination . Playing cards are typically palm-sized for convenient handling , and usually are sold together in a set as a deck of cards or pack of cards . Playing cards are available in a wide variety of styles , as decks may be custom-produced for casinos and magicians ( sometimes in the form of trick decks ) , made as promotional items , or intended as souvenirs , artistic works , educational tools , or branded accessories . Decks of cards or even single cards are also collected as a hobby or for monetary value . Different types of card decks can be found in different areas of the world - while the standard 52-card deck is known and used internationally , other types of cards such as Japanese hanafuda and Italian playing cards are well-known in their locales . Cards may also be produced for trading card sets or collectible card games , which can comprise hundreds if not thousands of unique cards .",
  "/wiki/Bingo_(U.S.)": "In the United States , Bingo is a game of chance in which each player matches numbers printed in different arrangements on cards which the numbers the game host ( caller ) draws at random , marking the selected numbers with tiles . When a player finds the selected numbers are arranged on their card in a row , they call out Bingo ! to alert all participants to a winning card , which prompts the game host ( or an associate assisting the host ) to examine the card for verification of the win . Players compete against one another to be the first to have a winning arrangement for the prize or jackpot . After a winner is declared , the players clear their number cards of the tiles and the game host begins a new round of play . Alternative methods of play try to increase participation by creating excitement . Since its invention in 1929 , modern bingo has evolved into multiple variations , with each jurisdiction 's gambling laws regulating how the game is played . There are also nearly unlimited patterns that may be specified for play . Some games require only one number to be matched , while cover-all games award the jackpot for covering an entire card . There are even games that award prizes to players for matching no numbers or achieving no pattern .",

Slot machines are also known pejoratively as one-armed bandits due to the large mechanical levers affixed to the sides of early mechanical machines and their ability to empty players ' pockets and wallets as thieves would . Its standard layout features a screen displaying three or more reels that spin when the game is activated . Some modern slot machines still include a lever as a skeuomorphic design trait to trigger play . However , the mechanics of early machines have since been superseded by random number generators - most are now operated using push-buttons and touchscreens . Slot machines include one or more currency detectors that validate the form of payment , whether coin , cash , voucher , or token . The machine pays off according to the pattern of symbols displayed when the reels stop spinning . Slot machines are the most popular gambling method in casinos and constitute about 70 percent of the average U.S. casino 's income . Digital technology has resulted in variations on the original slot machine concept . Since the player is essentially playing a video game , manufacturers are able to offer more interactive elements such as advanced bonus rounds and more varied video graphics .",

  "/wiki/Super_deformed": "Chibi ( \u3061\u3073 or \u30c1\u30d3 ) is a Japanese slang word describing something short ( a thing , an animal or a person ) . It comes from the verb \u79bf\u3073\u308b ( chibiru ) , which means 'to wear out and become shorter ' ( the tip of something ) . Chibi-debu ( \u3061\u3073\u30c7\u30d6 or \u30c1\u30d3\u30c7\u30d6 ) is used to describe something or someone that is both short and chubby . Chibi is widely used in Japan to describe a specific style of caricature where characters are drawn in an exaggerated way . Typically these characters are small and chubby , with stubby limbs and oversized heads to make them resemble children . This style of artwork , also known as super deformed ( shorthanded as SD ) , has since found its way into anime and manga fandom through its usage in manga works . Chibi can be translated as 'little ' ( e.g . Chibi Maruko-chan , which means Little Miss Maruko ) , but it is not used the same way as chiisana [ \u5c0f\u3055\u306a ] and chiisai [ \u5c0f\u3055\u3044 ] ( 'tiny ' , 'small ' , 'little ' in Japanese ) , but rather 'cute ' .",
  "/wiki/North_America": "North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere . It is also considered by some [ quantify ] to be a northern subcontinent of the Americas . It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean , to the east by the Atlantic Ocean , to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean , and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea . North America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers ( 9,540,000 square miles ) , about 16.5% of the earth 's land area and about 4.8% of its total surface . North America is the third largest continent by area , following Asia and Africa , and the fourth by population after Asia , Africa , and Europe . In 2013 , its population was estimated at nearly 579 million people in 23 independent states , or about 7.5% of the world 's population , if nearby islands ( most notably around the Caribbean ) are included . North America was reached by its first human populations during the last glacial period , via crossing the Bering land bridge approximately 40,000 to 17,000 years ago . The so-called Paleo-Indian period is taken to have lasted until about 10,000 years ago ( the beginning of the Archaic or Meso-Indian period ) . The Classic stage spans roughly the 6th to 13th centuries . The Pre-Columbian era ended in 1492 , with the beginning of the transatlantic migrations - the arrival of European settlers during the Age of Discovery and the Early Modern period . Present-day cultural and ethnic patterns reflect interactions between European colonists , indigenous peoples , African slaves and their descendants . Owing to Europe 's colonization of the Americas , most North Americans speak European languages such as English , Spanish or French , and their states ' cultures commonly reflect Western traditions .",

It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north , the Atlantic Ocean to the west , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , and Asia to the east . The eastern border comprises a long and mixed line of mountain ranges and waterways that would normally define a subcontinent . However , Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition . It is the 6th largest continent in the world . Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains , the Ural River , the Caspian and Black Seas and the waterways of the Turkish Straits . Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres ( 3,930,000 sq mi ) , or 2% of the Earth 's surface ( 6.8% of land area ) . Politically , Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which Russia is the largest and most populous , spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population . Europe had a total population of about 741 million ( about 11% of the world population ) as of 2018 [ update ] . The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent , even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe . Further from the sea , seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast . Europe , in particular ancient Greece and ancient Rome , was the birthplace of Western civilisation .",

  "/wiki/PlayStation_Vita": "The PlayStation Vita ( also known as the PS Vita or simply Vita ) is a handheld video game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment . It was first released in Japan on December 17 , 2011 , and in North America , Europe , and other international territories beginning on February 22 , 2012 . The console is the successor to the PlayStation Portable , and a part of the PlayStation brand of gaming devices ; as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles , it primarily competed with the Nintendo 3DS . The original model of the handheld includes a 5-inch ( 130 mm ) OLED multi-touch capacitive touchscreen , two analog joysticks , and front and shoulder push-button input , and supports Bluetooth , Wi-Fi , and optional 3G . Internally , the Vita features a quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore processor and a quad-core SGX543MP graphics processing unit . The PS Vita 2000 series , a revised version of the system , was released across 2013 and 2014 , sports all of the same features with a slightly smaller size , extended battery life , and an LCD screen replacing the OLED display . Sony also released the PlayStation TV , a short-lived , re-purposed version of the Vita that allowed for the play of PS Vita games on a television screen similar to a home video game console , though the PS TV variant was discontinued by the end of 2015 . The system 's design was created to meld the experience of big budget , dedicated video game platforms with the then up-and-coming trend of mobile gaming through smart phones and tablets . However , in the year after the device 's successful launch , sales of the hardware and its bigger budget games stalled , threatening to end its lifespan . A concentrated effort to attract smaller independent developers in the West , combined with strong support from mid-level Japanese companies , helped keep the platform afloat . While this led to less diversity in its game library , it did garner strong support in JRPGs and visual novels , alongside a wealth of Western-developed indie games , leading it to become a moderate seller in Japan , and build a smaller , yet passionate userbase in the West . While Sony has not released exact sales figures , late-lifespan estimates in sales fall around 15 to 16 million units .",
