Jack Sears and Tommy Sopwith ended the final race on the same number of championship points . With this a possibility going into the final round it was initially suggested the champion would be decided by the toss of a coin . The idea was very unpopular with both drivers , and it was decided two identical looking Marcus Chambers-owned Riley One-Point-Five works rally cars would be brought along for a five lap shoot-out . To make the race fair , they raced five laps , switched cars , then raced five laps again with the driver who had the quickest combined time being crowned champion . In extremely wet conditions , the first head to head was won by Sopwith by 2.2 seconds . The second race was won by Sears by 3.8 seconds .

Revealed on 3 May 1963 , after much advance publicity , it was the first British mass-produced car with the engine block and cylinder head cast in aluminium . Being a direct competitor to the BMC 's Mini , it used a space-saving rear-engine , rear-wheel-drive layout to allow as much luggage and passenger capacity as possible in both the rear and the front of the car . It used a unique opening rear hatch to allow luggage to be put into the back seat rest . It was the first mass-produced British car with the engine in the back and the first to use a diaphragm spring clutch . The baulk-ring synchromesh unit for the transaxle compensated for the speeds of gear and shaft before engagement , which the Mini had suffered from during its early production years . It incorporated many design features which were uncommon in cars until the late 1970s , such as a folding rear bench seat , automatic choke and gauges for temperature , voltage and oil pressure . This unorthodox small/light car was designed for the Rootes Group by Michael Parkes ( who later became a Formula One driver ) and Tim Fry . It was manufactured at the purpose-built Linwood plant in Scotland . Along with the Hillman marque was a series of variations including an estate car ( Husky ) , a van and a coup\u00e9 . The Imp gained a reputation as a successful rally car when Rosemary Smith won the Tulip Rally in 1965 . This led the Rootes Group to produce a special rally conversion of the Imp under both the Hillman and Singer marques known as the Imp Rallye .",

Unett was born on 22 July 1936 in Wolvey , Warwickshire . His parents ran a farm and it was being around , then helping repair the farm machinery sparked his interest in mechanics . Instead of following his parents into farming , he joined Humber as an apprentice at the age of 15 which was part of the Rootes Group organisation . He became development engineer , one of a select few , known as 'The Set 'em Alight Boys ' due to Rootes Chief Test engineer Don Tarbun 's expression 'For **** sake , set 'em alight ' , often exclaimed by him when facing difficulties . Unett was deputy head of the department for the development of the 'series ' Sunbeam Alpine in 1958-1959 . He began motor racing in 1961 . After competing and crashing in a disastrous Club rally , Rootes competition manager Mike Parkes encouraged Unett to attend a race meeting at the Goodwood Circuit , leading him to buy his first racing car , a prototype from the Alpine development programme registration number XRW 302 . After developing it for racing it was in this car that Unett won his first trophy in 1964 , the 'Freddie Dixon Challenge Trophy ' , one of the biggest prizes in motor club racing at the time . The history of this surviving prototype can be found here . The site also has a film and pictorial history of Bernard Unett 's career .

  "/wiki/Rootes_Group": "The Rootes Group or Rootes Motors Limited was a British automobile manufacturer and , separately , a major motor distributors and dealers business . Run from London 's West End , they were respectively based in the Midlands and south of England . In the decade beginning 1928 the Rootes brothers , William and Reginald , made prosperous by their very successful distribution and servicing business , were keen to enter manufacturing for closer control of the products they were selling . One brother has been termed the power unit , the other the steering and braking system . With the financial support of Prudential Assurance , the two brothers bought some well-known British motor manufacturers , including Hillman , Humber , Singer , Sunbeam , Talbot , Commer and Karrier , controlling them through their parent , Rootes ' 60-per-cent-owned subsidiary , Humber Limited . At its height in 1960 , Rootes had manufacturing plants in the Midlands at Coventry and Birmingham , in southern England at Acton , Luton and Dunstable , and a brand-new plant in the west of Scotland at Linwood . From its offices in Devonshire House , Piccadilly , in London it controlled exports and international distribution for Rootes and other motor manufacturers and its own local distribution and service operations in London , Kent , Birmingham and Manchester . There were assembly plants in nine countries outside the UK . Rootes Group was under-capitalised and unable to survive industrial relations problems and losses from the 1963 introduction of a new aluminium-engined small car , the Hillman Imp . By mutual agreement , from mid-1964 , Rootes Motors was taken over in stages by Chrysler Corporation , which bought control from the Rootes family in 1967 . By the end of 1978 the last of the various elements of Chrysler UK had been sold to Peugeot and Renault .",
