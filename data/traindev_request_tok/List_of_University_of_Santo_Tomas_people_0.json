The Philippine Revolution began in August 1896 , when the Spanish authorities discovered the Katipunan , an anti-colonial secret organization . The Katipunan , led by Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio , began to influence much of the Philippines . During a mass gathering in Caloocan , the leaders of the Katipunan organized themselves into a revolutionary government , named the newly established government Haring Bayang Katagalugan , and openly declared a nationwide armed revolution . Bonifacio called for an attack on the capital city of Manila . This attack failed ; however , the surrounding provinces began to revolt . In particular , rebels in Cavite led by Mariano \u00c1lvarez and Emilio Aguinaldo ( who were from two different factions of the Katipunan ) won early major victories . A power struggle among the revolutionaries led to Bonifacio 's death in 1897 , with command shifting to Aguinaldo , who led the newly formed revolutionary government . That year , the revolutionaries and the Spanish signed the Pact of Biak-na-Bato , which temporarily reduced hostilities . Aguinaldo and other Filipino officers exiled themselves in the British colony of Hong Kong in southern China . However , the hostilities never completely ceased .

While Filipino nationalists viewed the conflict as a continuation of the struggle for independence that began in 1896 with the Philippine Revolution , the U.S. government regarded it as an insurrection . The conflict arose when the First Philippine Republic objected to the terms of the Treaty of Paris under which the United States took possession of the Philippines from Spain , ending the Spanish-American War . Fighting erupted between forces of the United States and those of the Philippine Republic on February 4 , 1899 , in what became known as the 1899 Battle of Manila . On June 2 , 1899 , the First Philippine Republic officially declared war against the United States . The war officially ended on July 2 , 1902 , with a victory for the United States . However , some Philippine groups - led by veterans of the Katipunan , a Philippine revolutionary society - continued to battle the American forces for several more years . Among those leaders was General Macario Sakay , a veteran Katipunan member who assumed the presidency of the proclaimed Tagalog Republic , formed in 1902 after the capture of President Emilio Aguinaldo . Other groups , including the Moro , Bicol , and Pulahan peoples , continued hostilities in remote areas and islands , until their final defeat at the Battle of Bud Bagsak on June 15 , 1913 . The war resulted in the deaths of at least 200,000 Filipino civilians , mostly due to famine and disease . Some estimates for total civilian dead reach up to a million .

His three-tier defense , now known as the Luna Defense Line , gave the American troops a hard campaign in the provinces north of Manila . This defense line culminated in the creation of a military base in the Cordillera . Despite his commitment to discipline the army and serve the Republic which attracted the admiration of people , his temper caused some to abhor him , including people from Aguinaldo 's Cabinet . His efforts were not without recognition during his time , for he was awarded the Philippine Republic Medal in 1899 . He was also a member of the Malolos Congress .

In many countries , this degree is a prerequisite for registration to practice as a pharmacist . Since both PharmB and PharmD are prerequisites to license in most western countries theyre considered equivalent . In many western countries , the foreign graduates with BPharm , PharmB or BS Pharm practice similarly as PharmD graduates . It is analogous to MBBS vs. MD where MBBS is foreign equivalent of MD . It is training to understand the properties and impacts of medicines and developing the skills required to counsel patients about their use . B Pharm holders can work in several fields such as being a pharmacist , patient counseling , doing further studies such as master 's degree , working in a university as a lecturer , or working as a drug information specialist . In some countries , it has been superseded by the Doctor of Pharmacy ( PharmD ) and Master of Pharmacy ( MPharm ) degrees . In the United States , this degree was granted as the baccalaureate pharmacy degree only at Washington State University , where it has now been superseded by the PharmD degree . The degree previously offered in the US - and the required degree in Canada - is the Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy .

  "/wiki/Philippine\u2013American_War": "The Philippine-American War , also referred to as the Filipino-American War , the Philippine War , the Philippine Insurrection or the Tagalog Insurgency ( Filipino : Digmaang Pilipino-Amerikano ; Spanish : Guerra Filipino-Estadounidense ) , was an armed conflict between the First Philippine Republic and the United States that lasted from February 4 , 1899 , to July 2 , 1902 . While Filipino nationalists viewed the conflict as a continuation of the struggle for independence that began in 1896 with the Philippine Revolution , the U.S. government regarded it as an insurrection . The conflict arose when the First Philippine Republic objected to the terms of the Treaty of Paris under which the United States took possession of the Philippines from Spain , ending the Spanish-American War . Fighting erupted between forces of the United States and those of the Philippine Republic on February 4 , 1899 , in what became known as the 1899 Battle of Manila . On June 2 , 1899 , the First Philippine Republic officially declared war against the United States . The war officially ended on July 2 , 1902 , with a victory for the United States . However , some Philippine groups - led by veterans of the Katipunan , a Philippine revolutionary society - continued to battle the American forces for several more years . Among those leaders was General Macario Sakay , a veteran Katipunan member who assumed the presidency of the proclaimed Tagalog Republic , formed in 1902 after the capture of President Emilio Aguinaldo . Other groups , including the Moro , Bicol , and Pulahan peoples , continued hostilities in remote areas and islands , until their final defeat at the Battle of Bud Bagsak on June 15 , 1913 . The war resulted in the deaths of at least 200,000 Filipino civilians , mostly due to famine and disease . Some estimates for total civilian dead reach up to a million . The war , and especially the following occupation by the U.S. , changed the culture of the islands , leading to the disestablishment of the Catholic Church in the Philippines as a state religion , and the introduction of English to the islands as the primary language of government , education , business , industry , and , in future decades , among upper-class families and educated individuals .",

  "/wiki/Polymath": "A polymath ( Greek : \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03ae\u03c2 , polymath\u0113s , having learned much ; Latin : homo universalis , universal man ) is an individual whose knowledge spans a significant number of subjects , known to draw on complex bodies of knowledge to solve specific problems . The earliest recorded use of the term in English is from 1624 , in the second edition of The Anatomy of Melancholy by Robert Burton ; the form polymathist is slightly older , first appearing in the Diatribae upon the first part of the late History of Tithes of Richard Montagu in 1621 . Use in English of the similar term polyhistor dates from the late sixteenth century . In Western Europe , the first work to use polymathy in its title ( De Polymathia tractatio : integri operis de studiis veterum ) was published in 1603 by Johann von Wowern ( de ) , a Hamburg philosopher . Von Wowern defined polymathy as knowledge of various matters , drawn from all kinds of studies [ . ] ranging freely through all the fields of the disciplines , as far as the human mind , with unwearied industry , is able to pursue them . Von Wowern lists erudition , literature , philology , philomathy and polyhistory as synonyms . Polymaths include the great thinkers of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment , who excelled at several fields in science , technology , engineering , mathematics , and the arts . In the Italian Renaissance , the idea of the polymath was expressed by Leon Battista Alberti ( 1404-1472 ) in the statement that a man can do all things if he will . Embodying a basic tenet of Renaissance humanism that humans are limitless in their capacity for development , the concept led to the notion that people should embrace all knowledge and develop their capacities as fully as possible . This is expressed in the term Renaissance man , often applied to the gifted people of that age who sought to develop their abilities in all areas of accomplishment : intellectual , artistic , social , physical , and spiritual ."
