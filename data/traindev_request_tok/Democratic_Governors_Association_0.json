  "/wiki/U.S._state": "In the United States , a state is a constituent political entity , of which there are currently 50 . Bound together in a political union , each state holds governmental jurisdiction over a separate and defined geographic territory and shares its sovereignty with the federal government . Due to this shared sovereignty , Americans are citizens both of the federal republic and of the state in which they reside . State citizenship and residency are flexible , and no government approval is required to move between states , except for persons restricted by certain types of court orders ( such as paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody ) . States are divided into counties or county-equivalents , which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign . County or county-equivalent structure varies widely by state , and states may also create other local governments . State governments are allocated power by the people ( of each respective state ) through their individual constitutions . All are grounded in republican principles , and each provides for a government , consisting of three branches , each with separate and independent powers : executive , legislative , and judicial . States , unlike U.S. territories , possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution . States and their residents are represented in the United States Congress , a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives . Each state is also entitled to select a number of electors ( equal to the total number of representatives and senators from that state ) to vote in the Electoral College , the body that directly elects the President of the United States . Additionally , each state has the opportunity to ratify constitutional amendments , and , with the consent of Congress , two or more states may enter into interstate compacts with one another .",

The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s , in the midst of political wars over the slavery debate . When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the Kansas-Nebraska Act , abolitionist Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a free state or a slave state .

  "/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_New_York": "The governor of New York is the head of the executive branch of New York 's state government and the commander-in-chief of the state 's National Guard . The governor has a duty to enforce state laws , to convene the New York legislature , the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the legislature , and to grant pardons , except in cases of treason and impeachment . Fifty-six people have served as governor , four of whom served non-consecutive terms ; the official numbering only lists each governor once , so there have officially been fifty-six governors . All of them have been men . New York has never had a female governor . This numbering includes one acting governor : the lieutenant governor who filled the vacancy after the resignation of the governor , under the 1777 Constitution . The list does not include people who have acted as governor when the governor was out of state , such as Lieutenant Governor Timothy L. Woodruff during Theodore Roosevelt 's vice presidential campaign in 1900 , or Acting Speaker of the New York State Assembly Moses M. Weinstein , who acted as governor for 10 days in 1968 while the governor , the lieutenant governor and the senate majority leader were out of the state , attending the Republican National Convention in Miami . Four men have become President of the United States after serving as Governor of New York : Martin Van Buren , Grover Cleveland , Theodore Roosevelt , and Franklin D. Roosevelt , and six were Vice President of the United States . Van Buren and Theodore Roosevelt held both offices . Two governors have been Chief Justice of the United States : John Jay held that position when he was elected governor in 1795 , and Charles Evans Hughes became chief justice in 1930 , two decades after leaving the governorship . The longest-serving governor was the first , George Clinton , who first took office on July 30 , 1777 , and served seven terms in two different periods , totaling just under 21 years in office . As 18 of those years were consecutive , Clinton also served the longest consecutive period in office for a New York governor .",
