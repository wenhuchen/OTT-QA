  "/wiki/H._G._Wells": "Herbert George Wells ( 21 September 1866 - 13 August 1946 ) was an English writer . He was prolific in many genres , writing dozens of novels , short stories , and works of social commentary , history , satire , biography , and autobiography , and even including two books on recreational war games . He is now best remembered for his science fiction novels and is often called the father of science fiction , along with Jules Verne and the publisher Hugo Gernsback . [ a ] During his own lifetime , however , he was most prominent as a forward-looking , even prophetic social critic who devoted his literary talents to the development of a progressive vision on a global scale . A futurist , he wrote a number of utopian works and foresaw the advent of aircraft , tanks , space travel , nuclear weapons , satellite television and something resembling the World Wide Web . His science fiction imagined time travel , alien invasion , invisibility , and biological engineering . Brian Aldiss referred to Wells as the Shakespeare of science fiction . Wells rendered his works convincing by instilling commonplace detail alongside a single extraordinary assumption - dubbed Wellss law - leading Joseph Conrad to hail him in 1898 as O Realist of the Fantastic ! . His most notable science fiction works include The Time Machine ( 1895 ) , The Island of Doctor Moreau ( 1896 ) , The Invisible Man ( 1897 ) , The War of the Worlds ( 1898 ) and the military science fiction The War in the Air ( 1907 ) . Wells was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times . Wells 's earliest specialised training was in biology , and his thinking on ethical matters took place in a specifically and fundamentally Darwinian context . He was also from an early date an outspoken socialist , often ( but not always , as at the beginning of the First World War ) sympathising with pacifist views .",
  "/wiki/Red_weed": "The red weed ( also referred to as the red creeper or the red swamp ) is a fictional plant native to Mars in the novel The War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells . It is this plant that supposedly gives Mars its dull red colour . It is one of the several types of plants brought to Earth possibly accidentally by the invading Martians , but the only one that truly was able to adapt and grow widespread on Earth . When it is exposed to water , it grows and reproduces explosively , flooding the neighboring countryside as it clogs streams and rivers . The narrator mentions near the end of The Man on Putney Hill that the weed glows purple at night . He tries eating some , but it has a metallic taste . Though it engulfed the native plant life of Earth , it also succumbed to the effects of Earth bacteria . Wells ' earlier short story , The Crystal Egg , features a dense , red weed seen on Mars that also grows heavily on water , in this case a Martian canal . As the book has been interpreted as criticism of imperialism , the red weed could symbolize the non-native fauna colonizers introduced to the Americas , Australia , New Zealand and other countries . In many cases , these introduced species overwhelmed the native fauna , especially in remote islands . Wells may have been influenced by the theories of Camille Flammarion , who in 1873 claimed that Mars was red due to red vegetation growing on it .",
  "/wiki/J._B._S._Haldane": "John Burdon Sanderson Haldane FRS ( /\u02c8h\u0254\u02d0lde\u026an/ ; 5 November 1892 - 1 December 1964 ) was a British-Indian scientist known for his work in the study of physiology , genetics , evolutionary biology , and mathematics . He made innovative contributions to the fields of statistics and biostatistics . His article on abiogenesis in 1929 introduced the primordial soup theory , and it became the foundation to build physical models for the chemical origin of life . Haldane established human gene maps for haemophilia and colour blindness on the X chromosome , and codified Haldane 's rule on sterility in the heterogametic sex of hybrids in species . He correctly proposed that sickle-cell disease confers some immunity to malaria . He was the first to suggest the central idea of in vitro fertilisation , as well as concepts such as hydrogen economy , cis and trans-acting regulation , coupling reaction , molecular repulsion , the darwin ( as a unit of evolution ) and organismal cloning . In 1957 he articulated Haldane 's dilemma , a limit on the speed of beneficial evolution which subsequently proved incorrect . He willed his body for medical studies , as he wanted to remain useful even in death . He is also remembered for coining the words clone and cloning in human biology , and ectogenesis . Haldane 's first paper in 1915 demonstrated genetic linkage in mammals . Subsequent works established a unification of Mendelian genetics and Darwinian evolution by natural selection whilst laying the groundwork for modern evolutionary synthesis and thus helped to create population genetics . Haldane was a professed socialist , Marxist , atheist and humanist whose political dissent led him to leave England in 1956 and live in India , becoming a naturalised Indian citizen in 1961 .",
  "/wiki/Last_and_First_Men": "Last and First Men : A Story of the Near and Far Future is a future history science fiction novel written in 1930 by the British author Olaf Stapledon . A work of unprecedented scale in the genre , it describes the history of humanity from the present onwards across two billion years and eighteen distinct human species , of which our own is the first . The book employs a narrative conceit that , under subtle inspiration , the novelist has unknowingly been dictated a channelled text from the last human species . Stapledon 's conception of history is based on the Hegelian Dialectic , following a repetitive cycle with many varied civilisations rising from and descending back into savagery over millions of years , but it is also one of progress , as the later civilisations rise to far greater heights than the first . The book anticipates the science of genetic engineering , and is an early example of the fictional supermind ; a consciousness composed of many telepathically linked individuals . In 1932 , Stapledon followed Last and First Men with the far less acclaimed Last Men in London . Another Stapledon novel , Star Maker ( 1937 ) , could also be considered a sequel to Last and First Men ( mentioning briefly man 's evolution on Neptune ) , but is even more ambitious in scope , being a history of the entire universe . It is the 11th title in the SF Masterworks series .",

  "/wiki/Venus": "Venus is the second planet from the Sun . It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty . As the second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon , Venus can cast shadows and , rarely , is visible to the naked eye in broad daylight . Venus lies within Earth 's orbit , and so never appears to venture far from the Sun , either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a bit before dawn . Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days . With a rotation period of 243 Earth days , it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any planet in the Solar System and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus ( meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east ) . Venus does not have any moons , a distinction it shares only with Mercury among planets in the Solar System . Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth 's sister planet because of their similar size , mass , proximity to the Sun , and bulk composition . It is radically different from Earth in other respects . It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets , consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide . The atmospheric pressure at the planet 's surface is 92 times that of Earth , or roughly the pressure found 900 m ( 3,000 ft ) underwater on Earth . Venus is by far the hottest planet in the Solar System , with a mean surface temperature of 735 K ( 462 \u00b0C ; 863 \u00b0F ) , even though Mercury is closer to the Sun .",
  "/wiki/Farmer_in_the_Sky": "Farmer In The Sky is a 1950 science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein about a teenaged boy who emigrates with his family to Jupiter 's moon Ganymede , which is in the process of being terraformed . Among Heinlein 's juveniles , a condensed version of the novel was published in serial form in Boys ' Life magazine ( August , September , October , November 1950 ) , under the title Satellite Scout . The novel was awarded a Retro Hugo in 2001 . Passing references by the lead character to the song The Green Hills of Earth and to its author , Rhysling , have caused some to consider it part of Heinlein 's Future History series .",
  "/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein": "Robert Anson Heinlein ( /\u02c8ha\u026anla\u026an/ ; July 7 , 1907 - May 8 , 1988 ) was an American science-fiction author , aeronautical engineer , and retired Naval officer . Sometimes called the dean of science fiction writers , he was among the first to emphasize scientific accuracy in his fiction , and was thus a pioneer of the subgenre of hard science fiction . His published works , both fiction and non-fiction , express admiration for competence and emphasize the value of critical thinking . His work continues to have an influence on the science-fiction genre , and on modern culture more generally . Heinlein became one of the first American science-fiction writers to break into mainstream magazines such as The Saturday Evening Post in the late 1940s . He was one of the best-selling science-fiction novelists for many decades , and he , Isaac Asimov , and Arthur C. Clarke are often considered the Big Three of English-language science fiction authors . Notable Heinlein works include Stranger in a Strange Land , Starship Troopers ( which helped mold the space marine and mecha archetypes ) and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress . His work sometimes had controversial aspects , such as plural marriage in The Moon is a Harsh Mistress , militarism in Starship Troopers and technologically competent women characters that were strong and independent , yet often stereotypically feminine - such as Friday . A writer also of numerous science-fiction short stories , Heinlein was one of a group of writers who came to prominence under the editorship ( 1937-1971 ) of John W. Campbell at Astounding Science Fiction magazine , though Heinlein denied that Campbell influenced his writing to any great degree . Heinlein used his science fiction as a way to explore provocative social and political ideas , and to speculate how progress in science and engineering might shape the future of politics , race , religion , and sex . Within the framework of his science-fiction stories , Heinlein repeatedly addressed certain social themes : the importance of individual liberty and self-reliance , the nature of sexual relationships , the obligation individuals owe to their societies , the influence of organized religion on culture and government , and the tendency of society to repress nonconformist thought . He also speculated on the influence of space travel on human cultural practices .",
  "/wiki/Ganymede_(moon)": "Ganymede /\u02c8\u0261\u00e6n\u026ami\u02d0d/ , a satellite of Jupiter ( Jupiter III ) , is the largest and most massive of the Solar System 's moons . The ninth largest object in the Solar System , it is the largest without a substantial atmosphere . It has a diameter of 5,268 km ( 3,273 mi ) and is 8% larger than the planet Mercury , although only 45% as massive . Possessing a metallic core , it has the lowest moment of inertia factor of any solid body in the Solar System and is the only moon known to have a magnetic field . Outward from Jupiter , it is the seventh satellite and the third of the Galilean moons , the first group of objects discovered orbiting another planet . Ganymede orbits Jupiter in roughly seven days and is in a 1:2:4 orbital resonance with the moons Europa and Io , respectively . Ganymede is composed of approximately equal amounts of silicate rock and water ice . It is a fully differentiated body with an iron-rich , liquid core , and an internal ocean that may contain more water than all of Earth 's oceans combined . Its surface is composed of two main types of terrain . Dark regions , saturated with impact craters and dated to four billion years ago , cover about a third of the satellite . Lighter regions , crosscut by extensive grooves and ridges and only slightly less ancient , cover the remainder . The cause of the light terrain 's disrupted geology is not fully known , but was likely the result of tectonic activity due to tidal heating .",

He co-wrote the screenplay for the 1968 film 2001 : A Space Odyssey , one of the most influential films of all time . Clarke was a science writer who was an avid populariser of space travel and a futurist of uncanny ability . He wrote over a dozen books and many essays for popular magazines . In 1961 he received the Kalinga Prize , a UNESCO award for popularising science . Clarke 's science and science fiction writings earned him the moniker Prophet of the Space Age . His science fiction earned him a number of Hugo and Nebula awards , which along with a large readership made him one of the towering figures of science fiction . For many years Clarke , Robert Heinlein and Isaac Asimov were known as the Big Three of science fiction . Clarke was a lifelong proponent of space travel . In 1934 , while still a teenager , he joined the British Interplanetary Society . In 1945 , he proposed a satellite communication system using geostationary orbits .

  "/wiki/Phobos_(moon)": "Phobos ( /\u02c8fo\u028ab\u0259s/ FOH-b\u0259s , /-b\u0252s/ -\u2060boss , from Greek \u03a6\u03cc\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2 ; systematic designation : Mars I ) is the innermost and larger of the two natural satellites of Mars , the other being Deimos . Both moons were discovered in 1877 by American astronomer Asaph Hall . Phobos is a small , irregularly shaped object with a mean radius of 11 km ( 7 mi ) and is seven times as massive as the outer moon , Deimos . Phobos is named after the Greek god Phobos , a son of Ares ( Mars ) and Aphrodite ( Venus ) and the personification of fear ( cf . phobia ) . Phobos orbits 6,000 km ( 3,700 mi ) from the Martian surface , closer to its primary body than any other known planetary moon . It is so close that it orbits Mars much faster than Mars rotates , and completes an orbit in just 7 hours and 39 minutes . As a result , from the surface of Mars it appears to rise in the west , move across the sky in 4 hours and 15 minutes or less , and set in the east , twice each Martian day . Phobos is one of the least reflective bodies in the Solar System , with an albedo of just 0.071 . Surface temperatures range from about \u22124 \u00b0C ( 25 \u00b0F ) on the sunlit side to \u2212112 \u00b0C ( \u2212170 \u00b0F ) on the shadowed side . The defining surface feature is the large impact crater , Stickney , which takes up a substantial proportion of the moon 's surface . In November 2018 , astronomers concluded that the many grooves on Phobos were caused by boulders ejected from the asteroid impact that created Stickney and rolled around on the surface of the moon .",
  "/wiki/The_Martian_Way": "The Martian Way is a science fiction novella by American writer Isaac Asimov .

It was also included in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame , Volume Two ( 1973 ) after being voted one of the best novellas up to 1965 . There were originally no female characters in The Martian Way , but Galaxy editor H. L. Gold insisted that one be included . Asimov complied by giving Richard Swenson a shrewish wife . It was not what Gold had in mind , but he accepted the story anyway . When Asimov wrote The Martian Way in 1952 , it was thought that the fragments making up Saturn 's rings might be over a mile in diameter . It is now known that none of the ring fragments is more than a few meters in diameter . The final journey back to Mars is described to be under constant acceleration ( except for brief shutdowns for rest ) which took five weeks , with the acceleration being well above the comfortable threshold for human beings . However , even with the maximum distance possible between Mars and Saturn , the constant acceleration and deceleration required to make such a journey in five weeks would have been below 1 m/s2 .",

  "/wiki/The_Psychotechnic_League": "The Psychotechnic League is a future history created by American science fiction writer Poul Anderson . The name Psychotechnic League was coined by Sandra Miesel in the early 1980s , to capitalize on Anderson 's better-known Polesotechnic League future history . Anderson published 21 novels , novellas and short stories set in this future between 1949 and 1957 , with a 22nd published in 1968 . Anderson did not write the stories in chronological order ; instead , as Robert A. Heinlein did with his own Future History stories , he wrote whichever story in the series he wanted to , and trusted his readers to make the connections between them . Anderson included a series timeline in the Winter 1955 issue of Startling Stories to accompany the novella The Snows of Ganymede . By the late 1950s , Anderson 's political beliefs had altered to the point where he was uncomfortable with the political philosophy underlying the series , and he abandoned it . In particular , he had completely reversed his earlier strong support for the United Nations as the nucleus of a world government , a stance which formed the main plot element of several earlier stories in the series .",

In the novel , Francis Sandow refers to that mad painting by Boecklin , The Isle of the Dead . B\u00f6cklin created at least five paintings with that title , each depicting an oarsman and a standing figure in a small boat , crossing dark water toward a forbidding island . A later Ace books edition featured a cover painting by Dean Ellis that was deliberately reminiscent of B\u00f6cklin 's work . As to the novel 's inspiration , Zelazny noted , This was a spin-off from the novelette I did called This Moment of the Storm . Actually , it was n't the guy I was interested in , at first . I wanted somebody that was born in the twentieth century , who had made it aboard one of these generation starships where he 'd been frozen and spent generations getting to this new planet which proved habitable . By the time he got there , theyd invented a faster-than-light drive , because several centuries had gone by and theyd become more sophisticated . Earth had much higher technology , and he had the means of going back fast if he wanted to , but he did n't .
