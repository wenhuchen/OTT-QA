The newer Greek tetrachordo ( 4 courses of strings ) bouzouki was introduced into Irish traditional music in the mid-1960s by Johnny Moynihan of the folk group Sweeney 's Men . Alec Finn , first in the Cana Band and subsequently in De Dannan , introduced the first more-traditional Greek trichordo ( 3 course ) bouzouki into Irish music . In the early 1970s , Andy Irvine gave his Greek bouzouki to D\u00f3nal Lunny , who replaced the octave strings on the two lower G and D courses with unison strings , thus reinforcing their lower frequencies . Soon after , on a visit with Irvine to the workshop of luthier Peter Abnett , Lunny commissioned a bouzouki to the specifications of a classic , 4-course Greek bouzouki but with unison strings and a three-piece , partially staved back . Since then , the instrument has been adapted for Irish traditional and other styles of folk music .",
  "/wiki/Cuatro_(instrument)": "The cuatro is a family of Latin American string instruments found in Central and South America , Puerto Rico and other parts of the West Indies , derived from the Spanish guitar . Although some have viola-like shapes , most cuatros resemble a small to mid-sized classical guitar . Cuatro means four in Spanish ; the instrument 's 15th century predecessors were the Spanish vihuela and the Portuguese cavaquinho , the latter having four strings like the original cuatro ( modern cuatros often have more than four strings ) . Certain variants are considered the national instrument of some countries ( e.g. , Venezuela ) . The cuatro is widely used in ensembles in Jamaica , Mexico , and Surinam to accompany singing and dancing . In Trinidad and Tobago it accompanies Parang singers . In Saint Lucia the cuatro is used as an accompanying instrument in traditional Sewenal music at Christmas time . In Puerto Rico and Venezuela , the cuatro is an ensemble instrument for secular and religious music , and is played at parties and traditional gatherings . Modern cuatros come a variety of sizes and shapes , and number of strings . Cuatros can either have single-strings , like a guitar , or double- or triple-coursed strings like a mandolin , and vary in size from a large mandolin or small guitar , to the size of a full-size guitar . Depending on their particular stringing , cuatros are part of the guitar or mandolin subfamilies of the lute family .",

The Swedish fiddle and nyckelharpa are among the most common Swedish folk instruments . The instrumental genre is the biggest one in Sweden . In the 1960s , Swedish youth sparked a roots revival in Swedish folk culture . Many joined Spelmanslag ( folk musicians ' clubs ) and performed on mainstream radio and TV . They focused on instrumental polska music , with vocals and influences from other traditional genres becoming more prominent since the 1990s . By 1970 , the dansband culture also began . Swedish music has also included more modern and pop influences . On a per capita basis , Sweden is one of the world 's most successful exporters of popular music .

  "/wiki/Hurdy-gurdy": "The hurdy-gurdy is a stringed instrument that produces sound by a hand crank-turned , rosined wheel rubbing against the strings . The wheel functions much like a violin bow , and single notes played on the instrument sound similar to those of a violin . Melodies are played on a keyboard that presses tangents - small wedges , typically made of wood - against one or more of the strings to change their pitch . Like most other acoustic stringed instruments , it has a sound board and hollow cavity to make the vibration of the strings audible . Most hurdy-gurdies have multiple drone strings , which give a constant pitch accompaniment to the melody , resulting in a sound similar to that of a violin . For this reason , the hurdy-gurdy is often used interchangeably or along with bagpipes , particularly in Occitan , Catalan , Cajun French and contemporary Asturian , Cantabric , Galician , Hungarian and Slavic folk music . Many folk music festivals in Europe feature music groups with hurdy-gurdy players . The most famous has been held since 1976 at Saint-Chartier in the Indre d\u00e9partement in Central France .

When played , the strings are usually plucked by the Uyghurs of Western China and strummed and plucked by the Tajiks , Turkmen , Uzbeks . Related instruments include the Kazakh dombra . The Dutar is also an important instrument among the Kurds of Khorasan amongst whom Haj Ghorban Soleimani of Quchan was a noted virtuoso . In Kormanji one who plays the dutar is known as a bakci ( bakhshi ) , while in Azeri the term is ashiq . Khorasan bakhshi music is recognized on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity . At the time of the Dutar 's humble origins in the 15th century as a shepherd 's instrument its strings were made from gut . However , with the opening up of the Silk Road , catgut gave way to strings made from twisted silk imported from China . To this day some instruments still feature silk strings , although nylon strings are also commonly used . The dutar has a warm , dulcet tone .

  "/wiki/Fiddle": "A fiddle is a bowed string musical instrument , most often a violin . It is a colloquial term for the violin , used by players in all genres including classical music . Although violins and fiddles are essentially synonymous , the style of the music played may determine specific construction differences between fiddles and classical violins . For example , fiddles may optionally be set up with a bridge with a flatter arch to reduce the range of bow-arm motion needed for techniques such as the double shuffle , a form of bariolage involving rapid alternation between pairs of adjacent strings . To produce a brighter tone , compared to the deeper tones of gut or synthetic core strings , fiddlers often use steel strings . The fiddle is part of many traditional ( folk ) styles , which are typically aural traditions - taught 'by ear ' rather than via written music . Fiddling is the act of playing the fiddle , and fiddlers are musicians that play it . Among musical styles , fiddling tends to produce rhythms that focus on dancing , with associated quick note changes , whereas classical music tends to contain more vibrato and sustained notes . Fiddling is also open to improvisation and embellishment with ornamentation at the player 's discretion - in contrast to orchestral performances , which adhere to the composer 's notes to reproduce a work faithfully . It is less common for a classically trained violinist to play folk music , but today , many fiddlers ( e.g. , Alasdair Fraser , Brittany Haas , Alison Krauss , etc . ) have classical training .

  "/wiki/Guitar": "The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that usually has six strings . It is typically played with both hands by strumming or plucking the strings with either a guitar pick or the fingers/fingernails of one hand , while simultaneously fretting ( pressing the strings against the frets ) with the fingers of the other hand . The sound of the vibrating strings is projected either acoustically , by means of the hollow chamber of the guitar ( for an acoustic guitar ) , or through an electrical amplifier and a speaker . The guitar is a type of chordophone , traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut , nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning . The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern , the vihuela , the four-course Renaissance guitar , and the five-course baroque guitar , all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument . There are three main types of modern acoustic guitar : the classical guitar ( Spanish guitar/nylon-string guitar ) , the steel-string acoustic guitar , and the archtop guitar , which is sometimes called a jazz guitar . The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings ' vibration , amplified by the hollow body of the guitar , which acts as a resonating chamber . The classical guitar is often played as a solo instrument using a comprehensive finger-picking technique where each string is plucked individually by the player 's fingers , as opposed to being strummed . The term finger-picking can also refer to a specific tradition of folk , blues , bluegrass , and country guitar playing in the United States . The acoustic bass guitar is a low-pitched instrument that is one octave below a regular guitar . Electric guitars , introduced in the 1930s , use an amplifier and a loudspeaker that both makes the sound of the instrument loud enough for the performers and audience to hear , and , given that it produces an electric signal when played , that can electronically manipulate and shape the tone using an equalizer ( e.g. , bass and treble tone controls ) and a huge variety of electronic effects units , the most commonly used ones being distortion ( or overdrive ) and reverb . Early amplified guitars employed a hollow body , but solid wood guitars began to dominate during the 1960s and 1970s , as they are less prone to unwanted acoustic feedback howls .",

  "/wiki/Hardanger_fiddle": "A Hardanger fiddle ( or in Norwegian : hardingfele ) is a traditional stringed instrument used originally to play the music of Norway . In modern designs , this type of fiddle is very similar to the violin , though with eight or nine strings ( rather than four as on a standard violin ) and thinner wood . Four of the strings are strung and played like a violin , while the rest , aptly named understrings or sympathetic strings , resonate under the influence of the other four . The Hardingfele is used mainly in the southwest part of Norway , whereas the ordinary violin ( called flatfele - 'flat fiddle ' or vanlig fele - 'common fiddle ' ) is found elsewhere . The Hardingfele is used for dancing , accompanied by rhythmic loud foot stomping . It was also traditional for the fiddler to lead the bridal procession to the church . The instrument is often highly decorated , with a carved animal ( usually a dragon or the Lion of Norway ) or a carved woman 's head as part of the scroll at the top of the pegbox , extensive mother of pearl inlay on the tailpiece and fingerboard , and black ink decorations called 'rosing ' on the body of the instrument . Sometimes pieces of bone are used to decorate the pegs and the edges of the instrument . The earliest known example of the hardingfele is from 1651 , made by Ole Jonsen Jaastad in Hardanger , Norway . Originally , the instrument had a rounder , narrower body .

Hawaii 's musical contributions to the music of the United States are out of proportion to the state 's small size . Styles like slack-key guitar are well known worldwide , while Hawaiian-tinged music is a frequent part of Hollywood soundtracks . Hawaii also made a contribution to country music with the introduction of the steel guitar . In addition , the music which began to be played by Puerto Ricans in Hawaii in the early 1900s is called cachi cachi music , on the islands of Hawaii . Music of Hawaiian people is largely religious in nature , and includes chanting and dance music .

  "/wiki/Hawaiian_language": "The Hawaiian language ( Hawaiian : \u02bb\u014clelo Hawai\u02bbi , pronounced [ \u0294o\u02d0\u02c8l\u025blo h\u0259\u02c8v\u0250j\u0294i ] ) is a Polynesian language that takes its name from Hawai\u02bbi , the largest island in the tropical North Pacific archipelago where it developed . Hawaiian , along with English , is an official language of the State of Hawaii . King Kamehameha III established the first Hawaiian-language constitution in 1839 and 1840 . For various reasons , including territorial legislation establishing English as the official language in schools , the number of native speakers of Hawaiian gradually decreased during the period from the 1830s to the 1950s . Hawaiian was essentially displaced by English on six of seven inhabited islands . In 2001 , native speakers of Hawaiian amounted to less than 0.1% of the statewide population . Linguists were unsure if Hawaiian and other endangered languages would survive . [ failed verification ] Nevertheless , from around 1949 to the present day , there has been a gradual increase in attention to and promotion of the language . Public Hawaiian-language immersion preschools called P\u016bnana Leo were established in 1984 ; other immersion schools followed soon after that . The first students to start in immersion preschool have now graduated from college and many are fluent Hawaiian speakers . The federal government has acknowledged this development . For example , the Hawaiian National Park Language Correction Act of 2000 changed the names of several national parks in Hawai\u02bbi , observing the Hawaiian spelling ."
