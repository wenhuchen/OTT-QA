Mannock was a pioneer of fighter aircraft tactics in aerial warfare . At the time of his death he had amassed 61 aerial victories , making him the fifth highest scoring pilot of the war . Mannock was born in 1887 to an English father , Edward Mannock , and an Irish mother . Mannock 's father served in the British Army and the family moved to India when Mannock was a small child . Mannock was sickly and developed several ailments in his formative years . Upon his return to England he became a fervent supporter of Irish nationalism and the Irish Home Rule movement but became a member of the Independent Labour Party . In 1914 Mannock was working as a telephone engineer in Turkey . After the Ottoman Empire 's entry into the war on the side of the Central Powers he was interned . Mannock was badly treated and soon fell ill. Turkish authorities repatriated him to Britain believing him to be unfit for war service .

  "/wiki/First_World_War": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",
  "/wiki/Western_Front_(World_War_I)": "The Western Front was the main theatre of war during the First World War . Following the outbreak of war in August 1914 , the German Army opened the Western Front by invading Luxembourg and Belgium , then gaining military control of important industrial regions in France . The tide of the advance was dramatically turned with the Battle of the Marne . Following the Race to the Sea , both sides dug in along a meandering line of fortified trenches , stretching from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier with France , which changed little except during early 1917 and in 1918 . Between 1915 and 1917 there were several offensives along this front . The attacks employed massive artillery bombardments and massed infantry advances . Entrenchments , machine gun emplacements , barbed wire and artillery repeatedly inflicted severe casualties during attacks and counter-attacks and no significant advances were made . Among the most costly of these offensives were the Battle of Verdun , in 1916 , with a combined 700,000 casualties ( estimated ) , the Battle of the Somme , also in 1916 , with more than a million casualties ( estimated ) , and the Battle of Passchendaele ( Third Battle of Ypres ) , in 1917 , with 487,000 casualties ( estimated ) . To break the deadlock of trench warfare on the Western Front , both sides tried new military technology , including poison gas , aircraft , and tanks . The adoption of better tactics and the cumulative weakening of the armies in the west led to the return of mobility in 1918 . The German Spring Offensive of 1918 was made possible by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk that ended the war of the Central Powers against Russia and Romania on the Eastern Front . Using short , intense hurricane bombardments and infiltration tactics , the German armies moved nearly 100 kilometres ( 60 miles ) to the west , the deepest advance by either side since 1914 , but the result was indecisive .",

It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war .
