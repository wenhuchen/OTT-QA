  "/wiki/USS_Albacore_(AGSS-569)": "USS Albacore ( AGSS-569 ) was a unique research submarine that pioneered the American version of the teardrop hull form ( sometimes referred to as an Albacore hull ) of modern submarines . The revolutionary design was derived from extensive hydrodynamic and wind tunnel testing , with an emphasis on underwater speed and maneuverability . She was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the albacore . Her keel was laid down on 15 March 1952 by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard of Kittery , Maine . She was launched on 1 August 1953 , sponsored by Mrs. J. E. Jowers , the widow of Chief Motor Machinist 's Mate Arthur L. Stanton , lost with the second Albacore ( SS-218 ) , and commissioned on 6 December 1953 with Lieutenant Commander Kenneth C. Gummerson in command . The effectiveness of submarines in World War II convinced both the Soviets and the United States Navy that undersea warfare would play an even more important role in coming conflicts and dictated development of superior submarines . The advent of nuclear power nourished the hope that such warships could be produced . The effort to achieve this goal involved the development of a nuclear propulsion system and the design of a streamlined submarine hull capable of optimum submerged performance .",

  "/wiki/Submarine": "A submarine ( or sub ) is a watercraft capable of independent operation underwater . It differs from a submersible , which has more limited underwater capability . It is also sometimes used historically or colloquially to refer to remotely operated vehicles and robots , as well as medium-sized or smaller vessels , such as the midget submarine and the wet sub . Submarines are referred to as boats rather than ships irrespective of their size . Although experimental submarines had been built before , submarine design took off during the 19th century , and they were adopted by several navies . Submarines were first widely used during World War I ( 1914-1918 ) , and are now used in many navies large and small . Military uses include attacking enemy surface ships ( merchant and military ) , or other submarines , aircraft carrier protection , blockade running , ballistic missile submarines as part of a nuclear strike force , reconnaissance , conventional land attack ( for example using a cruise missile ) , and covert insertion of special forces . Civilian uses for submarines include marine science , salvage , exploration and facility inspection and maintenance . Submarines can also be modified to perform more specialized functions such as search-and-rescue missions or undersea cable repair . Submarines are also used in tourism and undersea archaeology . Most large submarines consist of a cylindrical body with hemispherical ( or conical ) ends and a vertical structure , usually located amidships , which houses communications and sensing devices as well as periscopes . In modern submarines , this structure is the sail in American usage and fin in European usage .",

  "/wiki/Shaker": "The United Society of Believers in Christ 's Second Appearing , more commonly known as the Shakers , is a millenarian nontrinitarian restorationist Christian sect founded circa 1747 in England and then organized in the United States in the 1780s . They were initially known as Shaking Quakers because of their ecstatic behavior during worship services . Espousing egalitarian ideals , women took on spiritual leadership roles alongside men , including founding leaders such as Jane Wardley , Mother Ann Lee , and Mother Lucy Wright . The Shakers emigrated from England and settled in Revolutionary colonial America , with an initial settlement at Watervliet , New York ( present-day Colonie ) in 1774 . They practice a celibate and communal lifestyle , pacifism , uniform charismatic worship , and their model of equality of the sexes , which they institutionalized in their society in the 1780s . They are also known for their simple living , architecture , technological innovation , and furniture . During the mid-19th century , an Era of Manifestations resulted in a period of dances , gift drawings , and gift songs inspired by spiritual revelations . At its peak in the mid-19th century , there were 4,000-6,000 Shaker believers living in 18 major communities and numerous smaller , often short-lived , communities . External and internal societal changes in the mid- and late-19th century resulted in the thinning of the Shaker community as members left or died with few converts to the faith to replace them . By 1920 , there were only 12 Shaker communities remaining in the United States . As of 2019 [ update ] , there is only one active Shaker village : Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village , in Maine .

Orozco painted the mural during the same time his fellow muralist , Diego Rivera , was working on his murals at the Rockefeller Center in New York .

[ N 1 ] After 1765 , growing constitutional and political differences strained the relationship between Great Britain and its American colonies . Patriot protests against taxation without representation followed the Stamp Act and escalated into boycotts , which culminated in 1773 with the Sons of Liberty destroying a shipment of tea in Boston Harbor . Britain responded by closing Boston Harbor and passing a series of punitive measures against Massachusetts Bay Colony . Massachusetts colonists responded with the Suffolk Resolves , and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown . Twelve colonies formed a Continental Congress ( with the exception of Georgia ) to coordinate their resistance , establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power . British attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia in Concord led to open combat and a British defeat on April 19 , 1775 . Militia forces then besieged Boston , forcing a British evacuation in March 1776 , and Congress appointed George Washington to command the Continental Army . Concurrently , the Americans failed decisively in an attempt to invade Quebec and raise insurrection against the British . On July 2 , 1776 , the Second Continental Congress voted for independence , issuing its declaration on July 4 .

  "/wiki/Georgian_architecture": "Georgian architecture is the name given in most English-speaking countries to the set of architectural styles current between 1714 and 1830 . It is eponymous for the first four British monarchs of the House of Hanover - George I , George II , George III , and George IV - who reigned in continuous succession from August 1714 to June 1830 . The style was revived in the late 19th century in the United States as Colonial Revival architecture and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian architecture ; in both it is also called Georgian Revival architecture . In the United States the term Georgian is generally used to describe all buildings from the period , regardless of style ; in Britain it is generally restricted to buildings that are architectural in intention , and have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the period , though that covers a wide range . The Georgian style is highly variable , but marked by symmetry and proportion based on the classical architecture of Greece and Rome , as revived in Renaissance architecture . Ornament is also normally in the classical tradition , but typically restrained , and sometimes almost completely absent on the exterior . The period brought the vocabulary of classical architecture to smaller and more modest buildings than had been the case before , replacing English vernacular architecture ( or becoming the new vernacular style ) for almost all new middle-class homes and public buildings by the end of the period . Georgian architecture is characterized by its proportion and balance ; simple mathematical ratios were used to determine the height of a window in relation to its width or the shape of a room as a double cube . Regularity , as with ashlar ( uniformly cut ) stonework , was strongly approved , imbuing symmetry and adherence to classical rules : the lack of symmetry , where Georgian additions were added to earlier structures remaining visible , was deeply felt as a flaw , at least before John Nash began to introduce it in a variety of styles . Regularity of housefronts along a street was a desirable feature of Georgian town planning . Until the start of the Gothic Revival in the early 19th century , Georgian designs usually lay within the Classical orders of architecture and employed a decorative vocabulary derived from ancient Rome or Greece .",

He alienated anti-slavery groups by championing and signing the Kansas-Nebraska Act and enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act , yet he failed to stem conflict between North and South , setting the stage for Southern secession and the American Civil War . Pierce was born in New Hampshire , and served in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate until he resigned from the Senate in 1842 . His private law practice was a success , and he was appointed New Hampshire 's U.S. Attorney in 1845 . He took part in the Mexican-American War as a brigadier general in the Army . He was seen by Democrats as a compromise candidate uniting northern and southern interests and was nominated as the party 's candidate for president on the 49th ballot at the 1852 Democratic National Convention . He and running mate William R. King easily defeated the Whig Party ticket of Winfield Scott and William A. Graham in the 1852 presidential election . As president , Pierce simultaneously attempted to enforce neutral standards for civil service while also satisfying the diverse elements of the Democratic Party with patronage , an effort which largely failed and turned many in his party against him . He was a Young America expansionist who signed the Gadsden Purchase of land from Mexico and led a failed attempt to acquire Cuba from Spain . He signed trade treaties with Britain and Japan , while his Cabinet reformed their departments and improved accountability , but these successes were overshadowed by political strife during his presidency . His popularity declined sharply in the Northern states after he supported the Kansas-Nebraska Act , which nullified the Missouri Compromise , while many whites in the South continued to support him .
