Born into an upper-middle-class household , Potter was educated by governesses and grew up isolated from other children . She had numerous pets and spent holidays in Scotland and the Lake District , developing a love of landscape , flora , and fauna , all of which she closely observed and painted . Potters study and watercolours of fungi led to her being widely respected in the field of mycology . In her thirties , Potter self-published the highly successful children 's book The Tale of Peter Rabbit . Following this , Potter began writing and illustrating children 's books full-time . In all , Potter wrote thirty books ; the best known being her twenty-three children 's tales .

  "/wiki/The_Tale_of_Two_Bad_Mice": "The Tale of Two Bad Mice is a children 's book written and illustrated by Beatrix Potter , and published by Frederick Warne & Co. in September 1904 .

While the tale was being developed , Potter and Warne fell in love and became engaged , much to the annoyance of Potter 's parents , who were grooming their daughter to be a permanent resident and housekeeper in their London home . The tale is about two mice who vandalize a doll 's house . After finding the food on the dining room table made of plaster , they smash the dishes , throw the doll clothing out the window , tear the bolster , and carry off a number of articles to their mouse-hole . When the little girl who owns the doll 's house discovers the destruction , she positions a policeman doll outside the front door to ward off any future depredation . The two mice atone for their crime spree by putting a crooked sixpence in the doll 's stocking on Christmas Eve and sweeping the house every morning with a dust-pan and broom . The tale 's themes of rebellion , insurrection , and individualism reflect not only Potter 's desire to free herself of her domineering parents and build a home of her own , but her fears about independence and her frustrations with Victorian domesticity . The book was critically well received and brought Potter her first fan letter from America .

Blyton 's books are still enormously popular , and have been translated into 90 languages . She wrote on a wide range of topics including education , natural history , fantasy , mystery , and biblical narratives and is best remembered today for her Noddy , Famous Five and Secret Seven series . Her first book , Child Whispers , a 24-page collection of poems , was published in 1922 . Following the commercial success of her early novels such as Adventures of the Wishing-Chair ( 1937 ) and The Enchanted Wood ( 1939 ) , Blyton went on to build a literary empire , sometimes producing fifty books a year in addition to her prolific magazine and newspaper contributions . Her writing was unplanned and sprang largely from her unconscious mind : she typed her stories as events unfolded before her . The sheer volume of her work and the speed with which it was produced led to rumours that Blyton employed an army of ghost writers , a charge she vigorously denied . Blyton 's work became increasingly controversial among literary critics , teachers and parents from the 1950s onwards , because of the alleged unchallenging nature of her writing and the themes of her books , particularly the Noddy series . Some libraries and schools banned her works , which the BBC had refused to broadcast from the 1930s until the 1950s because they were perceived to lack literary merit . Her books have been criticised as being elitist , sexist , racist , xenophobic and at odds with the more liberal environment emerging in post-war Britain , but they have continued to be best-sellers since her death in 1968 . Blyton felt she had a responsibility to provide her readers with a strong moral framework , so she encouraged them to support worthy causes . In particular , through the clubs she set up or supported , she encouraged and organised them to raise funds for animal and paediatric charities .",

Loved mainly by girls , this character 's memory has lived on . The original books ( published by Brockhampton Press of Leicester at a price of one shilling ) are highly collectable , perhaps because few remain in reasonable condition . The books were immensely popular in Blyton 's days and eventually sold one million copies . [ dubious - discuss ]"
