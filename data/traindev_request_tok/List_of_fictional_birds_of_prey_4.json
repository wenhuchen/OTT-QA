The Peregrine is renowned for its speed , reaching over 320 km/h ( 200 mph ) during its characteristic hunting stoop ( high-speed dive ) , making it the fastest bird in the world and the fastest member of the animal kingdom . According to a National Geographic TV program , the highest measured speed of a peregrine falcon is 389 km/h ( 242 mph ) .

As an analogy , film is a series of still images projected onto a screen . Those still images need to be changing at roughly 25 frames per second before humans see them as fluid and no longer as individual , discrete pictures . The film would have to be refreshing at 129 frames per second before peregrine falcons stopped seeing flashing , still images and started seeing fluid motion .
