  "/wiki/Asynchronous_transfer_mode": "Asynchronous Transfer Mode ( ATM ) is a telecommunications standard defined by ANSI and ITU ( formerly CCITT ) standards for carriage of user traffic , including telephony ( voice ) , data , and video signals . ATM was developed to meet the needs of the Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network , as defined in the late 1980s , and designed to integrate telecommunication networks . Additionally , it was designed for networks that must handle both traditional high-throughput data traffic ( e.g. , file transfers ) , and real-time , low-latency content such as voice and video . The reference model for ATM approximately maps to the three lowest layers of the ISO-OSI reference model : network layer , data link layer , and physical layer . ATM is a core protocol used over the SONET/SDH backbone of the public switched telephone network ( PSTN ) and Integrated Services Digital Network ( ISDN ) , but its use is declining in favour of all IP . ATM provides functionality that uses features of circuit switching and packet switching networks : ATM uses asynchronous time-division multiplexing , and encodes data into small , fixed-sized packets . In the ISO-OSI reference model data link layer ( layer 2 ) , the basic transfer units are generically called frames . In ATM these frames are of a fixed ( 53 octets or bytes ) length and specifically called cells . This differs from approaches such as the Internet Protocol or Ethernet that use variable sized packets and frames . ATM uses a connection-oriented model in which a virtual circuit must be established between two endpoints before the actual data exchange begins . These virtual circuits may be permanent , i.e . dedicated connections that are usually preconfigured by the service provider , or switched , i.e .",

  "/wiki/Optical_communications": "Optical communication , also known as optical telecommunication , is communication at a distance using light to carry information . It can be performed visually or by using electronic devices . The earliest basic forms of optical communication date back several millennia , while the earliest electrical device created to do so was the photophone , invented in 1880 . An optical communication system uses a transmitter , which encodes a message into an optical signal , a channel , which carries the signal to its destination , and a receiver , which reproduces the message from the received optical signal . When electronic equipment is not employed the 'receiver ' is a person visually observing and interpreting a signal , which may be either simple ( such as the presence of a beacon fire ) or complex ( such as lights using color codes or flashed in a Morse code sequence ) . Free-space optical communication has been deployed in space , while terrestrial forms are naturally limited by geography , weather and the availability of light . This article provides a basic introduction to different forms of optical communication .",

  "/wiki/Electret_microphone": "An electret microphone is a type of electrostatic capacitor-based microphone , which eliminates the need for a polarizing power supply by using a permanently charged material . An electret is a stable dielectric material with a permanently embedded static electric dipole moment ( which , due to the high resistance and chemical stability of the material , will not decay for hundreds of years ) . The name comes from electrostatic and magnet ; drawing analogy to the formation of a magnet by alignment of magnetic domains in a piece of iron . Electrets are commonly made by first melting a suitable dielectric material such as a plastic or wax that contains polar molecules , and then allowing it to re-solidify in a powerful electrostatic field . The polar molecules of the dielectric align themselves to the direction of the electrostatic field , producing a permanent electrostatic bias . Modern electret microphones use PTFE plastic , either in film or solute form , to form the electret .",

  "/wiki/Cryptography": "Cryptography or cryptology ( from Ancient Greek : \u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u03c0\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 , romanized : krypt\u00f3s hidden , secret ; and \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd graphein , to write , or -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 -logia , study , respectively ) is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries . More generally , cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages ; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality , data integrity , authentication , and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography . Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics , computer science , electrical engineering , communication science , and physics . Applications of cryptography include electronic commerce , chip-based payment cards , digital currencies , computer passwords , and military communications . Cryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption , the conversion of information from a readable state to apparent nonsense . The originator of an encrypted message shares the decoding technique only with intended recipients to preclude access from adversaries . The cryptography literature often uses the names Alice ( A ) for the sender , Bob ( B ) for the intended recipient , and Eve ( eavesdropper ) for the adversary . Since the development of rotor cipher machines in World War I and the advent of computers in World War II , the methods used to carry out cryptology have become increasingly complex and its application more widespread . Modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice ; cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions , making such algorithms hard to break in practice by any adversary . It is theoretically possible to break such a system , but it is infeasible to do so by any known practical means . These schemes are therefore termed computationally secure ; theoretical advances , e.g. , improvements in integer factorization algorithms , and faster computing technology require these solutions to be continually adapted . There exist information-theoretically secure schemes that provably can not be broken even with unlimited computing power - an example is the one-time pad - but these schemes are more difficult to use in practice than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure mechanisms .",

  "/wiki/Interferon": "Interferons ( IFNs , /\u02cc\u026ant\u0259r\u02c8f\u026a\u0259r\u0252n/ ) are a group of signaling proteins made and released by host cells in response to the presence of several viruses . In a typical scenario , a virus-infected cell will release interferons causing nearby cells to heighten their anti-viral defenses . IFNs belong to the large class of proteins known as cytokines , molecules used for communication between cells to trigger the protective defenses of the immune system that help eradicate pathogens . Interferons are named for their ability to interfere with viral replication by protecting cells from virus infections . IFNs also have various other functions : they activate immune cells , such as natural killer cells and macrophages ; they increase host defenses by up-regulating antigen presentation by virtue of increasing the expression of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) antigens . Certain symptoms of infections , such as fever , muscle pain and flu-like symptoms , are also caused by the production of IFNs and other cytokines . More than twenty distinct IFN genes and proteins have been identified in animals , including humans . They are typically divided among three classes : Type I IFN , Type II IFN , and Type III IFN . IFNs belonging to all three classes are important for fighting viral infections and for the regulation of the immune system .",
