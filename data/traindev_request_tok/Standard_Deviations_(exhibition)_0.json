  "/wiki/Matthew_Carter": "Matthew Carter ( born 1 October 1937 ) is a British type designer . A 2005 New Yorker profile described him as 'the most widely read man in the world ' by considering the amount of text set in his commonly used fonts . Carter 's career began in the early 1960s and has bridged all three major technologies used in type design : physical type , phototypesetting and digital font design , as well as the design of custom lettering . Carter 's most used fonts are the classic web fonts Verdana and Georgia and the Windows interface font Tahoma , as well as other designs including Bell Centennial , Miller and Galliard . He is the son of the English historian of printing Harry Carter ( 1901-1982 ) and cofounded Bitstream , one of the first major retailers of digital fonts . He lives in Cambridge , Massachusetts .",

  "/wiki/Caslon": "Caslon is the name given to serif typefaces designed by William Caslon I ( c. 1692-1766 ) in London , or inspired by his work . Caslon worked as an engraver of punches , the masters used to stamp the moulds or matrices used to cast metal type . He worked in the tradition of what is now called old-style serif letter design , that produced letters with a relatively organic structure resembling handwriting with a pen . Caslon established a tradition of engraving type in London , which previously had not been common , and was influenced by the imported Dutch Baroque typefaces that were popular in England at the time . His typefaces established a strong reputation for their quality and their attractive appearance , suitable for extended passages of text . The letterforms of Caslon 's roman , or upright type include an ' A ' with a concave hollow at top left and a ' G ' without a downwards-pointing spur at bottom right . The sides of the 'M ' are straight . The ' W ' has three terminals at the top and the ' b ' has a small tapered stroke ending at bottom left . Ascenders and descenders are relatively short and the level of stroke contrast is modest in body text sizes . However , Caslon created subtly different designs of letter at different sizes , with increasing levels of fine detail and sharp contrast in stroke weight at larger sizes . Caslon 's larger-size roman fonts have two serifs on the ' C ' , while his smaller-size versions have one half-arrow serif only at top right . In italic , Caslon 's h folds inwards and the A is sharply slanted .",

  "/wiki/P._Scott_Makela": "P. Scott Makela ( 1960-May 7 , 1999 ) was a graphic designer , multimedia designer and type designer . Among other work , he was especially noted for the design of Dead History , a postmodern typeface ( issued by the Emigre digital type foundry ) that combined features of a rounded sans serif typeface and a crisp neo-classical serif typeface . With the emergence of the personal computer in the mid-1980s , Makela was among the first to explore digital programs such as Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator . As a result , he created an idiosyncratic , original and highly controversial design aesthetic . In particular , his disregard for clean , modernist , problem-solving design agendas - synonymous with contemporary corporate graphic design - caused much debate among powerful , old-guard designers such as Massimo Vignelli , Paul Rand , and Henry Wolf . Makela graduated from Minneapolis College of Art and Design in 1985 . He developed a notable body of work of graphics , film and industrial soul music before his sudden death at the age of 39 in May 1999 . Commercial yet highly personal , Makela created visually aggressive work for clients such as Apple Computer , Rossignol , Nike and Sony . Projects such as Michael Jackson 's Scream and film titles for the seminal Fight Club defined a post-modern moment in graphic design , along with the work of contemporaries such as April Greiman and David Carson . In 1996 , Makela and partner and wife , Laurie Haycock Makela became designers-in-residence and co-directors of the graduate program in Graphic Design at Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan , where they also ran their studio , Words + Pictures for Business + Culture . Together with writer Lewis Blackwell they authored Whereishere ( Ginko Press ) an unprecedented print-website concept that broke from the orthodox approach to understanding two dimensional design . As a passionate snowboarder and mountain biker , Makela epitomized and expressed early 1990s American youth culture .",

The typeface is based on Style Type E of the Highway Gothic series of fonts , a signage alphabet drawn for the United States Federal Highway Administration by Dr. Theodore W. Forbes in 1949 .

Frere-Jones later designed another signage typeface , Whitney , published by Hoefler & Co. , that bears a resemblance to its ancestor while being less flamboyant and more economical for general print usage , in body copy , or in headlines . The terminals of ascending and descending strokes are cut at an angle to the stroke ( see lowercase t , and l ) , and on curved strokes ( see lowercase e and s ) , terminals are drawn at a 90\u00b0 angle to the stroke , positioning them at an angle to the baseline .

Explaining what drew him to Granjon 's work , Carter wrote on some of his more characteristic letterforms : looking at them , adjectives like 'spirited , 'tense ' and 'vigorous ' come to mind.it is easy to admire Granjon 's work . Mike Parker , Director of Typographic Development at Mergenthaler Linotype , had been inspired by seeing the types of Granjon at the Plantin-Moretus Museum in Antwerp .
