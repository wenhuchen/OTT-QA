The three largest towns are Llanelli , Carmarthen and Ammanford . Carmarthen is the county town and administrative centre . Carmarthenshire has been inhabited since prehistoric times . The county town was founded by the Romans , and the region was part of the Principality of Deheubarth in the High Middle Ages . After invasion by the Normans in the 12th and 13th centuries it was subjugated , along with other parts of Wales , by Edward I of England . There was further unrest in the early 15th century , when the Welsh rebelled under Owain Glynd\u0175r , and during the English Civil War . Carmarthenshire is mainly an agricultural county , apart from the southeastern part which was once heavily industrialised with coal mining , steel-making and tin-plating . In the north of the county , the woollen industry was very important in the 18th century . The economy depends on agriculture , forestry , fishing and tourism . West Wales was identified in 2014 as the worst-performing region in the United Kingdom along with the South Wales Valleys with the decline in its industrial base , and the low profitability of the livestock sector . Carmarthenshire , as a tourist destination , offers a wide range of outdoor activities .",

Carno currently has the largest production capacity in Wales . Originally consisting of 56 wind turbines each of 600 kilowatts ( kW ) maximum output , the combined maximum power of 33.6 megawatts ( MW ) made Carno the largest Wind Farm in Europe at the time of its construction .

During the second half of the first millennium Ceredigion was a minor kingdom . It has been administered as a county since 1282 . Welsh is spoken by more than half the population . Ceredigion is considered to be a centre of Welsh culture . The county is mainly rural with over 50 miles ( 80 km ) of coastline and a mountainous hinterland . The numerous sandy beaches and the long-distance Ceredigion Coast Path provide excellent views of Cardigan Bay . In the 18th and early 19th centuries , Cardiganshire had more industry than it does today ; Cardigan was the commercial centre of the county ; lead , silver and zinc were mined and Cardigan was the principal port of South Wales prior to the silting of its harbour . The economy became highly dependent on dairy farming and the rearing of livestock for the English market . During the 20th century , livestock farming became less profitable , and the county 's population declined as people moved to the more prosperous parts of Wales or emigrated . However , there has been a population increase caused by elderly people moving to the county for retirement , and various government initiatives have encouraged tourism and other alternative sources of income . Ceredigion 's population at the 2011 UK census was 75,900 .",
  "/wiki/Moel_Maelogen": "Moel Maelogan ( shown on O.S . maps as 'Maelogen ' , and also sometimes spelled 'Moelogan ' and 'M\u00e6logan ' ) is a hill ( summit height 424m ) on the western edge of Mynydd Hiraethog ( also known as the Denbigh Moors ) in north Wales , and overlooking the Conwy Valley . It is known mostly as the general location of a wind farm . The initial three turbines were erected in 2002 , and started generating in January 2003 ; each turbine is capable of producing 1300 kW . This scheme marked erection of the UK wind industry 's 1000th turbine and was initially welcomed , as it had been set up by three local farmers to boost their incomes , under the name of Cwmni Gwynt Teg ( Fair Wind Company ) . After commissioning , however , it was opposed by some , not least because , although not located in the Snowdonia National Park itself , the turbines are visible from many parts of it . Of the three turbines , two were owned and operated by the local farming co-operative ; the third was owned and operated by Energiekontor UK Ltd , the UK subsidiary of the German wind development company Energiekontor AG , which was instrumental in the finance and construction of the wind farm . The electricity produced goes to the local Llanrwst sub-station 4.5 km away , and is sold to the Non-Fossil Purchasing Agency . Under the project name of Ail Wynt ( Second Wind ) , Cwmni Gwynt Teg planned a further 11 turbines but this was rejected [ who ? ] . Despite further opposition an amended plan for an additional 9 turbines was passed , and these were built and commissioned in 2008 within a more compact area and at reduced height .

  "/wiki/North_Hoyle_Offshore_Wind_Farm": "North Hoyle Offshore Wind Farm is Wales ' first offshore wind farm , and the UK 's first major offshore renewable power project . Situated in Liverpool Bay , it commenced operation in 2003 . The first of the UK 's Round 1 offshore wind farms , North Hoyle covers an area of 10 square kilometres ( 3.9 sq mi ) , and is located approximately 7.5 kilometres ( 4.7 mi ) off the coast of North Wales , between the towns of Rhyl and Prestatyn . The Round 1 projects were intended to act as testbeds ; building the UK 's understanding of offshore wind power , whilst in total also providing well over 1,000 MW of green generating capacity for the UK . All of the Round 1 offshore wind farms were limited to a maximum area of 10 square kilometres ( 3.9 sq mi ) , and no more than 30 wind turbines . The wind farm 's 30 Vestas V80 Offshore wind turbines are each rated at 2 MW capacity , giving a maximum project output of 60 MW . At the time of installation this was the most powerful wind farm in the UK , producing sufficient electricity annually to power 50,000 homes . Between 2004 and 2010 , the capacity factor was between 33 and 36% . Independent surveys carried out for the operators of North Hoyle have shown that the wind farm is very popular among holidaymakers and local residents . An opinion poll carried out in 2003 , after its construction , showed that 73% of people expressed support for the project and only 5% opposed it . North Hoyle was developed , built and is operated by RWE npower renewables ( formerly National Wind Power ) ; npower renewables also own the neighbouring Rhyl Flats and Gwynt y M\u00f4r offshore wind farms .",
  "/wiki/Liverpool_Bay": "Liverpool Bay is a bay of the Irish Sea between northeast Wales , Cheshire , Lancashire and Merseyside to the east of the Irish Sea . The bay is a classic example of a region of freshwater influence . Liverpool Bay has historically suffered from reduced oxygen content from prior massive discharges of sewage sludge , according to C.Michael Hogan . The rivers Alt , Clwyd , Dee , Ribble and Mersey drain into the bay . The bay is littered with wrecks and has many dive sites . The bay also contains several oil and gas fields including the Douglas Complex , with a combined daily capacity ( January 2008 ) of 60,000 barrels . The UK 's first major offshore wind farm , North Hoyle , is located in the south of the bay , which is a busy shipping route to the Mersey Docks . The land area around the bay is occasionally referred to as the Liverpool Bay Area . Though the term is seen by some as a possible official alternative to Merseyside , it is more often used to describe a much wider area which may include the West Lancashire towns of Ormskirk and Skelmersdale to the north , St Helens and Warrington to the east and Chester plus North Wales to the south . In this sense , it is often promoted by local thinkers and urbanists to encourage regional co-operation in both economic and cultural terms . It is not recognised by the British Government as a strategic economic sub-region , however . Despite having its advocates , the term is still not particularly common in the area .",
