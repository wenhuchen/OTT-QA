  "/wiki/Balikpapan-class_landing_craft_heavy": "The Balikpapan class is a ship class of eight heavy landing craft ( officially Landing Craft , Heavy or LCH ) . All eight were originally laid down by Walkers Limited for the Australian Army in the early 1970s . A reorganisation of watercraft responsibilities in the Australian military meant the landing craft were to be operated by the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , with seven commissioned directly into RAN service during 1973 and 1974 , and lead ship Balikpapan transferred from the army to the navy . During the leadup to the independence of Papua New Guinea in 1975 , two of the vessels ( Salamaua and Buna ) were transferred to the new Papua New Guinea Defence Force ( PNGDF ) . During their careers , the Australian vessels have operated in support of Operation Navy Help Darwin in 1974-75 , Operation Bel Isi from 1997 to 2003 , INTERFET operations in 1999 and 2000 , and RAMSI operations from 2003 . The six remaining RAN vessels were paid off in the 2010s : Balikpapan , Betano , and Wewak in 2012 ; Brunei , Labuan , and Tarakan in 2014 . They are yet to be replaced in RAN service . As of 2013 , the two PNGDF vessels were active , and in 2014 , the former Labuan was transferred to Papua New Guinea as the training ship Lakekamu . Brunei and Tarakan were refitted and donated to the Philippine Navy in 2015 , commissioning as Ivatan and Batak . Three additional units of the class - decommissioned units former HMAS Balikpapan , HMAS Wewak and HMAS Betano - were loaded on a transport ship in March 2016 for transport to the Philippine Navy .",

The class was designed to operate in the shallow water of rivers and estuaries . All of the ships in the class are named for British place names that end with -ham . The parent firm that was responsible for supervising construction was Samuel White of Cowes , Isle of Wight . Unlike traditional minesweepers , they were not equipped for sweeping moored or magnetic mines . Their work was to locate individual mines and neutralise them . This was a then-new role , and the class was configured for working in the shallow water of rivers , estuaries and shipping channels . The class consisted of 93 ships , launched between 1954 and 1959 . HMS Inglesham was the first . They were built in three slightly different sub-groups , the first sub-group , the 26-group , is distinguished by pennant numbers 26xx , and the second and third sub-groups , the 27-group , are distinguished by pennant numbers 27xx .

Sixty Bathurst-class corvettes were built in eight Australian shipyards to an Australian design . 36 were constructed for the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , 20 were built on British Admiralty orders but manned and commissioned by the RAN , and 4 served in the Royal Indian Navy . Three more were ordered for construction in India , but were cancelled . Although designed for the anti-submarine and anti-mine role , the Bathursts operated as maids-of-all-work during the war ; serving as troop and supply transports , supporting amphibious landings , providing air defence for convoys and disabled ships , participating in shore bombardments , and undertaking hydrographic surveys . Three ships were lost during the war - one to Japanese air attack and two to collisions with friendly merchant ships - while a fourth struck a friendly mine while sweeping the Great Barrier Reef in 1947 and sank . After the war , the Admiralty ships were sold to the Turkish Navy , Royal Netherlands Navy , and civilian operators , while several RAN-owned vessels were transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy , temporarily reactivated to facilitate National Service Training , or sold to civilians . Four of the Netherlands Bathursts were sold onward to the Indonesian Navy , one of which was destroyed in 1956 by rebels opposing the 'Guided Democracy ' political system .

The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 , and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom , giving name to the class . In Canada , they were named for towns and cities , though they kept the same designation . Originally called a twin-screw corvette , the name frigate was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy . Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941 . The design was too big for the locks on the Lachine Canal so it was not built by the shipyards on the Great Lakes and therefore all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the West Coast or along the St. Lawrence River below Montreal . In all , Canada ordered the construction of 70 frigates , including ten for the Royal Navy , which transferred two to the United States Navy . Twelve were built in Australia for the RAN ( four to a modified design ) . After World War II , they found employment in many other navies the world over ; several RCN ships were sunk as breakwaters .

Such ships , with a limit of 10,000 tons , standard displacement and 8-inch calibre main guns may be referred to as treaty cruisers ( the term heavy cruiser was not defined until the London Naval Treaty of 1930 [ page needed ] ) . The thirteen Counties were built in the Kent , London and Norfolk sub-classes . They were the only 10,000-ton 8-inch gun , or A , cruisers that the Royal Navy built . The Counties are remembered for their distinctive three-funnel layout and service in all the major naval theatres of the Second World War . To extract more ships from the treaty limits , the navy planned to construct 8,250-ton B ships , six of which could be built in place of five Counties . The extra ship that this afforded was an attractive proposition for a navy that had the immense peacetime commitments of empire . [ page needed ] Peacetime economies and politics intervened and only two B-type cruisers were built , an 8-inch gun modified County design : the York class .

  "/wiki/Royal_Navy": "The Royal Navy ( RN ) is the United Kingdom 's naval warfare force . Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels .",
