  "/wiki/Playtime": "Playtime ( sometimes written PlayTime ) is a 1967 French-Italian comedy film directed by Jacques Tati . In Playtime , Tati again plays Monsieur Hulot , a character who had appeared in his earlier films Mon Oncle and Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot . As mentioned on the production documentary that accompanies the Criterion Collections DVD of the film , by 1964 Tati had grown ambivalent towards playing Hulot as a recurring central role . Unable to dispense with the popular character altogether , Hulot appears intermittently in Playtime , alternating between central and supporting roles . Playtime was made from 1964 through 1967 . Shot in 70 mm , the work is notable for its enormous set , which Tati had built specially for the film , as well as Tati 's trademark use of subtle , yet complex visual comedy supported by creative sound effects ; dialogue is frequently reduced to the level of background noise . Playtime is considered Tati 's masterpiece , as well as his most daring work . In 2012 , Playtime was 43rd in the British Film Institute 's critics ' list and 37th in their directors ' list of Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time .",
  "/wiki/Jacques_Tati": "Jacques Tati ( French : [ tati ] ; born Jacques Tatischeff , pronounced [ tati\u0283\u025bf ] ; 9 October 1907 - 5 November 1982 ) was a French mime , filmmaker , actor , and screenwriter . Throughout his long career , he worked as a comic actor , writer , and director . In a poll conducted by Entertainment Weekly of the Greatest Movie Directors , Tati was voted the 46th greatest of all time . With only six feature-length films to his credit as director , he directed fewer films than any other director on this list of 50 . Tati 's Playtime ( 1967 ) ranked 43rd in the 2012 Sight & Sound critics ' poll of the greatest films ever made . As David Bellos puts it , Tati , from l'Ecole des facteurs to Playtime , is the epitome of what an auteur is ( in film theory ) supposed to be : the controlling mind behind a vision of the world on film .",
