Corazon Aquino was the most prominent figure of the 1986 People Power Revolution , which ended the 21-year rule of President Ferdinand Marcos . She was named Time magazine 's Woman of the Year in 1986 . Prior to this , she had not held any elective office . A self plain housewife , she was married to Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. , the staunchest critic of President Marcos . She emerged as leader of the opposition after her husband was assassinated on 21 August 1983 upon returning to the Philippines from exile in the United States . In late 1985 , Marcos called for a snap election , and Aquino ran for president with former senator Salvador Laurel as her running mate for vice president . After the election held on 7 February 1986 , the Batasang Pambansa proclaimed Marcos and his running mate Arturo Tolentino as the winners ; allegations were made of electoral fraud , with Aquino calling for massive civil disobedience actions . Defections from the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the support of the local Catholic hierarchy led to the People Power Revolution that ousted Marcos and secured Aquino 's accession on 25 February 1986 . As President , Aquino oversaw the promulgation of the 1987 Constitution , which limited the powers of the Presidency and re-established the bicameral Congress . Her administration provided strong emphasis on and concern for civil liberties and human rights , and on peace talks to resolve the ongoing Communist insurgency and Islamist secession movements . Her economic policies centered on restoring economic health and confidence and focused on creating a market-oriented and socially responsible economy .",

  "/wiki/Honorary_degree": "An honorary degree [ note 1 ] is an academic degree for which a university ( or other degree-awarding institution ) has waived the usual requirements , such as matriculation , residence , a dissertation , and the passing of comprehensive examinations . It is also known by the Latin phrases honoris causa ( for the sake of the honour ) or ad honorem ( to the honour ) . The degree is typically a doctorate or , less commonly , a master 's degree , and may be awarded to someone who has no prior connection with the academic institution or no previous postsecondary education . An example of identifying a recipient of this award is as follows : Doctorate in Business Administration ( Hon . Causa ) . The degree is often conferred as a way of honouring a distinguished visitor 's contributions to a specific field or to society in general . It is sometimes recommended that such degrees be listed in one 's curriculum vitae ( CV ) as an award , and not in the education section . With regard to the use of this honorific , the policies of institutions of higher education generally ask that recipients refrain from adopting the misleading title and that a recipient of an honorary doctorate should restrict the use of the title Dr before their name to any engagement with the institution of higher education in question and not within the broader community . Rev . Theodore Hesburgh held the record for most honorary degrees , having been awarded 150 during his lifetime .",

A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries .

Independence from Spain was achieved in 1819 , but by 1830 the Gran Colombia Federation was dissolved , with what is now Colombia and Panama emerging as the Republic of New Granada . The new sovereign state experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation ( 1858 ) , and then the United States of Colombia ( 1863 ) , before the Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886 .

  "/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy": "A Doctor of Philosophy ( PhD , Ph.D. , or DPhil ; Latin philosophiae doctor or doctor philosophiae ) is the highest university degree that is conferred after a course of study by universities in most countries . PhDs are awarded for programs across the whole breadth of academic fields . As an earned research degree , those studying for a PhD are usually required to produce original research that expands the boundaries of knowledge , normally in the form of a thesis or dissertation , and defend their work against experts in the field . The completion of a PhD is often a requirement for employment as a university professor , researcher , or scientist in many fields . Individuals who have earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree may , in many jurisdictions , use the title Doctor ( often abbreviated Dr or Dr. ) with their name , although the proper etiquette associated with this usage may also be subject to the professional ethics of their own scholarly field , culture , or society . Those who teach at universities or work in academic , educational , or research fields are usually addressed by this title professionally and socially in a salutation or conversation . Alternatively , holders may use post-nominal letters such as Ph.D. , PhD , or DPhil ( depending on the awarding institution ) . It is , however , considered incorrect to use both the title and post-nominals at the same time . The specific requirements to earn a PhD degree vary considerably according to the country , institution , and time period , from entry-level research degrees to higher doctorates . During the studies that lead to the degree , the student is called a doctoral student or PhD student ; a student who has completed all their coursework and comprehensive examinations and is working on their thesis/dissertation is sometimes known as a doctoral candidate or PhD candidate ( see : all but dissertation ) . A student attaining this level may be granted a Candidate of Philosophy degree at some institutions or may be granted a master 's degree en route to the doctoral degree .

Pedagogy , taken as an academic discipline , is the study of how knowledge and skills are imparted in an educational context , and it considers the interactions that take place during learning . Both the theory and practice of pedagogy vary greatly , as they reflect different social , political , and cultural contexts . Pedagogy is often described as the act of teaching . The pedagogy adopted by teachers shapes their actions , judgments , and other teaching strategies by taking into consideration theories of learning , understandings of students and their needs , and the backgrounds and interests of individual students . Its aims may range from furthering liberal education ( the general development of human potential ) to the narrower specifics of vocational education ( the imparting and acquisition of specific skills ) . Conventional western pedagogies view the teacher as knowledge holder and student as the recipient of knowledge ( described by Paulo Freire as banking methods ) , but theories of pedagogy increasingly identify the student as an agent , and the teacher as a facilitator . Instructive strategies are governed by the pupil 's background knowledge and experience , situation , and environment , as well as learning goals set by the student and teacher . One example would be the Socratic method . The teaching of adults , as a specific group , is referred to as andragogy .",
