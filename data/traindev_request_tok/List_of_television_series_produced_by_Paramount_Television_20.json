  "/wiki/The_Little_Rascals": "Our Gang ( known subsequently to television syndication as The Little Rascals or Hal Roach 's Rascals ) is an American series of comedy short films chronicling a group of poor neighborhood children and their adventures . Created by comedy producer and studio executive Hal Roach , the series was produced in various forms from 1922 to 1944 and is noted for showing children behaving in a relatively natural way . Roach and original director Robert F. McGowan worked to film the unaffected , raw nuances apparent in regular children rather than have them imitate adult acting styles . The series broke new ground by portraying white and black children interacting as equals . The franchise began in 1922 as a series of silent short subjects produced by the Roach studio and released by Path\u00e9 Exchange . Roach changed distributors from Path\u00e9 to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ( MGM ) in 1927 , and the series entered its most popular period after converting to sound in 1929 . Production continued at the Roach studio until 1938 , when the series was sold to MGM , which produced the comedies until 1944 . Across 220 short films and a feature-film spin-off , General Spanky , the Our Gang series featured over 41 child actors as regular members of cast . As MGM retained the rights to the Our Gang trademark following their purchase of the production rights , the 80 Roach-produced talkies were syndicated for television under the title The Little Rascals beginning in 1955 . Roach 's The Little Rascals package ( now owned by CBS Television Distribution ) and MGM 's Our Gang package ( now owned by Turner Entertainment and distributed by Warner Bros. Television ) have since remained in syndication . New productions based on the shorts have been made over the years , including a 1994 feature film , The Little Rascals , released by Universal Pictures .",
  "/wiki/Broadcast_syndication": "Broadcasting syndication is the license to broadcast television programs and radio programs by multiple television stations and radio stations , without going through a broadcast network . It is common in the United States where broadcast programming is scheduled by television networks with local independent affiliates . Syndication is less of a practice in the rest of the world , as most countries have centralized networks or television stations without local affiliates . Shows can be syndicated internationally , although this is less common . The three main types of syndication are first-run syndication , which is programming that is broadcast for the first time as a syndicated show and is made specifically to sell directly into syndication ; off-network syndication ( colloquially called a rerun ) , which is the licensing of a program that was originally run on network TV or in some cases , first-run syndication ; and public broadcasting syndication .",

The company is headquartered at the CBS Building in New York City with major production facilities and operations in New York City ( at the CBS Broadcast Center ) and Los Angeles ( at CBS Television City and the CBS Studio Center ) . CBS is sometimes referred to as the Eye Network , in reference to the company 's trademark symbol , in use since 1951 . It has also been called the Tiffany Network , alluding to the perceived high quality of CBS programming during the tenure of William S. Paley . It can also refer to some of CBS 's first demonstrations of color television , which were held in a former Tiffany & Co. building in New York City in 1950 . The network has its origins in United Independent Broadcasters Inc. , a collection of 16 radio stations purchased by Paley in 1928 and renamed the Columbia Broadcasting System . Under Paley 's guidance , CBS would first become one of the largest radio networks in the United States , and eventually one of the Big Three American broadcast television networks . In 1974 CBS dropped its former full name and became known simply as CBS , Inc . The Westinghouse Electric Corporation acquired the network in 1995 , renamed its corporate entity to the current CBS Broadcasting , Inc. in 1997 , and eventually adopted the name of the company it had acquired to become CBS Corporation . In 2000 CBS came under the control of the first Viacom , which was formed as a spin-off of CBS in 1971 . In late 2005 , Viacom split itself into two separate companies and re-established CBS Corporation through the spin-off of its broadcast television , radio , and select cable television and non-broadcasting assets , with the CBS television network at its core . CBS Corporation was controlled by Sumner Redstone through National Amusements , which also controlled the second Viacom until December 4 , 2019 , when the two separated companies agreed to re-merge to become the new single entity known as ViacomCBS .",
