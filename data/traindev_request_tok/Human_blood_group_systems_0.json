  "/wiki/International_Society_of_Blood_Transfusion": "The International Society of Blood Transfusion ( ISBT ) is a scientific society , founded in 1935 , which aims to promote the study of blood transfusion , and to spread the know-how about the manner in which blood transfusion medicine and science best can serve the patient 's interests . The society 's central office is in Amsterdam , and there are around 1700 members in 97 countries . Currently , the President is Martin L. Olsson . The Society organizes an international congress every other even year and two regional congresses in odd years , one in Europe and one in Asia . ISBT advocates standardisation and harmonisation in the field of blood transfusion . The other major impact on the transfusion community is the classification of various Human blood group systems under a common nomenclature . ISBT 's coordination also extends to obtaining donors with rare antigens , a process that often involves international searches , and a common terminology is critical to that process .",
  "/wiki/Epitope": "An epitope , also known as antigenic determinant , is the part of an antigen that is recognized by the immune system , specifically by antibodies , B cells , or T cells . For example , the epitope is the specific piece of the antigen to which an antibody binds . The part of an antibody that binds to the epitope is called a paratope . Although epitopes are usually non-self proteins , sequences derived from the host that can be recognized ( as in the case of autoimmune diseases ) are also epitopes . The epitopes of protein antigens are divided into two categories , conformational epitopes and linear epitopes , based on their structure and interaction with the paratope . Conformational and linear epitopes interact with the paratope based on the 3-D conformation adopted by the epitope , which is determined by the surface features of the involved epitope residues and the shape or tertiary structure of other segments of the antigen . A conformational epitope is formed by the 3-D conformation adopted by the interaction of discontiguous amino acid residues . In contrast , a linear epitope is formed by the 3-D conformation adopted by the interaction of contiguous amino acid residues . A linear epitope is not determined solely by the primary structure of the involved amino acids . Residues that flank such amino acid residues , as well as more distant amino acid residues of the antigen affect the ability of the primary structure residues to adopt the epitope 's 3-D conformation . The proportion of epitopes that are conformational is unknown . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/Chromosome": "A chromosome is a deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) molecule with part or all of the genetic material ( genome ) of an organism . Most eukaryotic chromosomes include packaging proteins which , aided by chaperone proteins , bind to and condense the DNA molecule to prevent it from becoming an unmanageable tangle . This three-dimensional genome structure plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation . Chromosomes are normally visible under a light microscope only when the cell is undergoing the metaphase of cell division ( where all chromosomes are aligned in the center of the cell in their condensed form ) . Before this happens , every chromosome is copied once ( S phase ) , and the copy is joined to the original by a centromere , resulting either in an X-shaped structure ( pictured here ) if the centromere is located in the middle of the chromosome or a two-arm structure if the centromere is located near one of the ends . The original chromosome and the copy are now called sister chromatids . During metaphase the X-shape structure is called a metaphase chromosome . In this highly condensed form chromosomes are easiest to distinguish and study . In animal cells , chromosomes reach their highest compaction level in anaphase during chromosome segregation . Chromosomal recombination during meiosis and subsequent sexual reproduction play a significant role in genetic diversity . If these structures are manipulated incorrectly , through processes known as chromosomal instability and translocation , the cell may undergo mitotic catastrophe . Usually , this will make the cell initiate apoptosis leading to its own death , but sometimes mutations in the cell hamper this process and thus cause progression of cancer .",
  "/wiki/ABO_blood_group_system": "The ABO blood group system is used to denote the presence of one , both , or neither of the A and B antigens on erythrocytes . In human blood transfusions it is the most important of the 36 different blood type ( or group ) classification systems currently recognized . A very rare ( in modern medicine ) mismatch in this , or any other serotype , can cause a serious , potentially fatal , adverse reaction after a transfusion , or a contra-indicated immune response to an organ transplant . The associated anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually IgM antibodies , which are produced in the first years of life by sensitization to environmental substances , such as food , bacteria , and viruses . The ABO blood types were discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1901 , for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930 . ABO blood types are also present in some other animals such as rodents and apes , including chimpanzees , bonobos , and gorillas .",

  "/wiki/Rh_blood_group_system": "The Rh blood group system is one of 36 known human blood group systems . It is the second most important blood group system , after the ABO blood group system . The Rh blood group system consists of 49 defined blood group antigens , among which the five antigens D , C , c , E , and e are the most important . There is no d antigen . Rh ( D ) status of an individual is normally described with a positive or negative suffix after the ABO type ( e.g. , someone who is A Positive has the A antigen and the Rh ( D ) antigen , whereas someone who is A Negative lacks the Rh ( D ) antigen ) . The terms Rh factor , Rh positive , and Rh negative refer to the Rh ( D ) antigen only . Antibodies to Rh antigens can be involved in hemolytic transfusion reactions and antibodies to the Rh ( D ) and Rh ( c ) antigens confer significant risk of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn . The term Rh was originally an abbreviation of Rhesus factor . It was discovered in 1937 by Karl Landsteiner and Alexander S. Wiener , who , at the time , believed it to be a similar antigen found in rhesus monkey red blood cells . It was subsequently learned the human factor is not identical to the rhesus monkey factor , but by then , Rhesus Group and like terms were already in widespread , worldwide use . Thus , notwithstanding it is a misnomer , the term survives ( e.g. , rhesus blood group system and the obsolete terms rhesus factor , rhesus positive , and rhesus negative - all three of which actually refer specifically and only to the Rh D factor and are thus misleading when unmodified ) .

  "/wiki/Hemolytic_disease_of_the_newborn_(anti-Kell)": "Hemolytic disease of the newborn ( anti-Kell1 ) is the second most common cause of severe hemolytic disease of the newborn ( HDN ) after Rh disease . Anti-Kell1 is becoming relatively more important as prevention of Rh disease is also becoming more effective . Hemolytic disease of the newborn ( anti-Kell1 ) is caused by a mismatch between the Kell antigens of the mother and fetus . About 91% of the population are Kell1 negative and about 9% are Kell1 positive . A fraction of a percentage are homozygous for Kell1 . Therefore , about 4.5% of babies born to a Kell1 negative mother are Kell1 positive . [ citation needed ] The disease results when maternal antibodies to Kell1 are transferred to the fetus across the placental barrier , breaching immune privilege . These antibodies can cause severe anemia by interfering with the early proliferation of red blood cells as well as causing alloimmune hemolysis . Very severe disease can occur as early as 20 weeks gestation . Hydrops fetalis can also occur early . The finding of anti-Kell antibodies in an antenatal screening blood test ( indirect Coombs test ) is an indication for early referral to a specialist service for assessment , management and treatment .

  "/wiki/Lewis_antigen_system": "The Lewis antigen system is a human blood group system . It is based upon two genes on chromosome 19 : FUT3 , or Lewis gene ; and FUT2 , or Secretor gene . Both genes are expressed in glandular epithelia . FUT2 has a dominant allele which codes for an enzyme ( designated Se ) and a recessive allele which does not produce a functional enzyme ( designated se ) . Similarly , FUT3 has a functional dominant allele ( Le ) and a non-functional recessive allele ( le ) . The proteins produced by the FUT2 and FUT3 genes modify type I oligosaccharide chains to create Lewis antigens . These oligosaccharide chains are similar to the type II chains of the ABO blood system , with a single bond in a different position . The link between the Lewis blood group and secretion of the ABO blood group antigens was possibly the first example of multiple effects of a human gene : the same enzyme ( fucosyltransferase2 ) which converts the Le-a antigen to Le-b is also responsible for the presence of soluble A , B and H antigens in bodily fluids . There are two main types of Lewis antigens , Lewis a ( Le-a ) and Lewis b ( Le-b ) . There are three common phenotypes : Le ( a+b- ) , Le ( a-b+ ) , and Le ( a-b- ) . The enzyme fucosyltransferase 3 ( FUT3 ) , encoded by Le gene , adds a fucose to the precursor oligosaccharide substrate , converting it to the Le-a antigen . People who have the Le allele and who are non-secretors ( homozygous for the nonfunctional se allele ) will express the Le-a antigen in their bodily fluids and on their erythrocytes .",
  "/wiki/Fucose": "Fucose is a hexose deoxy sugar with the chemical formula C6H12O5 . It is found on N-linked glycans on the mammalian , insect and plant cell surface . Fucose is the fundamental sub-unit of the seaweed polysaccharide fucoidan . The \u03b1 ( 1\u21923 ) linked core of fucose is a suspected carbohydrate antigen for IgE-mediated allergy . Two structural features distinguish fucose from other six-carbon sugars present in mammals : the lack of a hydroxyl group on the carbon at the 6-position ( C-6 ) ( thereby making it a deoxy sugar ) and the L-configuration . It is equivalent to 6-deoxy-l-galactose . In the fucose-containing glycan structures , fucosylated glycans , fucose can exist as a terminal modification or serve as an attachment point for adding other sugars . In human N-linked glycans , fucose is most commonly linked \u03b1-1,6 to the reducing terminal \u03b2-N-acetylglucosamine . However , fucose at the non-reducing termini linked \u03b1-1,2 to galactose forms the H antigen , the substructure of the A and B blood group antigens . Fucose is released from fucose-containing polymers by an enzyme called \u03b1-fucosidase found in lysosomes . l-Fucose has several potential applications in cosmetics , pharmaceuticals , and dietary supplements Fucosylation of antibodies has been established to reduce binding to the Fc receptor of Natural Killer cells and thereby reduce antigen-dependent cellular cytotoxicity .

Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever , tiredness , vomiting , and headaches . In severe cases it can cause yellow skin , seizures , coma , or death . Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten by an infected mosquito . If not properly treated , people may have recurrences of the disease months later . In those who have recently survived an infection , reinfection usually causes milder symptoms . This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria . It is caused by single-celled microorganisms of the Plasmodium group .

It is found throughout Southeast Asia , and is the most common cause of human malaria in Malaysia . Like other Plasmodium species , P. knowlesi has a life cycle that requires infection of both a mosquito and a warm-blooded host . While the natural warm-blooded hosts of P. knowlesi are likely various Old World monkeys , humans can be infected by P. knowlesi if they are fed upon by infected mosquitoes . P. knowlesi is a eukaryote in the phylum Apicomplexa , genus Plasmodium , and subgenus Plasmodium . It is most closely related to the human parasite Plasmodium vivax as well as other Plasmodium species that infect non-human primates . Humans infected with P. knowlesi can develop uncomplicated or severe malaria similar to that caused by Plasmodium falciparum .

Individuals with Co ( b ) allele or who are missing the Colton antigen are at risk for a transfusion reaction such as hemolytic anemia or alloimmunization . Antibodies against the Colton antigen may also cause hemolytic disease of the newborn , in which a pregnant woman 's body creates antibodies against the blood of her fetus , leading to destruction of the fetal blood cells .",
  "/wiki/Aquaporin_1": "Aquaporin 1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the AQP1 gene . AQP1 is a widely expressed water channel , whose physiological function has been most thoroughly characterized in the kidney . It is found in the basolateral and apical plasma membranes of the proximal tubules , the descending limb of the loop of Henle , and in the descending portion of the vasa recta . Additionally , it is found in red blood cells , vascular endothelium , the gastrointestinal tract , sweat glands , and lungs . It is not regulated by vasopressin ( ADH ) .",
  "/wiki/Landsteiner-Wiener_antigen_system": "The LW blood system was first described by Landsteiner and Wiener in 1940 . It was often confused with the Rh system , not becoming a separate antigen system until 1982 . The LW and RhD antigens are genetically independent though they are phenotypically related and the LW antigen is expressed more strongly on RhD positive cells than on RhD negative cells . In most populations , the antithetical LW antigens , LWa and LWb are present as very high and very low frequency , respectively .",
  "/wiki/Chido_antigen_system": "Complement component 4 ( C4 ) , in humans , is a protein involved in the intricate complement system , originating from the human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) system . It serves a number of critical functions in immunity , tolerance , and autoimmunity with the other numerous components . Furthermore , it is a crucial factor in connecting the recognition pathways of the overall system instigated by antibody-antigen ( Ab-Ag ) complexes to the other effector proteins of the innate immune response . For example , the severity of a dysfunctional complement system can lead to fatal diseases and infections . Complex variations of it can also lead to schizophrenia . Yet , the C4 protein derives from a simple two-locus allelic model , the C4A-C4B genes , that allows for an abundant variation in the levels of their respective proteins within a population . Originally defined in the context of the Chido/Rodgers blood group system , the C4A-C4B genetic model is under investigation for its possible role in schizophrenia risk and development .",
  "/wiki/Chromosome_6": "Chromosome 6 is one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes in humans . People normally have two copies of this chromosome . Chromosome 6 spans more than 170 million base pairs ( the building material of DNA ) and represents between 5.5 and 6% of the total DNA in cells . It contains the Major Histocompatibility Complex , which contains over 100 genes related to the immune response , and plays a vital role in organ transplantation .",
  "/wiki/XK_(protein)": "XK ( also known as Kell blood group precursor ) is a protein found on human red blood cells and other tissues which is responsible for the Kx antigen which helps determine a person 's blood type .",
  "/wiki/Gerbich_antigen_system": "Glycophorin C ( GYPC ; CD236/CD236R ; glycoprotein beta ; glycoconnectin ; PAS-2 ' ) plays a functionally important role in maintaining erythrocyte shape and regulating membrane material properties , possibly through its interaction with protein 4.1 . Moreover , it has previously been shown that membranes deficient in protein 4.1 exhibit decreased content of glycophorin C. It is also an integral membrane protein of the erythrocyte and acts as the receptor for the Plasmodium falciparum protein PfEBP-2 ( erythrocyte binding protein 2 ; baebl ; EBA-140 ) .",
  "/wiki/Chromosome_2": "Chromosome 2 is one of the twenty-three pairs of chromosomes in humans . People normally have two copies of this chromosome . Chromosome 2 is the second-largest human chromosome , spanning more than 242 million base pairs and representing almost eight percent of the total DNA in human cells . Chromosome 2 contains the HOXD homeobox gene cluster ."
