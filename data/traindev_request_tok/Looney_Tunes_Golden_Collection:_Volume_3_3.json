Coyote - brown fur , wiry body , and huge ears , but with a red nose in place of the Coyote 's black one ; ( usually ) white eyes instead of the Coyote 's yellow ones ; and , occasionally , a fang protruding from his mouth . He also shares the Coyote 's appetite and persistent use of Acme Corporation products , but he covets sheep instead of roadrunners and , when he speaks , does not have the upper-class accent or the egotistical bearing of the Coyote . Another crucial difference is that of personality : Ralph does not have the fanatical drive of the Coyote in pursuing his prey , preferring to abandon his chase at the end of the working day . Sam Sheepdog , by contrast , is a large , burly Berger de Brie ( Briard ) with white or tan fur and a mop of red hair that usually covers his eyes .

Many of the items for these contrivances are mail-ordered from a variety of companies that are all named Acme . One running gag running gag involves the Coyote falling from a high cliff . After he goes over the edge , the rest of the scene , shot from a bird's-eye view , shows him falling into a canyon so deep , that his figure is eventually lost to sight .
