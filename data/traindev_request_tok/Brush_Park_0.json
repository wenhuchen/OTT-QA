  "/wiki/American_Foursquare": "The American Foursquare or American Four Square is an American house style popular from the mid-1890s to the late 1930s . A reaction to the ornate and mass-produced elements of the Victorian and other Revival styles popular throughout the last half of the 19th century , the American Foursquare was plain , often incorporating handcrafted honest woodwork ( unless purchased from a mail-order catalog ) . This style incorporates elements of the Prairie School and the Craftsman styles . It is also sometimes called Transitional Period . The hallmarks of the style include a basically square , boxy design , two-and-one-half stories high , usually with four large , boxy rooms to a floor , a center dormer , and a large front porch with wide stairs . The boxy shape provides a maximum amount of interior room space , to use a small city lot to best advantage . Other common features included a hipped roof , arched entries between common rooms , built-in cabinetry , and Craftsman-style woodwork . A typical design would be as follows : first floor , from front to back , on one side , the living room and dining room ; while on the other side , the entry room or foyer , stairway and kitchen . Sometimes a bathroom was also included . Second floor , front to back , on one side , bedroom , bathroom and bedroom ; while on the other side , bedroom , stairway and bedroom . The bedrooms had a slightly longer dimension along the front and back of the house with side-by-side closets between the bedrooms . This gave a very efficient layout , with a bedroom in each corner and a centralized bathroom and stairway .",

  "/wiki/Greek_alphabet": "The Greek alphabet has been used to write the Greek language since the late ninth or early eighth century BC . It is derived from the earlier Phoenician alphabet , and was the first alphabetic script in history to have distinct letters for vowels as well as consonants . In Archaic and early Classical times , the Greek alphabet existed in many different local variants , but , by the end of the fourth century BC , the Euclidean alphabet , with twenty-four letters , ordered from alpha to omega , had become standard and it is this version that is still used to write Greek today . These twenty-four letters ( each in uppercase and lowercase forms ) are : \u0391 \u03b1 , \u0392 \u03b2 , \u0393 \u03b3 , \u0394 \u03b4 , \u0395 \u03b5 , \u0396 \u03b6 , \u0397 \u03b7 , \u0398 \u03b8 , \u0399 \u03b9 , \u039a \u03ba , \u039b \u03bb , \u039c \u03bc , \u039d \u03bd , \u039e \u03be , \u039f \u03bf , \u03a0 \u03c0 , \u03a1 \u03c1 , \u03a3 \u03c3/\u03c2 , \u03a4 \u03c4 , \u03a5 \u03c5 , \u03a6 \u03c6 , \u03a7 \u03c7 , \u03a8 \u03c8 , and \u03a9 \u03c9 . The Greek alphabet is the ancestor of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts . Like Latin and Cyrillic , Greek originally had only a single form of each letter ; it developed the letter case distinction between uppercase and lowercase in parallel with Latin during the modern era . Sound values and conventional transcriptions for some of the letters differ between Ancient and Modern Greek usage , because the pronunciation of Greek has changed significantly between the fifth century BC and today . Modern and Ancient Greek also use different diacritics . Apart from its use in writing the Greek language , in both its ancient and its modern forms , the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics , science and other fields .",

  "/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland .",

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",

A property listed in the National Register , or located within a National Register Historic District , may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred in preserving the property . The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act ( NHPA ) in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it . Of the more than one million properties on the National Register , 80,000 are listed individually . The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts . For most of its history , the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service ( NPS ) , an agency within the United States Department of the Interior . Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups , such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation , as well as coordinate , identify and protect historic sites in the United States . While National Register listings are mostly symbolic , their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties . Protection of the property is not guaranteed . During the nomination process , the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places . The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation , as well as the public and politicians .

  "/wiki/Renaissance_Revival_architecture": "Renaissance Revival architecture ( sometimes referred to as Neo-Renaissance ) is a group of 19th century architectural revival styles which were neither Greek Revival nor Gothic Revival but which instead drew inspiration from a wide range of classicizing Italian modes . Under the broad designation Renaissance architecture nineteenth-century architects and critics went beyond the architectural style which began in Florence and central Italy in the early 15th century as an expression of Renaissance humanism ; they also included styles we would identify as Mannerist or Baroque . Self-applied style designations were rife in the mid- and later nineteenth century : Neo-Renaissance might be applied by contemporaries to structures that others called Italianate , or when many French Baroque features are present ( Second Empire ) . The divergent forms of Renaissance architecture in different parts of Europe , particularly in France and Italy , has added to the difficulty of defining and recognizing Neo-Renaissance architecture . A comparison between the breadth of its source material , such as the English Wollaton Hall , Italian Palazzo Pitti , the French Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord , and the Russian Palace of Facets - all deemed Renaissance - illustrates the variety of appearances the same architectural label can take .",

  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",

  "/wiki/Boston": "Boston ( UK : /\u02c8b\u0252st\u0259n/ , US : /\u02c8b\u0254\u02d0st\u0259n/ ) is the capital and most populous city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States , and the 21st most populous city in the United States . The city proper covers 49 square miles ( 127 km2 ) with an estimated population of 694,583 in 2018 , also making it the most populous city in New England . Boston is the seat of Suffolk County as well , although the county government was disbanded on July 1 , 1999 . The city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area known as Greater Boston , a metropolitan statistical area ( MSA ) home to a census-estimated 4.8 million people in 2016 and ranking as the tenth-largest such area in the country . As a combined statistical area ( CSA ) , this wider commuting region is home to some 8.2 million people , making it the sixth most populous in the United States . Boston is one of the oldest municipalities in the United States , founded on the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630 by Puritan settlers from the English town of the same name . It was the scene of several key events of the American Revolution , such as the Boston Massacre , the Boston Tea Party , the Battle of Bunker Hill , and the Siege of Boston . Upon gaining U.S. independence from Great Britain , it continued to be an important port and manufacturing hub as well as a center for education and culture . The city has expanded beyond the original peninsula through land reclamation and municipal annexation . Its rich history attracts many tourists , with Faneuil Hall alone drawing more than 20 million visitors per year . Boston 's many firsts include the United States ' first public park ( Boston Common , 1634 ) , first public or state school ( Boston Latin School , 1635 ) and first subway system ( Tremont Street Subway , 1897 ) . Today , Boston is a thriving center of scientific research as well as port of entry for commerce and international immigration .",

  "/wiki/Venetian_Gothic_architecture": "Venetian Gothic is the local variant architectural style for Venice of Italian Gothic architecture , with a confluence of influences from local building requirements , some influence from Byzantine architecture , and some from Islamic architecture , reflecting Venice 's trading network . Very unusually for medieval architecture , the style is both at its most characteristic in secular buildings , and the great majority of survivals are secular . The best-known examples are the Doge 's Palace and the Ca ' d'Oro . Both feature loggias of closely spaced small columns , with heavy tracery with quatrefoil openings above , decoration along the roofline , and some coloured patterning to plain wall surfaces . Together with the ogee arch , capped with a relief ornament , and ropework reliefs , these are the most iconic characteristics of the style . Ecclesiastical Gothic architecture tended to be less distinctively Venetian , and closer to that in the rest of Italy . The beginning of the style probably goes back no further than the 13th century , although the dates of early Gothic palaces , and especially features such as windows in them , are largely uncertain . It dominated the 14th century and because of the city 's conservatism Venetian Gothic buildings , especially smaller palaces , continued to be built well into the second half of the 15th century , and Venetian Renaissance architecture very often retained reminiscences of its Gothic predecessor .",

Trained as a sociologist with a specialty in urbanism , Vergara turned to his systematic documentation at a moment of urban decay , and he chose locales where that stress seemed highest : the housing projects of Chicago ; the South Bronx of New York City ; Camden , New Jersey ; and Detroit , Michigan , among others .",
  "/wiki/Dry_goods": "Dry goods is a historic term describing the type of product line a store carries , which differs by region . The term comes from the textile trade , and the shops appear to have spread with the mercantile trade across the British colonial territories ( and former territories ) as a means of bringing supplies and manufactured goods to far-flung settlements and homesteads that were spreading globally . Starting in the mid-1700s , these stores began by selling supplies and textile goods to remote communities , and many customized the products they carried to the area 's needs . This continued to be the trend well into the early 1900s . With the rise of department stores and catalog sales , the decline of dry goods stores began , and the term has largely fallen out of use .",

  "/wiki/Tudor_Revival_architecture": "Tudor Revival architecture ( also known as mock Tudor in the UK ) first manifested itself in domestic architecture in the United Kingdom in the latter half of the 19th century . Based on revival of aspects that were perceived as Tudor architecture , in reality it usually took the style of English vernacular architecture of the Middle Ages that had survived into the Tudor period . The style later became an influence elsewhere , especially the British colonies . For example , in New Zealand , the architect Francis Petre adapted the style for the local climate . In Singapore , then a British colony , architects such as R. A. J. Bidwell pioneered what became known as the Black and White House . The earliest examples of the style originate with the works of such eminent architects as Norman Shaw and George Devey , in what at the time was thought Neo-Tudor design . Tudorbethan is a subset of Tudor Revival architecture that eliminated some of the more complex aspects of Jacobethan in favor of more domestic styles of Merrie England , which were cosier and quaint . It was associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",
