  "/wiki/Palace": "A palace is a grand residence , especially a royal residence , or the home of a head of state or some other high-ranking dignitary , such as a bishop or archbishop . The word is derived from the Latin name Pal\u0101tium , for Palatine Hill in Rome which housed the Imperial residences . Most European languages have a version of the term ( palais , palazzo , palacio etc . ) , and many use it for a wider range of buildings than English . In many parts of Europe , the equivalent term is also applied to large private houses in cities , especially of the aristocracy ; often the term for a large country house is different . Many historic palaces are now put to other uses such as parliaments , museums , hotels , or office buildings . The word is also sometimes used to describe a lavishly ornate building used for public entertainment or exhibitions , such as a movie palace .",
  "/wiki/Calshot_Castle": "Calshot Castle is an artillery fort constructed by Henry VIII on the Calshot Spit , Hampshire , England , between 1539 and 1540 . It formed part of the King 's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire and defend Southampton Water as it met the Solent . The castle had a keep at its centre , surrounded by a curtain wall and a moat . Initially heavily armed , it had a garrison of 16 men and as many as 36 artillery guns . The castle continued in use for many years , surviving the English Civil War intact and being extensively modernised in the 1770s . During the 19th century , Calshot Castle was used by the coastguard as a base for combating smuggling . In 1894 , however , fresh fears of a French invasion led to it being brought back into use as an artillery fort : a large coastal battery was constructed alongside the older castle and a boom built across Southampton Water , controlled from the castle . During the First World War , Calshot Castle was primarily used as a base for seaplanes , deployed on anti-submarine patrols in the English Channel ; its guns were removed before the end of the war , probably for use in France . The air base , by then called RAF Calshot , grew in size during the inter-war years , hosting the Schneider Trophy air races . With the outbreak of the Second World War , Calshot was re-armed in the face of a possible German invasion . The station continued in use after the war , but as military seaplanes became obsolete , it was finally closed in 1961 . After a short period of use by the coastguard , the castle was opened to the public by English Heritage in the 1980s .",
  "/wiki/Device_Fort": "The Device Forts , also known as Henrician castles and blockhouses , were a series of artillery fortifications built to defend the coast of England and Wales by Henry VIII . [ a ] Traditionally , the Crown had left coastal defences in the hands of local lords and communities but the threat of French and Spanish invasion led the King to issue an order , called a device , for a major programme of work between 1539 and 1547 . The fortifications ranged from large stone castles positioned to protect the Downs anchorage in Kent , to small blockhouses overlooking the entrance to Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire , and earthwork bulwarks along the Essex coast . Some forts operated independently , others were designed to be mutually reinforcing . The Device programme was hugely expensive , costing a total of \u00a3376,000 ( estimated as between \u00a32 and \u00a382 million in today 's money ) ; [ b ] much of this was raised from the proceeds of the Dissolution of the Monasteries a few years before . These utilitarian fortifications were armed with artillery , intended to be used against enemy ships before they could land forces or attack ships lying in harbour . The first wave of work between 1539 and 1543 was characterised by the use of circular bastions and multi-tiered defences , combined with many traditional medieval features . These designs contained serious military flaws , however , and the second period of construction until 1547 saw the introduction of angular bastions and other innovations probably inspired by contemporary thinking in mainland Europe . The castles were commanded by captains appointed by the Crown , overseeing small garrisons of professional gunners and soldiers , who would be supplemented by the local militia in an emergency . Despite a French raid against the Isle of Wight in 1545 , the Device Forts saw almost no action before peace was declared in 1546 . Some of the defences were left to deteriorate and were decommissioned only a few years after their construction . After war broke out with Spain in 1569 , Elizabeth I improved many of the remaining fortifications , including during the attack of the Spanish Armada of 1588 .",

  "/wiki/Tumulus": "A tumulus ( plural tumuli ) is a mound of earth and stones raised over a grave or graves . Tumuli are also known as barrows , burial mounds or kurgans , and may be found throughout much of the world . A cairn , which is a mound of stones built for various purposes , may also originally have been a tumulus . Tumuli are often categorised according to their external apparent shape . In this respect , a long barrow is a long tumulus , usually constructed on top of several burials , such as passage graves . A round barrow is a round tumulus , also commonly constructed on top of burials . The internal structure and architecture of both long and round barrows has a broad range ; the categorization only refers to the external apparent shape . The method of inhumation may involve a dolmen , a cist , a mortuary enclosure , a mortuary house , or a chamber tomb . Examples of barrows include Duggleby Howe and Maeshowe . The word tumulus is Latin for 'mound ' or 'small hill ' , which is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *teuh2- with extended zero grade *tum- , 'to bulge , swell ' also found in tomb , tumor , tumescent , thumb , thigh , and thousand .",
  "/wiki/Bronze_Age": "The Bronze Age is a historical period that was characterized by the use of bronze , and in some areas proto-writing , and other early features of urban civilization . The Bronze Age is the second principal period of the three-age Stone-Bronze-Iron system , as proposed in modern times by Christian J\u00fcrgensen Thomsen , for classifying and studying ancient societies . An ancient civilization is defined to be in the Bronze Age either by producing bronze by smelting its own copper and alloying with tin , arsenic , or other metals , or by trading for bronze from production areas elsewhere . Bronze itself is harder and more durable than other metals available at the time , allowing Bronze Age civilizations to gain a technological advantage . Whilst terrestrial iron is naturally abundant , its high melting point of 1,538 \u00b0C ( 2,800 \u00b0F ) placed it out of reach of common use until the end of the second millennium BC . Tin 's low melting point of 231.9 \u00b0C ( 449.4 \u00b0F ) and copper 's relatively moderate melting point of 1,085 \u00b0C ( 1,985 \u00b0F ) placed them within the capabilities of the Neolithic pottery kilns , which date back to 6000 BC and were able to produce temperatures greater than 900 \u00b0C ( 1,650 \u00b0F ) . Copper-tin ores are rare , as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in Western Asia before trading in bronze began in the third millennium BC . Worldwide , the Bronze Age generally followed the Neolithic period , with the Chalcolithic serving as a transition . Although the Iron Age generally followed the Bronze Age , in some areas ( such as Sub-Saharan Africa ) , the Iron Age began as early as 2500 BC . Bronze Age cultures differed in their development of the first writing . According to archaeological evidence , cultures in Mesopotamia ( cuneiform script ) and Egypt ( hieroglyphs ) developed the earliest viable writing systems .",

The forts were intended to defend the Dockyard in Portsmouth . Construction was carried out by the Royal Engineers and civilian contractors ( under Royal Engineer supervision ) . In addition to the newly constructed forts , extensive work was carried out on existing fortifications . The Portsmouth defences can be split into four distinct groups of forts , comprising four sea forts built in the Solent , a group of forts on Portsea Island , a group of forts along Portsdown Hill overlooking Portsmouth , and a group of forts on the Gosport peninsula .

  "/wiki/Hurst_Castle": "Hurst Castle is an artillery fort established by Henry VIII on the Hurst Spit in Hampshire , England , between 1541 and 1544 . It formed part of the king 's Device Forts coastal protection programme against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire , and defended the western entrance to the Solent waterway . The early castle had a central keep and three bastions , and in 1547 was equipped with 26 guns . It was expensive to operate due to its size , but it formed one of the most powerful forts along the coast . During the English Civil War of the 1640s , Hurst was held by Parliament and was used briefly to detain King Charles I before his execution in 1649 . It continued in use during the 18th century but fell into disrepair , the spit being frequented by smugglers . Repairs were made during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars with France , and the castle was modernised to enable it to hold 24-pounder ( 10.8 kg ) guns . Fresh fears of invasion followed in the 1850s , leading to heavier , 32-pounder ( 14.5 kg ) armament being installed and new gun batteries being laid out on both sides of the castle . Technological developments rapidly made these defences obsolete , however , and a fresh phase of work between 1861 and 1874 created sixty-one gun positions in two long , granite-faced batteries alongside the older castle . These held very heavy weapons , including massive 12.5 inch , 38 ton ( 317 mm , 39,000 kg ) rifled muzzle-loading guns . As the century progressed , these too became outdated and lighter , quick-firing guns were installed at the castle to replace them . The castle formed part of a network of defences around the entrance to the Solent during the First World War , and was re-armed again during the Second World War .",

The monks were best known to their neighbours for the generous hospitality they offered to travellers on land and sea . In 1536 , Netley Abbey was seized by Henry VIII of England during the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the buildings granted to William Paulet , a wealthy Tudor politician , who converted them into a mansion . The abbey was used as a country house until the beginning of the eighteenth century , after which it was abandoned and partially demolished for building materials .

  "/wiki/Portchester_Castle": "Portchester Castle is a medieval castle built within a former Roman fort at Portchester to the east of Fareham in the English county of Hampshire . Probably founded in the late 11th century , Portchester was a baronial castle taken under royal control in 1154 . The monarchy controlled the castle for several centuries and it was a favoured hunting lodge of King John . It was besieged and captured by the French in 1216 before permanently returning to English control shortly thereafter . Occupying a commanding position at the head of Portsmouth Harbour , in the medieval period Portchester was an important port . The castle saw the disembarkation for several campaigns to France led by England 's kings . In anticipation of a French invasion during the first quarter of the 14th century , Edward II spent \u00a31,100 repairing and reinforcing Portchester Castle . A plot to overthrow Henry V was discovered and the culprits apprehended at Portchester ; this event features in Shakespeare 's play , Henry V. Later in its history , the castle was used as a prison .

  "/wiki/Castle": "A castle is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages predominantly by the nobility or royalty and by military orders . Scholars debate the scope of the word castle , but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble . This is distinct from a palace , which is not fortified ; from a fortress , which was not always a residence for royalty or nobility ; and from a fortified settlement , which was a public defence - though there are many similarities among these types of construction . Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses . Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built , they took on a great many forms with many different features , although some , such as curtain walls , arrowslits , and portcullises , were commonplace . European-style castles originated in the 9th and 10th centuries , after the fall of the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes . These nobles built castles to control the area immediately surrounding them and the castles were both offensive and defensive structures ; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as offered protection from enemies . Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies , the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power . Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes , and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community , such as mills , fertile land , or a water source . Many northern European castles were originally built from earth and timber , but had their defences replaced later by stone . Early castles often exploited natural defences , lacking features such as towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep . In the late 12th and early 13th centuries , a scientific approach to castle defence emerged .",

  "/wiki/Hospice": "Hospice care is a type of health care that focuses on the palliation of a terminally ill patient 's pain and symptoms and attending to their emotional and spiritual needs . Hospice care has a palliative focus without curative intent . Usually , it is used for people with no further options for curing their disease or in people who have decided not to pursue further options that are arduous , likely to cause more symptoms , and not likely to succeed . In the United States , the term is largely defined by the practices of the Medicare system and other health insurance providers , which cover inpatient or at home hospice care to terminal patients who are medically certified to have less than six months to live . Hospice care under the Medicare Hospice Benefit requires that two physicians certify that a person has less than six months to live if the disease follows its usual course . According to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization ( NHPCO ) 2012 report on facts and figures of hospice care , 66.4% received at-home care and 26.1% in an inpatient facility . In the late 1970s , the U.S. government began to view hospice care as a humane care option for the terminally ill . In 1982 , Congress initiated the creation of the Medicare Hospice Benefit , which became permanent in 1986 . In 1993 , President Clinton installed hospice as a guaranteed benefit and an accepted component of health care provisions . Outside the United States , the term tends to be primarily associated with the particular buildings or institutions that specialize in such care ( although hospice at home services may also be available ) . [ citation needed ] Outside the United States , such institutions may similarly provide care mostly in an end-of-life setting , but they may also be available for patients with other palliative care needs .

Julius Caesar invaded Britain in 55 and 54 BC as part of his Gallic Wars . According to Caesar , the Britons had been overrun or culturally assimilated by other Celtic tribes during the British Iron Age and had been aiding Caesar 's enemies . He received tribute , installed the friendly king Mandubracius over the Trinovantes , and returned to Gaul . Planned invasions under Augustus were called off in 34 , 27 , and 25 BC . In 40 AD , Caligula assembled 200,000 men at the Channel on the continent , only to have them gather seashells ( musculi ) according to Suetonius , perhaps as a symbolic gesture to proclaim Caligula 's victory over the sea . Three years later , Claudius directed four legions to invade Britain and restore the exiled king Verica over the Atrebates . The Romans defeated the Catuvellauni , and then organized their conquests as the Province of Britain ( Latin : Provincia Britannia ) .

However , the term also encompasses houses that were , and often still are , the full-time residence for the landed gentry that ruled rural Britain until the Reform Act 1832 . Frequently , the formal business of the counties was transacted in these country houses . With large numbers of indoor and outdoor staff , country houses were important as places of employment for many rural communities . In turn , until the agricultural depressions of the 1870s , the estates , of which country houses were the hub , provided their owners with incomes . However , the late 19th and early 20th centuries were the swansong of the traditional English country house lifestyle . Increased taxation and the effects of World War I led to the demolition of hundreds of houses ; those that remained had to adapt to survive .
