Following the fall of the Iron Curtain , the field of competitors was quite different from previous Olympiads . Twelve of the 15 former Soviet republics now competed as independent nations , and they all finished in the top half . Meanwhile , an all-German team was present for the first time since World War II . Of the former Yugoslav republics , Croatia , Bosnia , and Slovenia appeared independently ; Serbia-Montenegro and Macedonia did not . This Olympiad also marked the final appearance of Czechoslovakia and the re-appearance of South Africa . With the Soviet team a thing of the past , all three medal ranks were now occupied by different ex-Soviet teams . Russia , captained by world champion Kasparov , took up the illustrious legacy of their predecessor and won by four points . Uzbekistan 's silver was a small surprise ; the Armenian bronze less so .",

Reported human rights abuses by FIDE and Kalmykia president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov led to calls for a boycott from Valery Borshchev , a member of the Duma . The British government did not call for a boycott but confirmed reliable reports of human rights problems and suggested that Kalmykian authorities might use publicity from Olympiad participation by foreign teams for its own purposes . Three nations were signed up but chose to stay away : Denmark , Norway , and Slovakia . The opening ceremony took place as scheduled , but the Chess Palace was still covered in scaffolding and was missing many windows . The first round was delayed , one free day was eliminated , and the tournament was shortened to 13 rounds from the planned 14 .
