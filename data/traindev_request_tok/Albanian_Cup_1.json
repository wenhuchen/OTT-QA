In 1991 KF Tirana retook its pre-1947 name and was divided into two branches , the multi disciplinary SK Tirana and the football branch of KF Tirana . KF Tirana is the most successful Albanian team in European competitions , having progressed from the first rounds on 11 occasions since making their European debut in the 1965-66 European Cup .

KS Besa surprised 5 times Albanian Champions , KF Tirana by winning the opening match in Kavaj\u00eb 2-1 , making a brilliant start . Tirana compensated somehow by breaking Vllaznia 5-3 in the next match . Besa just could n't do the same to Vllaznia at their home stadium , by losing this time 1-2 , this equalized all teams in points . Vllaznia then broke Besa once again in Shkod\u00ebr whilst Tirana retaliated their only loss by beating Besa in Tiran\u00eb 4-2 and therefore eliminating them directly . Tirana needed just one point in the final match in Shkod\u00ebr against Vllaznia to secure their first major trophy , but hosts were left stunned when Tirana won 2-1 in Loro Borici Stadium and lifting therefore the first Albanian Cup despite being 0-1 down in scoreline .
