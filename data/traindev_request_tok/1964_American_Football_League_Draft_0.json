  "/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_FBS_independent_schools": "National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) Football Bowl Subdivision independent schools are four-year institutions whose football programs are not part of an NCAA-affiliated conference . This means that FBS independents are not required to schedule each other for competition like conference schools do . There are fewer independent schools than in years past ; many independent schools join , or attempt to join , established conferences . The main reasons to join a conference are to gain a share of television revenue and access to bowl games that agree to take teams from certain conferences , and to help deal with otherwise potentially difficult challenges in scheduling opponents to play throughout the season . All Division I FBS independents are eligible for the College Football Playoff ( CFP ) , or for the so-called access bowls associated with the CFP , if they are chosen by the CFP selection committee . Notre Dame has a potential tie-in with the Orange Bowl . Army has an agreement with the Military Bowl ( formerly the EagleBank Bowl ) , and Notre Dame , in addition to its CFP agreement , has other bowl agreements as part of its affiliation with the Atlantic Coast Conference ( ACC ) . ( Notre Dame had similar agreements with its previous conference , the Big East . ) BYU had an agreement with the Armed Forces Bowl for 2011 . The ranks of football independents increased by one starting with the 2011 season with the announcement that BYU would leave the Mountain West Conference ( MWC ) to become a football independent starting with that season . The ranks increased by two in 2013 when the Western Athletic Conference ( WAC ) dropped football and New Mexico State and Idaho did not have a conference for football . The ranks of football independents decreased by two in 2014 with the return of Idaho and New Mexico State as football-only members of the Sun Belt Conference ( SBC ) and decreased by one more in 2015 with Navy joining the American Athletic Conference ( AAC ) as a football-only member .",

  "/wiki/Tight_end": "The tight end ( TE ) is a position in American football , arena football , and formerly Canadian football , on the offense . The tight end is often seen as a hybrid position with the characteristics and roles of both an offensive lineman and a wide receiver . Like offensive linemen , they are usually lined up on the offensive line and are large enough to be effective blockers . On the other hand , unlike offensive linemen , they are eligible receivers adept enough to warrant a defense 's attention when running pass patterns . Because of the hybrid nature of the position , the tight end 's role in any given offense depends on the tactical preferences and philosophy of the head coach . In some systems , the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman , rarely going out for passes . Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver , frequently taking advantage of the tight end 's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary . Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking on running plays while using a tight end with better pass-catching skills in obvious passing situations . Offensive formations may have as few as zero or as many as three tight ends at one time .",

Cornerbacks cover receivers most of the time , but also blitz and defend against such offensive running plays as sweeps and reverses .

  "/wiki/Fullback_(gridiron_football)": "A fullback ( FB ) is a position known as the best position in the game of football , in the offensive backfield in gridiron football , and is one of the two running back positions along with the halfback . Typically , fullbacks are larger than halfback and in most offensive schemes their duties are split between power running , pass catching , and blocking for both the quarterback and the other running back . Many great runners in the history of American football have been fullbacks , including Jim Brown , Marion Motley , Jim Taylor , Franco Harris , Larry Csonka , John Riggins , Christian Okoye , and Levi Jackson . However , many of these runners would retroactively be labeled as halfbacks , due to their position as the primary ball carrier ; they were primarily listed as fullbacks due to their size and did not often perform the run-blocking duties expected of modern fullbacks .

The conference sponsored only men 's sports ; awarding championships in baseball , basketball , cross-country , golf , swimming , indoor & outdoor track and field , tennis , and wrestling . The first conference championship was in cross country in the fall of 1970 . Southern Illinois won that championship and almost made a clean sweep by winning championships in basketball , wrestling , swimming , baseball , tennis , and both indoor and outdoor track . Only Ball State prevented a sweep by winning the golf championship that spring . At that time ( as is generally still the case now ) , in order to be recognized by the NCAA , a conference was required to have six or more member institutions . The Midwestern Conference had only five members and was unable to find a sixth , so it ceased operations after only two years . The five member schools eventually affiliated with other conferences .

The jet-airplane logo decal was replaced by a white football shape outlined in green , with the word JETS in thick green sans-serif capitals over NY in green outline serif lettering , and a miniature football at bottom center . Both the Jets and the baseball New York Mets moved to Shea in 1964 . The team 's original owner when it was the Titans , Harry Wismer , hoped the team could play in Shea beginning in 1961 , but funding difficulties and legal problems delayed construction of the stadium . Wismer signed a memorandum of understanding in late 1961 to secure the Titans ' new home . That memorandum recognized that the Mets would have exclusive use of the stadium until they had completed their season . As the Jets moved to Shea under new ownership , they were , in most years , required to open the season with several road games , a problem which would become worse in 1969 and 1973 when the Mets had long playoff runs . The Jets ' popularity had reached a zenith at this point , in that the attendance at any one of their home games this season ( except for one , and it was n't by much ) outdrew the Titans ' entire 1962 season attendance at the Polo Grounds .",
