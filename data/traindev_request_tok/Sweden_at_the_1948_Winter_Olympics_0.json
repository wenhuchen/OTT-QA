He set new world records on the 5,000 m ( 8:13.7 ) in 1941 and on the 3000 m ( 4:45.7 ) in 1942 . He became European Allround Champions in 1947 , winning both the 5,000 m and the 10000 m on his way to becoming European Champion . In addition to speed skating , Seyffarth also was one of Sweden 's leading cyclists , but this career was hampered by an injury in a dirt biking accident in 1943 . Seyffarth participated in the 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz , the first Winter Olympic Games to be held in twelve years . As a result of the lack of competition during , and shortly after , World War II , Seyffarth entered the 5,000 m as the world record holder , a record he had set almost exactly seven years earlier , in 1941 . During his heat , Seyffarth seemed to be winning until a photographer tried to take a picture of him and stepped onto the ice . Seyffarth brushed the photographer , losing several seconds , and went on to lose his heat and finally come in seventh overall . The winner of the race was Reidar Liaklev with a time of 8:29.4 , well above Seyffarth 's 1941 world record of 8:13.7 . Seyffarth 's official 5,000 m time was 8:37.9 . The day after his disappointing 5000 m race , Seyffarth won Olympic silver on the 1,500 m , half a second behind Norwegian skater Sverre Farstad . The day after that , Seyffarth won Olympic gold on the 10000 m with a time of 17:26.30 , not a particularly fast time considering that the world record at the time was 17:01.50 .",

Hedlund made his international debut at the 1939 European Allround Championships of Riga , Latvia , finishing 16th . Two weeks later , he participated in the World Allround Championships held in Helsinki , but his times on the first three distances were not good enough to qualify him for the final distance . The start of World War II meant that only very few tournaments were organised , so Hedlund could not compete very often during those years . When the war was over , Hedlund participated in the first European Allround Championships after the war and promptly became the 1946 European Allround Champion . There were no official World Allround Championships that year , but unofficial World Championships were held in Oslo and Hedlund won silver there . In 1947 , Hedlund won European silver behind compatriot \u00c5ke Seyffarth . At the 1948 Winter Olympics of St. Moritz , Hedlund won bronze on the 5,000 m behind Norwegian skaters Reidar Liaklev and Odd Lundberg . His last international medal came two weeks later at the European Allround Championships where he won silver , again behind Liaklev . Hedlund competed internationally until 1952 , when he finished in 9th-11th places in the 5,000-10,000 m events at the Winter Olympics . He died in Liding\u00f6 in 2003 at the age of 85 . His daughter Ylva also became an Olympic speed skater ."
