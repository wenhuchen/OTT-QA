  "/wiki/Call_sign": "In broadcasting and radio communications , a call sign ( also known as a call name or call letters - and historically as a call signal - or abbreviated as a call ) is a unique designation for a transmitter station . In the United States of America , they are used for all FCC-licensed transmitters . A call sign can be formally assigned by a government agency , informally adopted by individuals or organizations , or even cryptographically encoded to disguise a station 's identity . The use of call signs as unique identifiers dates to the landline railroad telegraph system . Because there was only one telegraph line linking all railroad stations , there needed to be a way to address each one when sending a telegram . In order to save time , two-letter identifiers were adopted for this purpose . This pattern continued in radiotelegraph operation ; radio companies initially assigned two-letter identifiers to coastal stations and stations aboard ships at sea . These were not globally unique , so a one-letter company identifier ( for instance , 'M ' and two letters as a Marconi station ) was later added . By 1912 , the need to quickly identify stations operated by multiple companies in multiple nations required an international standard ; an ITU prefix would be used to identify a country , and the rest of the call sign an individual station in that country .",

  "/wiki/Flag_carrier": "A flag carrier is a transportation company , such as an airline or shipping company , that , being locally registered in a given sovereign state , enjoys preferential rights or privileges accorded by the government for international operations . Historically , the term was used to refer to airlines owned by the government of their home country and associated with the national identity of that country . Such an airline may also be known as a national airline or a national carrier , although this can have different legal meanings in some countries . Today , the term may be used to refer to any international airline with a strong connection to its home country or that represents its home country internationally , regardless of whether it is government-owned . Flag carriers may also be known as such due to laws requiring aircraft or ships to display the state flag of the country of their registry . For example , under the law of the United States , a U.S. flag air carrier is any airline that holds a certificate under Section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 ( i.e. , any U.S.-based airline operating internationally ) , and any ship registered in the United States is known as a U.S. flag vessel .",

  "/wiki/Brand_name": "A brand is a name , term , design , symbol or any other feature that identifies one seller 's good or service as distinct from those of other sellers . Brands are used in business , marketing , and advertising for recognition and , importantly , to create and store value as brand equity for the object identified , to the benefit of the brand 's customers , its owners and shareholders . Name brands are sometimes distinguished from generic or store brands . The practice of branding is thought to have begun with the ancient Egyptians , who were known to have engaged in livestock branding as early as 2,700 BCE . Branding was used to differentiate one person 's cattle from another 's by means of a distinctive symbol burned into the animal 's skin with a hot branding iron . If a person stole any of the cattle , anyone else who saw the symbol could deduce the actual owner . The term has been extended to mean a strategic personality for a product or company , so that brand now suggests the values and promises that a consumer may perceive and buy into . Over time the practice of branding objects extended to a broader range of packaging and goods offered for sale including oil , wine , cosmetics , and fish sauce and , in the 21st century , extends even further into services ( such as legal , financial and medical ) , political parties and people ( e.g . Lady Gaga and Katy Perry ) . Branding in terms of painting a cow with symbols or colors at flea markets was considered to be one of the oldest forms of the practice . In the modern era , the concept of branding has expanded to include deployment by a manager of the marketing and communication techniques and tools that help to distinguish a company or products from competitors , aiming to create a lasting impression in the minds of customers . The key components that form a brand 's toolbox include a brand 's identity , personality , product design , brand communication ( such as by logos and trademarks ) , brand awareness , brand loyalty , and various branding ( brand management ) strategies .",

  "/wiki/Helicopter": "A helicopter , or chopper , is a type of rotorcraft in which lift and thrust are supplied by rotors . This allows the helicopter to take off and land vertically , to hover , and to fly forward , backward , and laterally . These attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated areas where fixed-wing aircraft and many forms of VTOL ( Vertical TakeOff and Landing ) aircraft can not perform . The English word helicopter is adapted from the French word h\u00e9licopt\u00e8re , coined by Gustave Ponton d'Am\u00e9court in 1861 , which originates from the Greek helix ( \u1f15\u03bb\u03b9\u03be ) helix , spiral , whirl , convolution and pteron ( \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd ) wing . English language nicknames for helicopter include chopper , copter , helo , heli , and whirlybird . Helicopters were developed and built during the first half-century of flight , with the Focke-Wulf Fw 61 being the first operational helicopter in 1936 . Some helicopters reached limited production , but it was not until 1942 that a helicopter designed by Igor Sikorsky reached full-scale production , with 131 aircraft built . Though most earlier designs used more than one main rotor , it is the single main rotor with anti-torque tail rotor configuration that has become the most common helicopter configuration . Tandem rotor helicopters are also in widespread use due to their greater payload capacity . Coaxial helicopters , tiltrotor aircraft , and compound helicopters are all flying today . Quadcopter helicopters were pioneered as early as 1907 in France , and other types of multicopter have been developed for specialized applications such as unmanned drones .",

A smaller AOE is still available at the H\u00e9libellule FBO It was one of two airports in Canada with sufficient right-of-way that can be expanded to accommodate 50 million passengers per year , the other being Toronto Pearson International Airport . A lack of traffic meant that Mirabel was never expanded beyond its first phase . It is one of only two non-capital airports with fewer than 200,000 passengers a year to be part of the National Airports System . The airport was intended to replace the existing Dorval Airport as the eastern air gateway to Canada . Accordingly , from 1975 to 1997 , all international flights to and from Montreal ( except for flights to and from the United States ) were required to use Mirabel . However , Mirabel 's distant location , the lack of adequate transport links to urban centres and the continued operation of domestic flights from Dorval Airport made Mirabel very unpopular with travellers and airlines . It did not help that Montreal 's economy declined relative to that of Toronto during the 1970s and 1980s .",
