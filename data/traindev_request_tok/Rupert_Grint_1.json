  "/wiki/Mockumentary": "A mockumentary ( a portmanteau of mock and documentary ) or docucomedy is a type of movie or television show depicting fictional events but presented as a documentary . These productions are often used to analyze or comment on current events and issues by using a fictional setting , or to parody the documentary form itself . While mockumentaries are usually comedic , pseudo-documentaries are their dramatic equivalents . However , pseudo-documentary should not be confused with docudrama , a fictional genre in which dramatic techniques are combined with documentary elements to depict real events . Also , docudrama is different from docufiction ; a genre in which documentaries are contaminated with fictional elements . Mockumentaries are often presented as historical documentaries , with B roll and talking heads discussing past events , or as cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 pieces following people as they go through various events . Examples emerged during the 1950s when archival film footage became available . A very early example was a short piece on the Swiss Spaghetti Harvest that appeared as an April Fools ' prank on the British television program Panorama in 1957 . The term mockumentary , which originated in the 1960s , was popularized in the mid-1980s when This Is Spinal Tap director Rob Reiner used it in interviews to describe that film . Mockumentaries are often partly or wholly improvised , as an unscripted style of acting helps to maintain the pretense of reality . Comedic mockumentaries rarely have laugh tracks , also to sustain the atmosphere , although exceptions exist . Music is often employed to expose the ambiguities and fallacies of conventional storytelling ; for instance by pointing at the paradoxes of the distinction between diegetic and extradiegetic music .",
  "/wiki/American_Dad!": "American Dad ! is an American animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane , Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman that originally premiered on Fox . American Dad ! is the first television series to have its inception on the network 's Animation Domination block . The series premiered on February 6 , 2005 , following Super Bowl XXXIX , with the rest of the first season airing three months later beginning May 1 , 2005 . The series is produced by Underdog Productions , Fuzzy Door Productions , and 20th Century Fox Television and syndicated by 20th Television . Creative direction of American Dad ! has largely been guided by Barker ( prior to his exit from the show in season 10 ) and Weitzman as opposed to MacFarlane , resulting in a series that is different from its counterparts . Unlike MacFarlane 's other shows , Family Guy and , to a lesser extent , The Cleveland Show , American Dad ! does not lean as heavily on the use of cutaway gags , and is less concerned with conventional setup-punchline jokes , instead deriving its humor mostly from the quirky characters , the relationships between family members , and the relatively relatable plots . While the core issues and resolutions are relatable in most episodes , the show nonetheless weaves in fantastical elements , pitching the tone of the show somewhere between observational comedy and farce . The plots are often absurd , but they are grounded by family stories and real-world issues .",
