  "/wiki/Animated": "Animation is a method in which pictures are manipulated to appear as moving images . In traditional animation , images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film . Today , most animations are made with computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) . Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation , while 2D computer animation can be used for stylistic reasons , low bandwidth or faster real-time renderings . Other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts , puppets or clay figures . Commonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other . The illusion - as in motion pictures in general - is thought to rely on the phi phenomenon and beta movement , but the exact causes are still uncertain . Analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the ph\u00e9nakisticope , zoetrope , flip book , praxinoscope and film . Television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally . For display on the computer , techniques like animated GIF and Flash animation were developed . Animation is more pervasive than many people realize .

It borders Hungary to the north , Romania to the northeast , Bulgaria to the southeast , North Macedonia to the south , Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to the west , and Montenegro to the southwest . The country claims a border with Albania through the disputed territory of Kosovo . [ a ] Serbia 's population numbers approximately seven million . Its capital , Belgrade , ranks among the largest citi\u0435s in southeastern Europe . Inhabited since the Paleolithic Age , the territory of modern-day Serbia faced Slavic migrations to Southeastern Europe in the 6th century , establishing several regional states in the early Middle Ages at times recognised as tributaries to the Byzantine , Frankish and Hungarian kingdoms . The Serbian Kingdom obtained recognition by the Holy See and Constantinople in 1217 , reaching its territorial apex in 1346 as the relatively short-lived Serbian Empire . By the mid-16th century , the Ottomans annexed the entirety of modern-day Serbia ; their rule was at times interrupted by the Habsburg Empire , which began expanding towards Central Serbia from the end of the 17th century while maintaining a foothold in Vojvodina . In the early 19th century , the Serbian Revolution established the nation-state as the region 's first constitutional monarchy , which subsequently expanded its territory . Following disastrous casualties in World War I , and the subsequent unification of the former Habsburg crownland of Vojvodina ( and other lands ) with Serbia , the country co-founded Yugoslavia with other South Slavic peoples , which would exist in various political formations until the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s . During the breakup of Yugoslavia , Serbia formed a union with Montenegro , which was peacefully dissolved in 2006 and restoring Serbia 's independence as a sovereign state for the first time since the late 1910s .
