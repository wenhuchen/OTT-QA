Preliminary results showed that the Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) , its Bavarian sister party , the Christian Social Union ( CSU ) , and the Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) won the election , and the three parties announced their intention to form a new centre-right government with Angela Merkel as Chancellor . Their main opponent , Frank-Walter Steinmeier 's Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) , conceded defeat .

Led by Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans since 2019 , the party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in Germany along with the Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) . The Social Democrats have governed at the federal level in Germany as part of a grand coalition with the CDU and the Christian Social Union ( CSU ) since December 2013 following the results of the 2013 and 2017 federal elections . The party participates in 11 of 16 state governments and 7 of them are governed by SPD Minister-Presidents . The SPD is a member of the Party of European Socialists and initiated the founding of the international Progressive Alliance of social-democratic parties on 22 May 2013 after criticising the Socialist International for its acceptance of authoritarian parties . Established in 1863 , the SPD is by far the oldest existing political party represented in the German Parliament and was one of the first Marxist-influenced parties in the world . It was illegal under the Anti-Socialist Laws from 1878 to 1890 . During the First World War , the party split into a pro-war mainstream and the pacifist Independent Social Democratic Party , a part of which went on to form the Communist Party of Germany . The social democrats came to power during the 1918-19 revolution . During the Weimar Republic , the SPD was the strongest party until 1932 and Friedrich Ebert served as the first President of Germany . During the Nazi era ( 1933-45 ) , the SPD was banned , and social democrats offered resistance against Hitler 's dictatorship . After the Second World War , the party was re-established .",
  "/wiki/2005_German_federal_election": "Federal elections were held in Germany on 18 September 2005 to elect the members of the 16th Bundestag . This became necessary after a motion of confidence in Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der failed on 1 July . Following the defeat of Schr\u00f6der 's Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) in a state election , Schr\u00f6der asked his supporters to abstain from the Bundestag motion , knowing the motion would fail and thus triggering an early federal election . The opposition Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) and its sister party in Bavaria , the Christian Social Union ( CSU ) , started the federal election campaign with a 21% lead over the SPD in opinion polls . Many commentators expected the Christian Democrats to win a clear electoral victory and that CDU leader Angela Merkel would become Chancellor , forming a government with the Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) and displacing the governing SPD-Green coalition . However , the CDU/CSU significantly lost momentum during the campaign and ultimately won only 1% more votes and four more seats than the SPD . Exit polls showed clearly that neither coalition group had won a majority of seats in the Bundestag , leading to a hung parliament situation . Both parties lost seats compared to 2002 , as did the Greens , while only the Left Party ( a partial successor of the Party of Democratic Socialism led by Gregor Gysi and former SPD chairman Oskar Lafontaine ) made significant gains . Both Schr\u00f6der and Merkel claimed victory , but the formation of a new government required careful negotiations . On 10 October 2005 , officials from the SPD and the CDU/CSU indicated that negotiations between the two had concluded successfully and that the participating parties would form a grand coalition with Angela Merkel as Chancellor . When the Bundestag met on 22 November 397 CDU/CSU and SPD Bundestag members duly voted for Merkel .",
