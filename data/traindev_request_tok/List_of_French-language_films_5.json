  "/wiki/The_Earrings_of_Madame_de...": "The Earrings of Madame de\u2026 ( French : Madame de\u2026 [ ma.dam d\u0259 ] ) is a 1953 drama film directed by Max Oph\u00fcls , adapted from Louise L\u00e9v\u00eaque de Vilmorin 's novel by Oph\u00fcls , Marcel Archard and Annette Wadement . The film is considered a masterpiece of the 1950s French cinema . Andrew Sarris called it the most perfect film ever made . Oph\u00fcls said the story 's construction attracted him , stating there is always the same axis around which the action continually turns like a carousel . A tiny , scarcely visible axis : a pair of earrings . The film 's different titles reflect on the fact that the surname of the Madame in question - the same as that of her husband 's - is never heard nor seen onscreen . The few times in the film when it might be revealed , it is elided by noise or a camera trick .",
