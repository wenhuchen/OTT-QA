  "/wiki/1500_metres_world_record_progression": "The 1500-metre run became a standard racing distance in Europe in the late 19th century , perhaps as a metric version of the mile , a popular running distance since at least the 1850s in English-speaking countries . A distance of 1500 m sometimes is called the metric mile . The French had the first important races over the distance , holding their initial championship in 1888 . When the Olympic games were revived in 1896 , metric distances were run , including the 1500 . However , most of the best milers in the world were absent , and the winning time of 4:33 1/5 by Australian Edwin Flack was almost 18 seconds slower than the amateur mile record , despite the fact the mile is 109 metres longer than the 1500 metres . The 1900 Olympics and 1904 Olympics showed improvements in times run , but it was not until the 1908 Olympics that a meeting of the top milers over the distance took place , and not until the 1912 Olympics that a true world-class race over the distance was run . The distance has now almost completely replaced the mile in major track meets .",
  "/wiki/Stockholm": "Stockholm ( Swedish pronunciation : [ \u02c8st\u0254\u0302k\u02d0 ( h ) \u0254lm ] ( listen ) ) is the capital and most populous urban area of Sweden . 972,647 people live in the municipality , approximately 1.6 million in the urban area , and 2.4 million in the metropolitan area . The city stretches across fourteen islands where Lake M\u00e4laren flows into the Baltic Sea . Outside the city to the east , and along the coast , is the island chain of the Stockholm archipelago . The area has been settled since the Stone Age , in the 6th millennium BC , and was founded as a city in 1252 by Swedish statesman Birger Jarl . It is also the county seat of Stockholm County . Stockholm is the cultural , media , political , and economic centre of Sweden . The Stockholm region alone accounts for over a third of the country 's GDP , and is among the top 10 regions in Europe by GDP per capita . It is an important global city , and the main centre for corporate headquarters in the Nordic region . The city is home to some of Europe 's top ranking universities , such as the Stockholm School of Economics , Karolinska Institute and KTH Royal Institute of Technology .

  "/wiki/1500_metres": "The 1500 metres or 1,500-metre run ( typically pronounced 'fifteen-hundred metres ' ) is the foremost middle distance track event in athletics . The distance has been contested at the Summer Olympics since 1896 and the World Championships in Athletics since 1983 . It is equivalent to 1.5 kilometers or approximately \u200b15\u204416 miles . The demands of the race are similar to that of the 800 metres , but with a slightly higher emphasis on aerobic endurance and a slightly lower sprint speed requirement . The 1500 metre race is predominantly aerobic , but anaerobic conditioning is also required . Each lap run during the world-record race run by Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco in 1998 in Rome , Italy averaged just under 55 seconds ( or under 13.8 seconds per 100 metres ) . 1,500 metres is three and three-quarter laps around a 400-metre track . During the 1970s and 1980s this race was dominated by British runners , along with an occasional Finn , American , or New Zealander , but through the 1990s many African runners began to win Olympic medals in this race , especially runners from Kenya , Morocco and Algeria . In the Modern Olympic Games , the men 's 1,500-metre race has been contested from the beginning , and at every Olympic Games since . The first winner , in 1896 , was Edwin Flack of Australia , who also won the first gold medal in the 800-metre race . The women 's 1,500-metre race was first added to the Summer Olympics in 1972 , and the winner of the first gold medal was Lyudmila Bragina of the Soviet Union . During the Olympic Games of 1972 through 2008 , the women 's 1,500-metre race has been won by three Soviets plus one Russian , one Italian , one Romanian , one Briton , one Kenyan , and two Algerians .",

Located at the southern tip of the U.S. state of New York , the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area , the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass and one of the world 's most populous megacities , with an estimated 19,979,477 people in its 2018 metropolitan statistical area and 22,679,948 residents in its combined statistical area . A global power city , New York City has been described as the cultural , financial , and media capital of the world , and exerts a significant impact upon commerce , entertainment , research , technology , education , politics , tourism , art , fashion , and sports . The city 's fast pace has inspired the term New York minute . Home to the headquarters of the United Nations , New York is an important center for international diplomacy . Situated on one of the world 's largest natural harbors , New York City consists of five boroughs , each of which is a separate county of the State of New York . The five boroughs - Brooklyn , Queens , Manhattan , The Bronx , and Staten Island - were consolidated into a single city in 1898 .

  "/wiki/Mile_run": "The mile run ( 1,760 yards or exactly 1,609.344 metres ) is a middle-distance foot race . The history of the mile run event began in England , where it was used as a distance for gambling races . It survived track and field 's switch to metric distances in the 1900s and retained its popularity , with the chase for the four-minute mile in the 1950s a high point for the race . In spite of the roughly equivalent 1500 metres race , the mile run is present in all fields of athletics and it remains the only imperial distance for which the IAAF records an official world record . Although the mile does not feature at any major championship competition , the Wanamaker Mile , Dream Mile , and Bowerman Mile races are among the foremost annual middle-distance races indoors and outdoors , respectively . The current mile world record holders are Morocco 's Hicham El Guerrouj with a time of 3:43.13 and Sifan Hassan of The Netherlands with the women 's record of 4:12.33 .",
  "/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York": "Buffalo is the second largest city in the U.S. state of New York and the largest city in Western New York . As of 2018 [ update ] , the population was 256,304 . The city is the county seat of Erie County and a major gateway for commerce and travel across the Canada-United States border , forming part of the bi-national Buffalo Niagara Region . As of the April 1 , 2010 , the metropolitan statistical area ( MSA ) had a population of 1,135,509 ; the combined statistical area ( CSA ) , which adds Cattaraugus County , had a population of 1,215,826 inhabitants . The Buffalo area was inhabited before the 17th century by the Native American Iroquois tribe and later by French colonizers . The city grew significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of immigration , the construction of the Erie Canal and rail transportation , and its close proximity to Lake Erie . This growth provided an abundance of fresh water and an ample trade route to the Midwestern United States while grooming its economy for the grain , steel and automobile industries that dominated the city 's economy in the 20th century . Since the city 's economy relied heavily on manufacturing , deindustrialization in the latter half of the 20th century led to a steady decline in population . While some manufacturing activity remains , Buffalo 's economy has transitioned to service industries with a greater emphasis on healthcare , research and higher education , which emerged following the Great Recession . Buffalo is on the eastern shore of Lake Erie , at the head of the Niagara River , 16 miles ( 26 km ) south of Niagara Falls . Its early embrace of electric power led to the nickname The City of Light . The city is also famous for its urban planning and layout by Joseph Ellicott , an extensive system of parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted , as well as significant architectural works .",
  "/wiki/2000_metres": "Middle-distance running events are track races longer than sprints , up to 3000 metres . The standard middle distances are the 800 metres , 1500 metres and mile run , although the 3000 metres may also be classified as a middle-distance event . The 1500 m came about as a result of running \u200b3 3\u20444 laps of a 400 m outdoor track or \u200b7 1\u20442 laps of a 200 m indoor track , which were commonplace in continental Europe in the 20th century .",

  "/wiki/Copenhagen": "Copenhagen [ a ] ( Danish : K\u00f8benhavn [ k\u02b0\u00f8pm\u0329\u02c8hau\u032f\u02c0n ] ( listen ) ) is the capital and most populous city of Denmark . As of 1 January 2020 , the city had a population of 794,128 , 632,340 in Copenhagen Municipality , 104,305 in Frederiksberg Municipality , 42,989 in T\u00e5rnby Municipality , and 14,494 in Drag\u00f8r Municipality . It forms the core of the wider urban area of Copenhagen ( population 1,320,629 ) and the Copenhagen metropolitan area ( population 2,557,737 ) . Copenhagen is situated on the eastern coast of the island of Zealand ; another small portion of the city is located on Amager , and it is separated from Malm\u00f8 , Sweden , by the strait of \u00d8resund . The \u00d8resund Bridge connects the two cities by rail and road . Originally a Viking fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now Gammel Strand , Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century . Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions , defences and armed forces . During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the Kalmar Union , governing the entire present day Nordic region in a personal union with Sweden and Norway ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state . The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of Scandinavia under the union for well over 120 years , starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion . After a plague outbreak and fire in the 18th century , the city underwent a period of redevelopment . This included construction of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden and founding of such cultural institutions as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts . After further disasters in the early 19th century when Horatio Nelson attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city , rebuilding during the Danish Golden Age brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen 's architecture .",
  "/wiki/3000_metres": "The 3000 metres or 3000-metre run is a track running event , also commonly known as the 3K or 3K run , where 7.5 laps are completed around an outdoor 400 m track or 15 laps around a 200 m indoor track . It is debated whether the 3000m should be classified as a middle distance or long distance event . In elite level competition , 3000 m pace is more comparable to the pace found in the longer 5000 metres event , rather than mile pace . The world record performance for 3000 m equates to a pace of 58.76 seconds per 400 m , which is closer to the 60.58 seconds for 5000 m than the 55.46 seconds for the mile . However , the 3000 m does require some anaerobic conditioning and an elite athlete needs to develop a high tolerance to lactic acid , as does the mile runner . Thus , the 3000 m demands a balance of aerobic endurance needed for the 5000 m and lactic acid tolerance needed for the Mile . In men 's athletics , 3000 metres has been an Olympic discipline only as a team race at the 1912 , 1920 and 1924 Summer Olympics . It has not been contested at any of the IAAF outdoor championships , but is occasionally hosted at annual elite track and field meetings . It is often featured in indoor track and field programmes and is the longest distance event present at the IAAF World Indoor Championships . In women 's athletics , 3000 metres was a standard event in the Olympic Games ( 1984 to 1992 ) and World Championships ( 1980 to 1993 ) . The event was discontinued at World Championship and Olympic level after the 1993 World Championships in Athletics - Qu Yunxia being the final gold medal winner at the event . Starting with the 1995 World Championships in Athletics and the 1996 Olympic Games , it was replaced by 5000 metres , with other IAAF-organized championships following suit .",
  "/wiki/Two_miles": "The 2 mile ( 10,560 feet or exactly 3,218.688 metres ) is a historic running distance . Like the mile run , it is still contested at some invitational meets , perhaps because it provides an easier record to break for meet promoters ( and corresponding bonus payment for participants ) , as well as its historical chronology . It is largely superseded by the 3000 m and 5000 m , and by the 3200 m in NFHS American high school competitions . The IAAF no longer keeps official world records for this distance ; they are called world best instead .
