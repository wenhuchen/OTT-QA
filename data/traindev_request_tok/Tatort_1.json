She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2000 . She graduated from Universite de Paris VI , Pierre and Marie Curie University . She is distinguished for her work on development in insects . Her first major discovery was that pattern formation and growth are regulated by the same mechanism . By a study of genetic mosaics she demonstrated that cells develop into particular structures by means of local interactions with their neighbours . She has made major contributions to the understanding of the process of lateral inhibition , whereby initially equivalent cells interact between themselves and subsequently adopt different fates . This process involves a conserved cellular receptor and is equally important in mammals ; the work can be related to studies on human development and disease .",
