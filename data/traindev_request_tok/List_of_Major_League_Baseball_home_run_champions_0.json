Nobody in baseball had as many RBIs or extra base hits as Veach from 1915 to 1922 . Veach was also among the best defensive outfielders of his era , regularly ranking among the league leaders in putouts , range factor , and fielding percentage . Despite being one of the most productive hitters in baseball during his years in Detroit , Veach played in the shadows of three Detroit outfielders who won 16 batting titles and were inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame : Cobb in center field and Sam Crawford followed by Harry Heilmann in right field . Detroit 's 1915 outfield consisting of Veach , Cobb , and Crawford has been ranked by baseball historian and statistician Bill James as the greatest outfield in history .",

  "/wiki/Babe_Ruth": "George Herman Babe Ruth Jr. ( February 6 , 1895 - August 16 , 1948 ) was an American professional baseball player whose career in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) spanned 22 seasons , from 1914 through 1935 . Nicknamed The Bambino and The Sultan of Swat , he began his MLB career as a star left-handed pitcher for the Boston Red Sox , but achieved his greatest fame as a slugging outfielder for the New York Yankees . Ruth established many MLB batting ( and some pitching ) records , including career home runs ( 714 ) , runs batted in ( RBIs ) ( 2,213 ) , bases on balls ( 2,062 ) , slugging percentage ( .690 ) , and on-base plus slugging ( OPS ) ( 1.164 ) ; the last two still stand as of 2019 [ update ] . Ruth is regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in American culture and is considered by many to be the greatest baseball player of all time . In 1936 , Ruth was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame as one of its first five inaugural members . At age seven , Ruth was sent to St. Mary 's Industrial School for Boys , a reformatory where he was mentored by Brother Matthias Boutlier of the Xaverian Brothers , the school 's disciplinarian and a capable baseball player . In 1914 , Ruth was signed to play minor-league baseball for the Baltimore Orioles but was soon sold to the Red Sox . By 1916 , he had built a reputation as an outstanding pitcher who sometimes hit long home runs , a feat unusual for any player in the pre-1920 dead-ball era . Although Ruth twice won 23 games in a season as a pitcher and was a member of three World Series championship teams with the Red Sox , he wanted to play every day and was allowed to convert to an outfielder . With regular playing time , he broke the MLB single-season home run record in 1919 . After that season , Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold Ruth to the Yankees amid controversy . The trade fueled Boston 's subsequent 86-year championship drought and popularized the Curse of the Bambino superstition .",
