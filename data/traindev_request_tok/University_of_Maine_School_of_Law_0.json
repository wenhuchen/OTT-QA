  "/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives": "The United States House of Representatives is the lower house of the United States Congress , the Senate being the upper house . Together they compose the national legislature of the United States . The composition of the House is established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The House is composed of representatives who sit in congressional districts that are allocated to each of the 50 states on a basis of population as measured by the U.S. Census , with each district entitled to one representative . Since its inception in 1789 , all representatives have been directly elected . The total number of voting representatives is fixed by law at 435 . As of the 2010 Census , the largest delegation is that of California , with fifty-three representatives . Seven states have only one representative : Alaska , Delaware , Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota , Vermont , and Wyoming . The House is charged with the passage of federal legislation , known as bills , which , after concurrence by the Senate , are sent to the president for consideration . In addition to this basic power , the House has certain exclusive powers , among them the power to initiate all bills related to revenue ; the impeachment of federal officers , who are sent to trial before the Senate ; and , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for president , the duty falls upon the House to elect one of the top three recipients of electors for that office , with one vote given to each state for that purpose . The House meets in the south wing of the United States Capitol . The presiding officer is the speaker of the House , who is elected by the members thereof ( and is therefore traditionally the leader of the controlling party ) .",

Located in New England , it is bordered by New Hampshire to the west , the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast , and the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Qu\u00e9bec to the northeast and northwest , respectively .

There is a humid continental climate throughout most of the state , including coastal areas . Maine 's most populous city is Portland and its capital is Augusta . For thousands of years , indigenous peoples were the only inhabitants of the territory that is now Maine . At the time of European arrival in what is now Maine , several Algonquian-speaking peoples inhabited the area . The first European settlement in the area was by the French in 1604 on Saint Croix Island , by Pierre Dugua , Sieur de Mons . The first English settlement was the short-lived Popham Colony , established by the Plymouth Company in 1607 . A number of English settlements were established along the coast of Maine in the 1620s , although the rugged climate , deprivations , and conflict with the local peoples caused many to fail over the years .",

The Supreme Court justices are appointed by the Governor of Vermont with confirmation by the Vermont Senate . When a judicial vacancy occurs , the judicial nominating board submits to the governor the names of as many persons as it deems qualified for appointment . All Supreme Court justices come up for retention at the same time every six years . The next retention date is March 31 , 2023 . The Joint Committee on Judicial Retention reviews a justice 's performance during the previous term and recommends to the Vermont General Assembly whether the justice should be retained . The committee consists of four House members appointed by the Speaker of the House and four Senate members appointed by the Committee on Committees . After open debate and discussion , the General Assembly votes by secret ballot , with a majority having to vote against reappointment for a justice to be denied another term . In addition to the retention process , any Vermont judge may be removed at any time in one of two ways : ( 1 ) Judges may be impeached by a two-thirds vote of the General Assembly and convicted by a two-thirds vote of the Senate , and ( 2 ) a Judicial Conduct Board investigates complaints of judicial misconduct or disability and recommends any necessary action to the Supreme Court .

It is composed of seven justices , who are appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Maine Senate . From 1820 until 1839 , justices served lifetime appointments with a mandatory retirement age of 70 . Beginning in 1839 , justices are appointed for seven-year terms , with no limit on the number of terms that they may serve . Known as the Law Court when sitting as an appellate court , the Supreme Court 's other functions include hearing appeals of sentences longer than one year of incarceration , overseeing admission to the bar and the conduct of its members , and promulgating rules for all the state 's courts . The Maine Supreme Judicial Court is one of the few state supreme courts in the United States authorized to issue advisory opinions , which it does upon request by the governor or legislature , as set out in the Maine Constitution . It is also unusual for a state 's highest appellate court in that its primary location is not that of the state 's capital city , Augusta , partially because the Kennebec County Courthouse did not have a courtroom large enough for the Supreme Court 's proceedings . The court did meet there from 1830 until 1970 , when it permanently moved to the Cumberland County Courthouse . The renovation of the Kennebec County Courthouse in 2015 , which included expansion of the bench in its largest courtroom to permit all 7 MSJC justices to sit there , will allow the court to meet there at least twice a year . It will also continue to meet in Portland , Bangor , and at high schools around the state . The MSJC is also authorized to rule on the fitness of the Governor of Maine to serve in office , which it does upon the Maine Secretary of State certifying to the court that the governor is temporarily unable to carry out the duties of that office . The court must then hold a hearing and , if it agrees that the governor is unfit , declare the office of governor temporarily vacant and transfer its duties to the President of the Maine Senate , who would serve as acting governor .",
