Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly - the moons - two are larger than the smallest planet , Mercury . [ d ] The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud . The vast majority of the system 's mass is in the Sun , with the majority of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter . The four smaller inner planets , Mercury , Venus , Earth and Mars , are terrestrial planets , being primarily composed of rock and metal . The four outer planets are giant planets , being substantially more massive than the terrestrials . The two largest , Jupiter and Saturn , are gas giants , being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium ; the two outermost planets , Uranus and Neptune , are ice giants , being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium , called volatiles , such as water , ammonia and methane . All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic . The Solar System also contains smaller objects . [ e ] The asteroid belt , which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter , mostly contains objects composed , like the terrestrial planets , of rock and metal . Beyond Neptune 's orbit lie the Kuiper belt and scattered disc , which are populations of trans-Neptunian objects composed mostly of ices , and beyond them a newly discovered population of sednoids .",

  "/wiki/Crust_(geology)": "In geology , the crust is the outermost solid shell of a rocky planet , dwarf planet , or natural satellite . It is usually distinguished from the underlying mantle by its chemical makeup ; however , in the case of icy satellites , it may be distinguished based on its phase ( solid crust vs. liquid mantle ) . The crusts of Earth , Moon , Mercury , Venus , Mars , Io , and other planetary bodies formed via igneous processes , and were later modified by erosion , impact cratering , volcanism , and sedimentation . Most terrestrial planets have fairly uniform crusts . Earth , however , has two distinct types : continental crust and oceanic crust . These two types have different chemical compositions and physical properties , and were formed by different geological processes .",

A simulation game attempts to copy various activities from real life in the form of a game for various purposes such as training , analysis , or prediction . Usually there are no strictly defined goals in the game , with the player instead allowed to control a character or environment freely . Well-known examples are war games , business games , and role play simulation . From three basic types of strategic , planning , and learning exercises : games , simulations , and case studies , a number of hybrids may be considered , including simulation games that are used as case studies .

  "/wiki/Real-time_strategy": "Real-time strategy ( RTS ) is a sub-genre of strategy video games in which the game does not progress incrementally in turns . This is distinguished from turn-based strategy ( TBS ) , in which all players take turns when playing . In an RTS , the participants position and maneuver units and structures under their control to secure areas of the map and/or destroy their opponents ' assets . In a typical RTS , it is possible to create additional units and structures during the course of a game . This is generally limited by a requirement to expend accumulated resources . These resources are in turn garnered by controlling special points on the map and/or possessing certain types of units and structures devoted to this purpose . More specifically , the typical game of the RTS genre features resource gathering , base building , in-game technological development and indirect control of units . The term real-time strategy was coined by Brett Sperry to market Dune II in the early 1990s . The tasks a player must perform to succeed at an RTS can be very demanding , and complex user interfaces have evolved to cope with the challenge . Some features have been borrowed from desktop environments ; for example , the technique of clicking and dragging to select all units under a given area . Though some game genres share conceptual and gameplay similarities with the RTS template , recognized genres are generally not subsumed as RTS games . For instance , city-building games , construction and management simulations , and games of the real-time tactics variety are generally not considered to be real-time strategy .",

  "/wiki/First-person_shooter": "First-person shooter ( FPS ) is a video game genre centered on gun and other weapon-based combat in a first-person perspective ; that is , the player experiences the action through the eyes of the protagonist . The genre shares common traits with other shooter games , which in turn makes it fall under the heading action game . Since the genre 's inception , advanced 3D and pseudo-3D graphics have challenged hardware development , and multiplayer gaming has been integral . The first-person shooter genre has been traced as far back as Maze War , development of which began in 1973 , and 1974 's Spasim . Later , and after more playful titles like MIDI Maze in 1987 , the genre coalesced into a more violent form with 1992 's Wolfenstein 3D , which has been credited with creating the genre 's basic archetype upon which subsequent titles were based . One such title , and the progenitor of the genre 's wider mainstream acceptance and popularity , was Doom , one of the most influential games in this genre ; for some years , the term Doom clone was used to designate this genre due to Doom 's influence . Corridor shooter was another common name for the genre in its early years , since processing limitations of the era 's hardware meant that most of the action in the games had to take place in enclosed areas , such as in cramped spaces like corridors and tunnels . 1998 's Half-Life - along with its 2004 sequel Half-Life 2 - enhanced the narrative and puzzle elements . In 1999 , the Half-Life mod Counter-Strike was released and , together with Doom , is perhaps one of the most influential first-person shooters . GoldenEye 007 , released in 1997 , was a landmark first-person shooter for home consoles , while the Halo series heightened the console 's commercial and critical appeal as a platform for first-person shooter titles . In the 21st century , the first-person shooter is the most commercially viable video game genre , and in 2016 , shooters accounted for over 27% of all video game sales .

The main story takes place in the year 2277 , around 36 years after the events of Fallout 2 , of which it is not a direct sequel .

  "/wiki/Role-playing_game": "A role-playing game ( sometimes spelled roleplaying game ; abbreviated RPG ) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting . Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative , either through literal acting , or through a process of structured decision-making regarding character development . Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines . There are several forms of role-playing games . The original form , sometimes called the tabletop role-playing game ( TRPG ) , is conducted through discussion , whereas in live action role-playing ( LARP ) , players physically perform their characters ' actions . In both of these forms , an arranger called a game master ( GM ) usually decides on the rules and setting to be used , while acting as the referee ; each of the other players takes on the role of a single character . Several varieties of RPG also exist in electronic media , such as multiplayer text-based Multi-User Dungeons ( MUDs ) and their graphics-based successors , massively multiplayer online role-playing games ( MMORPGs ) . Role-playing games also include single-player role-playing video games in which players control a character , or team of characters , who undertake ( s ) quests , and may include player capabilities that advance using statistical mechanics . These electronic games sometimes share settings and rules with tabletop RPGs , but emphasize character advancement more than collaborative storytelling . This type of game is well-established , so some RPG-related game forms , such as trading/collectible card games ( CCGs ) and wargames , may not be included under the definition . Some amount of role-playing activity may be present in such games , but it is not the primary focus .

At a distance of just under 12 light-years ( 3.7 parsecs ) from the Solar System , it is a relatively nearby star and the closest solitary G-class star . The star appears stable , with little stellar variation , and is metal-deficient . Observations have detected more than ten times as much dust surrounding Tau Ceti as is present in the Solar System . Since December 2012 , there has been evidence of possibly five planets orbiting Tau Ceti , with two of these being potentially in the habitable zone . Because of its debris disk , any planet orbiting Tau Ceti would face far more impact events than Earth . Despite this hurdle to habitability , its solar analog ( Sun-like ) characteristics have led to widespread interest in the star . Given its stability , similarity and relative proximity to the Sun , Tau Ceti is consistently listed as a target for the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence ( SETI ) and appears in some science fiction literature . It can be seen with the unaided eye with an apparent magnitude of 3.5 .
