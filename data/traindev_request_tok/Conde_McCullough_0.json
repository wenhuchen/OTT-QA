  "/wiki/Astoria,_Oregon": "Astoria is a port city and the seat of Clatsop County , Oregon , United States . Founded in 1811 , Astoria is the oldest city in the state of Oregon and was the first American settlement west of the Rocky Mountains . Astoria is located on the south shore of the Columbia River , where the river meets the Pacific Ocean . The city is named for John Jacob Astor , an investor from New York City whose American Fur Company founded Fort Astoria at the site . Astoria was incorporated by the Oregon Legislative Assembly on October 20 , 1876 . The city is served by the deepwater Port of Astoria . Transportation includes the Astoria Regional Airport with U.S. Route 30 and U.S. Route 101 as the main highways , and the 4.1-mile ( 6.6 km ) Astoria-Megler Bridge connecting to neighboring Washington across the river .

  "/wiki/U.S._Route_101_(Oregon)": "U.S. Route 101 ( US 101 ) , is a major north-south U.S. Highway in Oregon that runs through the state along the coastline near the Pacific Ocean . It runs from the California border , south of Brookings , to the Washington state line on the Columbia River , between Astoria , Oregon , and Megler , Washington . US 101 is designated as the Oregon Coast Highway No . 9 ( see Oregon highways and routes ) , as it serves the Oregon Coast region . Much of the highway runs between the Pacific Ocean and the Oregon Coast Range , thus US 101 is frequently mountainous in character . For most of its length it is a two-lane undivided highway . Many parts of the highway are subject to closure due to landslides caused by excessive rainfall , and in many parts of the coast , US 101 is the only viable route connecting certain coastal communities . Thus , in many cases when landslides block US 101 , the detour requires traveling inland over the Coast Range to alternative north-south routes in the Willamette Valley and then back west over the Coast Range again . US 101 is often the main street through coastal towns in Oregon , which can cause significant traffic delays . This is especially true in Lincoln City , where geography and tourism combine to create traffic problems .",

It was built and is owned by the Oregon Department of Transportation ( ODOT ) as part of Oregon Route 43 and is the third-southernmost Willamette bridge in the Portland metropolitan area , after the Boone Bridge in Wilsonville and the Oregon 219 bridge near Newberg . The bridge is 745 ft ( 227 m ) in length and 28 ft ( 8\u00bd m ) wide with a 360 ft ( 110 m ) long main span that provides 49 ft ( 15 m ) of vertical clearance at low river levels . The narrow width causes problems for large vehicles that cross it , often requiring traffic going in the other direction to stop . TriMet buses ceased using the bridge in 2009 . This bridge is the only Oregon bridge to be encased in gunite , which protects it from corrosive sulfur dioxide emissions from paper mills south of the bridge . The concrete look was favored by bridge designer Conde McCullough , designer of 500 Oregon bridges . His signature detailing is evident in the obelisk pylons with sconced light fixtures , ornate railings , and Art Deco piers . The Oregon City Bridge is just downstream from the 40 ft ( 12 m ) tall Willamette Falls and the Willamette Falls Locks , the oldest navigational locks in the United States .
