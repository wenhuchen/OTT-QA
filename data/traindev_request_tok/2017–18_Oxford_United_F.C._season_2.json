  "/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)": "The goalkeeper , often shortened to keeper or goalie , is one of the major positions of association football . It is the most specialised position in the sport . The goalkeeper 's primary role is to prevent the opposing team from scoring ( moving the ball over the defended goal-line within the frame of the goal ) . This is accomplished by the goalkeeper moving into the path of the ball and either catching it or directing it away from the vicinity of the goal line . Within the penalty area goalkeepers are able to use their hands , making them ( outside throw-ins ) the only players on the field permitted to handle the ball . The special status of goalkeepers is indicated by them wearing different coloured kits from their teammates . The back-pass rule prevents goalkeepers handling direct passes back to them from teammates . Goalkeepers usually perform goal kicks , and also give commands to their defence during corner kicks , direct and indirect free kicks , and marking . Goalkeepers play an important role in directing on field strategy as they have an unrestricted view of the entire pitch , giving them a unique perspective on play development . The goalkeeper is the only required position of a team . If they are injured or sent off , a substitute goalkeeper has to take their place , otherwise an outfield player must take the ejected keeper 's place in goal . In order to replace a goalkeeper who is sent off , a team usually substitutes an outfield player for the backup keeper ( thus effectively the red card and substitution takes out two of the starting eleven players ) .",

  "/wiki/Midfielder": "A midfielder is an association football position . Midfielders are generally positioned on the field between their team 's defenders and forwards . Some midfielders play a disciplined defensive role , breaking up attacks , and are otherwise known as defensive midfielders .

The number of midfielders on a team and their assigned roles depends on the team 's formation ; the collective group of these players on the field is sometimes referred to as the midfield . Most managers assign at least one midfielder to disrupt the opposing team 's attacks , while others may be tasked with creating goals , or have equal responsibilities between attack and defence . Midfielders are the players who typically travel the greatest distance during a match . Because midfielders arguably have the most possession during a game they are among the fittest players on the pitch .",

  "/wiki/Retirement": "Retirement is the withdrawal from one 's position or occupation or from one 's active working life . A person may also semi-retire by reducing work hours . An increasing number of individuals are choosing to put off this point of total retirement , by selecting to exist in the emerging state of pre-tirement . Some people who have retired from a position with a pre-nominal title , particularly military officers , are often listed with a post-nominal indicating retirement , e.g. , Admiral John Smith ( ret ) ( or rtd or retd ) . Many people choose to retire when they are eligible for private or public pension benefits , although some are forced to retire when bodily conditions no longer allow the person to work any longer ( by illness or accident ) or as a result of legislation concerning their position . In most countries , the idea of retirement is of recent origin , being introduced during the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Previously , low life expectancy and the absence of pension arrangements meant that most workers continued to work until death . Germany was the first country to introduce retirement benefits in 1889 . Nowadays , most developed countries have systems to provide pensions on retirement in old age , funded by employers or the state . In many poorer countries there is no support for the old beyond that provided through the family . Today , retirement with a pension is considered a right of the worker in many societies ; hard ideological , social , cultural and political battles have been fought over whether this is a right . In many western countries , this is a right embodied in national constitutions .",
