A standalone sequel to The Fast and the Furious ( 2001 ) , it is the second installment in The Fast Saga franchise and stars Paul Walker , Tyrese Gibson , Eva Mendes , Cole Hauser , Chris Ludacris Bridges , and James Remar . 2 Fast 2 Furious follows Brian O'Conner ( Walker ) and Roman Pearce ( Gibson ) who team up to go undercover for the U.S. Customs Service to bring down drug lord Carter Verone ( Hauser ) in exchange for the erasure of their criminal records . Plans for a The Fast and the Furious sequel were developed immediately following the box office success of the first entry . Early treatments for a sequel initially featured the returns of both Vin Diesel and Walker , however , the former declined , instead opting to star in The Chronicles of Riddick ( 2004 ) . As a result of this , Universal Studios delayed the start of filming to allow for script rewrites , which subsequently allowed for the franchise 's long-running characters of Roman Pearce and Tej Parker to be introduced . In August 2002 , John Singleton , who critically praised the first film , was announced to direct the second in place of Rob Cohen , who left the franchise after directing the previous installment . Principal photography began in Miami in October 2002 , with the majority of filming being done on location in Miami and South Florida . 2 Fast 2 Furious was released in the United States on June 6 , 2003 . The film was a commercial success , grossing over $ 236 million worldwide , quickly becoming the highest-grossing film in the franchise and the 16th highest-grossing film of 2003 . It received generally mixed reviews at the time of release , with praise being aimed at the film 's action sequences , but was also nominated for two awards at the 24th Golden Raspberry Awards . In later years , however , the film was reassessed by some critics who noted it as an underrated entry in the franchise .",
