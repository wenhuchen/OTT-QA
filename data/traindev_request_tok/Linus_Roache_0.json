It was filmed in St. Abbs , Scotland . Shue and Goldsmith received Saturn Award nominations for their contributions .

Franklin was a devotee of Alfred Hitchcock - he had recently directed Psycho II - and said after filming I hesitate to liken it to The Birds because everyone will say Oh shit , he 's doing Hitchcock again .

The film , which was principally shot in the United Kingdom , Iceland and Chicago , relied heavily on traditional stunts and miniature effects , with computer-generated imagery being used in a minimal capacity compared to other action films . Comic book storylines such as The Man Who Falls , Batman : Year One and Batman : The Long Halloween served as inspiration . Batman Begins opened on June 15 , 2005 , in the United States and Canada in 3,858 theaters .
