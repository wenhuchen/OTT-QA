The Grand Canyon is 277 miles ( 446 km ) long , up to 18 miles ( 29 km ) wide and attains a depth of over a mile ( 6,093 feet or 1,857 meters ) . The canyon and adjacent rim are contained within Grand Canyon National Park , the Kaibab National Forest , Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument , the Hualapai Indian Reservation , the Havasupai Indian Reservation and the Navajo Nation . President Theodore Roosevelt was a major proponent of preservation of the Grand Canyon area , and visited it on numerous occasions to hunt and enjoy the scenery . Nearly two billion years of Earth 's geological history have been exposed as the Colorado River and its tributaries cut their channels through layer after layer of rock while the Colorado Plateau was uplifted . While some aspects about the history of incision of the canyon are debated by geologists , several recent studies support the hypothesis that the Colorado River established its course through the area about 5 to 6 million years ago . Since that time , the Colorado River has driven the down-cutting of the tributaries and retreat of the cliffs , simultaneously deepening and widening the canyon . For thousands of years , the area has been continuously inhabited by Native Americans , who built settlements within the canyon and its many caves . The Pueblo people considered the Grand Canyon a holy site , and made pilgrimages to it .

In October 1926 , just three months after the first human artifact was uncovered at the Folsom Site , Byron Cummings , first Head of the Archaeology Department at the University of Arizona , led four students to Whitewater Draw . Discovered by a schoolboy , the Double Adobe site contained the skull of a mammoth overlying a sand layer containing stone artifacts . One of these students was Emil Haury . Later investigators found that the bones and artifacts were mixed by redeposited stream sediments , confusing the early interpretations . Fossil bones of mammoth , horse , bison , antelope , coyote and dire wolf were found associated with the artifacts , which included fire-cracked rock , projectile points , and small grinding stones . The presence of grinding stones has been interpreted to mean that people were beginning to adapt to the changes brought by the end of the Ice Age and the extinction of many of the large mammals . The coming of the Holocene Era ( 10,000 years Before Present ) brought warmer and drier conditions to the Southwest . As a result , by 11,000-10,500 BP the Clovis culture was beginning to give way to more regional variants , which are generally called the Archaic cultures . E. B. Sayles ' and E.

  "/wiki/Hoover_Dam": "Hoover Dam is a concrete arch-gravity dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River , on the border between the U.S. states of Nevada and Arizona . It was constructed between 1931 and 1936 during the Great Depression and was dedicated on September 30 , 1935 , by President Franklin D. Roosevelt . Its construction was the result of a massive effort involving thousands of workers , and cost over one hundred lives . Originally known as Boulder Dam from 1933 , it was officially renamed Hoover Dam , for President Herbert Hoover , by a joint resolution of Congress in 1947 . Since about 1900 , the Black Canyon and nearby Boulder Canyon had been investigated for their potential to support a dam that would control floods , provide irrigation water and produce hydroelectric power . In 1928 , Congress authorized the project . The winning bid to build the dam was submitted by a consortium called Six Companies , Inc. , which began construction of the dam in early 1931 . Such a large concrete structure had never been built before , and some of the techniques were unproven . The torrid summer weather and lack of facilities near the site also presented difficulties . Nevertheless , Six Companies turned the dam over to the federal government on March 1 , 1936 , more than two years ahead of schedule . Hoover Dam impounds Lake Mead , the largest reservoir in the United States by volume ( when it is full ) . The dam is located near Boulder City , Nevada , a municipality originally constructed for workers on the construction project , about 30 mi ( 48 km ) southeast of Las Vegas , Nevada .",

  "/wiki/Jerome,_Arizona": "Jerome is a town in the Black Hills of Yavapai County in the U.S. state of Arizona . Founded in the late 19th century on Cleopatra Hill overlooking the Verde Valley , it is more than 5,000 feet ( 1,500 m ) above sea level . It is about 100 miles ( 160 km ) north of Phoenix along State Route 89A between Sedona and Prescott . Supported in its heyday by rich copper mines , it was home to more than 10,000 people in the 1920s . As of the 2010 census , its population was 444 . The town owes its existence mainly to two ore bodies that formed about 1.75 billion years ago along a ring fault in the caldera of an undersea volcano . Tectonic plate movements , plate collisions , uplift , deposition , erosion , and other geologic processes eventually exposed the tip of one of the ore bodies and pushed the other close to the surface , both near Jerome . In the late 19th century , the United Verde Mine , developed by William A. Clark , extracted ore bearing copper , gold , silver , and other metals from the larger of the two . The United Verde Extension UVX Mine , owned by James Douglas , Jr. , depended on the other huge deposit . In total , the copper deposits discovered in the vicinity of Jerome were among the richest ever found . Jerome made news in 1917 , when strikes involving the Industrial Workers of the World ( IWW ) led to the expulsion at gunpoint of about 60 IWW members , who were loaded on a cattle car and shipped west . Production at the mines , always subject to fluctuations , boomed during World War I , fell thereafter , rose again , then fell again during and after the Great Depression .",
