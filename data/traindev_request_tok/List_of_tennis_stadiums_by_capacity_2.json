According to the 2011 Indian census , it is the seventh most populous city ; the city had a population of 4.5 million , while the suburb population brought the total to 14.1 million , making it the third-most populous metropolitan area in India . Kolkata Megalopolis is the area surrounding Kolkata Metropolitan city with additional population . Located on the east bank of the Hooghly River approximately 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) west of the border with Bangladesh , it is the principal commercial , cultural , and educational centre of East India , while the Port of Kolkata is India 's oldest operating port and its sole major riverine port . The city , nicknamed the City of Joy is widely regarded as the cultural capital of India and as of 2019 , six Nobel Laureates have been associated with the city . Recent estimates of Kolkata Metropolitan Area 's economy have ranged from $ 60 to $ 150 billion ( GDP adjusted for purchasing power parity ) making it third most-productive metropolitan area in India , after Mumbai and Delhi . In the late 17th century , the three villages that predated Calcutta were ruled by the Nawab of Bengal under Mughal suzerainty . After the Nawab granted the East India Company a trading licence in 1690 , the area was developed by the Company into an increasingly fortified trading post . Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah occupied Calcutta in 1756 , and the East India Company retook it the following year . In 1793 the East India company was strong enough to abolish Nizamat ( local rule ) , and assumed full sovereignty of the region . Under the company rule , and later under the British Raj , Calcutta served as the capital of British-held territories in India until 1911 , when its perceived geographical disadvantages , combined with growing nationalism in Bengal , led to a shift of the capital to New Delhi . Calcutta was the centre for the Indian independence movement ; it remains a hotbed of contemporary state politics .",

  "/wiki/National_Tennis_Centre_(Canada)": "The original National Tennis Centre in Toronto was located in the north end of York University 's Keele campus next to the Metro Toronto Track and Field Centre . Built in the late 1970s and originally the courts were clay , they were later changed to Har-Tru . The site was too small ( boxed in by Steeles Avenue on the north , parking lots to the west and south and historic Jacob Stong House and Barn to the east ) for the growing tournament , as pressure from the ATP + WTA Tours collectively forced the building of a new site on the west end of York University . The site had 6 courts for play , and 4 practice courts ( used for housing player facilities ) . The main structure was an open-air stadium with wooden seats and was not suitable for a first class tennis tour . The stadium held roughly 10,000 fans , and a second show court held roughly 2,000 . In 2003 the stadium was torn down and replaced by the Rexall Centre , located to the west of this site . The centre court has been demolished with area fenced off , but the 8 outer courts are still present ( 2 other courts are covered over ) . York University uses the building at 190 Albany Road for office space .

Toronto is an international centre of business , finance , arts , and culture , and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world . People have travelled through and inhabited the Toronto area , located on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers , deep ravines , and urban forest , for more than 10,000 years . After the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase , when the Mississauga surrendered the area to the British Crown , the British established the town of York in 1793 and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada . During the War of 1812 , the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy damage by American troops . York was renamed and incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto . It was designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation . The city proper has since expanded past its original borders through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of 630.2 km2 ( 243.3 sq mi ) . The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada . More than 50 percent of residents belong to a visible minority population group , and over 200 distinct ethnic origins are represented among its inhabitants .",
