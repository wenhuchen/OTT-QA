  "/wiki/KL_Sentral": "Kuala Lumpur Sentral ( KL Sentral ) or Stesen Sentral Kuala Lumpur is a transit-oriented development that houses the main railway station of Kuala Lumpur , the capital of Malaysia . Opened on 16 April 2001 , KL Sentral replaced the old Kuala Lumpur railway station as the city 's main intercity railway station . KL Sentral is the largest railway station in Malaysia .

All the railway components of the scheme have been completed , and NU Sentral shopping mall is located here . It was also designed to be a new business and financial hub for Kuala Lumpur .",
  "/wiki/Spanish_solution": "In railway and rapid transit parlance , the Spanish solution is a station layout with two railway platforms , one on each side of the track . This platform arrangement allows the separation of passenger streams by using one platform only for boarding and the other one only for alighting . The concept of separate platforms for boarding and alighting has been proven effective at stations with high passenger numbers .",
  "/wiki/Paid_area": "In rail transport , the paid area is a dedicated inner zone in a railway station or metro station barriers , which visitor or passenger requires a valid ticket , checked smartcard or a pass to get in . A system using paid areas is often called fare control . Passengers are allowed to enter or exit only through a faregate . A paid area usually exists in rapid transit railway stations for separating the train platform from the station exit , ensuring a passenger has paid or prepaid before reaching the platform and using any transport service . Such design requires a well-organized railway station layout . The paid area is similar in concept to the airside at an airport . However , in most cases entrance to the paid area requires only a valid ticket or transit pass . The exception is in certain cases of international rail travel , where passengers must also pass through immigration control and customs to enter the paid area . Examples include the Eurostar international platforms at St. Pancras railway station and Gare du Nord , Woodlands Train Checkpoint in Singapore , where the only departures are to neighbouring Malaysia , as well as Hung Hom Station , Lo Wu Station , Lok Ma Chau Station and Hong Kong West Kowloon Station in Hong Kong . In some rapid transit systems , passengers are banned from eating or drinking inside the paid area of every station .",
