  "/wiki/Basal_Ganglia": "The basal ganglia ( or basal nuclei ) are a group of subcortical nuclei , of varied origin , in the brains of vertebrates , including humans , which are situated at the base of the forebrain and top of the midbrain . There are some differences in the basal ganglia of primates . Basal ganglia are strongly interconnected with the cerebral cortex , thalamus , and brainstem , as well as several other brain areas . The basal ganglia are associated with a variety of functions , including control of voluntary motor movements , procedural learning , habit learning , eye movements , cognition , and emotion . The main components of the basal ganglia - as defined functionally - are the striatum ; both dorsal striatum ( caudate nucleus and putamen ) and ventral striatum ( nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle ) , globus pallidus , ventral pallidum , substantia nigra , and subthalamic nucleus . Each of these components has a complex internal anatomical and neurochemical organization . The largest component , the striatum ( dorsal and ventral ) , receives input from many brain areas beyond the basal ganglia , but only sends output to other components of the basal ganglia . The pallidum receives input from the striatum , and sends inhibitory output to a number of motor-related areas . The substantia nigra is the source of the striatal input of the neurotransmitter dopamine , which plays an important role in basal ganglia function . The subthalamic nucleus receives input mainly from the striatum and cerebral cortex , and projects to the globus pallidus . Popular theories implicate the basal ganglia primarily in action selection - in helping to decide which of several possible behaviors to execute at any given time . In more specific terms , the basal ganglia 's primary function is likely to control and regulate activities of the motor and premotor cortical areas so that voluntary movements can be performed smoothly .",

  "/wiki/Drug_delivery": "Drug delivery refers to approaches , formulations , technologies , and systems for transporting a pharmaceutical compound in the body some time based on nanoparticles as needed to safely achieve its desired therapeutic effect . It may involve scientific site-targeting within the body , or it might involve facilitating systemic pharmacokinetics ; in any case , it is typically concerned with both quantity and duration of drug presence . Drug delivery is often approached via a drug 's chemical formulation , but it may also involve medical devices or drug-device combination products . Drug delivery is a concept heavily integrated with dosage form and route of administration , the latter sometimes even being considered part of the definition . Drug delivery technologies modify drug release profile , absorption , distribution and elimination for the benefit of improving product efficacy and safety , as well as patient convenience and compliance . Drug release is from : diffusion , degradation , swelling , and affinity-based mechanisms . Some of the common routes of administration include the enteral ( gastrointestinal tract ) , parenteral ( via injections ) , inhalation , transdermal , topical and oral routes . Many medications such as peptide and protein , antibody , vaccine and gene based drugs , in general may not be delivered using these routes because they might be susceptible to enzymatic degradation or can not be absorbed into the systemic circulation efficiently due to molecular size and charge issues to be therapeutically effective . For this reason many protein and peptide drugs have to be delivered by injection or a nanoneedle array . For example , many immunizations are based on the delivery of protein drugs and are often done by injection . Protein drugs delivered by injection can usually reach the extracellular space . Many approaches have been evaluated for targeting the intracellular space with protein drugs but delivering proteins into cells ( e.g .",

Employing techniques from other mathematical sciences , such as mathematical modeling , statistical analysis , and mathematical optimization , operations research arrives at optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex decision-making problems . Because of its emphasis on human-technology interaction and because of its focus on practical applications , operations research has overlap with other disciplines , notably industrial engineering and operations management , and draws on psychology and organization science . Operations research is often concerned with determining the extreme values of some real-world objective : the maximum ( of profit , performance , or yield ) or minimum ( of loss , risk , or cost ) .

  "/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)": "RSA ( Rivest-Shamir-Adleman ) is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission . In such a cryptosystem , the encryption key is public and it is different from the decryption key which is kept secret ( private ) . In RSA , this asymmetry is based on the practical difficulty of the factorization of the product of two large prime numbers , the factoring problem . The acronym RSA is made of the initial letters of the surnames of Ron Rivest , Adi Shamir , and Leonard Adleman , who first publicly described the algorithm in 1977 . Clifford Cocks , an English mathematician working for the British intelligence agency Government Communications Headquarters ( GCHQ ) , had developed an equivalent system in 1973 , but this was not declassified until 1997 . A user of RSA creates and then publishes a public key based on two large prime numbers , along with an auxiliary value . The prime numbers must be kept secret . Anyone can use the public key to encrypt a message , but only someone with knowledge of the prime numbers can decode the message . Breaking RSA encryption is known as the RSA problem . Whether it is as difficult as the factoring problem remains an open question . There are currently no published methods to defeat the system if a large enough key is used . RSA is a relatively slow algorithm , and because of this , it is less commonly used to directly encrypt user data .",

  "/wiki/RNA_interference": "RNA interference ( RNAi ) is a biological process in which RNA molecules inhibit gene expression or translation , by neutralizing targeted mRNA molecules . Historically , RNAi was known by other names , including co-suppression , post-transcriptional gene silencing ( PTGS ) , and quelling . The detailed study of each of these seemingly different processes elucidated that the identity of these phenomena were all actually RNAi . Andrew Fire and Craig C. Mello shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on RNA interference in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans , which they published in 1998 . Since the discovery of RNAi and its regulatory potentials , it has become evident that RNAi has immense potential in suppression of desired genes . RNAi is now known as precise , efficient , stable and better than antisense technology for gene suppression . However , antisense RNA produced intracellularly by an expression vector may be developed and find utility as novel therapeutic agents . Two types of small ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) molecules - microRNA ( miRNA ) and small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) - are central to RNA interference . RNAs are the direct products of genes , and these small RNAs can direct enzyme complexes to degrade messenger RNA ( mRNA ) molecules and thus decrease their activity by preventing translation , via post-transcriptional gene silencing . Moreover , transcription can be inhibited via the pre-transcriptional silencing mechanism of RNA interference , through which an enzyme complex catalyzes DNA methylation at genomic positions complementary to complexed siRNA or miRNA . RNA interference has an important role in defending cells against parasitic nucleotide sequences - viruses and transposons . It also influences development .",
  "/wiki/Splicing_(genetics)": "RNA splicing , in molecular biology , is a form of RNA processing in which a newly made precursor messenger RNA ( pre-mRNA ) transcript is transformed into a mature messenger RNA ( mRNA ) . During splicing , introns ( Non-coding regions ) are removed and exons ( Coding Regions ) are joined together . For nuclear-encoded genes , splicing takes place within the nucleus either during or immediately after transcription . For those eukaryotic genes that contain introns , splicing is usually required in order to create an mRNA molecule that can be translated into protein . For many eukaryotic introns , splicing is carried out in a series of reactions which are catalyzed by the spliceosome , a complex of small nuclear ribonucleo proteins ( snRNPs ) . Self-splicing introns , or ribozymes capable of catalyzing their own excision from their parent RNA molecule , also exist .",
