The bridge runs nearly 8 kilometres ( 5 miles ) from the Swedish coast to the artificial island Peberholm in the middle of the strait . The crossing is completed by the 4-kilometre ( 2.5 mi ) Drogden Tunnel from Peberholm to the Danish island of Amager . The \u00d6resund Bridge is the longest combined road and rail bridge in Europe and connects two major metropolitan areas : Copenhagen , the Danish capital city , and the Swedish city of Malm\u00f6 . It connects the road and rail networks of the Scandinavian Peninsula with those of Central and Western Europe . A data cable also makes the bridge the backbone of internet data transmission between central Europe and Sweden ( and , prior to 2016 also Finland ) . The international European route E20 crosses via road , the \u00d8resund Line via railway . The construction of the Great Belt Fixed Link ( 1988-1998 ) , connecting Zealand to Funen and thence to the Jutland Peninsula , and the \u00d6resund Bridge have connected Central and Western Europe to Scandinavia by road and rail . The \u00d6resund Bridge was designed by the Danish engineering firm COWI . The justification for the additional expenditure and complexity related to digging a tunnel for part of the way , rather than raising that section of the bridge , was to avoid interfering with air traffic from the nearby Copenhagen Airport , to provide a clear channel for ships in good weather or bad , and to prevent ice floes from blocking the strait . The \u00d6resund Bridge crosses the border between Denmark and Sweden . Although the Schengen Agreement and the Nordic Passport Union should mean no routine passport inspections , since January 2016 , identity and visa checks have been imposed by Sweden on travellers from Denmark due to the European migrant crisis .",

The strait has a length of 118 kilometres ( 73 mi ) and the width varies from 4 kilometres ( 2.5 mi ) to 28 kilometres ( 17 mi ) . It is 4 kilometres ( 2.5 mi ) wide at its narrowest point between Helsing\u00f8r in Denmark and Helsingborg in Sweden . \u00d8resund is along with the Great Belt , Little Belt and Kiel Canal one of four waterways that connects the Baltic Sea to the Atlantic Ocean via Kattegat , Skagerrak , and the North Sea , and is one of the busiest waterways in the world . The \u00d8resund Bridge , between the Danish capital Copenhagen and the Swedish city of Malm\u00f6 , inaugurated on 1 July 2000 , connects a bi-national metropolitan area with close to 4 million inhabitants . The HH Ferry route , between Helsing\u00f8r , Denmark and Helsingborg , Sweden , in the northern part of \u00d8resund , is one of the world 's busiest international ferry routes with more than 70 departures from each harbour per day . \u00d8resund is a geologically young strait that formed 8500-8000 years ago as a result of rising sea levels . Previously the Ancylus Lake , a fresh-water body occupying the Baltic basin , had been connected to the sea solely by the Great Belt . As such the entrance of salt water by \u00d8resund marked the beginning of the modern Baltic Sea as a salt-water sea .",

It forms the core of the wider urban area of Copenhagen ( population 1,320,629 ) and the Copenhagen metropolitan area ( population 2,557,737 ) . Copenhagen is situated on the eastern coast of the island of Zealand ; another small portion of the city is located on Amager , and it is separated from Malm\u00f8 , Sweden , by the strait of \u00d8resund . The \u00d8resund Bridge connects the two cities by rail and road . Originally a Viking fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now Gammel Strand , Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century . Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions , defences and armed forces . During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the Kalmar Union , governing the entire present day Nordic region in a personal union with Sweden and Norway ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state . The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of Scandinavia under the union for well over 120 years , starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion . After a plague outbreak and fire in the 18th century , the city underwent a period of redevelopment . This included construction of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden and founding of such cultural institutions as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts . After further disasters in the early 19th century when Horatio Nelson attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city , rebuilding during the Danish Golden Age brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen 's architecture .",

  "/wiki/Great_Belt_Fixed_Link": "The Great Belt Fixed Link ( Danish : Storeb\u00e6ltsforbindelsen ) is a multi-element fixed link crossing the Great Belt strait between the Danish islands of Zealand and Funen . It consists of a road suspension bridge and a railway tunnel between Zealand and the small island Sprog\u00f8 in the middle of the Great Belt , and a box-girder bridge for both road and rail traffic between Sprog\u00f8 and Funen . The total length is 18 kilometres ( 11 mi ) . The Great Belt Bridge ( Danish : Storeb\u00e6ltsbroen ) commonly refers to the suspension bridge , although it may also be used to mean the box-girder bridge or the link in its entirety . Officially named the East Bridge , the suspension bridge was designed by the Danish firms COWI and Ramboll . It has the world 's fifth-longest main span ( 1.6 km ( 1 mi ) ) , and the longest outside Asia . At the time of the opening of the bridge it was the second longest , beaten by the Akashi Kaiky\u014d Bridge opened a few months previously . The link replaced a ferry service , which had been the primary means of crossing the Great Belt . After more than 50 years of debate , the Danish government decided in 1986 to construct a link ; it opened to rail traffic in 1997 and to road traffic in 1998 . At an estimated cost of DKK 21.4 billion ( 1988 prices ) , the link is the largest construction project in Danish history . It has reduced travel times significantly ; previously taking one hour by ferry , the Great Belt can now be crossed in ten minutes . This link and the \u00d8resund Bridge ( built 1995-1999 ) have together enabled driving from mainland Europe to Sweden and the rest of Scandinavia through Denmark .",

The bridge was built , without any fatalities , between 1930-33 with 100-200 workers on the construction site . Large sections were built on Aalborg 's waterfront west of the bridge 's current location . A week before the inauguration , a load test occurred with 48 fully laden trucks placed on the bridge 's leaf .

However , it has inlets both from the North Sea and Kattegat , and hence separates the North Jutlandic Island ( Danish : N\u00f8rrejyske \u00d8 , which includes the old provinces of Vendsyssel , Han herred and Thy ) from the rest of the Jutland Peninsula . The Limfjord extends from Thybor\u00f8n Channel on the North Sea to Hals on the Kattegat .

It is more common to refer to the three traditional districts Vendsyssel , Hanherred and Thy . The area was not surrounded by water until a storm in February 1825 , which caused a connection between the North Sea and the fjord Limfjorden . Hence it is traditionally regarded as a part of Jutland rather than an island . Geographically , it is the second largest island of Denmark after Zealand ( excluding Greenland ) with a population of 296,700 on 1 January 2014 . Danes rarely refer to the area as a whole , but more often to the three constituent districts or to North Jutland ( which also includes an area south of the Limfjord ) . The adjectives nordenfjords and s\u00f8ndenfjords are commonly used , meaning north and south of the Fjord , respectively . The names can all be considered ad hoc creations , as a traditional name for the island as a geographical unity is lacking . The island has six fixed transport links to the mainland ( four road bridges , one road tunnel and one rail bridge ) and is therefore not so separated transport-wise . There are also two car ferry connections .",
