The area around Aberdeen has been settled for at least 8,000 years , when prehistoric villages lay around the mouths of the rivers Dee and Don . The city has a long , sandy coastline and a marine climate , the latter resulting in chilly summers and mild winters . Aberdeen received Royal burgh status from David I of Scotland ( 1124-1153 ) , transforming the city economically . The city has two universities , the University of Aberdeen , founded in 1495 , and Robert Gordon University , which was awarded university status in 1992 , making Aberdeen the educational centre of north-east Scotland . The traditional industries of fishing , paper-making , shipbuilding , and textiles have been overtaken by the oil industry and Aberdeen 's seaport . Aberdeen Heliport is one of the busiest commercial heliports in the world and the seaport is the largest in the north-east of Scotland . Aberdeen used to host the Aberdeen International Youth Festival , a major international event which attracted up to 1000 of the most talented young performing arts companies but the council ended funding in 2017 and the festival was wound up in 2018 .
