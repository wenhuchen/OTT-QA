  "/wiki/Queen's_Counsel": "In the United Kingdom and in some Commonwealth countries , a Queen 's Counsel ( post-nominal QC ) during the reign of a queen , or King 's Counsel ( post-nominal KC ) during the reign of a king , is a lawyer ( usually a barrister or advocate ) who is appointed by the monarch of the country to be one of Her [ His ] Majesty 's Counsel learned in the law . The position originated in England . Some Commonwealth countries have either abolished the position , or re-named it so as to remove monarchical connotations , for example , Senior Counsel or Senior Advocate . Queen 's Counsel is an office , conferred by the Crown , that is recognised by courts . Members have the privilege of sitting within the bar of court . The term is recognised as an honorific . As members wear silk gowns of a particular design ( see court dress ) , appointment as Queen 's Counsel is known informally as taking silk and QCs are often colloquially called silks . Appointments are made from within the legal profession on the basis of merit rather than a particular level of experience .

  "/wiki/Administrator_of_the_Northern_Territory": "The Administrator of the Northern Territory is an official appointed by the Governor-General of Australia to represent the government of the Commonwealth in the Northern Territory . He or she performs functions similar to those of a state governor . Strictly speaking , the appointment of an Administrator is made by the Governor-General-in-Council , that is , the Governor-General acting on the advice of the Commonwealth Government , rather than the advice of the Government of the Northern Territory . The Northern Territory received self-government on 1 July 1978 , in accordance with the provisions of the Northern Territory ( Self-Government ) Act 1978 ( Cth ) . Since then , the practice has arisen that in making an appointment the Governor-General-in-Council will act on the recommendation of the Northern Territory Government . Unlike an Australian State Governor , the Administrator is not the direct representative of the Queen in the Territory but is instead appointed by the Queen 's representative in the Commonwealth , the Governor-General , to administer the Territory in accordance with the Act . In practice , however , the Administrator performs a similar constitutional role to that of a state governor and can be considered the Queen 's indirect representative in the Territory . The Administrator formally appoints the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and the members of the Cabinet after every election . In all but a few cases , he or she is required by convention to act on the Cabinet 's advice . The Administrator gives royal assent to all bills passed by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly . Although the Governor-General ( in practice , the Commonwealth Government ) has the power to veto any territorial bill , in practice this right is almost never exercised . The office of the Deputy of the Administrator was created in 1997 .",

The plural is attorneys general or attorney generals . In some jurisdictions , attorneys general also have executive responsibility for law enforcement , prosecutions or even responsibility for legal affairs generally . In practice , the extent to which the attorney general personally provides legal advice to the government varies between jurisdictions , and even between individual office-holders within the same jurisdiction , often depending on the level and nature of the office-holder 's prior legal experience . Where the attorney general has ministerial responsibility for legal affairs in general ( as is the case , for example , with the United States Attorney General or the Attorney-General for Australia , and the respective attorneys general of the states in each country ) , the ministerial portfolio is largely equivalent to that of a Minister of Justice in some other countries . The term was originally used to refer to any person who holds a general power of attorney to represent a principal in all matters . In the common law tradition , anyone who represents the state , especially in criminal prosecutions , is such an attorney . Although a government may designate some official as the permanent attorney general , anyone who came to represent the state in the same way could , in the past , be referred to as such , even if only for a particular case . Today , however , in most jurisdictions , the term is largely reserved as a title of the permanently appointed attorney general of the state , sovereign or other member of the royal family . Civil law jurisdictions have similar offices , which may be variously called public prosecutor general , procurators , advocates general , public attorneys , and other titles .

  "/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting": "Olympic weightlifting , or Olympic-style weightlifting , often simply referred to as weightlifting , is a sport in which the athlete attempts a maximum-weight single lift of a barbell loaded with weight plates . The two competition lifts in order are the snatch and the clean and jerk . The snatch is a wide-grip , one-move lift . The clean and jerk is a close-grip , two-move lift . Each weightlifter receives three attempts in each , and the combined total of the highest two successful lifts determines the overall result within a bodyweight category . Bodyweight categories are different for male and female competitors . A lifter who fails to complete at least one successful snatch and one successful clean and jerk also fails to total , and therefore receives an incomplete entry for the competition . The clean and press was once a competition lift , but was discontinued due to difficulties in judging proper form . In comparison with other strength sports , which test limit strength ( with or without lifting aids ) , weightlifting tests aspects of human ballistic limits ( explosive strength ) ; the lifts are therefore executed faster - and with more mobility and a greater range of motion during their execution - than other strength movements . The lifts performed in the sport of weightlifting , and in particular their component lifts ( e.g . squats , deadlifts , cleans ) , are commonly used by elite athletes in other sports to train for both explosive and functional strength .",

Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports , the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability , the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18 , the five Continental games ( Pan American , African , Asian , European , and Pacific ) , and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games . The Deaflympics and Special Olympics are also endorsed by the IOC . The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic , political , and technological advancements . The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism , as envisioned by Coubertin , to allowing participation of professional athletes . The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games .",

  "/wiki/Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom": "Her Majesty 's Most Honourable Privy Council , commonly known as the Privy Council of the United Kingdom or simply the Privy Council , is a formal body of advisers to the Sovereign of the United Kingdom . Its membership mainly comprises senior politicians who are current or former members of either the House of Commons or the House of Lords . The Privy Council formally advises the sovereign on the exercise of the Royal Prerogative , and corporately ( as Queen-in-Council ) it issues executive instruments known as Orders in Council , which among other powers enact Acts of Parliament . The Council also holds the delegated authority to issue Orders of Council , mostly used to regulate certain public institutions . The Council advises the sovereign on the issuing of Royal Charters , which are used to grant special status to incorporated bodies , and city or borough status to local authorities . Otherwise , the Privy Council 's powers have now been largely replaced by its executive committee , the Cabinet of the United Kingdom . Certain judicial functions are also performed by the Queen-in-Council , although in practice its actual work of hearing and deciding upon cases is carried out day-to-day by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council . The Judicial Committee consists of senior judges appointed as Privy Counsellors : predominantly Justices of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and senior judges from the Commonwealth . The Privy Council formerly acted as the High Court of Appeal for the entire British Empire ( other than for the United Kingdom itself ) , and continues to hear appeals from the Crown Dependencies , the British Overseas Territories , and some independent Commonwealth states .",
  "/wiki/Federation_of_Australia": "The Federation of Australia was the process by which the six separate British self-governing colonies of Queensland , New South Wales , Victoria , Tasmania , South Australia , and Western Australia agreed to unite and form the Commonwealth of Australia , establishing a system of federalism in Australia . Fiji and New Zealand were originally part of this process , but they decided not to join the federation . Following federation , the six colonies that united to form the Commonwealth of Australia as states kept the systems of government ( and the bicameral legislatures ) that they had developed as separate colonies , but they also agreed to have a federal government that was responsible for matters concerning the whole nation . When the Constitution of Australia came into force , on 1 January 1901 , the colonies collectively became states of the Commonwealth of Australia . The efforts to bring about federation in the mid-19th century were dogged by the lack of popular support for the movement . A number of conventions were held during the 1890s to develop a constitution for the Commonwealth . Sir Henry Parkes , Premier of New South Wales , was instrumental in this process . Sir Edmund Barton , second only to Parkes in the length of his commitment to the federation cause , was the caretaker Prime Minister of Australia at the inaugural national election in 1901 in March 1901 . The election returned Barton as prime minister , though without a majority . This period has lent its name to an architectural style prevalent in Australia at that time , known as Federation architecture , or Federation style ."
