  "/wiki/Pacific_Northwest": "The Pacific Northwest ( PNW ) , sometimes referred to as Cascadia , is a geographic region in western North America bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and ( loosely ) by the Rocky Mountains on the east . Though no official boundary exists , the most common conception includes the Canadian province of British Columbia ( BC ) and the U.S. states of Idaho , Oregon , and Washington . Broader conceptions reach north into Southeast Alaska and Yukon , south into northern California , and east to the Continental Divide to include Western Montana and parts of Wyoming . Narrower conceptions may be limited to the coastal areas west of the Cascade and Coast mountains . The variety of definitions can be attributed to partially overlapping commonalities of the region 's history , culture , geography , society , and other factors . The Northwest Coast is the coastal region of the Pacific Northwest , and the Northwest Plateau ( also commonly known as the Interior in British Columbia and the Inland Northwest in the United States ) is the inland region . The term Pacific Northwest should not be confused with the Northwest Territory ( also known as the Great Northwest , a historical term in the United States ) or the Northwest Territories of Canada . The region 's largest metropolitan areas are Greater Seattle , Washington , with 3.8 million people ; Metro Vancouver , British Columbia , with 2.5 million people ; and Greater Portland , Oregon , with 2.4 million people . The culture of the Pacific Northwest is influenced by the Canada-United States border , which the United States and the United Kingdom established at a time when the region 's inhabitants were composed mostly of indigenous peoples . Two sections of the border - one along the 49th parallel south of British Columbia and one between the Alaska Panhandle and northern British Columbia - have left a great impact on the region . According to Canadian historian Ken Coates , the border has not merely influenced the Pacific Northwest - rather , the region 's history and character have been determined by the boundary .",
