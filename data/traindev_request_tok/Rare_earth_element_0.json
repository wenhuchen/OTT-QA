  "/wiki/Atomic_number": "The atomic number or proton number ( symbol Z ) of a chemical element is the number of protons found in the nucleus of every atom of that element . The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element . It is identical to the charge number of the nucleus . In an uncharged atom , the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons . The sum of the atomic number Z and the number of neutrons N gives the mass number A of an atom . Since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass ( and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes ) and the mass defect of nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass , the atomic mass of any atom , when expressed in unified atomic mass units ( making a quantity called the relative isotopic mass ) , is within 1% of the whole number A . Atoms with the same atomic number but different neutron numbers , and hence different mass numbers , are known as isotopes . A little more than three-quarters of naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes ( see monoisotopic elements ) , and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element ( called the relative atomic mass ) in a defined environment on Earth , determines the element 's standard atomic weight . Historically , it was these atomic weights of elements ( in comparison to hydrogen ) that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the 19th century . The conventional symbol Z comes from the German word Zahl meaning number , which , before the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics , merely denoted an element 's numerical place in the periodic table , whose order is approximately , but not completely , consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights . Only after 1915 , with the suggestion and evidence that this Z number was also the nuclear charge and a physical characteristic of atoms , did the word Atomzahl ( and its English equivalent atomic number ) come into common use in this context .",

The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets and ultimately from the Phoenician alphabet . Latin was originally spoken in the area around Rome , known as Latium . Through the power of the Roman Republic , it became the dominant language in Italy , and subsequently throughout the western Roman Empire . Latin has contributed many words to the English language . In particular , Latin ( and Ancient Greek ) roots are used in English descriptions of theology , the sciences , medicine , and law . By the late Roman Republic ( 75 BC ) , Old Latin had been standardised into Classical Latin . Vulgar Latin was the colloquial form spoken during the same time and attested in inscriptions and the works of comic playwrights like Plautus and Terence and author Petronius . Late Latin is the written language from the 3rd century and the colloquial form Vulgar Latin developed into the Romance languages , such as French , Italian , Portuguese , Romanian , Catalan and Spanish in the 6th to 9th centuries . Medieval Latin was used as a literary language from the 9th century to the Renaissance which used Renaissance Latin . Later , Early Modern Latin and New Latin evolved . Latin was used as the language of international communication , scholarship and science until well into the 18th century , when it began to be supplanted by vernaculars ( including the Romance languages ) .",

  "/wiki/Metal-halide_lamp": "A metal-halide lamp is an electrical lamp that produces light by an electric arc through a gaseous mixture of vaporized mercury and metal halides ( compounds of metals with bromine or iodine ) . It is a type of high-intensity discharge ( HID ) gas discharge lamp . Developed in the 1960s , they are similar to mercury vapor lamps , but contain additional metal halide compounds in the quartz arc tube , which improve the efficiency and color rendition of the light . The most common metal halide compound used is sodium iodide . Once the arc tube reaches its running temperature , the sodium dissociates from the iodine , adding orange and reds to the lamp 's spectrum from the sodium D line as the metal ionizes . As a result , metal-halide lamps have high luminous efficacy of around 75-100 lumens per watt , which is about twice that of mercury vapor lights and 3 to 5 times that of incandescent lights and produce an intense white light . Lamp life is 6,000 to 15,000 hours . As one of the most efficient sources of high CRI white light , metal halides as of 2005 [ update ] were the fastest growing segment of the lighting industry . They are used for wide area overhead lighting of commercial , industrial , and public spaces , such as parking lots , sports arenas , factories , and retail stores , as well as residential security lighting and automotive headlamps ( xenon headlights ) . The lamps consist of a small fused quartz or ceramic arc tube which contains the gases and the arc , enclosed inside a larger glass bulb which has a coating to filter out the ultraviolet light produced . They operate at a pressure between 4 and 20 atmospheres , and require special fixtures to operate safely , as well as an electrical ballast . Metal atoms produce most of the light output .",
  "/wiki/Mercury-vapor_lamp": "A mercury-vapor lamp is a gas discharge lamp that uses an electric arc through vaporized mercury to produce light . The arc discharge is generally confined to a small fused quartz arc tube mounted within a larger borosilicate glass bulb . The outer bulb may be clear or coated with a phosphor ; in either case , the outer bulb provides thermal insulation , protection from the ultraviolet radiation the light produces , and a convenient mounting for the fused quartz arc tube . Mercury vapor lamps are more energy efficient than incandescent and most fluorescent lights , with luminous efficacies of 35 to 65 lumens/watt . Their other advantages are a long bulb lifetime in the range of 24,000 hours and a high intensity , clear white light output . For these reasons , they are used for large area overhead lighting , such as in factories , warehouses , and sports arenas as well as for streetlights . Clear mercury lamps produce white light with a bluish-green tint due to mercury 's combination of spectral lines . This is not flattering to human skin color , so such lamps are typically not used in retail stores . Color corrected mercury bulbs overcome this problem with a phosphor on the inside of the outer bulb that emits white light , offering better color rendition . They operate at an internal pressure of around one atmosphere and require special fixtures , as well as an electrical ballast . They also require a warm-up period of 4 - 7 minutes to reach full light output . Mercury vapor lamps are becoming obsolete due to the higher efficiency and better color balance of metal halide lamps .",
  "/wiki/Yttrium": "Yttrium is a chemical element with the symbol Y and atomic number 39 . It is a silvery-metallic transition metal chemically similar to the lanthanides and has often been classified as a rare-earth element . Yttrium is almost always found in combination with lanthanide elements in rare-earth minerals , and is never found in nature as a free element . 89Y is the only stable isotope , and the only isotope found in the Earth 's crust . The most important uses of yttrium are LEDs and phosphors , particularly the red phosphors in television set cathode ray tube displays . Yttrium is also used in the production of electrodes , electrolytes , electronic filters , lasers , superconductors , various medical applications , and tracing various materials to enhance their properties . Yttrium has no known biological role . Exposure to yttrium compounds can cause lung disease in humans .

On the other hand , Metallic superconductors usually work below -200 \u00b0C : they are then called low-temperature superconductors . Metallic superconductors are also ordinary superconductors , since they were discovered and used before the high-temperature ones . Ceramic superconductors are now becoming suitable for some practical use , but they still have many manufacturing issues and there are very few successful practical examples of employment . Most ceramics are brittle which makes the fabrication of wires from them very problematic . The major advantage of high-temperature ceramic superconductors is that they can be cooled by using liquid nitrogen . On the other hand , metallic superconductors require usually more difficult coolants - mostly liquid helium .

YIG may also be known as yttrium ferrite garnet , or as iron yttrium oxide or yttrium iron oxide , the latter two names usually associated with powdered forms . In YIG , the five iron ( III ) ions occupy two octahedral and three tetrahedral sites , with the yttrium ( III ) ions coordinated by eight oxygen ions in an irregular cube . The iron ions in the two coordination sites exhibit different spins , resulting in magnetic behavior . By substituting specific sites with rare earth elements , for example , interesting magnetic properties can be obtained . YIG has a high Verdet constant which results in the Faraday effect , high Q factor in microwave frequencies , low absorption of infrared wavelengths down to 1200 nm , and very small linewidth in electron spin resonance .

  "/wiki/Microwave": "Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths ranging from about one meter to one millimeter ; with frequencies between 300 MHz ( 1 m ) and 300 GHz ( 1 mm ) . Different sources define different frequency ranges as microwaves ; the above broad definition includes both UHF and EHF ( millimeter wave ) bands . A more common definition in radio-frequency engineering is the range between 1 and 100 GHz ( wavelengths between 0.3 m and 3 mm ) . In all cases , microwaves include the entire SHF band ( 3 to 30 GHz , or 10 to 1 cm ) at minimum . Frequencies in the microwave range are often referred to by their IEEE radar band designations : S , C , X , Ku , K , or Ka band , or by similar NATO or EU designations . The prefix micro- in microwave is not meant to suggest a wavelength in the micrometer range . Rather , it indicates that microwaves are small ( having shorter wavelengths ) , compared to the radio waves used prior to microwave technology . The boundaries between far infrared , terahertz radiation , microwaves , and ultra-high-frequency radio waves are fairly arbitrary and are used variously between different fields of study . Microwaves travel by line-of-sight ; unlike lower frequency radio waves they do not diffract around hills , follow the earth 's surface as ground waves , or reflect from the ionosphere , so terrestrial microwave communication links are limited by the visual horizon to about 40 miles ( 64 km ) . At the high end of the band they are absorbed by gases in the atmosphere , limiting practical communication distances to around a kilometer . Microwaves are widely used in modern technology , for example in point-to-point communication links , wireless networks , microwave radio relay networks , radar , satellite and spacecraft communication , medical diathermy and cancer treatment , remote sensing , radio astronomy , particle accelerators , spectroscopy , industrial heating , collision avoidance systems , garage door openers and keyless entry systems , and for cooking food in microwave ovens .",
  "/wiki/Spark_plug": "A spark plug ( sometimes , in British English , a sparking plug , and , colloquially , a plug ) is a device for delivering electric current from an ignition system to the combustion chamber of a spark-ignition engine to ignite the compressed fuel/air mixture by an electric spark , while containing combustion pressure within the engine . A spark plug has a metal threaded shell , electrically isolated from a central electrode by a porcelain insulator . The central electrode , which may contain a resistor , is connected by a heavily insulated wire to the output terminal of an ignition coil or magneto . The spark plug 's metal shell is screwed into the engine 's cylinder head and thus electrically grounded . The central electrode protrudes through the porcelain insulator into the combustion chamber , forming one or more spark gaps between the inner end of the central electrode and usually one or more protuberances or structures attached to the inner end of the threaded shell and designated the side , earth , or ground electrode ( s ) . Spark plugs may also be used for other purposes ; in Saab Direct Ignition when they are not firing , spark plugs are used to measure ionization in the cylinders - this ionic current measurement is used to replace the ordinary cam phase sensor , knock sensor and misfire measurement function . Spark plugs may also be used in other applications such as furnaces wherein a combustible fuel/air mixture must be ignited . In this case , they are sometimes referred to as flame igniters .

  "/wiki/Cancer_treatments": "Cancer can be treated by surgery , chemotherapy , radiation therapy , hormonal therapy , targeted therapy ( including immunotherapy such as monoclonal antibody therapy ) and synthetic lethality . The choice of therapy depends upon the location and grade of the tumor and the stage of the disease , as well as the general state of the patient ( performance status ) . Cancer_genome_sequencing helps in determining which cancer the patient exactly has for determining the best therapy for the cancer . A number of experimental cancer treatments are also under development . Under current estimates , two in five people will have cancer at some point in their lifetime . Complete removal of the cancer without damage to the rest of the body ( that is , achieving cure with near-zero adverse effects ) is the ideal , if rarely achieved , goal of treatment and is often the goal in practice . Sometimes this can be accomplished by surgery , but the propensity of cancers to invade adjacent tissue or to spread to distant sites by microscopic metastasis often limits its effectiveness ; and chemotherapy and radiotherapy can have a negative effect on normal cells . Therefore , cure with nonnegligible adverse effects may be accepted as a practical goal in some cases ; and besides curative intent , practical goals of therapy can also include ( 1 ) suppressing the cancer to a subclinical state and maintaining that state for years of good quality of life ( that is , treating the cancer as a chronic disease ) , and ( 2 ) palliative care without curative intent ( for advanced-stage metastatic cancers ) . Because cancer refers to a class of diseases , it is unlikely that there will ever be a single cure for cancer any more than there will be a single treatment for all infectious diseases . Angiogenesis inhibitors were once thought to have potential as a silver bullet treatment applicable to many types of cancer , but this has not been the case in practice .",

It is also sometimes considered the first element of the 6th-period transition metals , which would put it in group 3 , although lutetium is sometimes placed in this position instead . Lanthanum is traditionally counted among the rare earth elements . The usual oxidation state is +3 . Lanthanum has no biological role in humans but is essential to some bacteria . It is not particularly toxic to humans but does show some antimicrobial activity . Lanthanum usually occurs together with cerium and the other rare earth elements . Lanthanum was first found by the Swedish chemist Carl Gustav Mosander in 1839 as an impurity in cerium nitrate - hence the name lanthanum , from the Ancient Greek \u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ( lanthanein ) , meaning to lie hidden .

At their most basic , cameras are sealed boxes ( the camera body ) with a small hole ( the aperture ) that let light in to capture an image on a light-sensitive surface ( usually photographic film or a digital sensor ) . Cameras have various mechanisms to control how the light falls onto the light-sensitive surface . Lenses focus the light entering the camera , the size of the aperture can be widened or narrowed to let more or less light into the camera , and a shutter mechanism determines the amount of time the photo-sensitive surface is exposed to the light . The still image camera is the main instrument in the art of photography and captured images may be reproduced later as a part of the process of photography , digital imaging , photographic printing . The similar artistic fields in the moving image camera domain are film , videography , and cinematography . The word camera comes from camera obscura , which means dark chamber and is the Latin name of the original device for projecting an image of external reality onto a flat surface . The modern photographic camera evolved from the camera obscura . The functioning of the camera is very similar to the functioning of the human eye .

  "/wiki/Fluid_catalytic_cracking": "Fluid catalytic cracking ( FCC ) is one of the most important conversion processes used in petroleum refineries . It is widely used to convert the high-boiling , high-molecular weight hydrocarbon fractions of petroleum crude oils into more valuable gasoline , olefinic gases , and other products . Cracking of petroleum hydrocarbons was originally done by thermal cracking , which has been almost completely replaced by catalytic cracking because it produces more gasoline with a higher octane rating . It also produces byproduct gases that have more carbon-carbon double bonds ( i.e . more olefins ) , and hence more economic value , than those produced by thermal cracking . The feedstock to FCC is usually that portion of the crude oil that has an initial boiling point of 340 \u00b0C ( 644 \u00b0F ) or higher at atmospheric pressure and an average molecular weight ranging from about 200 to 600 or higher . This portion of crude oil is often referred to as heavy gas oil or vacuum gas oil ( HVGO ) .

Ceres is the only object in the asteroid belt known to be currently rounded by its own gravity , although detailed analysis was required to exclude Vesta . From Earth , the apparent magnitude of Ceres ranges from 6.7 to 9.3 , peaking once at opposition every 15 to 16 months , which is its synodic period . Thus even at its brightest , it is too dim to be seen by the naked eye , except under extremely dark skies .

This property allows it to have many commercial applications , such as the ignition source for lighters ( where it is often known by the misleading name flint ) , strikers for gas welding and cutting torches , deoxidization in metallurgy , and ferrocerium rods ( also called ferro rods , flint-spark-lighters and wrongly flint-and-steel as this is the name of a different type of lighter using a section of high carbon steel and a natural flint ) . Due to ferrocerium 's ability to ignite in adverse conditions , rods of ferrocerium are commonly used as an emergency combustion device in survival kits . Ferrocerium was invented in 1903 by the Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach . It takes its name from its two primary components : iron ( from Latin : ferrum ) , and the rare-earth element cerium . The pyrophoric effect is dependent on the brittleness of the alloy and its low autoignition temperature .",
  "/wiki/Hydrophobic": "In chemistry , hydrophobicity is the physical property of a molecule ( known as a hydrophobe ) that is seemingly repelled from a mass of water .

Hydrophobic molecules tend to be ping spottable nonpolar and , thus , prefer other neutral molecules and nonpolar solvents . Because water molecules are polar , hydrophobes do not dissolve well among them . Hydrophobic molecules in water often cluster together , forming micelles . Water on hydrophobic surfaces will exhibit a high contact angle . Examples of hydrophobic molecules include the alkanes , oils , fats , and greasy substances in general . Hydrophobic materials are used for oil removal from water , the management of oil spills , and chemical separation processes to remove non-polar substances from polar compounds .

In 1841 , Swedish chemist Carl Gustav Mosander extracted a rare-earth oxide residue he called didymium from a residue he called lanthana , in turn separated from cerium salts . In 1885 , the Austrian chemist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach separated didymium into two elements that gave salts of different colours , which he named praseodymium and neodymium . The name praseodymium comes from the Greek prasinos ( \u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ) , meaning green , and didymos ( \u03b4\u03af\u03b4\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) , twin . Like most rare-earth elements , praseodymium most readily forms the +3 oxidation state , which is the only stable state in aqueous solution , although the +4 oxidation state is known in some solid compounds and , uniquely among the lanthanides , the +5 oxidation state is attainable in matrix-isolation conditions . Aqueous praseodymium ions are yellowish-green , and similarly praseodymium results in various shades of yellow-green when incorporated into glasses . Many of praseodymium 's industrial uses involve its ability to filter yellow light from light sources .",
  "/wiki/Rare-earth_magnet": "Rare-earth magnets are strong permanent magnets made from alloys of rare-earth elements . Developed in the 1970s and 1980s , rare-earth magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnets made , producing significantly stronger magnetic fields than other types such as ferrite or alnico magnets . The magnetic field typically produced by rare-earth magnets can exceed 1.4 teslas , whereas ferrite or ceramic magnets typically exhibit fields of 0.5 to 1 tesla . There are two types : neodymium magnets and samarium-cobalt magnets . Rare-earth magnets are extremely brittle and also vulnerable to corrosion , so they are usually plated or coated to protect them from breaking , chipping , or crumbling into powder . The development of rare-earth magnets began around 1966 , when K. J. Strnat and G. Hoffer of the US Air Force Materials Laboratory discovered that an alloy of yttrium and cobalt , YCo5 , had by far the largest magnetic anisotropy constant of any material then known . The term rare earth can be misleading , as some of these metals can be as abundant in the Earth 's crust as tin or lead , but rare earth ores are unevenly distributed , not existing in seams like coal or copper , so in any given cubic kilometre of crust they are rare . The major source is currently China . Some countries classify rare earth metals as strategically important , and recent Chinese export restrictions on these materials have led some to initiate research programs to develop strong magnets that do not require rare earth metals .",
  "/wiki/Laser": "A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation . The term laser originated as an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation . The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore H. Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories , based on theoretical work by Charles Hard Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow . A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light which is coherent . Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot , enabling applications such as laser cutting and lithography . Spatial coherence also allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances ( collimation ) , enabling applications such as laser pointers and lidar . Lasers can also have high temporal coherence , which allows them to emit light with a very narrow spectrum , i.e. , they can emit a single color of light . Alternatively , temporal coherence can be used to produce pulses of light with a broad spectrum but durations as short as a femtosecond ( ultrashort pulses ) . Lasers are used in optical disk drives , laser printers , barcode scanners , DNA sequencing instruments , fiber-optic , semiconducting chip manufacturing ( photolithography ) , and free-space optical communication , laser surgery and skin treatments , cutting and welding materials , military and law enforcement devices for marking targets and measuring range and speed , and in laser lighting displays for entertainment . They have been used for car headlamps on luxury cars , by using a blue laser and a phosphor to produce highly directional white light .",
  "/wiki/Carbon_arc": "An arc lamp or arc light is a lamp that produces light by an electric arc ( also called a voltaic arc ) . The carbon arc light , which consists of an arc between carbon electrodes in air , invented by Humphry Davy in the first decade of the 1800s , was the first practical electric light . It was widely used starting in the 1870s for street and large building lighting until it was superseded by the incandescent light in the early 20th century . It continued in use in more specialized applications where a high intensity point light source was needed , such as searchlights and movie projectors until after World War II . The carbon arc lamp is now obsolete for most of these purposes , but it is still used as a source of high intensity ultraviolet light . The term is now used for gas discharge lamps , which produce light by an arc between metal electrodes through an inert gas in a glass bulb . The common fluorescent lamp is a low-pressure mercury arc lamp . The xenon arc lamp , which produces a high intensity white light , is now used in many of the applications which formerly used the carbon arc , such as movie projectors and searchlights .",
  "/wiki/Glass": "Glass is a non-crystalline , often transparent amorphous solid , that has widespread practical , technological , and decorative use in , for example , window panes , tableware , and optics . Glass is most often formed by rapid cooling ( quenching ) of the molten form , some glasses such as volcanic glass are naturally occurring . The most familiar , and historically the oldest , types of manufactured glass are silicate glasses based on the chemical compound silica ( silicon dioxide , or quartz ) , the primary constituent of sand . Soda-lime glass , containing around 70% silica , account for around 90% of manufactured glass . The term glass , in popular usage , is often used to refer only to this type of material , although silica-free glasses often have desirable properties for applications in modern communications technology . Some objects , such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses , are so commonly made of silicate-based glass that they are simply called by the name of the material . Although brittle , silicate glass is extremely durable , and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures . The earliest known glass objects , of the mid third millennium BCE , were beads , perhaps initially created as accidental by-products of metal-working ( slags ) or during the production of faience , a pre-glass vitreous material made by a process similar to glazing . Due to its ease of formability into any shape , it has been traditionally used for vessels : bowls , vases , bottles , jars and drinking glasses . In its most solid forms , it has also been used for paperweights , marbles . Glass can be coloured by adding metal salts or painted and printed with vitreous enamels , leading to its use in stained glass windows and other Glass art objects . The refractive , reflective and transmission properties of glass make glass suitable for manufacturing optical lenses , prisms , and optoelectronics materials .",
  "/wiki/Vitreous_enamel": "Vitreous enamel , also called porcelain enamel , is a material made by fusing powdered glass to a substrate by firing , usually between 750 and 850 \u00b0C ( 1,380 and 1,560 \u00b0F ) . The powder melts , flows , and then hardens to a smooth , durable vitreous coating . The word comes from the Latin vitreum , meaning glass . Enamel can be used on metal , glass , ceramics , stone , or any material that will withstand the fusing temperature . In technical terms fired enamelware is an integrated layered composite of glass and another material ( or more glass ) . The term enamel is most often restricted to work on metal , which is the subject of this article . Enamelled glass is also called painted , and overglaze decoration to pottery is often called enamelling . Enamelling is an old and widely adopted technology , for most of its history mainly used in jewelry and decorative art . Since the 19th century , enamels have also been applied to many consumer objects , such as some cooking vessels , steel sinks , enamel bathtubs , and stone countertops . It has also been used on some appliances , such as dishwashers , laundry machines , and refrigerators , and on marker boards and signage . The term enamel has also sometimes been applied to industrial materials other than vitreous enamel , such as enamel paint and the polymers coating enameled wire . The word enamel comes from the Old High German word smelzan ( to smelt ) via the Old French esmail , or from a Latin word smaltum , first found in a 9th-century Life of Leo IV .",
  "/wiki/Didymium": "Didymium ( Greek : \u03b4\u03af\u03b4\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf , twin element ) is a mixture of the elements praseodymium and neodymium . It is used in safety glasses for glassblowing and blacksmithing , especially with a gas ( propane ) -powered forge , where it provides a filter that selectively blocks the yellowish light at 589 nm emitted by the hot sodium in the glass , without having a detrimental effect on general vision , unlike dark welder 's glasses . The strong infrared light emitted by the superheated forge gases and insulation lining the forge walls is also blocked thereby saving the crafters ' eyes from serious cumulative damage such as glassblower 's cataract . The usefulness of didymium glass for eye protection of this sort was discovered by Sir William Crookes . Didymium photographic filters are often used to enhance autumn scenery by making leaves appear more vibrant . It does this by removing part of the orange region of the color spectrum , acting as an optical band-stop filter . Unfiltered , this group of colors tends to make certain elements of a picture appear muddy . These photographic filters are also used by nightscape photographers as they absorb part of the light pollution caused by sodium street lights . Didymium was also used in the sodium vapor process for matte work due to its ability to absorb the yellow color produced by its eponymous sodium lighting . Didymium is also used in calibration materials for spectroscopy .",
  "/wiki/Welding_goggles": "Welding goggles provide a degree of eye protection while some forms of welding and cutting are being done . They are intended to protect the eyes not only from the heat and optical radiation produced by the welding , such as the intense ultraviolet light produced by an electric arc , but also from sparks or debris . A full facemask may be required for arc welding . Welding and cutting processes , including arc welding and cutting , as well as brazing produce intense ultraviolet ( UV ) , infrared ( IR ) and visible light wavelengths . The UV and IR wavelengths can not be seen and can produce eye injury without the victim realizing it immediately . Extremely dark filters of the proper sort are needed for the welder to be able to look at the intensely glowing metal being welded . An approved face shield or welding helmet can also have filters for optical radiation protection , and offer additional protection against debris and sparks . UV blocking protective spectacles with side shields or welding goggles are considered primary protection , with the face shield or welding helmet considered secondary protection . This way , the eyes are still protected even when the face shield or helmet is lifted up . The optical filter in welding goggles , face mask or helmet must be a type which is suitable for the sort of work being done . A filter suitable for gas welding , for instance , should not be used for arc welding . Face masks which are self dimming are available for arc welding , MIG , TIG , and plasma cutting , and allow better vision before the arc is struck and after it is extinguished .",
  "/wiki/Neodymium": "Neodymium is a chemical element with the symbol Nd and atomic number 60 . Neodymium belongs to the lanthanide series and is a rare-earth element . It is a hard , slightly malleable silvery metal that quickly tarnishes in air and moisture . When oxidized , neodymium reacts quickly to produce pink , purple/blue and yellow compounds in the +2 , +3 and +4 oxidation states . Neodymium was discovered in 1885 by the Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach . It is present in significant quantities in the ore minerals monazite and bastn\u00e4site . Neodymium is not found naturally in metallic form or unmixed with other lanthanides , and it is usually refined for general use . Although neodymium is classed as a rare-earth element , it is fairly common , no rarer than cobalt , nickel , or copper , and is widely distributed in the Earth 's crust . Most of the world 's commercial neodymium is mined in China . Neodymium compounds were first commercially used as glass dyes in 1927 , and they remain a popular additive in glasses . The color of neodymium compounds is due to the Nd3+ ion and is often a reddish-purple , but it changes with the type of lighting , because of the interaction of the sharp light absorption bands of neodymium with ambient light enriched with the sharp visible emission bands of mercury , trivalent europium or terbium . Some neodymium-doped glasses are used in lasers that emit infrared with wavelengths between 1047 and 1062 nanometers .",

  "/wiki/Promethium": "Promethium is a chemical element with the symbol Pm and atomic number 61 . All of its isotopes are radioactive ; it is extremely rare , with only about 500-600 grams naturally occurring in Earth 's crust at any given time . Promethium is one of only two radioactive elements that are followed in the periodic table by elements with stable forms , the other being technetium . Chemically , promethium is a lanthanide . Promethium shows only one stable oxidation state of +3 . In 1902 Bohuslav Brauner suggested that there was a then-unknown element with properties intermediate between those of the known elements neodymium ( 60 ) and samarium ( 62 ) ; this was confirmed in 1914 by Henry Moseley , who , having measured the atomic numbers of all the elements then known , found that atomic number 61 was missing . In 1926 , two groups ( one Italian and one American ) claimed to have isolated a sample of element 61 ; both discoveries were soon proven to be false . In 1938 , during a nuclear experiment conducted at Ohio State University , a few radioactive nuclides were produced that certainly were not radioisotopes of neodymium or samarium , but there was a lack of chemical proof that element 61 was produced , and the discovery was not generally recognized . Promethium was first produced and characterized at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1945 by the separation and analysis of the fission products of uranium fuel irradiated in a graphite reactor . The discoverers proposed the name prometheum ( the spelling was subsequently changed ) , derived from Prometheus , the Titan in Greek mythology who stole fire from Mount Olympus and brought it down to humans , to symbolize both the daring and the possible misuse of mankind 's intellect . However , a sample of the metal was made only in 1963 . There are two possible sources for natural promethium : rare decays of natural europium-151 ( producing promethium-147 ) and uranium ( various isotopes ) .",

According to the Theogony of Hesiod , they were the twelve children of the primordial parents Uranus ( Sky ) and his mother , Gaia ( Earth ) , with six male Titans : Oceanus , Coeus , Crius , Hyperion , Iapetus , and Cronus , and six female Titans , called the Titanides ( Greek : \u03a4\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 , Titan\u00eddes ; also Titanesses ) : Theia , Rhea , Themis , Mnemosyne , Phoebe , and Tethys . Cronus mated with his older sister Rhea and together they became the parents of the first generation of Olympians : Zeus and his five siblings Hestia , Demeter , Hera , Hades and Poseidon . Descendants of the Titans are sometimes also called Titans . The Titans were the former gods , the generation of gods preceding the Olympians . They were overthrown as part of the Greek succession myth , which told how Cronus seized power from his father Uranus , and ruled the cosmos with the Titans as his subordinates , and how Cronus and the Titans were in turn defeated and replaced as the ruling pantheon of gods , by Zeus and the Olympians , in a ten-year war called the Titanomachy .

Prometheus is known for his intelligence and as a champion of humankind and also seen as the author of the human arts and sciences generally . He is sometimes presented as the father of Deucalion , the hero of the flood story . The punishment of Prometheus as a consequence of the theft is a major theme of his , and is a popular subject of both ancient and modern culture . Zeus , king of the Olympian gods , sentenced the Titan to eternal torment for his transgression . The immortal was bound to a rock , where each day an eagle , the emblem of Zeus , was sent to eat Prometheus ' liver , which would then grow back overnight to be eaten again the next day . ( In ancient Greece , the liver was often thought to be the seat of human emotions . ) Prometheus was eventually freed by the hero Heracles . In another myth , Prometheus establishes the form of animal sacrifice practiced in ancient Greek religion . Evidence of a cult to Prometheus himself is not widespread . He was a focus of religious activity mainly at Athens , where he was linked to Athena and Hephaestus , other Greek deities of creative skills and technology . In the Western classical tradition , Prometheus became a figure who represented human striving , particularly the quest for scientific knowledge , and the risk of overreaching or unintended consequences .",
  "/wiki/Atomic_battery": "An atomic battery , nuclear battery , tritium battery or radioisotope generator is a device which uses energy from the decay of a radioactive isotope to generate electricity . Like nuclear reactors , they generate electricity from nuclear energy , but differ in that they do not use a chain reaction . Compared to other batteries , they are very costly , but have an extremely long life and high energy density , and so they are mainly used as power sources for equipment that must operate unattended for long periods of time , such as spacecraft , pacemakers , underwater systems and automated scientific stations in remote parts of the world . Nuclear battery technology began in 1913 , when Henry Moseley first demonstrated the beta cell . The field received considerable in-depth research attention for applications requiring long-life power sources for space needs during the 1950s and 1960s . In 1954 RCA researched a small atomic battery for small radio receivers and hearing aids . Since RCA 's initial research and development in the early 1950s , many types and methods have been designed to extract electrical energy from nuclear sources . The scientific principles are well known , but modern nano-scale technology and new wide-bandgap semiconductors have created new devices and interesting material properties not previously available . Batteries using the energy of radioisotope decay to provide long-lived power ( 10-20 years ) are being developed internationally . Conversion techniques can be grouped into two types : thermal and non-thermal . The thermal converters ( whose output power is a function of a temperature differential ) include thermoelectric and thermionic generators . The non-thermal converters ( whose output power is not a function of a temperature difference ) extract a fraction of the incident energy as it is being degraded into heat rather than using thermal energy to run electrons in a cycle .",

The last compound is a common reducing agent in chemical synthesis . Samarium has no significant biological role but is only slightly toxic . Samarium was discovered in 1879 by the French chemist Paul-\u00c9mile Lecoq de Boisbaudran and named after the mineral samarskite from which it was isolated . The mineral itself was earlier named after a Russian mine official , Colonel Vassili Samarsky-Bykhovets , who thereby became the first person to have a chemical element named after him , albeit indirectly . Although classified as a rare-earth element , samarium is the 40th most abundant element in the Earth 's crust and is more common than metals such as tin . Samarium occurs with concentration up to 2.8% in several minerals including cerite , gadolinite , samarskite , monazite and bastn\u00e4site , the last two being the most common commercial sources of the element . These minerals are mostly found in China , the United States , Brazil , India , Sri Lanka and Australia ; China is by far the world leader in samarium mining and production .

Townes , Nikolay Basov and Alexander Prokhorov were awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics for theoretical work leading to the maser . Masers are used as the timekeeping device in atomic clocks , and as extremely low-noise microwave amplifiers in radio telescopes and deep space spacecraft communication ground stations . Modern masers can be designed to generate electromagnetic waves at not only microwave frequencies but also radio and infrared frequencies . For this reason Charles Townes suggested replacing microwave with the word molecular as the first word in the acronym maser . The laser works by the same principle as the maser , but produces higher frequency coherent radiation at visible wavelengths . The maser was the forerunner of the laser , inspiring theoretical work by Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow that led to the invention of the laser in 1960 by Theodore Maiman .

The eastern border comprises a long and mixed line of mountain ranges and waterways that would normally define a subcontinent . However , Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition . It is the 6th largest continent in the world . Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains , the Ural River , the Caspian and Black Seas and the waterways of the Turkish Straits .

  "/wiki/Phosphor": "A phosphor , most generally , is a substance that exhibits the phenomenon of luminescence . This includes both phosphorescent materials , which show a slow decay in brightness ( > 1 ms ) , and fluorescent materials , where the emission decay takes place over tens of nanoseconds . Phosphorescent materials are known for their use in radar screens and glow-in-the-dark materials , whereas fluorescent materials are common in cathode ray tube ( CRT ) and plasma video display screens , fluorescent lights , sensors , and white LEDs . Phosphors are often transition-metal compounds or rare-earth compounds of various types . The most common uses of phosphors are in CRT displays and fluorescent lights . CRT phosphors were standardized beginning around World War II and designated by the letter P followed by a number . Phosphorus , the chemical element named for its light-emitting behavior , emits light due to chemiluminescence , not phosphorescence . In inorganic phosphors , these inhomogeneities in the crystal structure are created usually by addition of a trace amount of dopants , impurities called activators . ( In rare cases dislocations or other crystal defects can play the role of the impurity . ) The wavelength emitted by the emission center is dependent on the atom itself and on the surrounding crystal structure . The scintillation process in inorganic materials is due to the electronic band structure found in the crystals . An incoming particle can excite an electron from the valence band to either the conduction band or the exciton band ( located just below the conduction band and separated from the valence band by an energy gap ) .",
  "/wiki/Fluorescent_lamp": "A fluorescent lamp , or fluorescent tube , is a low-pressure mercury-vapor gas-discharge lamp that uses fluorescence to produce visible light . An electric current in the gas excites mercury vapor , which produces short-wave ultraviolet light that then causes a phosphor coating on the inside of the lamp to glow . A fluorescent lamp converts electrical energy into useful light much more efficiently than incandescent lamps . The typical luminous efficacy of fluorescent lighting systems is 50-100 lumens per watt , several times the efficacy of incandescent bulbs with comparable light output . Fluorescent lamp fixtures are more costly than incandescent lamps because they require a ballast to regulate the current through the lamp , but the lower energy cost typically offsets the higher initial cost . Compact fluorescent lamps are now available in the same popular sizes as incandescents and are used as an energy-saving alternative in homes . Because they contain mercury , many fluorescent lamps are classified as hazardous waste . The United States Environmental Protection Agency recommends that fluorescent lamps be segregated from general waste for recycling or safe disposal , and some jurisdictions require recycling of them .",
  "/wiki/NMR": "Nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) is a method of physical observation in which nuclei in a strong constant magnetic field are perturbed by a weak oscillating magnetic field ( in the near field and therefore not involving electromagnetic waves ) and respond by producing an electromagnetic signal with a frequency characteristic of the magnetic field at the nucleus . This process occurs near resonance , when the oscillation frequency matches the intrinsic frequency of the nuclei , which depends on the strength of the static magnetic field , the chemical environment , and the magnetic properties of the isotope involved ; in practical applications with static magnetic fields up to ca . 20 tesla , the frequency is similar to VHF and UHF television broadcasts ( 60-1000 MHz ) . NMR results from specific magnetic properties of certain atomic nuclei . Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is widely used to determine the structure of organic molecules in solution and study molecular physics , crystals as well as non-crystalline materials . NMR is also routinely used in advanced medical imaging techniques , such as in magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . All isotopes that contain an odd number of protons and/or neutrons ( see Isotope ) have an intrinsic nuclear magnetic moment and angular momentum , in other words a nonzero nuclear spin , while all nuclides with even numbers of both have a total spin of zero . The most commonly used nuclei are 1H and 13C , although isotopes of many other elements can be studied by high-field NMR spectroscopy as well . A key feature of NMR is that the resonance frequency of a particular simple substance is usually directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field . It is this feature that is exploited in imaging techniques ; if a sample is placed in a non-uniform magnetic field then the resonance frequencies of the sample 's nuclei depend on where in the field they are located . Since the resolution of the imaging technique depends on the magnitude of the magnetic field gradient , many efforts are made to develop increased gradient field strength . The principle of NMR usually involves three sequential steps :",
  "/wiki/Relaxation_(NMR)": "In magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( NMR spectroscopy ) , the term relaxation describes how signals change with time . In general signals deteriorate with time , becoming weaker and broader . The deterioration reflects the fact that the NMR signal , which results from nuclear magnetization , arises from the over-population of an excited state . Relaxation is the conversion of this non-equilibrium population to a normal population . In other words , relaxation describes how quickly spins forget the direction in which they are oriented . The rates of this spin relaxation can be measured in both spectroscopy and imaging applications .",
  "/wiki/Gadolinium": "Gadolinium is a chemical element with the symbol Gd and atomic number 64 . Gadolinium is a silvery-white metal when oxidation is removed . It is only slightly malleable and is a ductile rare-earth element . Gadolinium reacts with atmospheric oxygen or moisture slowly to form a black coating . Gadolinium below its Curie point of 20 \u00b0C ( 68 \u00b0F ) is ferromagnetic , with an attraction to a magnetic field higher than that of nickel . Above this temperature it is the most paramagnetic element . It is found in nature only in an oxidized form . When separated , it usually has impurities of the other rare-earths because of their similar chemical properties . Gadolinium was discovered in 1880 by Jean Charles de Marignac , who detected its oxide by using spectroscopy . It is named after the mineral gadolinite , one of the minerals in which gadolinium is found , itself named for the chemist Johan Gadolin . Pure gadolinium was first isolated by the chemist Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran around 1886 . Gadolinium possesses unusual metallurgical properties , to the extent that as little as 1% of gadolinium can significantly improve the workability and resistance to oxidation at high temperatures of iron , chromium , and related metals .",

  "/wiki/Computer_memory": "In computing , memory refers to a device that is used to store information for immediate use in a computer or related computer hardware device . It typically refers to semiconductor memory , specifically metal-oxide-semiconductor ( MOS ) memory , where data is stored within MOS memory cells on a silicon integrated circuit chip . The term memory is often synonymous with the term primary storage . Computer memory operates at a high speed , for example random-access memory ( RAM ) , as a distinction from storage that provides slow-to-access information but offers higher capacities . If needed , contents of the computer memory can be transferred to secondary storage ; a very common way of doing this is through a memory management technique called virtual memory . An archaic synonym for memory is store . The term memory , meaning primary storage or main memory , is often associated with addressable semiconductor memory , i.e . integrated circuits consisting of silicon-based MOS transistors , used for example as primary storage but also other purposes in computers and other digital electronic devices . There are two main kinds of semiconductor memory , volatile and non-volatile . Examples of non-volatile memory are flash memory ( used as secondary memory ) and ROM , PROM , EPROM and EEPROM memory ( used for storing firmware such as BIOS ) . Examples of volatile memory are primary storage , which is typically dynamic random-access memory ( DRAM ) , and fast CPU cache memory , which is typically static random-access memory ( SRAM ) that is fast but energy-consuming , offering lower memory areal density than DRAM . Most semiconductor memory is organized into memory cells or bistable flip-flops , each storing one bit ( 0 or 1 ) .",
  "/wiki/MRI_contrast_agent": "MRI contrast agents are contrast agents used to improve the visibility of internal body structures in magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . The most commonly used compounds for contrast enhancement are gadolinium-based . Such MRI contrast agents shorten the relaxation times of nuclei within body tissues following oral or intravenous administration . In MRI scanners , sections of the body are exposed to a very strong magnetic field causing primarily the hydrogen nuclei ( spins ) of water in tissues to be polarized in the direction of the magnetic field . An intense radiofrequency pulse is applied that tips the magnetization generated by the hydrogen nuclei in the direction of the receiver coil where the spin polarization can be detected . Random molecular rotational oscillations matching the resonance frequency of the nuclear spins provide the relaxation mechanisms that bring the net magnetization back to its equilibrium position in alignment with the applied magnetic field . The magnitude of the spin polarization detected by the receiver is used to form the MR image but decays with a characteristic time constant known as the T1 relaxation time . Water protons in different tissues have different T1 values , which is one of the main sources of contrast in MR images . A contrast agent usually shortens , but in some instances increases , the value of T1 of nearby water protons thereby altering the contrast in the image .",

The variation of materials ' magnetization due to the applied magnetic field changes the magnetostrictive strain until reaching its saturation value , \u03bb . The effect was first identified in 1842 by James Joule when observing a sample of iron . This effect causes energy loss due to frictional heating in susceptible ferromagnetic cores . The effect is also responsible for the low-pitched humming sound that can be heard coming from transformers , where oscillating AC currents produce a changing magnetic field .",
  "/wiki/Galfenol": "In materials science , galfenol is the general term for an alloy of iron and gallium . The name was first given to iron-gallium alloys by United States Navy researchers in 1998 when they discovered that adding gallium to iron could amplify iron 's magnetostrictive effect up to tenfold . Galfenol is of interest to sonar researchers because magnetostrictor materials are used to detect sound , and amplifying the magnetostrictive effect could lead to better sensitivity of sonar detectors . Galfenol is also proposed for vibrational energy harvesting , actuators for precision machine tools , active anti-vibration systems , and anti-clogging devices for sifting screens and spray nozzles . Galfenol is machinable and can be produced in sheet and wire form . In 2009 , scientists from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University , and National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) used neutron beams to determine the structure of galfenol . They determined that the addition of gallium changes the lattice structure of the iron atoms from regular cubic cells to one in which the faces of some of the cells become slightly rectangular . The elongated cells tend to clump together in the alloy , forming localized clumps within the material . These clumps have been described by Peter Gehring of the NIST Center for Neutron Research as something like raisins within a cake .",

  "/wiki/Sonar": "Sonar ( originally an acronym for sound navigation ranging ) is a technique that uses sound propagation ( usually underwater , as in submarine navigation ) to navigate , communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water , such as other vessels . Two types of technology share the name sonar : passive sonar is essentially listening for the sound made by vessels ; active sonar is emitting pulses of sounds and listening for echoes . Sonar may be used as a means of acoustic location and of measurement of the echo characteristics of targets in the water . Acoustic location in air was used before the introduction of radar . Sonar may also be used for robot navigation , and SODAR ( an upward-looking in-air sonar ) is used for atmospheric investigations . The term sonar is also used for the equipment used to generate and receive the sound . The acoustic frequencies used in sonar systems vary from very low ( infrasonic ) to extremely high ( ultrasonic ) . The study of underwater sound is known as underwater acoustics or hydroacoustics . The first recorded use of the technique was by Leonardo da Vinci in 1490 who used a tube inserted into the water to detect vessels by ear . It was developed during World War I to counter the growing threat of submarine warfare , with an operational passive sonar system in use by 1918 . Modern active sonar systems use an acoustic transponder to generate a sound wave which is reflected back from target objects .",
  "/wiki/Fuel_cells": "A fuel cell is an electrochemical cell that converts the chemical energy of a fuel ( often hydrogen ) and an oxidizing agent ( often oxygen ) into electricity through a pair of redox reactions . Fuel cells are different from most batteries in requiring a continuous source of fuel and oxygen ( usually from air ) to sustain the chemical reaction , whereas in a battery the chemical energy usually comes from metals and their ions or oxides that are commonly already present in the battery , except in flow batteries . Fuel cells can produce electricity continuously for as long as fuel and oxygen are supplied . The first fuel cells were invented by Sir William Grove in 1838 . The first commercial use of fuel cells came more than a century later following the invention of the hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell by Francis Thomas Bacon in 1932 . The alkaline fuel cell , also known as the Bacon fuel cell after its inventor , has been used in NASA space programs since the mid-1960s to generate power for satellites and space capsules . Since then , fuel cells have been used in many other applications . Fuel cells are used for primary and backup power for commercial , industrial and residential buildings and in remote or inaccessible areas . They are also used to power fuel cell vehicles , including forklifts , automobiles , buses , boats , motorcycles and submarines . There are many types of fuel cells , but they all consist of an anode , a cathode , and an electrolyte that allows ions , often positively charged hydrogen ions ( protons ) , to move between the two sides of the fuel cell . At the anode a catalyst causes the fuel to undergo oxidation reactions that generate ions ( often positively charged hydrogen ions ) and electrons .

The platters are paired with magnetic heads , usually arranged on a moving actuator arm , which read and write data to the platter surfaces . Data is accessed in a random-access manner , meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored and retrieved in any order . HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage , retaining stored data even when powered off . Introduced by IBM in 1956 , HDDs were the dominant secondary storage device for general-purpose computers beginning in the early 1960s . HDDs maintained this position into the modern era of servers and personal computers , though personal computing devices produced in large volume , like cell phones and tablets , rely on flash products . More than 224 companies have produced HDDs historically , though after extensive industry consolidation most units are manufactured by Seagate , Toshiba , and Western Digital . HDDs dominate the volume of storage produced ( exabytes per year ) for servers .

  "/wiki/Magnet": "A magnet is a material or object that produces a magnetic field . This magnetic field is invisible but is responsible for the most notable property of a magnet : a force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials , such as iron , and attracts or repels other magnets . A permanent magnet is an object made from a material that is magnetized and creates its own persistent magnetic field . An everyday example is a refrigerator magnet used to hold notes on a refrigerator door . Materials that can be magnetized , which are also the ones that are strongly attracted to a magnet , are called ferromagnetic ( or ferrimagnetic ) . These include the elements iron , nickel and cobalt and their alloys , some alloys of rare-earth metals , and some naturally occurring minerals such as lodestone . Although ferromagnetic ( and ferrimagnetic ) materials are the only ones attracted to a magnet strongly enough to be commonly considered magnetic , all other substances respond weakly to a magnetic field , by one of several other types of magnetism . Ferromagnetic materials can be divided into magnetically soft materials like annealed iron , which can be magnetized but do not tend to stay magnetized , and magnetically hard materials , which do . Permanent magnets are made from hard ferromagnetic materials such as alnico and ferrite that are subjected to special processing in a strong magnetic field during manufacture to align their internal microcrystalline structure , making them very hard to demagnetize . To demagnetize a saturated magnet , a certain magnetic field must be applied , and this threshold depends on coercivity of the respective material . Hard materials have high coercivity , whereas soft materials have low coercivity . The overall strength of a magnet is measured by its magnetic moment or , alternatively , the total magnetic flux it produces .",
  "/wiki/Erbium": "Erbium is a chemical element with the symbol Er and atomic number 68 . A silvery-white solid metal when artificially isolated , natural erbium is always found in chemical combination with other elements . It is a lanthanide , a rare earth element , originally found in the gadolinite mine in Ytterby in Sweden , from which it got its name . Erbium 's principal uses involve its pink-colored Er3+ ions , which have optical fluorescent properties particularly useful in certain laser applications . Erbium-doped glasses or crystals can be used as optical amplification media , where Er3+ ions are optically pumped at around 980 or 1480 nm and then radiate light at 1530 nm in stimulated emission . This process results in an unusually mechanically simple laser optical amplifier for signals transmitted by fiber optics . The 1550 nm wavelength is especially important for optical communications because standard single mode optical fibers have minimal loss at this particular wavelength . In addition to optical fiber amplifier-lasers , a large variety of medical applications ( i.e . dermatology , dentistry ) rely on the erbium ion 's 2940 nm emission ( see Er : YAG laser ) when lit at another wavelength , which is highly absorbed in water in tissues , making its effect very superficial . Such shallow tissue deposition of laser energy is helpful in laser surgery , and for the efficient production of steam which produces enamel ablation by common types of dental laser .",
  "/wiki/Vanadium_steel": "Vanadium is a chemical element with the symbol V and atomic number 23 . It is a hard , silvery-grey , malleable transition metal . The elemental metal is rarely found in nature , but once isolated artificially , the formation of an oxide layer ( passivation ) somewhat stabilizes the free metal against further oxidation . Andr\u00e9s Manuel del R\u00edo discovered compounds of vanadium in 1801 in Mexico by analyzing a new lead-bearing mineral he called brown lead , and presumed its qualities were due to the presence of a new element , which he named erythronium ( derived from the Greek word for red , \u1f10\u03c1\u03c5\u03b8\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd , eruthr\u00f3n ) since upon heating most of the salts turned red . Four years later , he was ( erroneously ) convinced by other scientists that erythronium was identical to chromium . Chlorides of vanadium were generated in 1830 by Nils Gabriel Sefstr\u00f6m who thereby proved that a new element was involved , which he named vanadium after the Scandinavian goddess of beauty and fertility , Vanad\u00eds ( Freyja ) . Both names were attributed to the wide range of colors found in vanadium compounds . Del Rio 's lead mineral was later renamed vanadinite for its vanadium content . In 1867 Henry Enfield Roscoe obtained the pure element . Vanadium occurs naturally in about 65 minerals and in fossil fuel deposits . It is produced in China and Russia from steel smelter slag . Other countries produce it either from magnetite directly , flue dust of heavy oil , or as a byproduct of uranium mining .",
  "/wiki/Optical_fiber": "An optical fiber is a flexible , transparent fiber made by drawing glass ( silica ) or plastic to a diameter slightly thicker than that of a human hair . Optical fibers are used most often as a means to transmit light [ a ] between the two ends of the fiber and find wide usage in fiber-optic communications , where they permit transmission over longer distances and at higher bandwidths ( data rates ) than electrical cables . Fibers are used instead of metal wires because signals travel along them with less loss ; in addition , fibers are immune to electromagnetic interference , a problem from which metal wires suffer . Fibers are also used for illumination and imaging , and are often wrapped in bundles so they may be used to carry light into , or images out of confined spaces , as in the case of a fiberscope . Specially designed fibers are also used for a variety of other applications , some of them being fiber optic sensors and fiber lasers . Optical fibers typically include a core surrounded by a transparent cladding material with a lower index of refraction . Light is kept in the core by the phenomenon of total internal reflection which causes the fiber to act as a waveguide . Fibers that support many propagation paths or transverse modes are called multi-mode fibers , while those that support a single mode are called single-mode fibers ( SMF ) . Multi-mode fibers generally have a wider core diameter and are used for short-distance communication links and for applications where high power must be transmitted . Single-mode fibers are used for most communication links longer than 1,000 meters ( 3,300 ft ) . [ citation needed ] Being able to join optical fibers with low loss is important in fiber optic communication . This is more complex than joining electrical wire or cable and involves careful cleaving of the fibers , precise alignment of the fiber cores , and the coupling of these aligned cores .",

In their pre-reaction states , reducers have extra electrons ( that is , they are by themselves reduced ) and oxidizers lack electrons ( that is , they are by themselves oxidized ) . A reducing agent typically is in one of its lower possible oxidation states and is known as the electron donor . Examples of reducing agents include the earth metals , formic acid , oxalic acid , and sulfite compounds . For example , consider the overall reaction for aerobic cellular respiration :",
  "/wiki/Flare_(countermeasure)": "A flare or decoy flare is an aerial infrared countermeasure used by a plane or helicopter to counter an infrared homing ( heat-seeking ) surface-to-air missile or air-to-air missile . Flares are commonly composed of a pyrotechnic composition based on magnesium or another hot-burning metal , with burning temperature equal to or hotter than engine exhaust . The aim is to make the infrared-guided missile seek out the heat signature from the flare rather than the aircraft 's engines .",
  "/wiki/Stainless_steel": "In metallurgy , stainless steel , also known as inox steel or inox from French inoxydable ( inoxidizable ) , is a steel alloy , with a minimum of 11% chromium content by mass and a maximum of 1.2% carbon by mass . Stainless steels are most notable for their corrosion resistance , which increases with increasing chromium content . Additions of molybdenum increases corrosion resistance in reducing acids and against pitting attack in chloride solutions . Thus , there are numerous grades of stainless steel with varying chromium and molybdenum contents to suit the environment the alloy must endure . Resistance to corrosion and staining , low maintenance , and familiar luster make stainless steel an ideal material for many applications where both the strength of steel and corrosion resistance are required . Stainless steel is rolled into sheets , plates , bars , wire , and tubing to be used in : cookware , cutlery , surgical instruments , major appliances ; construction material in large buildings , such as the Chrysler Building ; industrial equipment ( for example , in paper mills , chemical plants , water treatment ) ; and storage tanks and tankers for chemicals and food products ( for example , chemical tankers and road tankers ) . Corrosion resistance , the ease with which it can be steam cleaned and sterilized , and lack of need for surface coatings has also influenced the use of stainless steel in commercial kitchens and food processing plants .",
  "/wiki/Strain_gauge": "A strain gauge ( also spelled strain gage ) is a device used to measure strain on an object . Invented by Edward E. Simmons and Arthur C. Ruge in 1938 , the most common type of strain gauge consists of an insulating flexible backing which supports a metallic foil pattern . The gauge is attached to the object by a suitable adhesive , such as cyanoacrylate . As the object is deformed , the foil is deformed , causing its electrical resistance to change . This resistance change , usually measured using a Wheatstone bridge , is related to the strain by the quantity known as the gauge factor .",
  "/wiki/Nuclear_medicine": "Nuclear medicine is a medical specialty involving the application of radioactive substances in the diagnosis and treatment of disease . Nuclear medicine imaging , in a sense , is radiology done inside out or endoradiology because it records radiation emitting from within the body rather than radiation that is generated by external sources like X-rays . In addition , nuclear medicine scans differ from radiology as the emphasis is not on imaging anatomy but the function and for such reason , it is called a physiological imaging modality . Single photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) and positron emission tomography ( PET ) scans are the two most common imaging modalities in nuclear medicine .",
  "/wiki/Earthquakes": "An earthquake ( also known as a quake , tremor or temblor ) is the shaking of the surface of the Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the Earth 's lithosphere that creates seismic waves . Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they can not be felt to those violent enough to propel objects ( and people ) into the air , and wreak destruction across entire cities . The seismicity , or seismic activity , of an area is the frequency , type , and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time . The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling . At the Earth 's surface , earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the ground . When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore , the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami . Earthquakes can also trigger landslides and occasionally , volcanic activity . In its most general sense , the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event - whether natural or caused by humans - that generates seismic waves . Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological faults but also by other events such as volcanic activity , landslides , mine blasts , and nuclear tests . An earthquake 's point of initial rupture is called its focus or hypocenter . The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter .",
  "/wiki/Lutetium": "Lutetium is a chemical element with the symbol Lu and atomic number 71 . It is a silvery white metal , which resists corrosion in dry air , but not in moist air . Lutetium is the last element in the lanthanide series , and it is traditionally counted among the rare earths . Lutetium is sometimes considered the first element of the 6th-period transition metals , although lanthanum is more often considered as such . Lutetium was independently discovered in 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain , Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach , and American chemist Charles James . All of these researchers found lutetium as an impurity in the mineral ytterbia , which was previously thought to consist entirely of ytterbium . The dispute on the priority of the discovery occurred shortly after , with Urbain and Welsbach accusing each other of publishing results influenced by the published research of the other ; the naming honor went to Urbain , as he had published his results earlier . He chose the name lutecium for the new element , but in 1949 the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium . In 1909 , the priority was finally granted to Urbain and his names were adopted as official ones ; however , the name cassiopeium ( or later cassiopium ) for element 71 proposed by Welsbach was used by many German scientists until the 1950s . Lutetium is not a particularly abundant element , although it is significantly more common than silver in the earth 's crust . It has few specific uses . Lutetium-176 is a relatively abundant ( 2.5% ) radioactive isotope with a half-life of about 38 billion years , used to determine the age of minerals and meteorites .",

  "/wiki/Paris": "Paris ( French pronunciation : \u200b [ pa\u0281i ] ( listen ) ) is the capital and most populous city of France , with a population of 2,148,271 residents ( official estimate , 1 January 2020 ) in an area of 105 square kilometres ( 41 square miles ) . Since the 17th century , Paris has been one of Europe 's major centres of finance , diplomacy , commerce , fashion , science and the arts . The City of Paris is the centre and seat of government of the \u00cele-de-France , or Paris Region , which has an estimated official 2020 population of 12,278,210 , or about 18 percent of the population of France . The Paris Region had a GDP of \u20ac709 billion ( $ 808 billion ) in 2017 . According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey in 2018 , Paris was the second most expensive city in the world , after Singapore , and ahead of Z\u00fcrich , Hong Kong , Oslo and Geneva . Another source ranked Paris as most expensive , on a par with Singapore and Hong Kong , in 2018 . The city is a major railway , highway and air-transport hub served by two international airports : Paris-Charles de Gaulle ( the second busiest airport in Europe ) and Paris-Orly . Opened in 1900 , the city 's subway system , the Paris M\u00e9tro , serves 5.23 million passengers daily ; it is the second busiest metro system in Europe after the Moscow Metro . Gare du Nord is the 24th busiest railway station in the world , but the first located outside Japan , with 262 million passengers in 2015 . Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks : the Louvre was among most visited art museums in the world in 2019 , with 9.6 million visitors . The Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay , Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet , and Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist art , the Pompidou Centre Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne has the largest collection of modern and contemporary art in Europe , and the Mus\u00e9e Rodin and Mus\u00e9e Picasso exhibit the works of the two noted Parisians . The historical district along the Seine in the city centre is classified as a UNESCO Heritage Site , and popular landmarks in the city centre included the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris , now closed for renovation after the 15 April 2019 fire .",
  "/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography": "Positron-emission tomography ( PET ) is a nuclear medicine functional imaging technique that is used to observe metabolic processes in the body as an aid to the diagnosis of disease . The system detects pairs of gamma rays emitted indirectly by a positron-emitting radioligand , most commonly fluorine-18 , which is introduced into the body on a biologically active molecule called a radioactive tracer . Different ligands are used for different imaging purposes , depending on what the radiologist/researcher wants to detect . Three-dimensional images of tracer concentration within the body are then constructed by computer analysis . In modern PET computed tomography scanners , three-dimensional imaging is often accomplished with the aid of a computed tomography X-ray scan performed on the patient during the same session , in the same machine . If the biologically active tracer molecule chosen for PET is fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) , an analogue of glucose , the concentrations of tracer imaged will indicate tissue metabolic activity as it corresponds to the regional glucose uptake . Use of this tracer to explore the possibility of cancer metastasis ( i.e. , spreading to other sites ) is the most common type of PET scan in standard medical care ( representing 90% of current scans ) . Metabolic trapping of the radioactive glucose molecule allows the PET scan to be utilized . The same tracer may also be used for PET investigation and diagnosis of types of dementia . Less often , other radioactive tracers , usually but not always labeled with fluorine-18 , are used to image the tissue concentration of other types of molecules of interest . One of the disadvantages of PET scanners is their operating cost . A similar imaging process to PET is single-photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) , which also uses radioligands to detect molecules in the brain , and is less expensive .",
  "/wiki/Lutetium_tantalate": "Lutetium tantalate is a chemical compound of lutetium , tantalum and oxygen with the formula LuTaO4 . With a density of 9.81 g/cm3 , it is the densest known white stable material . ( Although thorium dioxide ThO2 is also white and has a higher density of 10 g/cm3 , it is radioactively unstable ; while not radioactive enough to make it unstable as a material , even its low rate of decay is still too much for certain uses such as phosphors for detecting ionising radiation . ) The white color and high density of LuTaO4 make it ideal for phosphor applications , though the high cost of lutetium is a hindrance .",
  "/wiki/Oil_refinery": "An oil refinery or petroleum refinery is an industrial process plant where crude oil is transformed and refined into more useful products such as petroleum naphtha , gasoline , diesel fuel , asphalt base , heating oil , kerosene , liquefied petroleum gas , jet fuel and fuel oils . Petrochemicals feed stock like ethylene and propylene can also be produced directly by cracking crude oil without the need of using refined products of crude oil such as naphtha . Oil refineries are typically large , sprawling industrial complexes with extensive piping running throughout , carrying streams of fluids between large chemical processing units , such as distillation columns . In many ways , oil refineries use much of the technology , and can be thought of , as types of chemical plants . The crude oil feedstock has typically been processed by an oil production plant . There is usually an oil depot at or near an oil refinery for the storage of incoming crude oil feedstock as well as bulk liquid products . Petroleum refineries are very large industrial complexes that involve many different processing units and auxiliary facilities such as utility units and storage tanks . Each refinery has its own unique arrangement and combination of refining processes largely determined by the refinery location , desired products and economic considerations . An oil refinery is considered an essential part of the downstream side of the petroleum industry . Some modern petroleum refineries process as much as 800,000 to 900,000 barrels ( 127,000 to 143,000 cubic meters ) of crude oil per day . According to the Oil and Gas Journal in the world a total of 636 refineries were operated on the 31 December 2014 for a total capacity of 87.75 million barrels ( 13,951,000 m3 ) . Jamnagar Refinery is the largest oil refinery , since 25 December 2008 , with a processing capacity of 1.24 million barrels ( 197,000 m3 ) .",
  "/wiki/LED_light_bulb": "An LED lamp or LED light bulb is an electric light for use in light fixtures that produces light using one or more light-emitting diodes ( LEDs ) . LED lamps have a lifespan many times longer than equivalent incandescent lamps , and are significantly more efficient than most fluorescent lamps , with some LED chips able to emit up to 303 lumens per watt ( as claimed by Cree and some other LED manufacturers ) . However , LED lamps require an electronic LED driver circuit when operated from mains power lines , and losses from this circuit means that the efficiency of the lamp is lower than the efficiency of the LED chips it uses . The most efficient commercially available LED lamps have efficiencies of 200 lumens per watt ( Lm/W ) . The LED lamp market is projected to grow by more than twelve-fold over the next decade , from $ 2 billion in the beginning of 2014 to $ 25 billion in 2023 , a compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of 25% . As of 2016 [ update ] , many LEDs use only about 10% of the energy an incandescent lamp requires . Similar to incandescent lamps ( and unlike most fluorescent lamps ) , LEDs come to full brightness immediately with no warm-up delay . Frequent switching on and off does not reduce life expectancy as with fluorescent lighting . Light output decreases gradually over the lifetime of the LED ( see Efficiency droop section ) . Some LED lamps are made to be a directly compatible drop-in replacement for incandescent or fluorescent lamps . LED lamp packaging may show the light output in lumens , the power consumption in watts , the color temperature in Kelvin or a colour description such as warm white , cool white or daylight , the operating temperature range , and sometimes the equivalent wattage of an incandescent lamp delivering the same output in lumens . The directional emission characteristics of LEDs affect the design of lamps ."
