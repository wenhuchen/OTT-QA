It stretches 828 kilometres ( 514 mi ) from Windsor in the west to the Ontario-Quebec border in the east . The part of Highway 401 that passes through Toronto is North America 's busiest highway , and one of the widest . Together with Quebec Autoroute 20 , it forms the road transportation backbone of the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor , along which over half of Canada 's population resides and is also a Core Route in the National Highway System of Canada . The route is maintained by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario ( MTO ) and patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police . The speed limit is 100 km/h ( 62 mph ) throughout its length , with the only exceptions the posted 80 km/h ( 50 mph ) limit westbound in Windsor and in most construction zones . By the end of 1952 , three individual highways were numbered Highway 401 : the partially completed Toronto Bypass between Weston Road and Highway 11 ( Yonge Street ) ; Highway 2A between West Hill and Newcastle ; and the Scenic Highway between Gananoque and Brockville , now known as the Thousand Islands Parkway . These three sections of highway were 11.8 , 54.7 and 41.2 km , ( 7.3 , 34.0 and 25.6 mi ) , respectively . In 1964 , the route became fully navigable from Windsor to the Ontario-Quebec border . In 1965 it was given a second designation , the Macdonald-Cartier Freeway , in honour of two Fathers of Confederation . At the end of 1968 , the Gananoque-Brockville section was bypassed and the final intersection grade-separated near Kingston , making Highway 401 a freeway for its entire 817.9-km length . On August 24 , 2007 , the portion of the highway between Glen Miller Road in Trenton and the Don Valley Parkway / Highway 404 Junction in Toronto was designated the Highway of Heroes , as the road is travelled by funeral convoys for fallen Canadian Forces personnel from CFB Trenton to the coroner 's office in Toronto .",

The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe , an urban agglomeration of 9,245,438 people ( as of 2016 ) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario . Toronto is an international centre of business , finance , arts , and culture , and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world . People have travelled through and inhabited the Toronto area , located on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers , deep ravines , and urban forest , for more than 10,000 years . After the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase , when the Mississauga surrendered the area to the British Crown , the British established the town of York in 1793 and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada . During the War of 1812 , the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy damage by American troops . York was renamed and incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto . It was designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation . The city proper has since expanded past its original borders through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of 630.2 km2 ( 243.3 sq mi ) . The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada .

At its peak , Highway 7 measured 716 km ( 445 mi ) in length , stretching from Highway 40 east of Sarnia in Southwestern Ontario to Highway 17 west of Ottawa in Eastern Ontario . However , due in part to the construction of Highways 402 and 407 , the province transferred the sections of Highway 7 west of London and through the Greater Toronto Area to county and regional jurisdiction . The highway is now 535.7 km ( 332.9 mi ) long ; the western segment begins at Highway 4 north of London and extends 154.1 km ( 95.8 mi ) to Georgetown , while the eastern segment begins at Donald Cousens Parkway in Markham and extends 381.6 km ( 237.1 mi ) to Highway 417 in Ottawa . Highway 7 was first designated in 1920 between Sarnia and Guelph and extended to Brampton the following year . Between 1927 and 1932 , the highway was more than doubled in length as it was gradually extended eastward to Perth , where Highway 15 continued to Ottawa . In the early 1960s , that section of Highway 15 was renumbered as Highway 7 . In that same decade , the Conestoga Parkway through Kitchener and the Peterborough Bypass were constructed . During the 1970s and 1980s , many sections of Highway 7 were widened from the initial two lane cross-section to four or six lanes . Within York Region , the route was upgraded to a limited-access expressway in preparation for the construction of Highway 407 . Soon thereafter , that new tollway would act as justification for transferring the section of Highway 7 through the Greater Toronto Area ( GTA ) to regional governments .

A village by the same name was surveyed within the township where Bear Creek crossed the Egremont . The larger village of Watford was established to the southeast of Warwick Village when the Great Western Railway was established in the 1850s . Watford became an incorporated village in 1873 while parts of Warwick were removed for municipal purposes when the villages of Forest and Arkona were incorporated in the 1870s . With municipal restructuring in 2001 , Watford and Warwick were merged . While agriculture remains a mainstay the township 's location between the cities of London and Sarnia means that increasingly residents find work in these larger centres .

The physical highway , however , continues as the Gardiner Expressway into downtown Toronto . The QEW is one of Ontario 's busiest highways , with an average of close to 200,000 vehicles per day on some sections .

Within the Regional Municipality of Halton , between its two junctions with Highway 403 , the QEW is signed concurrently with Highway 403 . The history of the QEW dates back to 1931 , when work began to widen the Middle Road in a similar fashion to the nearby Dundas Highway and Lakeshore Road as a relief project during the Great Depression . Following the 1934 provincial election , Ontario Minister of Highways Thomas McQuesten and his deputy minister Robert Melville Smith changed the design to be similar to the autobahns of Germany , dividing the opposite directions of travel and using grade-separated interchanges at major crossroads . When opened to traffic in 1937 , it was the first intercity divided highway in North America and featured the longest stretch of consistent illumination in the world . While not a true freeway at the time , it was gradually upgraded , widened , and modernized beginning in the 1950s , more or less taking on its current form by 1975 .

Incorporated as a village in 1860 , Morrisburg had a growing manufacturing base consisting of a gristmill , a carding mill and a fanning mill . The Grand Trunk Railroad reached Morrisburg in 1855 . Eventually a power station was built on the St. Lawrence River . During the 1950s , portions of Morrisburg were relocated because of expected flooding caused by the St. Lawrence Seaway project . Over 80 homes were moved and the entire downtown business district was demolished and relocated in a shopping plaza .
