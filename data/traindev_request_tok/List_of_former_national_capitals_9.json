According to Rus ' Primary Chronicle , the first ruler to start uniting East Slavic lands into what has become known as Kievan Rus ' was Prince Oleg ( 882-912 ) . He extended his control from Novgorod south along the Dnieper river valley to protect trade from Khazar incursions from the east , and he moved his capital to the more strategic Kiev . Sviatoslav I ( died 972 ) achieved the first major expansion of Kievan Rus ' territorial control , fighting a war of conquest against the Khazars . Vladimir the Great ( 980-1015 ) introduced Christianity with his own baptism and , by decree , extended it to all inhabitants of Kiev and beyond . Kievan Rus ' reached its greatest extent under Yaroslav the Wise ( 1019-1054 ) ; his sons assembled and issued its first written legal code , the Rus ' Justice , shortly after his death . The state declined beginning in the late 11th century and during the 12th century , disintegrating into various rival regional powers . It was further weakened by economic factors , such as the collapse of Rus ' commercial ties to the Byzantine Empire due to the decline of Constantinople and the accompanying diminution of trade routes through its territory .

It was concluded between the Tsardom of Russia and the Swedish Empire on 10 September [ O.S . 30 August ] 1721 in the then Swedish town of Nystad ( Finnish : Uusikaupunki , in the south-west of present-day Finland ) . Sweden had settled with the other parties in Stockholm ( 1719 and 1720 ) and in Frederiksborg ( 1720 ) . During the war Peter I of Russia had occupied all Swedish possessions on the eastern Baltic coast : Swedish Ingria ( where he began to build the soon-to-be new Russian capital of St. Petersburg in 1703 ) , Swedish Estonia and Swedish Livonia ( which had capitulated in 1710 ) , and Finland . In Nystad , King Frederick I of Sweden formally recognized the transfer of Estonia , Livonia , Ingria , and Southeast Finland ( Kexholmsl\u00e4n and part of Karelian Isthmus ) to Russia in exchange for two million silver thaler , while Russia returned the bulk of Finland to Swedish rule . The Treaty enshrined the rights of the German Baltic nobility within Estonia and Livonia to maintain their financial system , their existing customs border , their self-government , their Lutheran religion , and the German language ; this special position in the Russian Empire was reconfirmed by all Russian Tsars from Peter the Great ( reigned 1682-1725 ) to Alexander II ( reigned 1855-1881 ) . Nystad manifested the decisive shift in the European balance of power which the war had brought about : the Swedish imperial era had ended ; Sweden entered the Age of Liberty , while Russia had emerged as a new empire .",
  "/wiki/Imperial_Russia": "The Russian Empire [ a ] was an empire that extended across Eurasia and North America from 1721 , following the end of the Great Northern War , until the Republic was proclaimed by the Provisional Government that took power after the February Revolution of 1917 . The third-largest empire in history , at its greatest extent stretching over three continents , Europe , Asia , and North America , the Russian Empire was surpassed in size only by the British and Mongol empires . The rise of the Russian Empire coincided with the decline of neighboring rival powers : the Swedish Empire , the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , Persia and the Ottoman Empire . It played a major role in 1812-1814 in defeating Napoleon 's ambitions to control Europe and expanded to the west and south . The House of Romanov ruled the Russian Empire from 1721 until 1762 . Its matrilineal branch of patrilineal German descent , the House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov , ruled from 1762 to the end of the empire . At the beginning of the 19th century , the Russian Empire extended from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea in the south , from the Baltic Sea on the west into Alaska and Northern California in America on the east . With 125.6 million subjects registered by the 1897 census , it had the third-largest population in the world at the time , after Qing China and India . Like all empires , it featured great diversity in terms of economies , ethnicities , languages , and religion . There were many dissident elements that launched numerous rebellions and assassinations over the centuries . In the 19th century , they were closely watched by the imperial secret police , and thousands were exiled to Siberia . Economically , the empire was predominantly agricultural , with low productivity on large estates worked by Russian peasants , known as serfs , who were tied to the land in a feudal arrangement .",

Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas .",

The territory is today to be found in the modern states of Poland , Ukraine and the Slovak Republic . Galicia was conquered by the Prince of Volhynia Roman the Great with the help of Leszek the White of Poland . Roman the Great united the principalities of Halych and Volhynia into a single state . Along with Novgorod and Vladimir-Suzdal , it was one of the three most important powers to emerge from the collapse of Kievan Rus ' . Following the destruction wreaked by the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus ' ( 1239 to 1241 ) , Prince Danylo Romanovych was forced to pledge allegiance to Batu Khan of the Golden Horde in 1246 . He strove to rid his realm of the Mongol yoke , however , by a formal orientation to Western Europe . He was crowned as a Rex Rusiae by a papal legate in 1253 . He also tried , unsuccessfully , to establish military alliances with other European rulers . The Polish conquest of the kingdom in 1349 ended its vassalage to the Golden Horde . Western Galicia-Volhynia extended between the rivers San and Wieprz in what is now south-eastern Poland , while eastern territories covered the Pripet Marshes ( now in Belarus ) and the upper reaches of Southern Bug river in modern Ukraine . During its time , the kingdom was bordered by Black Rus ' , the Grand Duchy of Lithuania , the Principality of Turov-Pinsk , the Principality of Kiev , the Golden Horde , the Kingdom of Hungary , the Kingdom of Poland , the Principality of Moldova and the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights .",

The Hetmanate was founded by the Hetman of Zaporizhian Host Bohdan Khmelnytsky during the Uprising of 1648-57 . Establishment of vassal relations with the Tsardom of Russia in the Treaty of Pereyaslav of 1654 is considered a benchmark of the Cossack Hetmanate in Soviet , Ukrainian , and Russian historiography . The second Pereyaslav Council in 1659 further restricted the independence of the Hetmanate , and from the Moscow side there were attempts to declare agreements reached with Yuri Khmelnitsky in 1659 as nothing more than the former Bohdan 's agreements of 1654 . The 1667 Treaty of Andrusovo - conducted without any representation from the Cossack Hetmanate - established borders between the Polish and Russian states , dividing the Hetmanate in half along the Dnieper and putting the Zaporizhian Sich under a formal joint Russian-Polish administration . After a failed attempt to break the union with Russia by Ivan Mazepa in 1708 , the whole area was included into the Government of Kiev and Cossack autonomy was severely restricted . Catherine II of Russia officially abolished the institute of the Hetman in 1764 , and in 1764-1781 the Cossack Hetmanate was incorporated as the Little Russia Governorate headed by Pyotr Rumyantsev , with the last remnants of the Hetmanate 's administrative system abolished in 1781 .",
