The party was founded as an Irish republican party on 16 May 1926 by \u00c9amon de Valera and his supporters after they split from the anty-treaty wing of Sinn F\u00e9in on the issue of abstentionism in the aftermath of the Irish Civil War . Since 1927 Fianna F\u00e1il has been one of Ireland 's two major parties , along with Fine Gael ; both are seen as being centre-right parties , and as being to the right of the Labour Party and Sinn F\u00e9in . The party dominated Irish political life for most of the 20th century , and since its foundation either it or Fine Gael has led every government . Between 1989 and 2011 , it led coalition governments with parties of both the left and the right . Fianna F\u00e1il was last in government from 1997 to 2011 under Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen , with a periodic high of 81 seats in 2002 , reduced to 77 in 2007 and then to 20 in 2011 ( during the post-2008 economic downturn ) , the lowest in the party 's history . At the 2016 general election , Fianna F\u00e1il won 44 seats and became the largest opposition party in both houses ( D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann and Seanad \u00c9ireann ) of the Oireachtas , with party leader Miche\u00e1l Martin entering into a confidence and supply arrangement with a Fine Gael-led minority government at the beginning of the 32nd D\u00e1il .

This gives Labour a cumulative total of nineteen years served as part of a government , the second-longest total of any party in the Republic of Ireland after Fianna F\u00e1il .

The party also supported economic liberalisation , advocating measures such as lower taxation , fiscal conservatism , privatisation , and welfare reform . It enjoyed an impressive d\u00e9but at the 1987 general election , winning 14 seats in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann and capturing almost 12 per cent of the popular vote to temporarily surpass the Labour Party as Ireland 's third-largest political party .
