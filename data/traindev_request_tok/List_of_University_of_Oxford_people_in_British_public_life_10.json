The buildings have inspired replicas throughout the world in addition to being featured in films such as Harry Potter and The Golden Compass . This has helped Christ Church become the most popular Oxford college for tourists with almost half a million visitors annually . Christ Church has many notable alumni including thirteen British prime ministers ( more than any other Oxbridge college ) , King Edward VII , King William II of the Netherlands , seventeen Archbishops , writers Lewis Carroll ( Alice in Wonderland ) and W.

Located in Oriel Square , the college has the distinction of being the oldest royal foundation in Oxford ( a title formerly claimed by University College , whose claim of being founded by King Alfred is no longer promoted ) . In recognition of this royal connection , the college has also been known as King 's College and King 's Hall . The reigning monarch of the United Kingdom ( since 1952 , Elizabeth II ) is the official Visitor of the college . The original medieval foundation set up by Adam de Brome , under the patronage of Edward II , was called the House or Hall of the Blessed Mary at Oxford . The first design allowed for a provost and ten fellows , called scholars , and the college remained a small body of graduate fellows until the 16th century , when it started to admit undergraduates . During the English Civil War , Oriel played host to high-ranking members of the King 's Oxford Parliament . The main site of the college incorporates four medieval halls : Bedel Hall , St Mary Hall , St Martin Hall and Tackley 's Inn , the last being the earliest property acquired by the college and the oldest standing medieval hall in Oxford .

Despite his illustrious success as both Viceroy and Foreign Secretary , especially at the recent Conference of Lausanne , in 1923 Curzon was denied the office of Prime Minister . This was partly because Curzon was a member of the House of Lords , and partly because Lord Davidson - to whom Baldwin was loyal - and Sir Charles Waterhouse falsely claimed to Lord Stamfordham that the resigned Prime Minister Bonar Law had recommended that George V appoint Stanley Baldwin , not Curzon , as his successor . Curzon had been the candidate for Prime Minister preferred by the 4th Marquess of Salisbury , the son of the former Prime Minister , the 3rd Marquess . Winston Churchill , one of Curzon 's main rivals , accurately contended that Curzon sow [ ed ] gratitude and resentment along his path with equally lavish hands . However , even contemporaries who envied Curzon , such as Baldwin , conceded that Curzon was , in the words of his biographer Leonard Mosley , a devoted and indefatigable public servant , dedicated to the idea of Empire . Sir David Gilmour , in his biography Curzon : Imperial Statesman ( 1994 ) , contends that the insuperable extent of Curzon 's efforts for the British Empire was forever unrecompensed by the British polity subsequent to his retirement from the office of Viceroy of India , including after his brilliance as Foreign Secretary at the Conference of Lausanne .",
