  "/wiki/Arthur_Compton": "Arthur Holly Compton ( September 10 , 1892 - March 15 , 1962 ) was an American physicist who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927 for his 1923 discovery of the Compton effect , which demonstrated the particle nature of electromagnetic radiation . It was a sensational discovery at the time : the wave nature of light had been well-demonstrated , but the idea that light had both wave and particle properties was not easily accepted . He is also known for his leadership of the Manhattan Project 's Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago , and served as Chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis from 1945 to 1953 . In 1919 , Compton was awarded one of the first two National Research Council Fellowships that allowed students to study abroad . He chose to go to the University of Cambridge 's Cavendish Laboratory in England , where he studied the scattering and absorption of gamma rays . Further research along these lines led to the discovery of the Compton effect . He used X-rays to investigate ferromagnetism , concluding that it was a result of the alignment of electron spins , and studied cosmic rays , discovering that they were made up principally of positively charged particles . During World War II , Compton was a key figure in the Manhattan Project that developed the first nuclear weapons . His reports were important in launching the project . In 1942 , he became head of the Metallurgical Laboratory , with responsibility for producing nuclear reactors to convert uranium into plutonium , finding ways to separate the plutonium from the uranium and to design an atomic bomb . Compton oversaw Enrico Fermi 's creation of Chicago Pile-1 , the first nuclear reactor , which went critical on December 2 , 1942 . The Metallurgical Laboratory was also responsible for the design and operation of the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge , Tennessee .",

  "/wiki/Compton_effect": "Compton scattering , discovered by Arthur Holly Compton , is the scattering of a photon by a charged particle , usually an electron . It results in a decrease in energy ( increase in wavelength ) of the photon ( which may be an X-ray or gamma ray photon ) , called the Compton effect . Part of the energy of the photon is transferred to the recoiling electron . Inverse Compton scattering occurs when a charged particle transfers part of its energy to a photon .",

  "/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine": "The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded yearly by the Nobel Foundation for outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine . One of five prizes bequested in 1895 by Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel , it is an award for scientific progress through laboratory discoveries in experimental physiology . The Nobel Prize is presented annually on the anniversary of Nobel 's death , 10 December . As of 2019 , 110 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine have been awarded to 207 men and 12 women . The first one was awarded in 1901 to the German physiologist Emil von Behring , for his work on serum therapy and the development of a vaccine against diphtheria . The first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , Gerty Cori , received it in 1947 for her role in elucidating the metabolism of glucose , important in many aspects of medicine , including treatment of diabetes . The prize consists of a medal along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award . The front side of the medal displays the same profile of Alfred Nobel depicted on the medals for Physics , Chemistry , and Literature ; the reverse side is unique to this medal . The most recent Nobel prize was announced by Karolinska Institute on 7 October 2019 , and has been awarded to Americans William Kaelin Jr. , Gregg L. Semenza and British Peter J.

  "/wiki/Vitamin_K": "Vitamin K is a group of structurally similar , fat-soluble vitamins found in foods and in dietary supplements . The human body requires vitamin K for complete synthesis of certain proteins that are needed for blood coagulation ( K from koagulation , Danish for coagulation ) or for controlling binding of calcium in bones and other tissues . The vitamin K-related modification of the proteins allows them to bind calcium ions , which they can not do otherwise . Without vitamin K , blood coagulation is seriously impaired , and uncontrolled bleeding occurs . Preliminary clinical research indicates that deficiency of vitamin K may weaken bones , potentially leading to osteoporosis , and may promote calcification of arteries and other soft tissues . Chemically , the vitamin K family comprises 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone ( 3- ) derivatives . Vitamin K includes two natural vitamers : vitamin K1 and vitamin K2 . Vitamin K2 , in turn , consists of a number of related chemical subtypes , with differing lengths of carbon side chains made of isoprenoid groups of atoms . Vitamin K1 , also known as phylloquinone , is made by plants , and is found in highest amounts in green leafy vegetables because it is directly involved in photosynthesis . It may be thought of as the plant form of vitamin K. It is active as a vitamin in animals and performs the classic functions of vitamin K , including its activity in the production of blood-clotting proteins . Animals may also convert it to vitamin K2 . Bacteria in the gut flora can also convert K1 into vitamin K2 ( menaquinone ) .",

  "/wiki/Nerve_fibre": "An axon ( from Greek \u1f04\u03be\u03c9\u03bd \u00e1x\u014dn , axis ) , or nerve fiber ( or nerve fibre : see spelling differences ) , is a long , slender projection of a nerve cell , or neuron , in vertebrates , that typically conducts electrical impulses known as action potentials away from the nerve cell body . The function of the axon is to transmit information to different neurons , muscles , and glands . In certain sensory neurons ( pseudounipolar neurons ) , such as those for touch and warmth , the axons are called afferent nerve fibers and the electrical impulse travels along these from the periphery to the cell body , and from the cell body to the spinal cord along another branch of the same axon . Axon dysfunction has caused many inherited and acquired neurological disorders which can affect both the peripheral and central neurons . Nerve fibers are classed into three types - group A nerve fibers , group B nerve fibers , and group C nerve fibers . Groups A and B are myelinated , and group C are unmyelinated . These groups include both sensory fibers and motor fibers . Another classification groups only the sensory fibers as Type I , Type II , Type III , and Type IV . An axon is one of two types of cytoplasmic protrusions from the cell body of a neuron ; the other type is a dendrite . Axons are distinguished from dendrites by several features , including shape ( dendrites often taper while axons usually maintain a constant radius ) , length ( dendrites are restricted to a small region around the cell body while axons can be much longer ) , and function ( dendrites receive signals whereas axons transmit them ) . Some types of neurons have no axon and transmit signals from their dendrites . In some species , axons can emanate from dendrites known as axon-carrying dendrites .",

  "/wiki/Glycogen": "Glycogen is a multibranched polysaccharide of glucose that serves as a form of energy storage in animals , fungi , and bacteria . The polysaccharide structure represents the main storage form of glucose in the body . Glycogen functions as one of two forms of energy reserves , glycogen being for short-term and the other form being triglyceride stores in adipose tissue ( i.e. , body fat ) for long-term storage . In humans , glycogen is made and stored primarily in the cells of the liver and skeletal muscle . In the liver , glycogen can make up 5-6% of the organ 's fresh weight , and the liver of an adult weighing 1.5 kg can store roughly 100-120 grams of glycogen . In skeletal muscle , glycogen is found in a low concentration ( 1-2% of the muscle mass ) and the skeletal muscle of an adult weighing 70 kg stores roughly 400 grams of glycogen . The amount of glycogen stored in the body - particularly within the muscles and liver - mostly depends on physical training , basal metabolic rate , and eating habits . Small amounts of glycogen are also found in other tissues and cells , including the kidneys , red blood cells , white blood cells , and glial cells in the brain . The uterus also stores glycogen during pregnancy to nourish the embryo . Approximately 4 grams of glucose are present in the blood of humans at all times ; in fasted individuals , blood glucose is maintained constant at this level at the expense of glycogen stores in the liver and skeletal muscle . Glycogen stores in skeletal muscle serve as a form of energy storage for the muscle itself ; however , the breakdown of muscle glycogen impedes muscle glucose uptake from the blood , thereby increasing the amount of blood glucose available for use in other tissues . Liver glycogen stores serve as a store of glucose for use throughout the body , particularly the central nervous system .",

Cori was born in Prague ( then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire , now the Czech Republic ) . Gerty was not a nickname , but rather she was named after an Austrian warship . Growing up at a time when women were marginalized in science and allowed few educational opportunities , she gained admittance to medical school , where she met her future husband Carl Ferdinand Cori in an anatomy class ; upon their graduation in 1920 , they married . Because of deteriorating conditions in Europe , the couple emigrated to the United States in 1922 . Gerty Cori continued her early interest in medical research , collaborating in the laboratory with Carl . She published research findings coauthored with her husband , as well as publishing singly . Unlike her husband , she had difficulty securing research positions , and the ones she obtained provided meager pay . Her husband insisted on continuing their collaboration , though he was discouraged from doing so by the institutions that employed him . With her husband Carl and Argentine physiologist Bernardo Houssay , Gerty Cori received the Nobel Prize in 1947 for the discovery of the mechanism by which glycogen - a derivative of glucose - is broken down in muscle tissue into lactic acid and then resynthesized in the body and stored as a source of energy ( known as the Cori cycle ) .

RNA and DNA are nucleic acids , and , along with lipids , proteins and carbohydrates , constitute the four major macromolecules essential for all known forms of life . Like DNA , RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides , but unlike DNA , RNA is found in nature as a single strand folded onto itself , rather than a paired double strand . Cellular organisms use messenger RNA ( mRNA ) to convey genetic information ( using the nitrogenous bases of guanine , uracil , adenine , and cytosine , denoted by the letters G , U , A , and C ) that directs synthesis of specific proteins . Many viruses encode their genetic information using an RNA genome . Some RNA molecules play an active role within cells by catalyzing biological reactions , controlling gene expression , or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals . One of these active processes is protein synthesis , a universal function in which RNA molecules direct the synthesis of proteins on ribosomes . This process uses transfer RNA ( tRNA ) molecules to deliver amino acids to the ribosome , where ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) then links amino acids together to form coded proteins .",

DNA and ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) are nucleic acids ; alongside proteins , lipids and complex carbohydrates ( polysaccharides ) , nucleic acids are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life . The two DNA strands are also known as polynucleotides as they are composed of simpler monomeric units called nucleotides . Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases ( cytosine [ C ] , guanine [ G ] , adenine [ A ] or thymine [ T ] ) , a sugar called deoxyribose , and a phosphate group . The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next , resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone . The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together , according to base pairing rules ( A with T and C with G ) , with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA . The complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups , pyrimidines and purines . In DNA , the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine ; the purines are adenine and guanine . Both strands of double-stranded DNA store the same biological information . This information is replicated as and when the two strands separate . A large part of DNA ( more than 98% for humans ) is non-coding , meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences . The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are thus antiparallel .",

He began performing experiments with bacteriophages with Italian-American Salvador Luria , German Max Delbr\u00fcck , Indian-Canadian Adam Hasnain , and Serbian Mila Huhtala in 1940 , and observed that when two different strains of bacteriophage have infected the same bacteria , the two viruses may exchange genetic information . He moved with his research partner Martha Chase to Laurel Hollow , New York , in 1950 to join the Carnegie Institution of Washington 's Department of Genetics , where he and Martha Chase performed the famous Hershey-Chase experiment in 1952 . This experiment provided additional evidence that DNA , not protein , was the genetic material of life . Notable post-doctoral fellows in Hershey 's lab include Anna Marie Skalka .

  "/wiki/Virus": "A virus is a small infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of an organism . Viruses can infect all types of life forms , from animals and plants to microorganisms , including bacteria and archaea . Since Dmitri Ivanovsky 's 1892 article describing a non-bacterial pathogen infecting tobacco plants , and the discovery of the tobacco mosaic virus by Martinus Beijerinck in 1898 , about 5,000 virus species have been described in detail , although there are millions of types . Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most numerous type of biological entity . The study of viruses is known as virology , a sub-speciality of microbiology . While not inside an infected cell or in the process of infecting a cell , viruses exist in the form of independent particles , or virions , consisting of : ( i ) the genetic material , i.e . long molecules of DNA or RNA that encode the structure of the proteins by which the virus acts ; ( ii ) a protein coat , the capsid , which surrounds and protects the genetic material ; and in some cases ( iii ) an outside envelope of lipids . The shapes of these virus particles range from simple helical and icosahedral forms for some species to more complex structures for others . Most virus species have virions too small to be seen with an optical microscope , about one hundredth the size of most bacteria . The origins of viruses in the evolutionary history of life are unclear : some may have evolved from plasmids - pieces of DNA that can move between cells - while others may have evolved from bacteria . In evolution , viruses are an important means of horizontal gene transfer , which increases genetic diversity in a way analogous to sexual reproduction . Viruses are considered by some to be a life form , because they carry genetic material , reproduce , and evolve through natural selection , although they lack key characteristics ( such as cell structure ) that are generally considered necessary to count as life .",

Nucleotides are the building blocks of nucleic acids ; they are composed of three sub unit molecules : a nitrogenous base ( also known as nucleobase ) , a five-carbon sugar ( ribose or deoxyribose ) , and at least one phosphate group . The four nitrogenous bases present in DNA are guanine , adenine , cytosine and thymine ; in RNA uracil is used in place of thymine . Nucleotides also play a central role in metabolism at a fundamental , cellular level .

This formula holds true for monosaccharides . Some exceptions exist ; for example , deoxyribose , a sugar component of DNA , has the empirical formula C5H10O4 . The carbohydrates are technically hydrates of carbon ; structurally it is more accurate to view them as aldoses and ketoses . The term is most common in biochemistry , where it is a synonym of saccharide , a group that includes sugars , starch , and cellulose . The saccharides are divided into four chemical groups : monosaccharides , disaccharides , oligosaccharides , and polysaccharides . Monosaccharides and disaccharides , the smallest ( lower molecular weight ) carbohydrates , are commonly referred to as sugars .

Restriction enzymes are one class of the broader endonuclease group of enzymes . Restriction enzymes are commonly classified into five types , which differ in their structure and whether they cut their DNA substrate at their recognition site , or if the recognition and cleavage sites are separate from one another . To cut DNA , all restriction enzymes make two incisions , once through each sugar-phosphate backbone ( i.e . each strand ) of the DNA double helix . These enzymes are found in bacteria and archaea and provide a defence mechanism against invading viruses . Inside a prokaryote , the restriction enzymes selectively cut up foreign DNA in a process called restriction digestion ; meanwhile , host DNA is protected by a modification enzyme ( a methyltransferase ) that modifies the prokaryotic DNA and blocks cleavage . Together , these two processes form the restriction modification system . Over 3,000 restriction enzymes have been studied in detail , and more than 600 of these are available commercially . These enzymes are routinely used for DNA modification in laboratories , and they are a vital tool in molecular cloning .",

He received his medical degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1956 . Between 1956 and 1957 Smith worked for the Washington University in St. Louis Medical Service . In 1975 , he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship he spent at the University of Zurich . In 1970 , Smith and Kent W. Wilcox discovered the first type II restriction enzyme , that is now called as HindII . Smith went on to discover DNA methylases that constitute the other half of the bacterial host restriction and modification systems , as hypothesized by Werner Arber of Switzerland . He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1978 for discovering type II restriction enzymes with Werner Arber and Daniel Nathans as co-recipients . He later became a leading figure in the nascent field of genomics , when in 1995 he and a team at The Institute for Genomic Research sequenced the first bacterial genome , that of Haemophilus influenzae . H. influenza was the same organism in which Smith had discovered restriction enzymes in the late 1960s .",

  "/wiki/Biochemistry": "Biochemistry , sometimes called biological chemistry , is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms . Biochemical processes give rise to the complexity of life . A sub-discipline of both biology and chemistry , biochemistry can be divided in three fields ; structural biology , enzymology and metabolism . Over the last decades of the 20th century , biochemistry has through these three disciplines become successful at explaining living processes . Almost all areas of the life sciences are being uncovered and developed by biochemical methodology and research . Biochemistry focuses on understanding the chemical basis which allows biological molecules to give rise to the processes that occur within living cells and between cells , which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of tissues , organs , and organism structure and function . Biochemistry is closely related to molecular biology , the study of the molecular mechanisms of biological phenomena . Much of biochemistry deals with the structures , functions and interactions of biological macromolecules , such as proteins , nucleic acids , carbohydrates and lipids , which provide the structure of cells and perform many of the functions associated with life . The chemistry of the cell also depends on the reactions of smaller molecules and ions . These can be inorganic , for example water and metal ions , or organic , for example the amino acids , which are used to synthesize proteins . The mechanisms by which cells harness energy from their environment via chemical reactions are known as metabolism . The findings of biochemistry are applied primarily in medicine , nutrition , and agriculture .",
  "/wiki/Nucleic_acid": "Nucleic acids are the biopolymers , or small biomolecules , essential to all known forms of life . The term nucleic acid is the overall name for DNA and RNA . They are composed of nucleotides , which are the monomers made of three components : a 5-carbon sugar , a phosphate group and a nitrogenous base . If the sugar is a compound ribose , the polymer is RNA ( ribonucleic acid ) ; if the sugar is derived from ribose as deoxyribose , the polymer is DNA ( deoxyribonucleic acid ) . Nucleic acids are the most important of all biomolecules . These are found in abundance in all living things , where they function to create and encode and then store information of every living cell of every life-form organism on Earth . In turn , they function to transmit and express that information inside and outside the cell nucleus - to the interior operations of the cell and ultimately to the next generation of each living organism . The encoded information is contained and conveyed via the nucleic acid sequence , which provides the 'ladder-step ' ordering of nucleotides within the molecules of RNA and DNA . Strings of nucleotides are bonded to form helical backbones - typically , one for RNA , two for DNA - and assembled into chains of base-pairs selected from the five primary , or canonical , nucleobases , which are : adenine , cytosine , guanine , thymine , and uracil . Thymine occurs only in DNA and uracil only in RNA . Using amino acids and the process known as protein synthesis , the specific sequencing in DNA of these nucleobase-pairs enables storing and transmitting coded instructions as genes . In RNA , base-pair sequencing provides for manufacturing new proteins that determine the frames and parts and most chemical processes of all life forms .",
  "/wiki/Recombinant_DNA": "Recombinant DNA ( rDNA ) molecules are DNA molecules formed by laboratory methods of genetic recombination ( such as molecular cloning ) to bring together genetic material from multiple sources , creating sequences that would not otherwise be found in the genome . Recombinant DNA is the general name for a piece of DNA that has been created by combining at least two strands . Recombinant DNA is possible because DNA molecules from all organisms share the same chemical structure , and differ only in the nucleotide sequence within that identical overall structure . Recombinant DNA molecules are sometimes called chimeric DNA , because they can be made of material from two different species , like the mythical chimera . R-DNA technology uses palindromic sequences and leads to the production of sticky and blunt ends . The DNA sequences used in the construction of recombinant DNA molecules can originate from any species . For example , plant DNA may be joined to bacterial DNA , or human DNA may be joined with fungal DNA . In addition , DNA sequences that do not occur anywhere in nature may be created by the chemical synthesis of DNA , and incorporated into recombinant molecules . Using recombinant DNA technology and synthetic DNA , literally any DNA sequence may be created and introduced into any of a very wide range of living organisms . Proteins that can result from the expression of recombinant DNA within living cells are termed recombinant proteins . When recombinant DNA encoding a protein is introduced into a host organism , the recombinant protein is not necessarily produced . Expression of foreign proteins requires the use of specialized expression vectors and often necessitates significant restructuring by foreign coding sequences .",

  "/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex": "The major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) is a set of genes that code for cell surface proteins essential for the acquired immune system to recognize foreign molecules in vertebrates , which in turn determines histocompatibility . The main function of MHC molecules is to bind to antigens derived from pathogens and display them on the cell surface for recognition by the appropriate T-cells . MHC molecules mediate interactions of leukocytes , also called white blood cells ( WBCs ) , which are immune cells , with other leukocytes or with body cells . The MHC determines compatibility of donors for organ transplant , as well as one 's susceptibility to an autoimmune disease via crossreacting immunization . The human MHC is also called the HLA ( human leukocyte antigen ) complex ( often just the HLA ) . The MHC in mice is called the Histocompatibility system 2 or just the H-2 . In a cell , protein molecules of the host 's own phenotype or of other biologic entities are continually synthesized and degraded . Each MHC molecule on the cell surface displays a molecular fraction of a protein , called an epitope . The presented antigen can be either self or non-self , thus preventing an organism 's immune system targeting its own cells . In its entirety , the MHC population is like a meter indicating the balance of proteins within the cell . The MHC gene family is divided into three subgroups : MHC class I , MHC class II , and MHC class III . Class I MHC molecules have \u03b22 microglobulin subunit which can only be recognised by CD8 co-receptors .",
  "/wiki/Immune_system": "The immune system is a host defense system comprising many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease . To function properly , an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents , known as pathogens , from viruses to parasitic worms , and distinguish them from the organism 's own healthy tissue . In many species , there are two major subsystems of the immune system : the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system . Both subsystems use humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity to perform their functions . In humans , the blood-brain barrier , blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier , and similar fluid-brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system , which protects the brain . Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt , and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system ; however , multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens . Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections . Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants , such as plants and invertebrates . These mechanisms include phagocytosis , antimicrobial peptides called defensins , and the complement system . Jawed vertebrates , including humans , have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms , including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently . Adaptive ( or acquired ) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen , leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen . This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination .",

  "/wiki/Growth_factor": "A growth factor is a naturally occurring substance capable of stimulating cellular growth , proliferation , healing , and cellular differentiation . Usually it is a protein or a steroid hormone . Growth factors are important for regulating a variety of cellular processes . Growth factors typically act as signaling molecules between cells . Examples are cytokines and hormones that bind to specific receptors on the surface of their target cells . They often promote cell differentiation and maturation , which varies between growth factors . For example , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) enhances osteogenic differentiation , while fibroblast growth factors and vascular endothelial growth factors stimulate blood vessel differentiation ( angiogenesis ) .",

  "/wiki/Protein": "Proteins are large biomolecules , or macromolecules , consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues . Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms , including catalysing metabolic reactions , DNA replication , responding to stimuli , providing structure to cells , and organisms , and transporting molecules from one location to another . Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids , which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes , and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity . A linear chain of amino acid residues is called a polypeptide . A protein contains at least one long polypeptide . Short polypeptides , containing less than 20-30 residues , are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides , or sometimes oligopeptides . The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues . The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein is defined by the sequence of a gene , which is encoded in the genetic code . In general , the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids ; however , in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and - in certain archaea - pyrrolysine . Shortly after or even during synthesis , the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification , which alters the physical and chemical properties , folding , stability , activity , and ultimately , the function of the proteins . Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached , which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors . Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function , and they often associate to form stable protein complexes .",
  "/wiki/Phosphorylation": "In chemistry , phosphorylation of a molecule is the attachment of a phosphoryl group . Together with its counterpart , dephosphorylation , it is critical for many cellular processes in biology . Phosphorylation is especially important for protein function ; for example , this modification activates ( or deactivates ) almost half of the enzymes present in yeast , thereby regulating their function . Many proteins ( between 1/3 to 2/3 of the proteome in eukaryotes ) are phosphorylated temporarily , as are many sugars , lipids , and other biologically-relevant molecules .",

  "/wiki/Economic_history": "Economic history is the academic study of economies or economic events of the past . Research is conducted using a combination of historical methods , statistical methods and the application of economic theory to historical situations and institutions . The field can encompass a wide variety of topics , including equality , finance , technology , labor , and business . It emphasizes historicizing the economy itself , analyzing it as a dynamic force and attempting to provide insights into the way it is structured and conceived . Often economic history overlaps with global history in its emphasis on cross-border flows and international trends in the international economy . Using both quantitative data and qualitative sources , economic historians emphasize understanding the historical context in which major economic events take place . They often focus on the institutional dynamics of systems of production , labor , and capital , as well as the economy 's impact on society , culture , and language . Scholars of the discipline also study the various schools of economic thought such as mainstream economics , Marxian economics , the Chicago school of economics , and Keynesian economics . Sub-disciplines of the field include financial and business history , which overlaps with areas of social history such as demographic and labor history . The quantitative branch - in this case , econometric - study of economic history is also known as cliometrics . Historians have recently become more interested in another branch of economic history , often called the history of capitalism ."
