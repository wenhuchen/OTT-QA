  "/wiki/Listed_building": "A listed building , or listed structure , is one that has been placed on one of the four statutory lists maintained by Historic England in England , Historic Environment Scotland in Scotland , Cadw in Wales , and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency in Northern Ireland . The term has also been used in Ireland , where buildings are surveyed for the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage in accordance with the country 's obligations under the Granada Convention . However , the preferred term in Ireland is protected structure . A listed building may not be demolished , extended , or altered without special permission from the local planning authority , which typically consults the relevant central government agency , particularly for significant alterations to the more notable listed buildings . In England and Wales , a national amenity society must be notified of any work to a listed building which involves any element of demolition . Exemption from secular listed building control is provided for some buildings in current use for worship , but only in cases where the relevant religious organisation operates its own equivalent permissions procedure . Owners of listed buildings are , in some circumstances , compelled to repair and maintain them and can face criminal prosecution if they fail to do so or if they perform unauthorised alterations . When alterations are permitted , or when listed buildings are repaired or maintained , the owners are often required to use specific materials or techniques . Although most sites appearing on the lists are buildings , other structures such as bridges , monuments , sculptures , war memorials , and even milestones and mileposts and The Beatles ' Abbey Road pedestrian crossing are also listed . Ancient , military , and uninhabited structures , such as Stonehenge , are sometimes instead classified as scheduled monuments and protected by much older legislation , whilst cultural landscapes such as parks and gardens are currently listed on a non-statutory basis .",

  "/wiki/Monmouth_Rebellion": "The Monmouth Rebellion , also known as the Pitchfork Rebellion , the Revolt of the West or the West Country rebellion , was an attempt to overthrow James II . Prince James , Duke of York , had become King of England , Scotland , and Ireland upon the death of his elder brother Charles II on 6 February 1685 . James II was a Roman Catholic and some Protestants under his rule opposed his kingship . James Scott , 1st Duke of Monmouth , the eldest illegitimate son of Charles II , claimed to be rightful heir to the throne and attempted to displace James II . Plans were discussed to overthrow the monarch , following the failure of the Rye House Plot to assassinate Charles II and James in 1683 , while Monmouth was in self-imposed exile in the Dutch Republic . The Monmouth rebellion was coordinated with Argyll 's Rising , a rebellion in Scotland , where Archibald Campbell , the Earl of Argyll , landed with a small force . The Duke of Monmouth had been popular in the South West of England , so he planned to recruit troops locally and take control of the area before marching on London . Monmouth landed at Lyme Regis on 11 June 1685 . In the following few weeks , his growing army of nonconformists , artisans and farm workers fought a series of skirmishes with local militias and regular soldiers commanded by Louis de Duras , 2nd Earl of Feversham and John Churchill , who later became the Duke of Marlborough . Monmouth 's forces were unable to compete with the regular army and failed to capture the city of Bristol . The rebellion ended with the defeat of Monmouth 's army at the Battle of Sedgemoor on 6 July 1685 by forces led by Feversham and Churchill . Monmouth was executed for treason on 15 July 1685 .",

  "/wiki/Church_bell": "A church bell in the Christian tradition is a bell which is rung in a church for a variety of ceremonial purposes , and can be heard outside the building . Traditionally they are used to call worshippers to the church for a communal service , and to announce times of daily prayer , called the canonical hours . They are also rung on special occasions such as a wedding , or a funeral service . In some religious traditions they are used within the liturgy of the church service to signify to people that a particular part of the service has been reached . The ringing of church bells , in the Christian tradition , is also believed to drive out demons . The traditional European church bell ( see cutaway drawing ) used in Christian churches worldwide consists of a cup-shaped metal resonator with a pivoted clapper hanging inside which strikes the sides when the bell is swung . It is hung within a steeple or belltower of a church or religious building , so the sound can reach a wide area . Such bells are either fixed in position ( hung dead ) or hung from a pivoted beam ( the headstock ) so they can swing to and fro . A rope hangs from a lever or wheel attached to the headstock , and when the bell ringer pulls on the rope the bell swings back and forth and the clapper hits the inside , sounding the bell . Bells that are hung dead are normally sounded by hitting the sound bow with a hammer or occasionally by a rope which pulls the internal clapper against the bell . A church may have a single bell , or a collection of bells which are tuned to a common scale . They may be stationary and chimed , rung randomly by swinging through a small arc , or swung through a full circle to enable the high degree of control of English change ringing .",

  "/wiki/Buttresses": "A buttress is an architectural structure built against or projecting from a wall which serves to support or reinforce the wall . Buttresses are fairly common on more ancient buildings , as a means of providing support to act against the lateral ( sideways ) forces arising out of the roof structures that lack adequate bracing . The term counterfort can be synonymous with buttress , and is often used when referring to dams , retaining walls and other structures holding back earth . Early examples of buttresses are found on the Eanna Temple ( ancient Uruk ) , dating to as early as the 4th millennium BCE . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/Turret": "In architecture , a turret ( from Italian : torretta , little tower ; Latin : turris , tower ) is a small tower that projects vertically from the wall of a building such as a medieval castle . Turrets were used to provide a projecting defensive position allowing covering fire to the adjacent wall in the days of military fortification . As their military use faded , turrets were used for decorative purposes , as in the Scottish baronial style . A turret can have a circular top with crenelations as seen in the picture at right , a pointed roof , or other kind of apex . It might contain a staircase if it projects higher than the building ; however , a turret is not necessarily higher than the rest of the building ; in this case , it is typically part of a room , that can be simply walked into - see the turret of Chateau de Chaumont on the collection of turrets , which also illustrates a turret on a modern skyscraper . A building may have both towers and turrets ; turrets might be smaller or higher but turrets instead project from the edge of a building rather than continue to the ground . The size of a turret is therefore limited , since it puts additional stresses on the structure of the building . Turrets were traditionally supported by a corbel . In modern times , a gun turret is a weapon mount that houses the crew or mechanism of a projectile-firing weapon , allowing the weapon to be aimed and fired in some degree of azimuth and elevation . It can be found on warships , combat vehicles , military aircraft , and land fortifications , and usually offers some degree of armour or protection .",
