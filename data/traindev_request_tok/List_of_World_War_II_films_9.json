  "/wiki/Raid_at_Cabanatuan": "The Raid at Cabanatuan ( Filipino : Pagsalakay sa Cabanatuan ) , also known as The Great Raid ( Filipino : Ang Dakilang Pagsalakay ) , was a rescue of Allied prisoners of war ( POWs ) and civilians from a Japanese camp near Cabanatuan City , Philippines . On January 30 , 1945 , during World War II , United States Army Rangers , Alamo Scouts and Filipino guerrillas liberated more than 500 from the POW camp . After the surrender of tens of thousands of American troops during the Battle of Bataan , many were sent to the Cabanatuan prison camp after the Bataan Death March . The Japanese shifted most of the prisoners to other areas , leaving just over 500 American and other Allied POWs and civilians in the prison . Facing brutal conditions including disease , torture , and malnourishment , the prisoners feared they would be executed by their captors before the arrival of General Douglas MacArthur and his American forces returning to Luzon . In late January 1945 , a plan was developed by Sixth Army leaders and Filipino guerrillas to send a small force to rescue the prisoners . A group of over 100 Rangers and Scouts and 200 guerrillas traveled 30 miles ( 48 km ) behind Japanese lines to reach the camp . In a nighttime raid , under the cover of darkness and with distraction by a P-61 Black Widow night fighter , the group surprised the Japanese forces in and around the camp . Hundreds of Japanese troops were killed in the 30-minute coordinated attack ; the Americans suffered minimal casualties . The Rangers , Scouts , and guerrillas escorted the POWs back to American lines . The rescue allowed the prisoners to tell of the death march and prison camp atrocities , which sparked a rush of resolve for the war against Japan . The rescuers were awarded commendations by MacArthur , and were also recognized by President Franklin D. Roosevelt .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Bataan": "The Battle of Bataan ( Filipino : Labanan sa Bataan ) ( 7 January - 9 April 1942 ) was a battle fought by the United States and the Philippine Commonwealth against Japan during World War II . The battle represented the most intense phase of the Japanese invasion of the Philippines during World War II . In January 1942 , forces of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy invaded Luzon along with several islands in the Philippine Archipelago after the bombing of the American naval base at Pearl Harbor . The commander-in-chief of all U.S. and Filipino forces in the islands , General Douglas MacArthur , consolidated all of his Luzon-based units on the Bataan Peninsula to fight against the Japanese army . By this time , the Japanese controlled nearly all of Southeast Asia . The Bataan Peninsula and the island of Corregidor were the only remaining Allied strongholds in the region . Despite a lack of supplies , American and Filipino forces managed to fight the Japanese for three months , engaging them initially in a fighting retreat southward . As the combined American and Filipino forces made a last stand , the delay cost the Japanese valuable time and prevented immediate victory across the Pacific . The American surrender at Bataan to the Japanese , with 76,000 soldiers surrendering in the Philippines altogether , was the largest in American and Filipino military histories , and was the largest United States surrender since the American Civil War 's Battle of Harper 's Ferry . Soon afterwards , U.S. and Filipino prisoners of war were forced into the Bataan Death March .",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Singapore": "The Battle of Singapore , also known as the Fall of Singapore , was fought in the South-East Asian theatre of World War II when the Empire of Japan invaded the British stronghold of Singapore - nicknamed the Gibraltar of the East . Singapore was the major British military base in South-East Asia and was the key to British imperial interwar defence planning for South-East Asia and the South-West Pacific . The fighting in Singapore lasted from 8 to 15 February 1942 , after the two months during which Japanese forces had advanced down the Malayan Peninsula . The campaign , including the final battle , was a decisive Japanese victory , resulting in the Japanese capture of Singapore and the largest British surrender in modern history . About 80,000 British , Indian and Australian troops in Singapore became prisoners of war , joining 50,000 taken by the Japanese in the earlier Malayan Campaign . The British prime minister , Winston Churchill , called it the worst disaster in British military history .",
  "/wiki/Guadalcanal_Campaign": "The Guadalcanal campaign , also known as the Battle of Guadalcanal and codenamed Operation Watchtower by American forces , was a military campaign fought between 7 August 1942 and 9 February 1943 on and around the island of Guadalcanal in the Pacific theater of World War II . It was the first major land offensive by Allied forces against the Empire of Japan . On 7 August 1942 , Allied forces , predominantly United States Marines , landed on Guadalcanal , Tulagi , and Florida in the southern Solomon Islands , with the objective of using Guadalcanal and Tulagi as bases in supporting a campaign to eventually capture or neutralize the major Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain . The Japanese defenders , who had occupied those islands since May 1942 , were outnumbered and overwhelmed by the Allies , who captured Tulagi and Florida , as well as the airfield - later named Henderson Field - that was under construction on Guadalcanal . Surprised by the Allied offensive , the Japanese made several attempts between August and November to retake Henderson Field . Three major land battles , seven large naval battles ( five nighttime surface actions and two carrier battles ) , and almost daily aerial battles culminated in the decisive Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in early November , with the defeat of the last Japanese attempt to bombard Henderson Field from the sea and to land enough troops to retake it . In December , the Japanese abandoned their efforts to retake Guadalcanal , and evacuated their remaining forces by 7 February 1943 , in the face of an offensive by the U.S. Army 's XIV Corps . The Guadalcanal campaign was a significant strategic Allied combined-arms victory in the Pacific theater . While the Battle of Midway was a heavy defeat of the Imperial Japanese Navy , it did not stop Japanese offensives , which continued both at sea and on the ground . The victories at Milne Bay , Buna-Gona , and Guadalcanal marked the Allied transition from defensive operations to taking the strategic initiative in the theater , leading to offensive campaigns in the Solomon Islands , New Guinea , and the Central Pacific , which resulted in the surrender of Japan , ending World War II .",

The battles on the Eastern Front of the Second World War constituted the largest military confrontation in history . They were characterised by unprecedented ferocity , wholesale destruction , mass deportations , and immense loss of life due to combat , starvation , exposure , disease , and massacres . The Eastern Front , as the site of nearly all extermination camps , death marches , ghettos , and the majority of pogroms , was central to the Holocaust . Of the estimated 70-85 million deaths attributed to World War II , around 30 million occurred on the Eastern Front . The Eastern Front was decisive in determining the outcome in the European theatre of operations in World War II , eventually serving as the main reason for the defeat of Nazi Germany and the Axis nations . The two principal belligerent powers were Germany and the Soviet Union , along with their respective allies . Though never engaged in military action in the Eastern Front , the United States and the United Kingdom both provided substantial material aid in the form of the Lend-Lease to the Soviet Union .

  "/wiki/Atomic_bomb": "A nuclear weapon ( also called an atom bomb , nuke , atomic bomb , nuclear warhead , A-bomb , or nuclear bomb ) is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions , either fission ( fission bomb ) or from a combination of fission and fusion reactions ( thermonuclear bomb ) . Both bomb types release large quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter . The first test of a fission ( atomic ) bomb released an amount of energy approximately equal to 20,000 tons of TNT ( 84 TJ ) . The first thermonuclear ( hydrogen ) bomb test released energy approximately equal to 10 million tons of TNT ( 42 PJ ) . A thermonuclear weapon weighing little more than 2,400 pounds ( 1,100 kg ) can release energy equal to more than 1.2 million tons of TNT ( 5.0 PJ ) . A nuclear device no larger than traditional bombs can devastate an entire city by blast , fire , and radiation . Since they are weapons of mass destruction , the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a focus of international relations policy . Nuclear weapons have been used twice in war , both times by the United States against Japan near the end of World War II . On August 6 , 1945 , the U.S. Army Air Forces detonated a uranium gun-type fission bomb nicknamed Little Boy over the Japanese city of Hiroshima ; three days later , on August 9 , the U.S. Army Air Forces detonated a plutonium implosion-type fission bomb nicknamed Fat Man over the Japanese city of Nagasaki . These bombings caused injuries that resulted in the deaths of approximately 200,000 civilians and military personnel .

About 3,800 kamikaze pilots died during the war , and more than 7,000 naval personnel were killed by kamikaze attacks . Kamikaze aircraft were essentially pilot-guided explosive missiles , purpose-built or converted from conventional aircraft . Pilots would attempt to crash their aircraft into enemy ships in what was called a body attack ( tai-atari ) in planes loaded with a combination of explosives , bombs , and torpedoes . Accuracy was much higher than that of conventional attacks , and the payload and explosion larger ; about 19% of kamikaze attacks were successful . A kamikaze could sustain damage that would disable a conventional attacker and still achieve its objective . The goal of crippling or destroying large numbers of Allied ships , particularly aircraft carriers , was considered by the Empire of Japan to be a just reason for sacrificing pilots and aircraft . These attacks , which began in October 1944 , followed several critical military defeats for the Japanese . They had long since lost aerial parity as a result of having outdated aircraft and enduring the loss of experienced pilots . Japan suffered from a diminishing capacity for war and a rapidly declining industrial capacity relative to that of the Allies . Japan was also losing pilots faster than it could train their replacements . These combined factors , along with Japan 's unwillingness to surrender , led to the use of kamikaze tactics as Allied forces advanced towards the Japanese home islands .",

Their P-40B aircraft , marked with Chinese colors , flew under American control . Their mission was to bomb Japan and defend China but many delays meant the AVG flew in combat after the US and Japan declared war . The group consisted of three fighter squadrons of around 30 aircraft each that trained in Burma before the American entry into World War II to defend China against Japanese forces . The AVG were officially members of the Chinese Air Force . The group had contracts with salaries ranging from $ 250 a month for a mechanic to $ 750 for a squadron commander , roughly three times what they had been making in the U.S. forces . While it accepted some civilian volunteers for its headquarters and ground crew , the AVG recruited most of its staff from the U.S. military . The group first saw combat on 20 December 1941 , 12 days after Pearl Harbor ( local time ) . It demonstrated innovative tactical victories when the news in the U.S. was filled with little more than stories of defeat at the hands of the Japanese forces and achieved such notable success during the lowest period of the war for both the U.S. and the Allied Forces as to give hope to America that it might eventually defeat Japan . AVG pilots earned official credit and received combat bonuses for destroying 296 enemy aircraft , while losing only 14 pilots in combat . The combat records of the AVG still exist and researchers have found them credible . On 4 July 1942 the AVG was disbanded and replaced by the 23rd Fighter Group of the United States Army Air Forces , which was later absorbed into the U.S. Fourteenth Air Force with General Chennault as commander .",

  "/wiki/Danish_resistance_movement": "The Danish resistance movements ( Danish : Danske Modstandsbev\u00e6gelse ) were an underground insurgency to resist the German occupation of Denmark during World War II . Due to the initially lenient arrangements , in which the Nazi occupation authority allowed the democratic government to stay in power , the resistance movement was slower to develop effective tactics on a wide scale than in some other countries . Members of the Danish resistance movement were involved in underground activities , ranging from producing illegal publications to spying and sabotage . Major groups included the communist BOPA ( Danish : Borgerlige Partisaner , Civil Partisans ) and Holger Danske , both based in Copenhagen . Some small resistance groups such as the Samsing Group and the Churchill Club also contributed to the sabotage effort . Resistance agents killed an estimated 400 Danish Nazis , informers and collaborators until 1944 . After that date , they also killed some German nationals . In the postwar period , the Resistance was supported by politicians within Denmark and there was little effort to closely examine the killings . Studies were made in the late 20th and early 21st centuries , and people learned that there was sometimes improvised and contingent decision making about the targets , with some morally ambiguous choices . Several important books and films have been produced on this topic .",

  "/wiki/Home_front_during_World_War_II": "The 'home front ' covers the activities of the civilians in a nation at war . World War II was a total war ; homeland production became even more invaluable to both the Allied and Axis powers . Life on the home front during World War II was a significant part of the war effort for all participants and had a major impact on the outcome of the war . Governments became involved with new issues such as rationing , manpower allocation , home defense , evacuation in the face of air raids , and response to occupation by an enemy power . The morale and psychology of the people responded to leadership and propaganda . Typically women were mobilized to an unprecedented degree . All of the powers involved had learned from their experiences on the home front during World War I . Their success in mobilizing economic output was a major factor in supporting combat operations . Among morale-boosting activities that also benefited combat efforts , the home front engaged in a variety of scrap drives for materials crucial to the war effort such as metal , rubber , and rags .",
  "/wiki/V-2": "The V-2 ( German : Vergeltungswaffe 2 , Retribution Weapon 2 ) , technical name Aggregat 4 ( A4 ) , was the world 's first long-range guided ballistic missile . The missile , powered by a liquid-propellant rocket engine , was developed during the Second World War in Germany as a vengeance weapon , assigned to attack Allied cities as retaliation for the Allied bombings against German cities . The V-2 rocket also became the first artificial object to travel into space by crossing the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line with the vertical launch of MW 18014 on 20 June 1944 . Research into military use of long-range rockets began when the studies of graduate student Wernher von Braun attracted the attention of the German Army . A series of prototypes culminated in the A-4 , which went to war as the V-2 . Beginning in September 1944 , over 3,000 V-2s were launched by the German Wehrmacht against Allied targets , first London and later Antwerp and Li\u00e8ge . According to a 2011 BBC documentary , the attacks from V-2s resulted in the deaths of an estimated 9,000 civilians and military personnel , and a further 12,000 forced laborers and concentration camp prisoners died as a result of their forced participation in the production of the weapons . As Germany collapsed , teams from the Allied forces - the United States , the United Kingdom , and the Soviet Union - raced to capture key German manufacturing sites and technology . Wernher von Braun and over 100 key V-2 personnel surrendered to the Americans and many of the original V-2 team ended up working at the Redstone Arsenal . The US also captured enough V-2 hardware to build approximately 80 of the missiles . The Soviets gained possession of the V-2 manufacturing facilities after the war , re-established V-2 production , and moved it to the Soviet Union .",

The word anime is the Japanese term for animation , which means all forms of animated media . Outside Japan , anime refers specifically to animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics , vibrant characters and fantastical themes . The culturally abstract approach to the word 's meaning may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan . Many Westerners strictly view anime as a Japanese animation product . Some scholars suggest defining anime as specifically or quintessentially Japanese may be related to a new form of Orientalism . The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917 , and Japanese anime production has since continued to increase steadily . The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century , developing a large domestic and international audience . Anime is distributed theatrically , by way of television broadcasts , directly to home media , and over the Internet . It is classified into numerous genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences . Anime is a diverse art form with distinctive production methods and techniques that have been adapted over time in response to emergent technologies . It combines graphic art , characterization , cinematography , and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques ."
