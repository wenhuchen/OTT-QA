  "/wiki/Abney_Park_Chapel": "Abney Park Chapel , is a Grade II Listed chapel , designed by William Hosking and built by John Jay that is situated in Europe 's first wholly nondenominational cemetery , Abney Park Cemetery , London . Opened in May , 1840 , it was the first nondenominational cemetery chapel in Europe ( and probably the world - since the chapel at Mount Auburn was a later addition ) . It helped pioneer the early use of the Dissenting Gothic building style , and encouraged renewed interest in the careful blending of earlier styles . It was primarily the work of a small design team consisting of George Collison II ( acting as client for the cemetery founders , with a passion for Mount Auburn Cemetery near Boston , and it is said , Beverley Minster which dominated the skyline in his ancestral town ) ; William Hosking ( architect and civil engineer with an interest in Egyptology , antiquities , and architectural writing and scholarship ) ; the builder John Jay , and George Loddiges ( botanical scientist and horticulturalist primarily concerned with the setting of Abney Park Chapel , including its nearby rosarium and a collection of American plants on the Chapel Lawn ) .",
  "/wiki/Stoke_Newington": "Stoke Newington is an area occupying the north-west part of the London Borough of Hackney in north-east London , England . It is 5 miles ( 8 km ) north-east of Charing Cross . Stoke Newington Church Street was the site of the original hamlet of Stoke Newington , which in turn gave its name to Stoke Newington the ancient parish . The historic core on Church Street retains the distinct London village character which led Nikolaus Pevsner to write in 1953 that he found it hard to see the district as being in London at all . Stoke Newington is nicknamed Stokey by many residents .",
  "/wiki/Upper_Clapton": "Upper Clapton is a district in the London Borough of Hackney , forming part of Clapton in northeast London , England . Upper Clapton approximates to the northern part of the E5 ( Clapton ) postal district . The district borders the River Lea ( spelled Lea or Lee ) to the east and the border with Lower Clapton to the south is marked by the Lea Bridge and Kenninghall Roads . Neither Upper Clapton nor the wider Clapton area have ever been an administrative unit and consequently their extent has never been formally determined . Describing Upper Clapton as northern E5 is useful but also informal and imperfect , for instance a small area of Clapton Common and the immediately adjacent community is excluded from the postal district despite almost always being publicly viewed as being part of Upper Clapton . As is frequently the case with London districts , these boundaries are often uncertain and overlapping because of the meeting of the developing expansion of the original settlements . Western parts of the area are often considered part of a wider Stamford Hill , understandable perhaps because of the public transport junction and shopping area at Stamford Broadway , and that the Hasidic Jewish community identified as being located in Stamford Hill extends into Upper Clapton .",

It is Georgia 's dominant religious institution , and a majority of Georgian people are members . The Orthodox Church of Georgia is one of the oldest churches in the world . It asserts apostolic foundation , and its historical roots must be traced to the early and late Christianization of Iberia and Colchis by Saint Andrew in the 1st century AD and by Saint Nino in the 4th century AD , respectively . As in similar autocephalous Orthodox churches , the Church 's highest governing body is the Holy Synod of bishops . The church is headed by the Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia , currently Ilia II , who was elected in 1977 . Orthodox Christianity was the state religion throughout most of Georgia 's history until 1921 , when it was conquered by the Russian Red Army during the Russian-Georgian War and became part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( U.S.S.R. ) . The current Constitution of Georgia recognizes the special role of the Georgian Orthodox Church in the country 's history , but also stipulates the independence of the church from the state . Government relations are further defined and regulated by the Concordat of 2002 . The church is the most trusted institution in Georgia . According to a 2013 survey 95% respondents had a favorable opinion of its work .",

  "/wiki/Hackney_Central": "Hackney Central is a sub-district of Hackney in the London Borough of Hackney in London , England and is four miles ( 6.4 km ) northeast of Charing Cross . The Hackney Central area is focused on Mare Street and the retail areas to the north of it including Narrow Way and surrounding local area around Hackney Downs railway station . As such it extends north from Regent 's Canal ( with Bethnal Green ) , takes in most of Broadway Market and London Fields , and follows each side of Mare Street till it terminates in the vicinity of Hackney Central railway station . The area also includes the central retail area which extends from Hackney Downs station in the west to the Hackney Walk Outlet Village , on Morning Lane and goes in between Wick Road ( Homerton ) and Cassland Road ( South Hackney ) till meeting Hackney Wick , to the east . Hackney Central is the area that once would have been known as Hackney Village . This was a place that flourished from the Tudor period , when principal members of the Court had their houses in the surrounding area , and King Henry VIII of England had a palace ( located near the modern Lea Bridge Road roundabout ) . Hackney Central remained a popular resort for Londoners until the end of the Georgian era , when this suburb of London began to be completely built up . Railways , trams and factories brought an end to Hackney 's rural atmosphere during the Victorian era , and its fortunes declined . The industries of nearby Homerton and the Lee Valley have largely disappeared , leaving the NHS and local council as the largest employers . Successive waves of immigrants , both from abroad and within the United Kingdom , make modern Hackney a culturally vibrant part of inner London , with both the benefits and challenges that this brings . Extensive post-World War II redevelopment replaced much of the housing stock , but the Georgian housing and Victorian terraces that remain have become popular again .",

Greek Orthodox Christianity has also traditionally placed heavy emphasis and awarded high prestige to traditions of Eastern Orthodox monasticism and asceticism , with origins in Early Christianity in the Near East and in Byzantine Anatolia . Historically , the term Greek Orthodox has also been used to describe all Eastern Orthodox Churches in general , since Greek in Greek Orthodox can refer to the heritage of the Byzantine Empire . During the first eight centuries of Christian history , most major intellectual , cultural , and social developments in the Christian Church took place within the Empire or in the sphere of its influence , where the Greek language was widely spoken and used for most theological writings . Over time , most parts of the liturgy , traditions , and practices of the church of Constantinople were adopted by all , and still provide the basic patterns of contemporary Orthodoxy . Thus , the Eastern Church came to be called Greek Orthodox in the same way that the Western Church is called Roman Catholic . However , the appellation Greek was abandoned by the Slavic and other Eastern Orthodox churches in connection with their peoples ' national awakenings , from as early as the 10th century A.D . Thus , today it is generally only those churches that are most closely tied to Greek or Byzantine culture that are called Greek Orthodox .",
