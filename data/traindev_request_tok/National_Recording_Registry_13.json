The Marshall Plan aid was divided amongst the participant states roughly on a per capita basis . A larger amount was given to the major industrial powers , as the prevailing opinion was that their resuscitation was essential for general European revival . Somewhat more aid per capita was also directed towards the Allied nations , with less for those that had been part of the Axis or remained neutral . The largest recipient of Marshall Plan money was the United Kingdom ( receiving about 26% of the total ) , followed by France ( 18% ) and West Germany ( 11% ) . Some eighteen European countries received Plan benefits . Although offered participation , the Soviet Union refused Plan benefits , and also blocked benefits to Eastern Bloc countries , such as Hungary and Poland .
