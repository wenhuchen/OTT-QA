  "/wiki/Botanist": "Botany , also called plant science ( s ) , plant biology or phytology , is the science of plant life and a branch of biology . A botanist , plant scientist or phytologist is a scientist who specialises in this field . The term botany comes from the Ancient Greek word \u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7 ( botan\u0113 ) meaning pasture , grass , or fodder ; \u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7 is in turn derived from \u03b2\u03cc\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ( boskein ) , to feed or to graze . Traditionally , botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively , with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress . Nowadays , botanists ( in the strict sense ) study approximately 410,000 species of land plants of which some 391,000 species are vascular plants ( including approximately 369,000 species of flowering plants ) , and approximately 20,000 are bryophytes . Botany originated in prehistory as herbalism with the efforts of early humans to identify - and later cultivate - edible , medicinal and poisonous plants , making it one of the oldest branches of science . Medieval physic gardens , often attached to monasteries , contained plants of medical importance . They were forerunners of the first botanical gardens attached to universities , founded from the 1540s onwards . One of the earliest was the Padua botanical garden . These gardens facilitated the academic study of plants . Efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of plant taxonomy , and led in 1753 to the binomial system of Carl Linnaeus that remains in use to this day . In the 19th and 20th centuries , new techniques were developed for the study of plants , including methods of optical microscopy and live cell imaging , electron microscopy , analysis of chromosome number , plant chemistry and the structure and function of enzymes and other proteins .",

  "/wiki/Astronomer": "An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who focuses their studies on a specific question or field outside the scope of Earth . They observe astronomical objects such as stars , planets , moons , comets and galaxies - in either observational ( by analyzing the data ) or theoretical astronomy . Examples of topics or fields astronomers study include planetary science , solar astronomy , the origin or evolution of stars , or the formation of galaxies . Related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology , which studies the Universe as a whole . Astronomers usually fall under either of two main types : observational and theoretical . Observational astronomers make direct observations of celestial objects and analyze the data . In contrast , theoretical astronomers create and investigate models of things that can not be observed . Because it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle , astronomers must observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form , evolve , and die . They use these data to create models or simulations to theorize how different celestial objects work . Further subcategories under these two main branches of astronomy include planetary astronomy , galactic astronomy , or physical cosmology .",

  "/wiki/Berry_phase": "In classical and quantum mechanics , the geometric phase is a phase difference acquired over the course of a cycle , when a system is subjected to cyclic adiabatic processes , which results from the geometrical properties of the parameter space of the Hamiltonian . The phenomenon was independently discovered by S. Pancharatnam ( 1956 ) and by H. C. Longuet-Higgins ( 1958 ) and later generalized by Sir M. Berry ( 1984 ) . It is also known as the Pancharatnam-Berry phase , Pancharatnam phase , or Berry phase . It can be seen in the Aharonov-Bohm effect and in the conical intersection of potential energy surfaces . In the case of the Aharonov-Bohm effect , the adiabatic parameter is the magnetic field enclosed by two interference paths , and it is cyclic in the sense that these two paths form a loop . In the case of the conical intersection , the adiabatic parameters are the molecular coordinates . Apart from quantum mechanics , it arises in a variety of other wave systems , such as classical optics . As a rule of thumb , it can occur whenever there are at least two parameters characterizing a wave in the vicinity of some sort of singularity or hole in the topology ; two parameters are required because either the set of nonsingular states will not be simply connected , or there will be nonzero holonomy . Waves are characterized by amplitude and phase , and may vary as a function of those parameters . The geometric phase occurs when both parameters are changed simultaneously but very slowly ( adiabatically ) , and eventually brought back to the initial configuration . In quantum mechanics , this could involve rotations but also translations of particles , which are apparently undone at the end . One might expect that the waves in the system return to the initial state , as characterized by the amplitudes and phases ( and accounting for the passage of time ) .",

  "/wiki/Representation_theory": "Representation theory is a branch of mathematics that studies abstract algebraic structures by representing their elements as linear transformations of vector spaces , and studies modules over these abstract algebraic structures . In essence , a representation makes an abstract algebraic object more concrete by describing its elements by matrices and its algebraic operations ( for example , matrix addition , matrix multiplication ) . The theory of matrices and linear operators is well-understood , so representations of more abstract objects in terms of familiar linear algebra objects helps glean properties and sometimes simplify calculations on more abstract theories . The algebraic objects amenable to such a description include groups , associative algebras and Lie algebras . The most prominent of these ( and historically the first ) is the representation theory of groups , in which elements of a group are represented by invertible matrices in such a way that the group operation is matrix multiplication . Representation theory is a useful method because it reduces problems in abstract algebra to problems in linear algebra , a subject that is well understood . Furthermore , the vector space on which a group ( for example ) is represented can be infinite-dimensional , and by allowing it to be , for instance , a Hilbert space , methods of analysis can be applied to the theory of groups . Representation theory is also important in physics because , for example , it describes how the symmetry group of a physical system affects the solutions of equations describing that system .

The study of organic reactions includes the chemical synthesis of natural products , drugs , and polymers , and study of individual organic molecules in the laboratory and via theoretical ( in silico ) study . The range of chemicals studied in organic chemistry includes hydrocarbons ( compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen ) as well as compounds based on carbon , but also containing other elements , especially oxygen , nitrogen , sulfur , phosphorus ( included in many biochemicals ) and the halogens . Organometallic chemistry is the study of compounds containing carbon-metal bonds . In addition , contemporary research focuses on organic chemistry involving other organometallics including the lanthanides , but especially the transition metals zinc , copper , palladium , nickel , cobalt , titanium and chromium .",
  "/wiki/University_of_St_Andrews": "The University of St Andrews ( Scots : University o St Andras ; abbreviated as St And , from the Latin Sancti Andreae , in post-nominals ) is a public university in St Andrews , Fife , Scotland . It is the oldest of the four ancient universities of Scotland and , following Oxford and Cambridge universities , the third-oldest university in the United Kingdom and English-speaking world . St Andrews was founded in 1413 when the Avignon Antipope Benedict XIII issued a papal bull to a small founding group of Augustinian clergy . St Andrews is made up of a variety of institutions , comprising three colleges - United College ( a union of St Salvator 's and St Leonard 's Colleges ) , St Mary 's College , and St Leonard 's College , the last named being a non-statutory revival of St Leonard 's as a post-graduate society . There are 18 academic schools organised into four faculties . The university occupies historic and modern buildings located throughout the town . The academic year is divided into two semesters , Martinmas and Candlemas . In term time , over one-third of the town 's population are either staff members or students of the university . The student body is notably diverse : over 145 nationalities are represented with 45% of its intake from countries outside the UK ; about one-eighth of the students are from the rest of the EU and the remaining third are from overseas - 15% from North America alone . The university 's sport teams compete in BUCS competitions , and the student body is known for preserving ancient traditions such as Raisin Weekend , May Dip , and the wearing of distinctive academic dress . In the latest national league tables , the university is ranked second in the UK by The Guardian and within the top three in others . It has been twice named University of the Year by The Times and Sunday Times ' Good University Guide , one of only two UK universities to achieve this .",
  "/wiki/Methylation": "In the chemical sciences , methylation denotes the addition of a methyl group on a substrate , or the substitution of an atom ( or group ) by a methyl group . Methylation is a form of alkylation , with a methyl group , rather than a larger carbon chain , replacing a hydrogen atom . These terms are commonly used in chemistry , biochemistry , soil science , and the biological sciences . In biological systems , methylation is catalyzed by enzymes ; such methylation can be involved in modification of heavy metals , regulation of gene expression , regulation of protein function , and RNA processing . In vitro methylation of tissue samples is also one method for reducing certain histological staining artifacts . The counterpart of methylation is called demethylation .",
  "/wiki/Carbohydrates": "A carbohydrate ( /k\u0251\u02d0rbo\u028a\u02c8ha\u026adre\u026at/ ) is a biomolecule consisting of carbon ( C ) , hydrogen ( H ) and oxygen ( O ) atoms , usually with a hydrogen-oxygen atom ratio of 2:1 ( as in water ) and thus with the empirical formula Cm ( H2O ) n ( where m may be different from n ) . This formula holds true for monosaccharides . Some exceptions exist ; for example , deoxyribose , a sugar component of DNA , has the empirical formula C5H10O4 . The carbohydrates are technically hydrates of carbon ; structurally it is more accurate to view them as aldoses and ketoses . The term is most common in biochemistry , where it is a synonym of saccharide , a group that includes sugars , starch , and cellulose . The saccharides are divided into four chemical groups : monosaccharides , disaccharides , oligosaccharides , and polysaccharides . Monosaccharides and disaccharides , the smallest ( lower molecular weight ) carbohydrates , are commonly referred to as sugars . The word saccharide comes from the Greek word \u03c3\u03ac\u03ba\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd ( s\u00e1kkharon ) , meaning sugar . While the scientific nomenclature of carbohydrates is complex , the names of the monosaccharides and disaccharides very often end in the suffix -ose , as in the monosaccharides fructose ( fruit sugar ) and glucose ( starch sugar ) and the disaccharides sucrose ( cane or beet sugar ) and lactose ( milk sugar ) . Carbohydrates perform numerous roles in living organisms . Polysaccharides serve for the storage of energy ( e.g . starch and glycogen ) and as structural components ( e.g .",
  "/wiki/Francis_Robert_Japp": "Francis Robert Japp ( 8 February 1848 - 1 August 1925 ) was a British chemist who discovered the Japp-Klingemann reaction in 1887 . He was born in Dundee , Scotland , the son of James Japp , a minister of the Catholic Apostolic Church . He graduated from St Andrews with an M.A . in 1868 and entered the University of Edinburgh as a student of law . He left the university because of health problems and stayed in Germany for two years from 1871 until 1873 . After returning to England he decided to study chemistry . He started his studies at the University of Heidelberg with Robert Bunsen , where he received his Ph.D. in 1875 . He joined the laboratory of August Kekul\u00e9 at the University of Bonn the following year and after returning to Scotland in 1878 worked with Alexander Crum Brown at the University of Edinburgh . In 1881 Japp became assistant professor at the Royal School of Mines and Normal School of Science South Kensington and in 1890 Professor of Chemistry at the University of Aberdeen . In 1885 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society . He retired in 1918 . After the death of his only son in 1920 and an operation the following year , his health deteriorated .",
  "/wiki/Chemist": "A chemist ( from Greek ch\u0113m ( \u00eda ) alchemy ; replacing chemist from Medieval Latin alchimista ) is a scientist trained in the study of chemistry . Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties . Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities , with detail on the level of molecules and their component atoms . Chemists carefully measure substance proportions , reaction rates , and other chemical properties . The word 'chemist ' is also used to address Pharmacists in Commonwealth English . Chemists use this knowledge to learn the composition and properties of unfamiliar substances , as well as to reproduce and synthesize large quantities of useful naturally occurring substances and create new artificial substances and useful processes . Chemists may specialize in any number of subdisciplines of chemistry . Materials scientists and metallurgists share much of the same education and skills with chemists . The work of chemists is often related to the work of chemical engineers , who are primarily concerned with the proper design , construction and evaluation of the most cost-effective large-scale chemical plants and work closely with industrial chemists on the development of new processes and methods for the commercial-scale manufacture of chemicals and related products .",

  "/wiki/Psychologist": "A psychologist studies normal and abnormal mental states , perceptual , cognitive , emotional , and social processes and behavior by experimenting with , and observing , interpreting , and recording how individuals relate to one another and to their environments . Most psychologists need a license to practice psychology . Typically , psychologists need a doctoral degree in psychology , although a master 's degree is sufficient in some situations . Licensing and regulations can vary by country and profession . Psychologists can work in applied or academic settings . Academic psychologists educate higher-education students as well as conduct research , with graduate-level research being an important part of academic psychology . Academic positions can be tenured or non-tenured , with tenured positions being highly desirable . Applied psychology applies theory to solve problems in human and animal behavior . Clinical psychology and Counseling psychology are two fields of applied psychology that focus on therapeutic methods . Other applied fields such as industrial and organizational psychology , forensic psychology , and others , aim to solve problems in business , government , industry , and similar fields .",

  "/wiki/Geographer": "A geographer is a scientist whose area of study is geography , the study of Earth 's natural environment and human society . The Greek prefix , geo , means earth and the Greek suffix , graphy , meaning description , so a geographer is someone who studies the earth . The word geography is a Middle French word that is believed to have been first used in 1540 . Although geographers are historically known as people who make maps , map making is actually the field of study of cartography , a subset of geography . Geographers do not study only the details of the natural environment or human society , but they also study the reciprocal relationship between these two . For example , they study how the natural environment contributes to human society and how human society affects the natural environment . In particular , physical geographers study the natural environment while human geographers study human society . Modern geographers are the primary practitioners of the GIS ( geographic information system ) , who are often employed by local , state , and federal government agencies as well as in the private sector by environmental and engineering firms . The paintings by Johannes Vermeer titled The Geographer and The Astronomer are both thought to represent the growing influence and rise in prominence of scientific enquiry in Europe at the time of their painting in 1668-69 .",

Leslie gave the first modern account of capillary action in 1802 and froze water using an air-pump in 1810 , the first artificial production of ice . In 1804 , he experimented with radiant heat using a cubical vessel filled with boiling water . One side of the cube is composed of highly polished metal , two of dull metal ( copper ) and one side painted black . He showed that radiation was greatest from the black side and negligible from the polished side . The apparatus is known as a Leslie cube .",
  "/wiki/Physicist": "A physicist is a scientist who specializes in the field of physics , which encompasses the interactions of matter and energy at all length and time scales in the physical universe . Physicists generally are interested in the root or ultimate causes of phenomena , and usually frame their understanding in mathematical terms . Physicists work across a wide range of research fields , spanning all length scales : from sub-atomic and particle physics , through biological physics , to cosmological length scales encompassing the universe as a whole . The field generally includes two types of physicists : experimental physicists who specialize in the observation of physical phenomena and the analysis of experiments , and theoretical physicists who specialize in mathematical modeling of physical systems to rationalize , explain and predict natural phenomena . Physicists can apply their knowledge towards solving practical problems or to developing new technologies ( also known as applied physics or engineering physics ) .",
  "/wiki/Capillary_action": "Capillary action ( sometimes capillarity , capillary motion , capillary effect , or wicking ) is the ability of a liquid to flow in narrow spaces without the assistance of , or even in opposition to , external forces like gravity . The effect can be seen in the drawing up of liquids between the hairs of a paint-brush , in a thin tube , in porous materials such as paper and plaster , in some non-porous materials such as sand and liquefied carbon fiber , or in a biological cell . It occurs because of intermolecular forces between the liquid and surrounding solid surfaces . If the diameter of the tube is sufficiently small , then the combination of surface tension ( which is caused by cohesion within the liquid ) and adhesive forces between the liquid and container wall act to propel the liquid .",

  "/wiki/James_Bowman_Lindsay": "James Bowman Lindsay ( 8 September 1799 - 29 June 1862 ) was a Scottish inventor and author . He is credited with early developments in several fields , such as incandescent lighting and telegraphy .",
  "/wiki/Incandescent_lighting": "An incandescent light bulb , incandescent lamp or incandescent light globe is an electric light with a wire filament heated until it glows . The filament is enclosed in a bulb to protect the filament from oxidation . Current is supplied to the filament by terminals or wires embedded in the glass . A bulb socket provides mechanical support and electrical connections . Incandescent bulbs are manufactured in a wide range of sizes , light output , and voltage ratings , from 1.5 volts to about 300 volts . They require no external regulating equipment , have low manufacturing costs , and work equally well on either alternating current or direct current . As a result , the incandescent bulb became widely used in household and commercial lighting , for portable lighting such as table lamps , car headlamps , and flashlights , and for decorative and advertising lighting . Incandescent bulbs are much less efficient than other types of electric lighting , converting less than 5% of the energy they use into visible light . The remaining energy is lost as heat . The luminous efficacy of a typical incandescent bulb for 120 V operation is 16 lumens per watt , compared with 60 lm/W for a compact fluorescent bulb or 150 lm/W for some white LED lamps . Some applications use the heat generated by the filament , such as incubators , brooding boxes for poultry , heat lights for reptile tanks , infrared heating for industrial heating and drying processes , lava lamps , and the Easy-Bake Oven toy . Quartz tube heat lamps are used for industrial processes such as paint curing or for space heating .",
  "/wiki/Telegraphy": "Telegraphy is the long-distance transmission of textual messages where the sender uses symbolic codes , known to the recipient , rather than a physical exchange of an object bearing the message . Thus flag semaphore is a method of telegraphy , whereas pigeon post is not . Ancient signalling systems , although sometimes quite extensive and sophisticated as in China , were generally not capable of transmitting arbitrary text messages . Possible messages were fixed and predetermined and such systems are thus not true telegraphs . The earliest true telegraph put into widespread use was the optical telegraph of Claude Chappe , invented in the late 18th century . The system was extensively used in France , and European countries controlled by France , during the Napoleonic era . The electric telegraph started to replace the optical telegraph in the mid-19th century . It was first taken up in Britain in the form of the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph , initially used mostly as an aid to railway signalling . This was quickly followed by a different system developed in the United States by Samuel Morse . The electric telegraph was slower to develop in France due to the established optical telegraph system , but an electrical telegraph was put into use with a code compatible with the Chappe optical telegraph . The Morse system was adopted as the international standard in 1865 , using a modified Morse code developed in Germany . The heliograph is a telegraph system using reflected sunlight for signalling .",
