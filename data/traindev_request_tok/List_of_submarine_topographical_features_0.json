  "/wiki/Adriatic_Abyssal_Plain": "The Adriatic Abyssal Plain , more commonly referred to as the Adriatic Basin , is an oceanic basin under the Adriatic Sea . The Adriatic Sea 's average depth is 252.5 metres ( 828 ft ) , and its maximum depth is 1,233 metres ( 4,045 ft ) ; however , the North Adriatic basin rarely exceeds a depth of 100 metres ( 330 ft ) .",
  "/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea": "The Mediterranean Sea is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean , surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land : on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia , on the south by North Africa and on the east by the Levant . Although the sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean , it is usually referred to as a separate body of water . Geological evidence indicates that around 5.9 million years ago , the Mediterranean was cut off from the Atlantic and was partly or completely desiccated over a period of some 600,000 years ( the Messinian salinity crisis ) before being refilled by the Zanclean flood about 5.3 million years ago . It covers an area of about 2,500,000 km2 ( 970,000 sq mi ) , representing 0.7% of the global ocean surface , but its connection to the Atlantic via the Strait of Gibraltar - the narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates Spain in Europe from Morocco in Africa - is only 14 km ( 9 mi ) wide . In oceanography , it is sometimes called the Eurafrican Mediterranean Sea or the European Mediterranean Sea to distinguish it from mediterranean seas elsewhere . The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500 m ( 4,900 ft ) and the deepest recorded point is 5,267 m ( 17,280 ft ) in the Calypso Deep in the Ionian Sea . It lies between latitudes 30\u00b0 and 46\u00b0 N and longitudes 6\u00b0 W and 36\u00b0 E. Its west-east length , from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Gulf of Iskenderun , on the southeastern coast of Turkey , is about 4,000 kilometres ( 2,500 mi ) . The sea was an important route for merchants and travellers of ancient times , facilitating trade and cultural exchange between peoples of the region . The history of the Mediterranean region is crucial to understanding the origins and development of many modern societies . The countries surrounding the Mediterranean in clockwise order are Spain , France , Monaco , Italy , Slovenia , Croatia , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Montenegro , Albania , Greece , Turkey , Syria , Lebanon , Israel , Egypt , Libya , Tunisia , Algeria , and Morocco ; Malta and Cyprus are island countries in the sea . In addition , the Gaza Strip and the British Overseas Territories of Gibraltar and Akrotiri and Dhekelia have coastlines on the sea .",
  "/wiki/Agulhas_Bank": "The Agulhas Bank ( /\u0259\u02c8\u0261\u028cl\u0259s/ , from Portuguese for Cape Agulhas , Cabo das Agulhas , Cape of Needles ) is a broad , shallow part of the southern African continental shelf which extends up to 250 km ( 160 mi ) south of Cape Agulhas before falling steeply to the abyssal plain . It is the ocean region where the warm Indian Ocean and the cold Atlantic Ocean meet . This convergence leads to treacherous sailing conditions , accounting for numerous wrecked ships in the area over the years . However the meeting of the oceans here also fuels the nutrient cycle for marine life , making it one of the best fishing grounds in South Africa .",

  "/wiki/Geology_of_the_Iberian_Peninsula": "The geology of the Iberian Peninsula consists of the study of the rock formations on the Iberian Peninsula , which includes Spain , Portugal , Andorra , and Gibraltar . The peninsula contains rocks from every geological period from the Ediacaran to the Quaternary , and many types of rock are represented . World-class mineral deposits are also found there . The core of the Iberian Peninsula consists of a Hercynian cratonic block known as the Iberian Massif . On the northeast this is bounded by The Pyrenean fold belt , and on the southeast it is bounded by the Betic Fold mountain chain . These two fold chains are part of the Alpine belt . To the west , the peninsula is delimited by the continental boundary formed by the opening of the Atlantic Ocean .

  "/wiki/Aleutian_Basin": "The Aleutian Basin is an oceanic basin under the southwestern Bering Sea . While the northeastern half of the Bering Sea overlies the North American Plate in relatively shallow water , the Aleutian Basin consists of oceanic plate - the remnant of the Kula Plate that was mostly subducted under the North American Plate . Subduction of the Kula Plate ceased after the creation of the Aleutian Trench to its south . What remained of the Kula Plate attached to the North American Plate . This former subduction zone is now the Beringian Margin , which now hosts sixteen submarine canyons , including Zhemchug Canyon , the world 's largest . The deep-water part of the Bering Sea is separated into the Commander and Bowers basins by the submarine Shirshov Ridge and Bowers Ridge . The Commander Basin occupies the western part of the Bering Sea , with the Shirshov Ridge on its eastern border . The Shirshov Ridge extends 750 km southward from the Russian Olyutorskii Peninsula to connect with Bowers Ridge . The Bowers Ridge extends in the form of an arc over approximately 900 km from the Aleutian Islands Arc to the northwestern termination , where it meets Shirshov Ridge . This former island arc , Bowers Ridge , is a prominent semi-circular-shaped geological that meets the Aleutian arc and , together with the Aleutians , bounds Bowers Basin .",
  "/wiki/Amerasian_Basin": "The Amerasia Basin , or Amerasian Basin , is one of the two major basins from which the Arctic Ocean can be subdivided ( the other one being the Eurasian Basin ) . The triangular-shaped Amerasia Basin broadly extends from the Canadian Arctic Islands to the East Siberian Sea , and from Alaska to the Lomonosov Ridge . The basin can be further subdivided based on bathymetric features ; these include the Canada Basin , the Makarov Basin , the Podvodnikov Basin , the Alpha-Mendeleev Ridge , and the Chukchi Plateau . The Amerasia Basin is connected to the Pacific Ocean via the Bering Strait and to the North Atlantic Ocean via the Eurasia Basin and the Fram Strait . The continental shelf around the Amerasia Basin is very broad , averaging up to 342 mi ( 550 km ) in width . The average depth of the Amerasia Basin is 12,960 ft ( 3,950 m ) , and it covers 2,500,000 km2 ( 970,000 sq mi ) . The Canada Basin ( with a maximum depth of 4,000 m ( 13,000 ft ) ) is underlain by oceanic crust at its centre , as well as extended continental crust and transitional-type crust around its margins . The Makarov and Podvodnikov basins , may include oceanic crust , though have also been suggested to be highly extended continental crust or intruded by volcanics . The Alpha and Mendeleev ridges ( also collectively referred to as the Alpha-Mendeleev Ridge ) are considered to be predominantly volcanic in origin , possibly with a component of extended continental crust underneath . The Chukchi Plateau is made of continental crust . Many scenarios have been proposed for the opening of the Amerasia Basin . The most popular , the windshield wiper model , proposes that the Arctic Alaska-Chukotka terrane ( AAC ) was rotated in a counter-clockwise motion , away from the Canadian Arctic Islands during the Late Jurassic-Cretaceous in one or several stages .",

  "/wiki/Arctic_Ocean": "The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world 's five major oceans . It is also known as the coldest of all the oceans . The International Hydrographic Organization ( IHO ) recognizes it as an ocean , although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Sea . It is sometimes classified as an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean , and it is also seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean . Located mostly in the Arctic north polar region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere , besides its surrounding waters the Arctic Ocean is surrounded by Eurasia and North America . It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter . The Arctic Ocean 's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes ; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans , due to low evaporation , heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams , and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities . The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50% . The US National Snow and Ice Data Center ( NSIDC ) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years .",

  "/wiki/Southern_Ocean": "The Southern Ocean , also known as the Antarctic Ocean or the Austral Ocean , [ note 4 ] comprises the southernmost waters of the World Ocean , generally taken to be south of 60\u00b0 S latitude and encircling Antarctica . As such , it is regarded as the second-smallest of the five principal oceanic divisions : smaller than the Pacific , Atlantic , and Indian Oceans but larger than the Arctic Ocean . This oceanic zone is where cold , northward flowing waters from the Antarctic mix with warmer subantarctic waters . By way of his voyages in the 1770s , James Cook proved that waters encompassed the southern latitudes of the globe . Since then , geographers have disagreed on the Southern Ocean 's northern boundary or even existence , considering the waters as various parts of the Pacific , Atlantic , and Indian Oceans , instead . However , according to Commodore John Leech of the International Hydrographic Organization ( IHO ) , recent oceanographic research has discovered the importance of Southern Circulation , and the term Southern Ocean has been used to define the body of water which lies south of the northern limit of that circulation . This remains the current official policy of the IHO , since a 2000 revision of its definitions including the Southern Ocean as the waters south of the 60th parallel has not yet been adopted . Others regard the seasonally-fluctuating Antarctic Convergence as the natural boundary . The maximum depth of the Southern Ocean , using the definition that it lies south of 60th parallel , was surveyed by the Five Deeps Expedition in early February 2019 . The expedition 's multibeam sonar team identified the deepest point at 60\u00b0 28 ' 46S , 025\u00b0 32 ' 32W , with a depth of 7,434 meters .
