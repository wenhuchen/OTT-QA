  "/wiki/Paleo-Indians": "Paleo-Indians , Paleoindians or Paleoamericans , were the first peoples who entered , and subsequently inhabited , the Americas during the final glacial episodes of the late Pleistocene period . The prefix paleo- comes from the Greek adjective palaios ( \u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2 ) , meaning old or ancient . The term Paleo-Indians applies specifically to the lithic period in the Western Hemisphere and is distinct from the term Paleolithic . Traditional theories suggest that big-animal hunters crossed the Bering Strait from North Asia into the Americas over a land-and-ice bridge ( Beringia ) . This bridge existed from 45,000 to 12,000 BCE ( 47,000-14,000 BP ) . Small isolated groups of hunter-gatherers migrated alongside herds of large herbivores far into Alaska . From c. 16,500 - c. 13,500 BCE ( c. 18,500 - c. 15,500 BP ) , ice-free corridors developed along the Pacific coast and valleys of North America . This allowed animals , followed by humans , to migrate south into the interior of the continent . The people went on foot or used primitive boats along the coastline . The precise dates and routes of the peopling of the New World remain subjects of ongoing debate . At least two morphologically different Paleo-Indian populations were coexisting in different geographical areas of Mexico 10,000 years ago . Stone tools , particularly projectile points and scrapers , are the primary evidence of the earliest human activity in the Americas .",

  "/wiki/Adze": "An adze ( /\u00e6dz/ ; alternative spelling : adz ) is a cutting tool similar to an axe but with the cutting edge perpendicular to the handle rather than parallel . They have been used since the stone age . Adzes are used for smoothing or carving wood in hand woodworking . Two basic forms of an adze are the hand adze - a short handled tool swung with one hand - and the foot adze - a long handled tool capable of powerful swings using both hands , the cutting edge usually striking at foot or shin level . A similar , but blunt , tool used for digging in hard ground is called a mattock .",
  "/wiki/Scraper_(archaeology)": "In prehistoric archaeology , scrapers are unifacial tools thought to have been used for hideworking and woodworking . Many lithic analysts maintain that the only true scrapers are defined on the base of use-wear , and usually are those that were worked on the distal ends of blades - i.e. , end scrapers ( French : grattoir ) . Other scrapers include the so-called side scrapers or racloirs , which are made on the longest side of a flake , and notched scrapers , which have a cleft on either side that may have been used to attach them to something else . Scrapers are typically formed by chipping the end of a flake of stone in order to create one sharp side and to keep the rest of the sides dull to facilitate grasping it . Most scrapers are either circle or blade-like in shape . The working edges of scrapers tend to be convex , and many have trimmed and dulled lateral edges to facilitate hafting . One important variety of scraper is the thumbnail scraper , a scraper shaped much like its namesake . This scraper type is common at Paleo-Indian sites in North America . Scrapers are one of the most varied lithic tools found at archaeological sites . Due to the vast array of scrapers there are many typologies that scrapers can fall under , including tool size , tool shape , tool base , the number of working edges , edge angle , edge shape , and many more .",
  "/wiki/Woodland_period": "In the classification of archaeological cultures of North America , the Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures spanned a period from roughly 1000 BCE to European contact in the eastern part of North America , with some archaeologists distinguishing the Mississippian period , from 1000 CE to European contact as a separate period . The term Woodland Period was introduced in the 1930s as a generic term for prehistoric sites falling between the Archaic hunter-gatherers and the agriculturalist Mississippian cultures . The Eastern Woodlands cultural region covers what is now eastern Canada south of the Subarctic region , the Eastern United States , along to the Gulf of Mexico . This period is variously considered a developmental stage , a time period , a suite of technological adaptations or traits , and a family tree of cultures related to earlier Archaic cultures . It can be characterized as a chronological and cultural manifestation without any massive changes in a short time but instead having a continuous development in stone and bone tools , leather crafting , textile manufacture , cultivation , and shelter construction . Many Woodland peoples used spears and atlatls until the end of the period , when they were replaced by bows and arrows ; however , Southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns . The most cited technological distinction of this period was the widespread use of pottery ( although pottery manufacture had arisen during the Archaic period in some places ) , and the diversification of pottery forms , decorations , and manufacturing practices . The increasing use of horticulture and the development of the Eastern Agricultural Complex , consisting of weedy seed plants as well as gourd cultivation , also meant that groups became less mobile over time and , in some times and places , people lived in permanently occupied villages and cities . Intensive agriculture characterizes the Mississippian period from c. 1000-1400 CE and may have continued up to European contact , around 500 years ago .",

  "/wiki/Fire_lookout_tower": "A fire lookout tower , fire tower or lookout tower , provides housing and protection for a person known as a fire lookout whose duty it is to search for wildfires in the wilderness . The fire lookout tower is a small building , usually located on the summit of a mountain or other high vantage point , in order to maximize the viewing distance and range , known as view shed . From this vantage point the fire lookout can see smoke that may develop , determine the location by using a device known as an Osborne Fire Finder , and call fire suppression personnel to the fire . Lookouts also report weather changes and plot the location of lightning strikes during storms . The location of the strike is monitored for a period of days after in case of ignition . The typical fire lookout tower consists of a small room , known as a cab located atop a large steel , or wooden tower . Historically , the tops of tall trees have also been used to mount permanent platforms . Sometimes natural rock may be used to create a lower platform . In cases where the terrain makes a tower unnecessary , the structure is known as a ground cab . Ground cabs are called towers , even if they do n't sit on a tower . Towers gained popularity in the early 1900s , and fires were reported using telephones , carrier pigeons , and heliographs . Although many fire lookout towers have fallen into disrepair as a result of neglect , abandonment , and declining budgets , some fire service personnel have made an effort to preserve older fire towers , arguing that a good set of human eyes watching the forest for wildfire can be an effective and cheap fire safety measure .",
  "/wiki/Civilian_Conservation_Corps": "The Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) was a voluntary public work relief program that operated from 1933 to 1942 in the United States for unemployed , unmarried men .

The following spring , the town rebuilt the current hall with the same dimensions , headed by carpenter Theodore Ristin . The hall initially housed all functions of local government , with a clerk 's room with a vault , and a two-celled jail . It also hosted meetings of community organizations like the VFW and the Red Cross , and social functions like local plays , graduations , lectures , traveling shows , medicine shows , and dances in the opera house upstairs . Elections were held here , and public announcements like the closing of the polls were made from the front balcony .

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",

  "/wiki/Modernism": "Modernism is both a philosophical movement and an art movement that , along with cultural trends and changes , arose from wide-scale and far-reaching transformations in Western society during the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Among the factors that shaped modernism were the development of modern industrial societies and the rapid growth of cities , followed then by reactions to the horrors of World War I. Modernism also rejected the certainty of Enlightenment thinking , although many modernists also rejected religious belief . Modernism , in general , includes the activities and creations of those who felt the traditional forms of art , architecture , literature , religious faith , philosophy , social organization , activities of daily life , and sciences were becoming ill-fitted to their tasks and outdated in the new economic , social , and political environment of an emerging fully industrialized world . The poet Ezra Pound 's 1934 injunction to Make it new ! was the touchstone of the movement 's approach towards what it saw as the now obsolete culture of the past . In this spirit , its innovations , like the stream-of-consciousness novel , atonal ( or pantonal ) and twelve-tone music , divisionist painting and abstract art , all had precursors in the 19th century . A notable characteristic of modernism is self-consciousness and irony concerning literary and social traditions , which often led to experiments with form , along with the use of techniques that drew attention to the processes and materials used in creating a painting , poem , building and other works of art . Modernism explicitly rejected the ideology of realism [ full citation needed ] and made use of the works of the past by the employment of reprise , incorporation , rewriting , recapitulation , revision and parody . While some scholars see modernism continuing into the 21st century , others see it evolving into late modernism or high modernism .

It was established on May 6 , 1935 , by Executive Order 7034 . In one project , Federal Project Number One , the WPA employed musicians , artists , writers , actors and directors in large arts , drama , media , and literacy projects . The five projects dedicated to these were : the Federal Writers Project ( FWP ) , the Historical Records Survey ( HRS ) , the Federal Theatre Project ( FTP ) , the Federal Music Project ( FMP ) , and the Federal Art Project ( FAP ) . In the Historical Records Survey , for instance , many former slaves in the South were interviewed ; these documents are of great importance for American history . Theater and music groups toured throughout the United States , and gave more than 225,000 performances . Archaeological investigations under the WPA were influential in the rediscovery of pre-Columbian Native American cultures , and the development of professional archaeology in the US . The WPA 's initial appropriation in 1935 was for $ 4.9 billion ( about 6.7 percent of the 1935 GDP ) . Headed by Harry Hopkins , the WPA provided jobs and income to the unemployed during the Great Depression in the United States , while developing infrastructure to support the current and future society . Above all , the WPA hired workers and craftsmen who were mainly employed in building streets .

  "/wiki/Romanesque_Revival_architecture": "Romanesque Revival ( or Neo-Romanesque ) is a style of building employed beginning in the mid-19th century inspired by the 11th- and 12th-century Romanesque architecture . Unlike the historic Romanesque style , however , Romanesque Revival buildings tended to feature more simplified arches and windows than their historic counterparts . An early variety of Romanesque Revival style known as Rundbogenstil ( Round-arched style ) was popular in German lands and in the German diaspora beginning in the 1830s . By far the most prominent and influential American architect working in a free Romanesque manner was Henry Hobson Richardson . In the United States , the style derived from examples set by him are termed Richardsonian Romanesque , of which not all are Romanesque Revival . Romanesque Revival is also sometimes referred to as the Norman style or Lombard style , particularly in works published during the 19th century after variations of historic Romanesque that were developed by the Normans and Lombards , respectively . Like its influencing Romanesque style , the Romanesque Revival style was widely used for churches , and occasionally for synagogues such as the New Synagogue of Strasbourg built in 1898 , and the Congregation Emanu-El of New York built in 1929 . The style was quite popular for university campuses in the late 19th and early 20th century , especially in the United States and Canada ; well known examples can be found at the University of California , Los Angeles , University of Southern California , Tulane University , University of Denver , University of Toronto , and Wayne State University .",
