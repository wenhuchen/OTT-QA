The present-day Kanha area is divided into two sanctuaries , Hallon and Banjar , of 250 and 300 km2 ( 120 sq mi ) > respectively . Kanha National Park was created on 1 June 1955 and in 1973 was made the Kanha Tiger Reserve . Today it stretches over an area of 940 km2 ( 360 sq mi ) in the two districts Mandla and Balaghat . Together with a surrounding buffer zone of 1,067 km2 ( 412 sq mi ) and the neighbouring 110 km2 ( 42 sq mi ) Phen Sanctuary it forms the Kanha Tiger Reserve . This makes it the largest National Park in Central India . Kanha Tiger Reserve was ranked among the top 10 Famous Places for Tourists . The park has a significant population of the Royal Bengal tiger , Indian leopards , the sloth bear , barasingha and Indian wild dog . The forest depicted in the famous novel by Rudyard Kipling , The Jungle Book is based on jungles including this reserve . It is also the first tiger reserve in India to officially introduce a mascot , Bhoorsingh the Barasingha ( Swamp Deer ) .

  "/wiki/Tiger": "The tiger ( Panthera tigris ) is the largest species among the Felidae and classified in the genus Panthera . It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orangish-brown fur with a lighter underside . It is an apex predator , primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar . It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator , requiring large contiguous areas of habitat , which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring . Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years , before they become independent and leave their mother 's home range to establish their own . The tiger once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin , and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda islands . Since the early 20th century , tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated in Western and Central Asia , from the islands of Java and Bali , and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China . Today 's tiger range is fragmented , stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent and Sumatra . The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1986 . As of 2015 , the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals , down from around 100,000 at the start of the 20th century , with most remaining populations occurring in small pockets isolated from each other . Major reasons for population decline include habitat destruction , habitat fragmentation and poaching . This , coupled with the fact that it lives in some of the more densely populated places on Earth , has caused significant conflicts with humans .",

It occurs in a wide range in sub-Saharan Africa , in small parts of Western and Central Asia , on the Indian subcontinent to Southeast and East Asia . It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because leopard populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation , and are declining in large parts of the global range . In Hong Kong , Singapore , Kuwait , Syria , Libya , Tunisia and most likely in Morocco , leopard populations have already been extirpated . Contemporary records suggest that the leopard occurs in only 25% of its historical global range . Leopards are hunted illegally , and their body parts are smuggled in the wildlife trade for medicinal practices and decoration . Compared to other wild cats , the leopard has relatively short legs and a long body with a large skull . Its fur is marked with rosettes . It is similar in appearance to the jaguar , but has a smaller , lighter physique , and its rosettes are generally smaller , more densely packed and without central spots . Both leopards and jaguars that are melanistic are known as black panthers . The leopard is distinguished by its well-camouflaged fur , opportunistic hunting behaviour , broad diet , strength , and its ability to adapt to a variety of habitats ranging from rainforest to steppe , including arid and montane areas . It can run at speeds of up to 58 kilometres per hour ( 36 mph ) .",

  "/wiki/Wild_boar": "The wild boar ( Sus scrofa ) , also known as the wild swine , Common wild pig , or simply wild pig , is a suid native to much of the Americas , Eurasia , North Africa , and the Greater Sunda Islands . Human intervention has spread its distribution further , making the species one of the widest-ranging mammals in the world , as well as the most widely spread suiform . Its wide range , high numbers , and adaptability mean that it is classed as least concern by the IUCN and it has become an invasive species in part of its introduced range . The animal probably originated in Southeast Asia during the Early Pleistocene , and outcompeted other suid species as it spread throughout the Old World . As of 1990 , up to 16 subspecies are recognized , which are divided into four regional groupings based on skull height and lacrimal bone length . The species lives in matriarchal societies consisting of interrelated females and their young ( both male and female ) . Fully grown males are usually solitary outside the breeding season . The grey wolf , coyote , american alligator , jaguar , bobcat , lynx , cougar , and black bear , and brown bear is the wild boar 's main predators in the world , throughout most of its range , except in the Far East and the Lesser Sunda Islands , where it is replaced by the tiger , leopard , asiatic lion , and Komodo dragon , respectively . It has a long history of association with humans , having been the ancestor of most domestic pig breeds and a big-game animal for millennia .

  "/wiki/Crocodile": "Crocodiles ( subfamily Crocodylinae ) or true crocodiles are large semiaquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa , Asia , the Americas and Australia . Crocodylinae , all of whose members are considered true crocodiles , is classified as a biological subfamily . A broader sense of the term crocodile , Crocodylidae that includes Tomistoma , is not used in this article . The term crocodile here applies to only the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae . The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia , which includes the alligators and caimans ( family Alligatoridae ) , the gharial and false gharial ( family Gavialidae ) , and all other living and fossil Crocodylomorpha . Although they appear similar , crocodiles , alligators and the gharial belong to separate biological families . The gharial , with its narrow snout , is easier to distinguish , while morphological differences are more difficult to spot in crocodiles and alligators . The most obvious external differences are visible in the head , with crocodiles having narrower and longer heads , with a more V-shaped than a U-shaped snout compared to alligators and caimans . Another obvious trait is that the upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width , and the teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the upper jaw when the mouth is closed ; therefore , all teeth are visible , unlike an alligator , which possesses in the upper jaw small depressions into which the lower teeth fit . Also , when the crocodile 's mouth is closed , the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits into a constriction in the upper jaw . For hard-to-distinguish specimens , the protruding tooth is the most reliable feature to define the species ' family . Crocodiles have more webbing on the toes of the hind feet and can better tolerate saltwater due to specialized salt glands for filtering out salt , which are present , but non-functioning , in alligators .",

The lion is an apex and keystone predator , although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur , and have been known to hunt humans , although the species typically does not . Typically , the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas but is absent in dense forests . It is usually more diurnal than other big cats , but when persecuted it adapts to being active at night and at twilight . In the Pleistocene , the lion ranged throughout Eurasia , Africa and North America but today it has been reduced to fragmented populations in Sub-Saharan Africa and one critically endangered population in western India . It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s .

Although only eight species of bears are extant , they are widespread , appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere . Bears are found on the continents of North America , South America , Europe , and Asia . Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs , long snouts , small rounded ears , shaggy hair , plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws , and short tails . While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous , and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo , the remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets . With the exception of courting individuals and mothers with their young , bears are typically solitary animals . They may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an excellent sense of smell . Despite their heavy build and awkward gait , they are adept runners , climbers , and swimmers . Bears use shelters , such as caves and logs , as their dens ; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of hibernation , up to 100 days . Bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur ; they have been used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment , such as being made to dance .

With only four extant species ( in three genera ) , it is the fifth-smallest biological family in the Carnivora , and one of the smallest in the class Mammalia . Despite their low diversity , hyenas are unique and vital components of most African ecosystems . Although phylogenetically they are closer to felines and viverrids , and belong to the feliform category , hyenas are behaviourally and morphologically similar to canines in several elements of convergent evolution ; both hyenas and canines are non-arboreal , cursorial hunters that catch prey with their teeth rather than claws . Both eat food quickly and may store it , and their calloused feet with large , blunt , nonretractable claws are adapted for running and making sharp turns . However , the hyenas ' grooming , scent marking , defecating habits , mating and parental behaviour are consistent with the behaviour of other feliforms . Spotted hyenas may kill as many as 95% of the animals they eat , while striped hyenas are largely scavengers . Generally , hyenas are known to drive off larger predators , like lions , from their kills , despite having a reputation in popular culture for being cowardly . Hyenas are primarily nocturnal animals , but sometimes venture from their lairs in the early-morning hours . With the exception of the highly social spotted hyena , hyenas are generally not gregarious animals , though they may live in family groups and congregate at kills . Hyenas first arose in Eurasia during the Miocene period from viverrid-like ancestors , and diversified into two distinct types : lightly built dog-like hyenas and robust bone-crushing hyenas . Although the dog-like hyenas thrived 15 million years ago ( with one taxon having colonised North America ) , they became extinct after a change in climate along with the arrival of canids into Eurasia .",

  "/wiki/Four-horned_antelope": "The four-horned antelope ( Tetracerus quadricornis ) , or chousingha , is a small antelope found in India and Nepal . This antelope has four horns , which distinguish it from most other bovids , which have two horns ( sparing a few such as the Jacob sheep ) . The sole member of the genus Tetracerus , the species was first described by French zoologist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1816 . Three subspecies are recognised . The four-horned antelope stands nearly 55-64 centimetres ( 22-25 in ) at the shoulder and weighs nearly 17-22 kilograms ( 37-49 lb ) . Slender with thin legs and a short tail , the four-horned antelope has a yellowish brown to reddish coat . One pair of horns is located between the ears , and the other on the forehead . The posterior horns are always longer than the anterior horns , which might be mere fur-covered studs . While the posterior horns measure 8-12 centimetres ( 3.1-4.7 in ) , the anterior ones are 2-5 centimetres ( 0.79-1.97 in ) long . The four-horned antelope is diurnal ( active mainly during the day ) . Though solitary by nature , four-horned antelopes may form loose groups of three to five -with one or more adults , sometimes accompanied by juveniles . This elusive antelope feeds on grasses , herbs , shrubs , foliage , flowers and fruits .",
  "/wiki/Bison": "Bison are large , even-toed ungulates in the genus Bison within the subfamily Bovinae . Two extant and six extinct species are recognised . Of the six extinct species , five became extinct in the Quaternary extinction event . Bison palaeosinensis evolved in the Early Pleistocene in South Asia , and was the evolutionary ancestor of B. priscus ( steppe bison ) , which was the ancestor of all other Bison species . From 2 million years ago to 6,000 BC , steppe bison ranged across the mammoth steppe , inhabiting Europe and northern Asia with B. schoetensacki ( woodland bison ) , and North America with B. antiquus , B. latifrons , and B. occidentalis . The last species to go extinct , B. occidentalis , was succeeded at 3,000 BC by B. bison . Of the two surviving species , the American bison , B. bison , found only in North America , is the more numerous . Although commonly known as a buffalo in the United States and Canada , it is only distantly related to the true buffalo . The North American species is composed of two subspecies , the Plains bison , B. b. bison , and the wood bison , B. b. athabascae , which is the namesake of Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada . A third subspecies , the eastern bison ( B. b. pennsylvanicus ) is no longer considered a valid taxon , being a junior synonym of B. b. bison . References to woods bison or wood bison from the eastern United States confusingly refer to this subspecies , not B. b. athabascae , which was not found in the region . The European bison , B. bonasus , or wisent , is found in Europe and the Caucasus , reintroduced after being extinct in the wild .",
  "/wiki/Dhole": "The dhole /do\u028al/ ( Cuon alpinus ) is a canid native to Central , South , East Asia , and Southeast Asia . Other English names for the species include Asian wild dog , Asiatic wild dog , Indian wild dog , whistling dog , red dog , and mountain wolf . It is genetically close to species within the genus Canis , ( Fig . 10 ) but distinct in several anatomical aspects : its skull is convex rather than concave in profile , it lacks a third lower molar and the upper molars sport only a single cusp as opposed to between two and four . During the Pleistocene , the dhole ranged throughout Asia , Europe , and North America but became restricted to its historical range 12,000-18,000 years ago . The dhole is a highly social animal , living in large clans without rigid dominance hierarchies and containing multiple breeding females . Such clans usually consist of 12 individuals , but groups of over 40 are known . It is a diurnal pack hunter which preferentially targets medium- and large-sized ungulates . In tropical forests , the dhole competes with tiger and leopard , targeting somewhat different prey species , but still with substantial dietary overlap . It is listed as Endangered by the IUCN as populations are decreasing and are estimated at fewer than 2,500 adults . Factors contributing to this decline include habitat loss , loss of prey , competition with other species , persecution due to livestock predation and disease transfer from domestic dogs .",
  "/wiki/Fox": "Foxes are small-to-medium-sized , omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae . Foxes have a flattened skull , upright triangular ears , a pointed , slightly upturned snout , and a long bushy tail ( or brush ) . Twelve species belong to the monophyletic true foxes group of genus Vulpes . Approximately another 25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes ; these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes , or of the outlying group , which consists of bat-eared fox , gray fox , and island fox . Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica . By far the most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ) with about 47 recognized subspecies . The global distribution of foxes , together with their widespread reputation for cunning , has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world . The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds , long an established pursuit in Europe , especially in the British Isles , was exported by European settlers to various parts of the New World .",
  "/wiki/Porcupine": "Porcupines are large rodents with coats of sharp spines , or quills , that protect them against predators . The term covers two families of animals : the Old World porcupines of family Hystricidae , and the New World porcupines of family Erethizontidae . Both families belong to the infraorder Hystricognathi within the profoundly diverse order Rodentia and display superficially similar coats of quills : despite this , the two groups are distinct from each other and are not closely related to each other within the Hystricognathi . The Old World porcupines live in southern Europe , Asia ( western and southern ) , and most of Africa . They are large , terrestrial , and strictly nocturnal . In taxonomic terms , they form the family Hystricidae . The New World porcupines are indigenous to North America and northern South America . They live in wooded areas and can climb trees , where some species spend their entire lives . They are less strictly nocturnal than their Old World relatives , and generally smaller . In taxonomic terms , they form the family Erethizontidae . Most porcupines are about 60-90 cm ( 25-36 in ) long , with a 20-25 cm ( 8-10 in ) long tail . [ dubious - discuss ] Weighing 5-16 kg ( 12-35 lb ) , they are rounded , large , and slow , and use aposematic strategy of defence .",
  "/wiki/Flying_squirrel": "Flying squirrels ( scientifically known as Pteromyini or Petauristini ) are a tribe of 50 species of squirrels in the family Sciuridae . They are not capable of flight in the same way as birds or bats but are able to glide from one tree to another with the aid of a patagium , a furry , parachute-like membrane that stretches from wrist to ankle . Their long tail provides stability in flight . Anatomically they are very similar to other squirrels but have a number of adaptations to suit their life style ; their limb bones are longer and their hand , foot bones and distal vertebrae are shorter . Flying squirrels are able to steer and exert control over their glide path with their limbs and tail . Molecular studies have shown that flying squirrels are monophyletic and originated some 18-20 million years ago . Most are nocturnal and omnivorous , eating fruit , seeds , buds , flowers , insects , gastropods , spiders , fungi , bird 's eggs and tree sap . The young are born in a nest and are at first naked and helpless . They are cared for by their mother and by five weeks are able to practice gliding skills so that by ten weeks they are ready to leave the nest . Some captive-bred southern flying squirrels have become domesticated as small household pets , a type of pocket pet .",
  "/wiki/Mouse_deer": "Chevrotains , also known as mouse-deer , are small ungulates that make up the family Tragulidae , the only extant members of the infraorder Tragulina . The 10 extant species are placed in three genera , but several species also are known only from fossils . The extant species are found in forests in South and Southeast Asia , with a single species in the rainforests of Central and West Africa . They are solitary or live in pairs , and feed almost exclusively on plant material . Chevrotains are the smallest hoofed mammals in the world . The Asian species weigh between 0.7 and 8.0 kg ( 1.5 and 17.6 lb ) , while the African chevrotain is considerably larger at 7-16 kg ( 15-35 lb ) .

  "/wiki/Mandla_Plant_Fossils_National_Park": "Dindori Plant Fossils National Park is situated in Dindori district of Madhya Pradesh in India . This national park has plants in fossil form that existed in India anywhere between 40 million and 150 million years ago spread over seven villages of Dindori District ( Ghuguwa , Umaria , Deorakhurd , Barbaspur , Chanti-hills , Chargaon and Deori Kohani ) . The Dindori Plant Fossils National Park is an area that spreads over 274,100 square metres . Such fossils are found in three other villages of the district also , but they lie outside the national park . The Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany , Lucknow , has done some work on the plant fossils of Mandla , though the study is yet in a preliminary stage . In Ghuguwa and Umaria the standing , petrified trunks of trees have been identified as Gymnosperms and Angiosperms- Monocotyledons and palms . There are certain Bryophytes also . There is some question about whether the fossils are from the late Jurassic or the early and mid Cretaceous age . This is because when the breakup of the single land mass , Pangaea occurred , it was split by the continental drift into Laurasia and Gondwana somewhere between the Jurassic and Cretaceous ages . India formed a part of Gondwana . Depending on the age in which the split occurred , the fossils are either Jurassic or Cretaceous . Interspersed with the plant fossils are to be found the fossils of molluscs ."
