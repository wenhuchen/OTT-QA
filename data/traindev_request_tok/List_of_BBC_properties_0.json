North Acton , West Acton , East Acton , South Acton , Acton Green , Acton Town , Acton Vale and Acton Central are all parts of Acton . Acton means oak farm or farm by oak trees , and is derived from the Old English \u0101c ( oak ) and t\u016bn ( farm ) . Originally an ancient village , as London expanded , Acton was absorbed into the city . Since 1965 , Acton equates to the east of the London Borough of Ealing , though some of East Acton is in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham and a small portion of South Acton is in the London Borough of Hounslow . Acton and Harrow are the two locations with the most stations bearing their name anywhere in the United Kingdom ( apart from the full names of the London terminus stations ) , with seven each . [ citation needed ] Central Acton is synonymous with the hub of commerce and retail on the former main road between London and Oxford ( the Uxbridge Road ) ; a reminder of its history is in its inns , which date back in cases to the late Tudor period as stopping places for travellers . Nowadays , the principal route linking London and Oxford ( the A40 dual carriageway ) bypasses central Acton , but passes through East Acton and North Acton .",

  "/wiki/BBC_Symphony_Orchestra": "The BBC Symphony Orchestra ( BBC SO ) is a British orchestra based in London . Founded in 1930 , it was the first permanent salaried orchestra in London , and is the only one of the city 's five major symphony orchestras not to be self-governing . The BBC SO is the principal broadcast orchestra of the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) . The orchestra was originally conceived in 1928 as a joint enterprise by the BBC and the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham , but the latter withdrew the next year ; and the task of assembling and training the orchestra fell to the BBC 's director of music , Adrian Boult . Among its guest conductors in its first years was Arturo Toscanini , who judged it the finest orchestra he had ever conducted . During and after the Second World War , Boult strove to maintain standards , but the senior management of the post-war BBC did not allocate the orchestra the resources to meet competition from new and well-funded rivals . After Boult 's retirement from the BBC in 1950 , the orchestra went through a fallow period . Boult 's successor , Sir Malcolm Sargent , was popular with the public but had poor rapport with his players , and orchestral morale dropped . Sargent 's successor , Rudolf Schwarz , made little public impact , and although the BBC appointed high-profile chief conductors in the 1960s and 1970s - Antal Dor\u00e1ti , Colin Davis , Pierre Boulez and Gennady Rozhdestvensky - the BBC SO remained underfunded and could not attract enough good players to rival the leading London orchestras . As a result of initiatives begun in the 1960s by the BBC controller of music William Glock , performing standards gradually began to rise . Under Andrew Davis in the 1990s and Ji\u0159\u00ed B\u011blohl\u00e1vek in the 2000s the orchestra prospered . By the second decade of the 21st century the BBC SO was once again regarded by critics as of first-class status .",

ITV is the oldest commercial network in the UK . Since the passing of the Broadcasting Act 1990 , its legal name has been Channel 3 , to distinguish it from the other analogue channels at the time , namely BBC 1 , BBC 2 and Channel 4 . In part , the number 3 was assigned because television sets would usually be tuned so that the regional ITV station would be on the third button , with the other stations being allocated to the number within their name . ITV is a network of television companies that operate regional television services and also share programmes between each other to be shown on the entire network . In recent years , several of these companies have merged , so currently the fifteen regional franchises are in the hands of two companies . The ITV network is to be distinguished from ITV plc , the company that resulted from the merger of Granada plc and Carlton Communications in 2004 and which holds the Channel 3 broadcasting licences in England , Wales , southern Scotland , the Isle of Man , the Channel Islands and Northern Ireland . With the exception of Northern Ireland , the ITV brand is the brand used by ITV plc for the Channel 3 service in these areas . In Northern Ireland , ITV plc uses the brand name UTV .
