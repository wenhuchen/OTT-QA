  "/wiki/Country": "The term country refers to a political state or nation or its territory . It is often referred to as the land of an individual 's birth , residence , or citizenship . A country may be an independent sovereign state or part of a larger state , as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division , a physical territory with a government , or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics . It is not inherently sovereign . Countries can refer both to sovereign states and to other political entities , while other times it can refer only to states . For example , the CIA World Factbook uses the word in its Country name field to refer to a wide variety of dependencies , areas of special sovereignty , uninhabited islands , and other entities in addition to the traditional countries or independent states . [ Note 1 ] The largest country in the world is Russia , while the most populated is China . The newest country is South Sudan .",
  "/wiki/Territory_(country_subdivision)": "A territory is an administrative division , usually an area that is under the jurisdiction of a state . In most countries , a territory is an organized division of an area that is controlled by a country but is not formally developed into , or incorporated into , a political unit of the country that is of equal status to other political units that may often be referred to by words such as provinces or states . In international politics , a territory is usually either the total area from which a state may extract power resources or any non-sovereign geographic area which has come under the authority of another government ; which has not been granted the powers of self-government normally devolved to secondary territorial divisions ; or both .",
  "/wiki/Flag": "A flag is a piece of fabric ( most often rectangular or quadrilateral ) with a distinctive design and colours . It is used as a symbol , a signalling device , or for decoration . The term flag is also used to refer to the graphic design employed , and flags have evolved into a general tool for rudimentary signalling and identification , especially in environments where communication is challenging ( such as the maritime environment , where semaphore is used ) . The study of flags is known as vexillology from the Latin vexillum , meaning flag . National flags are patriotic symbols with widely varied interpretations that often include strong military associations because of their original and ongoing use for that purpose . Flags are also used in messaging , advertising , or for decorative purposes . Some military units are called flags after their use of flags . A flag ( Arabic : \u0644\u0648\u0627\u0621 ) is equivalent to a brigade in Arab countries . In Spain , a flag ( Spanish : bandera ) is a battalion-equivalent in the Spanish Legion .",

  "/wiki/Capital_(political)": "A capital or capital city is the municipality exercising primary status in a country , state , province , or other administrative region , usually as its seat of government . A capital is typically a city that physically encompasses the government 's offices and meeting places ; the status as capital is often designated by its law or constitution . In some jurisdictions , including several countries , the different branches of government are located in different settlements . In some cases , a distinction is made between the official ( constitutional ) capital and the seat of government , which is in another place . Capital cities that also serve as the prime economic , population , cultural , or intellectual centres of a nation or an empire are sometimes referred to as primate cities . Examples are Athens , Bangkok , Brussels , Copenhagen , Cairo , London , Mexico City , Paris , Lima , Seoul and Tokyo . News media often use the name of a capital city as an alternative name for the country of which it is the capital or of the government that is seated there , as a form of metonymy . For example , relations between Washington and London refer to relations between the United States and the United Kingdom .",

Guatemala attained independence in 1821 as part of the Federal Republic of Central America , which dissolved by 1841 . From the mid- to late-19th century , Guatemala experienced chronic instability and civil strife . Beginning in the early 20th century , it was ruled by a series of dictators backed by the United Fruit Company and the United States government . In 1944 , the authoritarian leader Jorge Ubico was overthrown by a pro-democratic military coup , initiating a decade-long revolution that led to sweeping social and economic reforms . A U.S.-backed military coup in 1954 ended the revolution and installed a dictatorship . From 1960 to 1996 , Guatemala endured a bloody civil war fought between the US-backed government and leftist rebels , including genocidal massacres of the Maya population perpetrated by the military .

It is bordered on the northeast by Honduras , on the northwest by Guatemala , and on the south by the Pacific Ocean . El Salvador 's capital and largest city is San Salvador . As of 2018 [ update ] , the country had a population of approximately 6.42 million . El Salvador was for centuries inhabited by several Mesoamerican nations , especially the Cuzcatlecs , as well as the Lenca and Maya . In the early 16th century , the Spanish Empire conquered the territory , incorporating it into the Viceroyalty of New Spain ruled from Mexico City . However the Viceroyalty of Mexico had little or no influence in the daily affairs of the Central American isthmus , which would be colonized in 1524 . In 1609 the area became the Captaincy General of Guatemala , from which El Salvador was part of until its independence from Spain , which took place in 1821 , as part of the First Mexican Empire , then further seceded , as part of the Federal Republic of Central America , in 1823 . When the Republic dissolved in 1841 , El Salvador became a sovereign nation , then formed a short-lived union with Honduras and Nicaragua called the Greater Republic of Central America , which lasted from 1895 to 1898 . From the late 19th to the mid-20th century , El Salvador endured chronic political and economic instability characterized by coups , revolts , and a succession of authoritarian rulers . Persistent socioeconomic inequality and civil unrest culminated in the devastating Salvadoran Civil War ( 1979-1992 ) , which was fought between the military-led government and a coalition of left-wing guerrilla groups .
