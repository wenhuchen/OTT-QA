  "/wiki/Nativity_of_Mary": "The Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary , the Nativity of Mary , or the Birth of the Virgin Mary , refers to a Christian feast day celebrating the birth of Mary , mother of Jesus . The modern canon of scripture does not record Mary 's birth . The earliest known account of Mary 's birth is found in the Protoevangelium of James ( 5:2 ) , an apocryphal text from the late second century , with her parents known as Saint Anne and Saint Joachim . In the case of saints , the Church commemorates their date of death , with Saint John the Baptist and the Virgin Mary as the few whose birth dates are commemorated . The reason for this is found in the singular mission each had in salvation history , but traditionally also because these alone were holy in their very birth ( for Mary , see Immaculate Conception ; John was sanctified in Saint Elizabeth 's womb according to the traditional interpretation of Lk 1:15 ) . Devotion to the innocence of Mary under this Marian title is widely celebrated in many cultures across globe .",

  "/wiki/Trinity": "The Christian doctrine of the Trinity ( Latin : Trinitas , lit .

The three persons are distinct , yet are one substance , essence or nature ( homoousios ) . In this context , a nature is what one is , whereas a person is who one is . The subset of Christianity that accepts this doctrine is collectively known as trinitarianism , while the subset that does n't is referred to as nontrinitarian . Trinitarianism contrasts with positions such as Binitarianism ( one deity in two persons ) and Monarchianism ( no plurality of persons within God ) , of which Modalistic Monarchianism ( one deity revealed in three modes ) and Unitarianism ( one deity in one person ) are subsets . While the developed doctrine of the Trinity is not explicit in the books that constitute the New Testament , the New Testament possesses a triadic understanding of God and contains a number of Trinitarian formulas . The doctrine of the Trinity was first formulated among the fathers of the Church as early Christians attempted to rationalize the relationship between Jesus and God in their scriptural documents and prior traditions .",

Perspectives on Joseph as a historical figure are distinguished by some persons from a theological reading of the Gospel texts . Joseph is venerated as Saint Joseph in the Catholic Church , Orthodox Church , Oriental Orthodox Church , Anglicanism and Lutheranism . In Catholic traditions , Joseph is regarded as the patron saint of workers and is associated with various feast days . Pope Pius IX declared him to be both the patron and the protector of the Catholic Church , in addition to his patronages of the sick and of a happy death , due to the belief that he died in the presence of Jesus and Mary . In popular piety , Joseph is regarded as a model for fathers and has also become patron of various dioceses and places . Several venerated images of Saint Joseph have been granted a canonical coronation by a pope . In popular religious iconography he is associated with lilies or a spikenard . With the present-day growth of Mariology , the theological field of Josephology has also grown and since the 1950s centers for studying it have been formed .",

Some sources say it is a corruption of the French description of the clay ( glaise ) water ( eau ) , whereas others say it comes from a Native American word meaning 'fallen timbers ' . Another weak possibility according to Lakehistory.info is that it could have been the French term la glace [ *aux glaces ? ] , which means 'mirror ' , or 'ice ' [ 'at the ices ' ? ] . There is something to be said for the unattested eau glaise 'clay water ' ( as if 'dirty water ' ) , like attested terre glaise 'clay soil ' , but both Ramsey and Stewart agree that Auglaize ( and variants , implying *aux glaises ) is American French for 'at the lick ( s ) ' , literally 'at the clays ' , where wild beasts came to lick salt and minerals from the soil , and fulfilling the lacuna in standard French for a salt lick .

Known as the Apostle of Ireland , he is the primary patron saint of Ireland , the other patron saints being Brigit of Kildare and Columba . He is venerated in the Catholic Church , the Anglican Communion , the Lutheran Churches , the Old Catholic Church , and in the Eastern Orthodox Church as equal-to-the-apostles and Enlightener of Ireland . The dates of Patrick 's life can not be fixed with certainty , but there is broad agreement that he was active as a missionary in Ireland during the fifth century . Nevertheless , as the most recent biography on Patrick shows , a late fourth-century date for the saint is not impossible . Early medieval tradition credits him with being the first bishop of Armagh and Primate of Ireland , and regards him as the founder of Christianity in Ireland , converting a society practising a form of Celtic polytheism . He has been generally so regarded ever since , despite evidence of some earlier Christian presence in Ireland . According to the autobiographical Confessio of Patrick , when he was about 16 , he was captured by Irish pirates from his home in Britain and taken as a slave to Ireland , looking after animals ; he lived there for six years before escaping and returning to his family . After becoming a cleric , he returned to northern and western Ireland . In later life , he served as a bishop , but little is known about the places where he worked .

When used for the prayer , the word is usually capitalized ( the Rosary ) , as is customary for other names of prayers , such as the Lord 's Prayer , and the Hail Mary ; when referring to the beads , it is written with a lower-case initial letter ( a rosary bead ) . The prayers that comprise the Rosary are arranged in sets of ten Hail Marys , called decades . Each decade is preceded by one Lord 's Prayer ( Our Father ) and traditionally followed by only one Glory Be , but now commonly following that , per request of Our Lady of Fatima , the Fatima Prayer ( O my Jesus ) . During recitation of each set , thought is given to one of the Mysteries of the Rosary , which recall events in the lives of Jesus and Mary . Five decades are recited per rosary . Other prayers are sometimes added before or after each decade . Rosary beads are an aid towards saying these prayers in the proper sequence . A standard 15 Mysteries of the Rosary , based on the long-standing custom , was established by Pope Pius V during the 16th century , grouping the mysteries in three sets : the Joyful Mysteries , the Sorrowful Mysteries , and the Glorious Mysteries .

He is called a prophet by all of these faiths , and is honored as a saint in many Christian traditions . According to the New Testament , John anticipated a messianic figure greater than himself , and the Gospels portray John as the precursor or forerunner of Jesus , since John announces Jesus ' coming and prepares the people for Jesus ' ministry . Jesus himself identifies John as Elijah who is to come , which some biblical scholars interpret to mean that Jesus believed that John was the reincarnation of the Old Testament prophet Elijah , although John the Baptist in the Gospel of John explicitly denies being linked to Elijah ( John 1:21 ) . According to the New Testament , John the Baptist and Jesus of Nazareth were relatives . Some scholars maintain that John belonged to the Essenes , a semi-ascetic Judaic sect who expected a Hebrew messiah and who practiced ritual baptism . John used baptism as the central symbol or sacrament of his pre-messianic movement . Most scholars agree that John baptized Jesus , and several New Testament accounts report that some of Jesus ' early followers had previously been followers of John .

  "/wiki/Blessed_Virgin_Mary_(Roman_Catholic)": "In the Catholic Church , the veneration of Mary , mother of Jesus , encompasses various Marian devotions which include prayer , pious acts , visual arts , poetry , and music devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary . Popes have encouraged it , while also taking steps to reform some manifestations of it . [ note 1 ] The Holy See has insisted on the importance of distinguishing true from false devotion , and authentic doctrine from its deformations by excess or defect . There are significantly more titles , feasts , and venerative Marian practices among Roman Catholics than in other Western Christian traditions . The term hyperdulia indicates the special veneration due to Mary , greater than the ordinary dulia for other saints , but utterly unlike the latria due only to God . Belief in the incarnation of God the Son through Mary is the basis for calling her the Mother of God , which was declared a dogma at the Council of Ephesus in 431 . At the Second Vatican Council and in Pope John Paul II 's encyclical Redemptoris mater , she is spoken of also as Mother of the Church . Growth of Roman Catholic veneration of Mary and Mariology has often come not from official declarations , but from Marian writings of the saints , popular devotion , and at times reported Marian apparitions . The Holy See approves only a select few as worthy of belief , the most recent being the 2008 approval of certain apparitions from 1665 . Further pious veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary encouraged by Popes are exhibited in the canonical coronations granted to popular Marian images venerated in a particular locality all over the world , while Marian movements and societies with millions of members have arisen from belief in events such as Akita , F\u00e1tima , and Lourdes , and other reasons .",

The popularization of this devotion in its modern form is derived from a Catholic nun from France , Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque , who said she learned the devotion from Jesus during a series of apparitions to her between 1673 and 1675 , and later , in the 19th century , from the mystical revelations of another Catholic nun in Portugal , Blessed Mary of the Divine Heart , a religious of the Good Shepherd , who requested in the name of Christ that Pope Leo XIII consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus . Predecessors to the modern devotion arose unmistakably in the Middle Ages in various facets of Catholic mysticism , particularly with Saint Gertrude the Great .",

He was the bishop of Hippo Regius in North Africa and is viewed as one of the most important Church Fathers of the Latin Church for his writings in the Patristic Period . Among his most important works are The City of God , De doctrina Christiana , and Confessions . According to his contemporary , Jerome , Augustine established anew the ancient Faith . [ a ] In his youth he was drawn to Manichaeism and later to neoplatonism . After his baptism and conversion to Christianity in 386 , Augustine developed his own approach to philosophy and theology , accommodating a variety of methods and perspectives . Believing that the grace of Christ was indispensable to human freedom , he helped formulate the doctrine of original sin and made seminal contributions to the development of just war theory . When the Western Roman Empire began to disintegrate , Augustine imagined the Church as a spiritual City of God , distinct from the material Earthly City . His thoughts profoundly influenced the medieval worldview . The segment of the Church that adhered to the concept of the Trinity as defined by the Council of Nicaea and the Council of Constantinople closely identified with Augustine 's On the Trinity . Augustine is recognized as a saint in the Catholic Churches , the Eastern Orthodox Church , and the Anglican Communion and as a preeminent Doctor of the Church .
