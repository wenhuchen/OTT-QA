  "/wiki/Deal_Castle": "Deal Castle is an artillery fort constructed by Henry VIII in Deal , Kent , between 1539 and 1540 . It formed part of the King 's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire and defended the strategically important Downs anchorage off the English coast . Comprising a keep with six inner and outer bastions , the moated stone castle covered 0.85 acres ( 0.34 ha ) and had sixty-six firing positions for artillery . It cost the Crown a total of \u00a327,092 to build the three castles of Deal , Sandown and Walmer , which lay adjacent to one another along the coast and were connected by earthwork defences . [ a ] The original invasion threat passed but , during the Second English Civil War of 1648-49 , Deal was seized by pro-Royalist insurgents and was only retaken by Parliamentary forces after several months ' fighting . Although it remained armed , Deal was adapted by Sir John Norris and Lord Carrington during the 18th and 19th centuries to form a more suitable private house for the castle 's captain , which was by now an honorary position . In 1904 , the War Office concluded that the castle no longer had any value either as a defensive site or as a barracks and it was opened to the public when the captain was not in residence . Early in the Second World War , the captain 's quarters were destroyed by German bombing , forcing Deal 's then-captain , William Birdwood , to move to Hampton Court Palace and the castle became an observation post for an artillery battery placed along the shore line . The castle was not brought back into use as a residence and was restored by the government during the 1950s to form a tourist attraction . In the 21st century , Deal Castle is operated by English Heritage , receiving 25,256 visitors in 2008 .",
  "/wiki/Device_Fort": "The Device Forts , also known as Henrician castles and blockhouses , were a series of artillery fortifications built to defend the coast of England and Wales by Henry VIII . [ a ] Traditionally , the Crown had left coastal defences in the hands of local lords and communities but the threat of French and Spanish invasion led the King to issue an order , called a device , for a major programme of work between 1539 and 1547 . The fortifications ranged from large stone castles positioned to protect the Downs anchorage in Kent , to small blockhouses overlooking the entrance to Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire , and earthwork bulwarks along the Essex coast . Some forts operated independently , others were designed to be mutually reinforcing . The Device programme was hugely expensive , costing a total of \u00a3376,000 ( estimated as between \u00a32 and \u00a382 million in today 's money ) ; [ b ] much of this was raised from the proceeds of the Dissolution of the Monasteries a few years before . These utilitarian fortifications were armed with artillery , intended to be used against enemy ships before they could land forces or attack ships lying in harbour . The first wave of work between 1539 and 1543 was characterised by the use of circular bastions and multi-tiered defences , combined with many traditional medieval features . These designs contained serious military flaws , however , and the second period of construction until 1547 saw the introduction of angular bastions and other innovations probably inspired by contemporary thinking in mainland Europe . The castles were commanded by captains appointed by the Crown , overseeing small garrisons of professional gunners and soldiers , who would be supplemented by the local militia in an emergency . Despite a French raid against the Isle of Wight in 1545 , the Device Forts saw almost no action before peace was declared in 1546 . Some of the defences were left to deteriorate and were decommissioned only a few years after their construction . After war broke out with Spain in 1569 , Elizabeth I improved many of the remaining fortifications , including during the attack of the Spanish Armada of 1588 .",

  "/wiki/Castle": "A castle is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages predominantly by the nobility or royalty and by military orders . Scholars debate the scope of the word castle , but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble . This is distinct from a palace , which is not fortified ; from a fortress , which was not always a residence for royalty or nobility ; and from a fortified settlement , which was a public defence - though there are many similarities among these types of construction . Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses . Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built , they took on a great many forms with many different features , although some , such as curtain walls , arrowslits , and portcullises , were commonplace . European-style castles originated in the 9th and 10th centuries , after the fall of the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes . These nobles built castles to control the area immediately surrounding them and the castles were both offensive and defensive structures ; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as offered protection from enemies . Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies , the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power . Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes , and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community , such as mills , fertile land , or a water source . Many northern European castles were originally built from earth and timber , but had their defences replaced later by stone . Early castles often exploited natural defences , lacking features such as towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep . In the late 12th and early 13th centuries , a scientific approach to castle defence emerged .",

  "/wiki/Martello_Tower": "Martello towers , sometimes known simply as Martellos , are small defensive forts that were built across the British Empire during the 19th century , from the time of the French Revolutionary Wars onwards . Most were coastal forts . They stand up to 40 feet ( 12 m ) high ( with two floors ) and typically had a garrison of one officer and 15-25 men . Their round structure and thick walls of solid masonry made them resistant to cannon fire , while their height made them an ideal platform for a single heavy artillery piece , mounted on the flat roof and able to traverse , and hence fire , over a complete 360\u00b0 circle . A few towers had moats or other batteries and works attached for extra defence . The Martello towers were used during the first half of the 19th century , but became obsolete with the introduction of powerful rifled artillery . Many have survived to the present day , often preserved as historic monuments . In the second half of the 19th century , during the premiership of Lord Palmerston , there was another spate of tower and fort building . The Palmerston Forts are also circular in design and resemble Martello towers .",
  "/wiki/Eynsford_Castle": "Eynsford Castle is a ruined medieval fortification in Eynsford , Kent . Built on the site of an earlier Anglo-Saxon stone burh , the castle was constructed by William de Enysford , probably between 1085 and 1087 , to protect the lands of Lanfranc , the Archbishop of Canterbury , from Odo , the Bishop of Bayeux . It comprised an inner and an outer bailey , the former protected by a stone curtain wall . In 1130 the defences were improved , and a large stone hall built in the inner bailey . The de Enysford family held the castle until their male line died out in 1261 , when it was divided equally between the Heringaud and de Criol families . A royal judge , William Inge , purchased half of the castle in 1307 , and arguments ensued between him and his co-owner , Nicholas de Criol , who ransacked Eynsford in 1312 . The castle was never reoccupied and fell into ruins , and in the 18th century it was used to hold hunting kennels and stables . The ruins began to be restored after 1897 , work intensifying after 1948 when the Ministry of Works took over the running of the castle . In the 21st century , Eynsford Castle is managed by English Heritage and is open to visitors .",

  "/wiki/Chapel": "A chapel is a Christian place of prayer and worship that is usually relatively small , and is distinguished from a church . The term has several senses . Firstly , smaller spaces inside a church that have their own altar are often called chapels ; the Lady chapel is a common type of these . Secondly , a chapel is a place of worship , sometimes non-denominational , that is part of a building or complex with some other main purpose , such as a school , college , hospital , palace or large aristocratic house , castle , barracks , prison , funeral home , cemetery , airport , or a military or commercial ship . Thirdly , chapels are small places of worship , built as satellite sites by a church or monastery , for example in remote areas ; these are often called a chapel of ease . A feature of all these types is that often no clergy were permanently resident or specifically attached to the chapel . Finally , for historical reasons , chapel is also often the term used for independent or nonconformist places of worship in Great Britain - outside the established church , even where in practice they operate as a parish church . The earliest Christian places of worship are now often referred to as chapels , as they were not dedicated buildings but rather a dedicated chamber within a building . Most larger churches had one or more secondary altars which , if they occupied a distinct space , would often be called a chapel . In Russian Orthodox tradition , the chapels were built underneath city gates , where most people could visit them . The most famous example is the Iberian Chapel . Although chapels frequently refer to Christian places of worship , they are also commonly found in Jewish synagogues and do not necessarily denote a specific denomination .",

  "/wiki/Kit's_Coty_House": "Kit 's Coty House or Kit 's Coty is a chambered long barrow near the village of Aylesford in the southeastern English county of Kent . Constructed circa 4000 BCE , during the Early Neolithic period of British prehistory , today it survives in a ruined state . Archaeologists have established that the monument was built by pastoralist communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to Britain from continental Europe . Although representing part of an architectural tradition of long barrow building that was widespread across Neolithic Europe , Kit 's Coty House belongs to a localised regional variant of barrows produced in the vicinity of the River Medway , now known as the Medway Megaliths . Of these , it lies near to both Little Kit 's Coty House and the Coffin Stone on the eastern side of the river . Three further surviving long barrows , Addington Long Barrow , Chestnuts Long Barrow , and Coldrum Long Barrow , are located west of the Medway . They were among the first ancient British remains to be protected by the state , on the advice of General Augustus Pitt-Rivers , the first Inspector of Ancient Monuments . The site is now under the ownership of non-departmental public body English Heritage , and is open to visitors all year round . Kit 's Coty can be reached on foot along a track that appears at the junction where the Pilgrim 's Way and Rochester Road meet . The chamber is encircled by iron railings . It lies approximately 2 kilometres north of another of the Medway Megaliths , Little Kit 's Coty House . The name Kits Coty allegedly means Tomb in the Forest according to signs at the site , possibly related to the Ancient British *kaitom , later *keiton , meaning forest .",
  "/wiki/Megalithic_tomb": "A megalith is a large stone that has been used to construct a structure or monument , either alone or together with other stones . The adjective megalithic describes structures made of such large stones without the use of mortar [ citation needed ] or concrete , as well as the periods of prehistory characterised by such constructions . There are over 35,000 megaliths in Europe alone , ranging from Sweden to the Mediterranean sea The word was first used in 1849 by the British antiquarian Algernon Herbert in reference to Stonehenge and derives from the Ancient Greek \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 ( transliteration m\u00e9gas , meaning great ) and \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 ( transliteration l\u00edthos meaning stone ) .

The division lasted until the transitional period of the Chalcolithic from about 6,500 years ago ( 4500 BC ) , marked by the development of metallurgy , leading up to the Bronze Age and Iron Age . In Northern Europe , the Neolithic lasted until about 1700 BC , while in China it extended until 1200 BC . Other parts of the world ( including the New World ) remained broadly in the Neolithic stage of development until European contact . The Neolithic comprises a progression of behavioral and cultural characteristics and changes , including the use of wild and domestic crops and of domesticated animals .

  "/wiki/Church_(building)": "A church building or church house , often simply called a church , is a building used for Christian religious activities , particularly for Christian worship services . The term is often used by Christians to refer to the physical buildings where they worship , but it is sometimes used ( by analogy ) to refer to buildings of other religions . In traditional Christian architecture , a church interior is often structured in the shape of a Christian cross . When viewed from plan view the vertical beam of the cross is represented by the center aisle and seating while the horizontal beam and junction of the cross is formed by the bema and altar . Towers or domes are often added with the intention of directing the eye of the viewer towards the heavens and inspiring a range of thoughts and emotions in visitors and worshippers . Modern church buildings have a variety of architectural styles and layouts ; many buildings that were designed for other purposes have now been converted for church use , and , conversely , many original church buildings have been put to other uses . The earliest identified Christian church building was a house church founded between 233 and 256 . From the 11th through the 14th centuries , a wave of building of cathedrals and smaller parish churches were erected across Western Europe . A cathedral is a church building , usually Roman Catholic , Protestant ( including Anglican ) , Eastern Orthodox , or Oriental Orthodox , housing a cathedra , the formal name for the seat or throne of a presiding bishop .",
  "/wiki/Countless_Stones": "The countless stones is a motif that appears in English and Welsh folklore . It is associated with various megalithic monuments , including chambered long barrows from the Early Neolithic and the stones circles of the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age . The motif holds that an individual attempting to count the number of stones in the monument will be unable to do so . The earliest textual accounts of the story date from the late sixteenth century , where it is linked to the stone circle of Stonehenge in Wiltshire . Multiple sources from the seventeenth-century also link the story to Stonehenge , although also apply it to The Hurlers in Cornwall and Long Meg and Her Daughters in Cumberland . The countless stones motif was the subject of a study by folklorist S. F. Menefee , published in the Folklore journal in 1975 , and was part of Leslie Grinsell 's catalogue of folkloric motifs associated with prehistoric sites in Britain .",
  "/wiki/Lullingstone_Roman_Villa": "Lullingstone Roman Villa is a villa built during the Roman occupation of Britain , situated near the village of Eynsford in Kent , south eastern England . Constructed in the 1st century , perhaps around A. D. 80-90 , the house was repeatedly expanded and occupied until it was destroyed by fire in the 5th century . The occupants were wealthy Romans or native Britons who had adopted Roman customs . Some evidence found on site suggests that about A. D. 150 , the villa was considerably enlarged and may have been used as the country retreat of the governors of the Roman province of Britannia . Two sculpted marble busts found in the cellar may be those of Pertinax , governor in 185-186 , and his father-in-law , Publius Helvius Successus . In the 4th century a room , probably already in religious use , was converted to a Christian chapel or house church , much the earliest known in the British Isles . In the Anglo-Saxon period , the ruins of a Roman temple-mausoleum on the site of the villa were incorporated into a Christian chapel ( Lullingstane Chapel ) that was extant at the time of the Norman Conquest , one of the earliest known chapels in the country .

  "/wiki/Hospice": "Hospice care is a type of health care that focuses on the palliation of a terminally ill patient 's pain and symptoms and attending to their emotional and spiritual needs . Hospice care has a palliative focus without curative intent . Usually , it is used for people with no further options for curing their disease or in people who have decided not to pursue further options that are arduous , likely to cause more symptoms , and not likely to succeed . In the United States , the term is largely defined by the practices of the Medicare system and other health insurance providers , which cover inpatient or at home hospice care to terminal patients who are medically certified to have less than six months to live . Hospice care under the Medicare Hospice Benefit requires that two physicians certify that a person has less than six months to live if the disease follows its usual course . According to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization ( NHPCO ) 2012 report on facts and figures of hospice care , 66.4% received at-home care and 26.1% in an inpatient facility . In the late 1970s , the U.S. government began to view hospice care as a humane care option for the terminally ill . In 1982 , Congress initiated the creation of the Medicare Hospice Benefit , which became permanent in 1986 . In 1993 , President Clinton installed hospice as a guaranteed benefit and an accepted component of health care provisions . Outside the United States , the term tends to be primarily associated with the particular buildings or institutions that specialize in such care ( although hospice at home services may also be available ) .

  "/wiki/Chantry_chapel": "A chantry may refer to one of two meanings of the term . Firstly , it could mean the prayers and liturgy in the Christian church reserved for the dead as part of the search for atonement for sins committed during their life . It might include the mass and by extension , the endowment left for the purpose of the continuance of prayers and liturgy . It could be called a type of trust fund established during the pre-Reformation medieval era in England for the purpose of employing one or more priests to sing a stipulated number of services for the benefit of the soul of a specified deceased person , usually the donor who had established the chantry in his will . There could be a stipulated period of time immediately following her/his death . It was believed such masses might help atone for misdeeds and with mercy enable the soul to be granted eternal peace in the presence of God . Chantries were commonly established in England and were endowed with lands , rents from specified properties and other assets by the donor , usually in his will . The income from these assets maintained the chantry priest . Alternatively , a chantry chapel is a building on private land or a dedicated area or altar within a parish church or cathedral , set aside or built especially for the performance of the chantry duties by the priest . A chantry may occupy a single altar , for example in the side aisle of a church , rather than an enclosed chapel within a larger church , generally dedicated to the donor 's favourite saint . Many chantry altars became richly endowed , often with gold furnishings and valuable vestments . Over the centuries , chantries increased in embellishments , often by attracting new donors and chantry priests .",

  "/wiki/St_Mary's_Church,_Reculver": "St Mary 's Church , Reculver , was founded in the 7th century as either a minster or a monastery on the site of a Roman fort at Reculver , which was then at the north-eastern extremity of Kent in south-eastern England . In 669 , the site of the fort was given for this purpose by King Ecgberht of Kent to a priest named Bassa , beginning a connection with Kentish kings that led to King Eadberht II of Kent being buried there in the 760s , and the church becoming very wealthy by the beginning of the 9th century . From the early 9th century to the 11th the church was treated as essentially a piece of property , with control passing between kings of Mercia , Wessex and England and the archbishops of Canterbury . Viking attacks may have extinguished the church 's religious community in the 9th century , although an early 11th-century record indicates that the church was then in the hands of a dean accompanied by monks . By the time of Domesday Book , completed in 1086 , St Mary 's was serving as a parish church . The original building , which incorporated stone and tiles scavenged from the Roman fort , was a simple one consisting only of a nave and an apsidal chancel , with a small room , or porticus , built out from each of the church 's northern and southern sides where the nave and chancel met . The church was much altered and expanded during the Middle Ages , including the addition of twin towers in the 12th century ; the last addition , in the 15th century , was of north and south porches leading into the nave . This expansion coincided with a long period of prosperity for the settlement of Reculver : the settlement 's decline led to the church 's decay and , following unsuccessful attempts to prevent the erosion of the adjacent coastline , the building was almost completely demolished in 1809 . The church 's remains were preserved by the intervention of Trinity House in 1810 , since the towers had long been important as a landmark for shipping : preservation was achieved through the first effective effort to protect the cliff on which the church then stood from further erosion . Some materials from the structure were incorporated into a replacement church , also dedicated to St Mary , built at Hillborough in the same parish . Much of the rest was used for the building of a new harbour wall at Margate , known as Margate Pier . Other , surviving remnants include fragments of a high cross of stone that once stood inside the church , and two stone columns from a triple arch between the nave and chancel : the columns formed part of the original church and were still in place when demolition began .",

  "/wiki/High_cross": "A high cross or standing cross ( Irish : cros ard / ardchros , Scottish Gaelic : crois \u00e0rd / \u00e0rd-chrois , Welsh : croes uchel / croes eglwysig ) is a free-standing Christian cross made of stone and often richly decorated . There was a unique Early Medieval tradition in Ireland and Britain of raising large sculpted stone crosses , usually outdoors . These probably developed from earlier traditions using wood , perhaps with metalwork attachments , and earlier pagan Celtic memorial stones ; the Pictish stones of Scotland may also have influenced the form . The earliest surviving examples seem to come from the territory of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria , which had been converted to Christianity by Irish missionaries ; it remains unclear whether the form first developed in Ireland or Britain . Their relief decoration is a mixture of religious figures and sections of decoration such as knotwork , interlace and in Britain vine-scrolls , all in the styles also found in insular art in other media such as illuminated manuscripts and metalwork . They were probably normally painted , perhaps over a modelled layer of plaster ; with the loss of paint and the effects of weathering the reliefs , in particular scenes crowded with small figures , are often now rather indistinct and hard to read . The earlier crosses were typically up to about two metres or eight feet high , but in Ireland examples up to three times higher appear later , retaining thick massive proportions , giving large surface areas for carving . The tallest of the Irish crosses is the so-called Tall Cross at Monasterboice , County Louth . It stands at seven metres or twenty-two feet high . Anglo-Saxon examples mostly remained slender in comparison , but could be large ; except in earlier Northumbrian examples their decoration is mostly ornamental rather than figures . The crosses often , though not always , feature a stone ring around the intersection , forming a Celtic cross ; this seems clearly an innovation of Celtic Christianity , perhaps at Iona . The term high cross is mainly used in Ireland and Scotland , but the tradition across Britain and Ireland is essentially a single phenomenon , though there are certainly strong regional variations .",
  "/wiki/Swingfield_Preceptory": "Swingfield Preceptory ( or St John 's Commandery , Swingfield ) was a priory about 5 miles north of Folkestone , Kent on the south coast of England .",
  "/wiki/Priory": "A priory is a monastery of men or women under religious vows that is headed by a prior or prioress . Priories may be houses of mendicant friars or nuns ( such as the Dominicans , Augustinians , Franciscans , and Carmelites , for instance ) , or monasteries of monks or nuns ( as with the Benedictines ) . Houses of canons regular and canonesses regular also use this term , the alternative being canonry . In pre-Reformation England , if an abbey church was raised to cathedral status , the abbey became a Cathedral Priory . The bishop , in effect , took the place of the abbot , and the monastery itself was headed by a prior ."
