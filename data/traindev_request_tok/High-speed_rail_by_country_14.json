In the 17th century , Salzburg became a centre of the Counter-Reformation , where monasteries and numerous Baroque churches were built . Salzburg 's historic centre ( German : Altstadt ) is thus renowned for its Baroque architecture and is one of the best-preserved city centres north of the Alps , with 27 churches . It was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996 . The city has three universities and a large population of students . Tourists also visit Salzburg to tour the historic centre and the scenic Alpine surroundings . Salzburg was the birthplace of the 18th-century composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart .

It is also called the Riedbahn ( Ried Railway ) . The line runs through an area called the Hessische Ried , hence the name . The term Riedbahn was originally used for the Darmstadt-Worms railway and the two lines share the central section between Gro\u00df-Gerau and Biblis . The Mannheim-Frankfurt railway is used by three Intercity-Express routes , connecting South Germany with Berlin , Hamburg , Cologne and Dortmund and regional services of the Rhine-Main transport union and Rhine-Neckar transport union . The line is one of the busiest line in Germany with 650 trains per day , although most freight uses the Main-Neckar Railway , which is further east and gives better access to the Mannheim marshalling yard . In order to overcome heavy congestion of the line and to accelerate train services , it is proposed to build a new line between Frankfurt and Mannheim . The planning approval process is expected to start in 2017 .",
