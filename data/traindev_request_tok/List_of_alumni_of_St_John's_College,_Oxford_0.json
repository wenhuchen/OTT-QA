After his resignation , he was appointed Special Envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East , an office which he held until 2015 . He currently runs the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change .

He became Leader of the Opposition on his election as Labour Party leader in 1994 , following the sudden death of his predecessor , John Smith .

Despite opposition from Labour 's hard left , he removed the party 's formal commitment to the nationalisation of the economy , weakened trade union influence in the party , and committed to the free market and the European Union .",
  "/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom": "The prime minister of the United Kingdom ( informally abbreviated to PM ) , until 1801 known as the prime minister of Great Britain , is the head of government of the United Kingdom . The prime minister directs both the executive and the legislature , and together with their Cabinet is accountable to the monarch , to Parliament , to their party , and ultimately to the electorate , for the government 's policies and actions . The office of Prime Minister is not established by any statute or constitutional document but exists only by long-established convention , whereby the reigning monarch appoints as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons ; this individual is typically the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber . The position of Prime Minister was not created ; it evolved slowly and organically over three hundred years due to numerous Acts of Parliament , political developments , and accidents of history . The office is therefore best understood from a historical perspective . The origins of the position are found in constitutional changes that occurred during the Revolutionary Settlement ( 1688-1720 ) and the resulting shift of political power from the Sovereign to Parliament . Although the sovereign was not stripped of the ancient prerogative powers and legally remained the head of government , politically it gradually became necessary for him or her to govern through a prime minister who could command a majority in Parliament . By the 1830s , the Westminster system of government ( or cabinet government ) had emerged ; the prime minister had become primus inter pares or the first among equals in the Cabinet and the head of government in the United Kingdom . The political position of Prime Minister was enhanced by the development of modern political parties , the introduction of mass communication and photography . By the start of the 20th century the modern premiership had emerged ; the office had become the pre-eminent position in the constitutional hierarchy vis-\u00e0-vis the Sovereign , Parliament and Cabinet . Prior to 1902 , the prime minister sometimes came from the House of Lords , provided that his government could form a majority in the Commons . However as the power of the aristocracy waned during the 19th century the convention developed that the prime minister should always sit as a Member of Parliament ( MP ) in the lower house , making them answerable only to the Commons in Parliament .",
