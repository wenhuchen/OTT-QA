  "/wiki/Talk_radio": "Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues and consisting entirely or almost entirely of original spoken word content rather than outside music . Most shows are regularly hosted by a single individual , and often feature interviews with a number of different guests . Talk radio typically includes an element of listener participation , usually by broadcasting live conversations between the host and listeners who call in ( usually via telephone ) to the show . Listener contributions are usually screened by a show 's producers in order to maximize audience interest and , in the case of commercial talk radio , to attract advertisers . Generally , the shows are organized into segments , each separated by a pause for advertisements ; however , in public or non-commercial radio , music is sometimes played in place of commercials to separate the program segments . Variations of talk radio include conservative talk , hot talk , liberal talk ( increasingly known as progressive talk ) and sports talk . While talk radio has historically been associated with broadcast radio , starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of live Internet website streaming and podcasts . Now , it is possible for an individual to use a variety of services to host an Internet-based talk-radio show without carriage by a traditional radio station . In addition , TV programming from talk and news outlets such as BBC , CNN , Bloomberg and Fox is now often available expanding the world of talk radio further . Talk radio listening is enjoyed not only on radios , but a wide variety of other devices and services including PCs using iTunes , station directories such as TuneIn , show directory smartphones with apps such as Stitcher and time-shifting services like DAR.fm .",

Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms , folk lyrics , and harmonies mostly accompanied by string instruments such as banjos , electric and acoustic guitars , steel guitars ( such as pedal steels and dobros ) , and fiddles as well as harmonicas .

Campus radio stations are generally licensed and regulated by national governments , and have very different characteristics from one country to the next . One commonality between many radio stations regardless of their physical location is a willingness - or , in some countries , even a licensing requirement - to broadcast musical selections that are not categorized as commercial hits . Because of this , campus radio has come to be associated with emerging musical trends , including genres such as punk and new wave , alternative rock , indie rock and hip hop , long before those genres become part of the musical mainstream . Campus radio stations also often provide airplay and promotional exposure to new and emerging local artists .

Often the radio format is best described as a freeform , with a lot of creativity and individualism among the disc jockeys and show hosts . A number of these radio stations have gained critical acclaim for their programming and are considered by the community in which they are embedded to be an essential media outlet .

The first language ( sometimes also referred to as the mother tongue ) is acquired without formal education , by mechanisms about which scholars disagree . Children acquiring two languages natively from these early years are called simultaneous bilinguals . It is common for young simultaneous bilinguals to be more proficient in one language than the other .
