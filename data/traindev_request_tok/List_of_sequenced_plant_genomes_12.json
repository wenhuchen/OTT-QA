  "/wiki/Setaria_italica": "Foxtail millet , scientific name Setaria italica ( synonym Panicum italicum L. ) , is an annual grass grown for human food . It is the second-most widely planted species of millet , and the most grown millet spices in Asia . Oldest evidence of foxtail millet is found along the ancient course of Yellow river in Cishan , China , carbon dated to be 8700 BC . India also grown foxtail millet since antiquity .

  "/wiki/Poaceae": "Poaceae ( /po\u028a\u02c8e\u026asia\u026a/ ) or Gramineae is a large and nearly ubiquitous family of monocotyledonous flowering plants known as grasses , commonly referred to collectively as grass . Poaceae includes the cereal grasses , bamboos and the grasses of natural grassland and cultivated lawns and pasture . The Poaceae are the most important source of the world 's dietary energy supply . They provide , through direct human consumption , just over one-half ( 51% ) of all dietary energy ; rice provides 20% , wheat supplies 20% , maize ( corn ) 5.5% , and other grains 6% . Grasses have stems that are hollow except at the nodes and narrow alternate leaves borne in two ranks . The lower part of each leaf encloses the stem , forming a leaf-sheath . With around 780 genera and around 12,000 species , Poaceae are the fifth-largest plant family , following the Asteraceae , Orchidaceae , Fabaceae and Rubiaceae . Grasslands such as savannah and prairie where grasses are dominant are estimated to constitute 40.5% of the land area of the Earth , excluding Greenland and Antarctica . Grasses are also an important part of the vegetation in many other habitats , including wetlands , forests and tundra . The Poaceae are the most economically important plant family , providing staple foods from domesticated cereal crops such as maize , wheat , rice , barley , and millet as well as feed for meat-producing animals . They are used as building materials ( bamboo , thatch , and straw ) . They are a source of biofuel , primarily via the conversion of maize to ethanol .",
  "/wiki/C4_carbon_fixation": "C4 carbon fixation or the Hatch-Slack pathway is a photosynthetic process in some plants . It is the first step in extracting carbon from carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) to be able to use it in sugar and other biomolecules . It is one of three known processes for carbon fixation . C4 refers to the four-carbon molecule that is the first product of this type of carbon fixation . C4 fixation is an elaboration of the more common C3 carbon fixation and is believed to have evolved more recently . C4 overcomes the tendency of the enzyme RuBisCO to wastefully fix oxygen rather than carbon dioxide in the process of photorespiration . This is achieved by ensuring that RuBisCO works in an environment where there is a lot of carbon dioxide and very little oxygen . CO2 is shuttled via malate or aspartate from mesophyll cells to bundle-sheath cells . In these bundle-sheath cells CO2 is released by decarboxylation of the malate . C4 plants use PEP carboxylase to capture more CO2 in the mesophyll cells . PEP ( phosphoenolpyruvate , three carbons ) binds to CO2 to make oxaloacetic acid ( OAA , four carbons ) . OAA then makes malate or aspartate ( four carbons ) , which is transported into the bundle sheath cells , where it releases the CO2 .",

  "/wiki/Dichanthelium_oligosanthes": "Dichanthelium oligosanthes , known as Heller 's rosette grass , fewanther obscuregrass , and few-flowered panicgrass , is a frost-tolerant , perennial grass species native to North America . It is found primarily in the contiguous United States with specimens also reported in British Columbia and Alberta in Canada , as well as south of the Rio Grande in northern Mexico . D. oligosanthes is most frequently in partially shaded glens within woods , recently cut forests , and grassy banks . The species is primarily cleistogamous , with individual florets often self pollinate without opening . Despite being a member of the grass subfamily Panicoideae which includes many species which utilize C4 photosynthesis , D. oligosanthes retains the more ancestral trait , using a C3 photosynthetic pathway . The genome of Dichanthelium oligosanthes is carried on nine chromosomes and is estimated to be between 750 and 950 megabases in size . A draft genome assembly was generated from the progeny of a single self-pollinated plant collected from the Shaw Nature Reserve near Gray Summit , Missouri .",

  "/wiki/Zea_mays": "Maize ( /me\u026az/ MAYZ ; Zea mays subsp . mays , from Spanish : ma\u00edz after Taino : mahiz ) , also known as corn , is a cereal grain first domesticated by indigenous peoples in southern Mexico about 10,000 years ago . The leafy stalk of the plant produces pollen inflorescences and separate ovuliferous inflorescences called ears that yield kernels or seeds , which are fruits . Maize has become a staple food in many parts of the world , with the total production of maize surpassing that of wheat or rice . However , little of this maize is consumed directly by humans : most is used for corn ethanol , animal feed and other maize products , such as corn starch and corn syrup . The six major types of maize are dent corn , flint corn , pod corn , popcorn , flour corn , and sweet corn . Sugar-rich varieties called sweet corn are usually grown for human consumption as kernels , while field corn varieties are used for animal feed , various corn-based human food uses ( including grinding into cornmeal or masa , pressing into corn oil , and fermentation and distillation into alcoholic beverages like bourbon whiskey ) , and as chemical feedstocks . Maize is also used in making ethanol and other biofuels . Maize is widely cultivated throughout the world , and a greater weight of maize is produced each year than any other grain . In 2014 , total world production was 1.04 billion tonnes . Maize is the most widely grown grain crop throughout the Americas , with 361 million metric tons grown in the United States in 2014 . Approximately 40% of the crop - 130 million tons - is used for corn ethanol .",
  "/wiki/Pennisetum_glaucum": "Pearl millet ( Pennisetum glaucum ) is the most widely grown type of millet . It has been grown in Africa and the Indian subcontinent since prehistoric times . The center of diversity , and suggested area of domestication , for the crop is in the Sahel zone of West Africa . Recent archaeobotanical research has confirmed the presence of domesticated pearl millet on the Sahel zone of northern Mali between 2500 and 2000 BC . Cultivation subsequently spread and moved overseas to India . The earliest archaeological records in the Indian subcontinent date to around 2000 BC , and it spread rapidly through Northern Indian subcontinent reaching South India by 1500 BC , based on evidence from the site of Hallur . Cultivation also spread throughout eastern and southern parts of Africa . Pearl millet is widely grown in the northeastern part of Nigeria ( especially in Borno and Yobe states ) . It is a major source of food to the local villagers of that region . The crop grows easily in that region due to its ability to withstand harsh weather conditions like drought and flood . Records exist for cultivation of pearl millet in the United States in the 1850s , and the crop was introduced into Brazil in the 1960s ."
