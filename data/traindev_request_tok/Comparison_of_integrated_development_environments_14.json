  "/wiki/Integrated_development_environment": "An integrated development environment ( IDE ) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development . An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor , build automation tools and a debugger . Some IDEs , such as NetBeans and Eclipse , contain the necessary compiler , interpreter , or both ; others , such as SharpDevelop and Lazarus , do not . The boundary between an IDE and other parts of the broader software development environment is not well-defined ; sometimes a version control system or various tools to simplify the construction of a graphical user interface ( GUI ) are integrated . Many modern IDEs also have a class browser , an object browser , and a class hierarchy diagram for use in object-oriented software development .",
  "/wiki/Software_developer": "A computer programmer , sometimes called more recently a coder ( especially in more informal contexts ) , is a person who creates computer software . The term computer programmer can refer to a specialist in one area of computers , or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software . A programmer 's most oft-used computer language ( e.g. , Assembly , COBOL , C , C++ , C # , JavaScript , Lisp , Python ) may be prefixed to the term programmer . Some who work with web programming languages also prefix their titles with web . A range of occupations that involve programming also often require a range of other , similar skills , for example : ( software ) developer , web developer , mobile applications developer , embedded firmware developer , software engineer , computer scientist , game programmer , game developer and software analyst . The use of the term programmer as applied to these positions is sometimes considered an insulting simplification or even derogatory .",
  "/wiki/Software_release": "A software release life cycle is the sum of the stages of development and maturity for a piece of computer software . Cycles range from its initial development to its eventual release , and include updated versions of the released version to help improve software or fix software bugs still present in the software . Computer users are most likely to be familiar with the release cycle beta as software products are sometimes publicly advertised as being beta in order to reduce users ' expectations of their reliability .",
  "/wiki/Platform_(computing)": "A computing platform or digital platform is the environment in which a piece of software is executed . It may be the hardware or the operating system ( OS ) , even a web browser and associated application programming interfaces , or other underlying software , as long as the program code is executed with it . Computing platforms have different abstraction levels , including a computer architecture , an OS , or runtime libraries . A computing platform is the stage on which computer programs can run . A platform can be seen both as a constraint on the software development process , in that different platforms provide different functionality and restrictions ; and as an assistant to the development process , in that they provide low-level functionality ready-made . For example , an OS may be a platform that abstracts the underlying differences in hardware and provides a generic command for saving files or accessing the network .",
  "/wiki/Software_license": "A software license is a legal instrument ( usually by way of contract law , with or without printed material ) governing the use or redistribution of software . Under United States copyright law , all software is copyright protected , in both source code and object code forms , unless that software was developed by the United States Government , in which case it can not be copyrighted . Authors of copyrighted software can donate their software to the public domain , in which case it is also not covered by copyright and , as a result , can not be licensed . A typical software license grants the licensee , typically an end-user , permission to use one or more copies of software in ways where such a use would otherwise potentially constitute copyright infringement of the software owner 's exclusive rights under copyright .",
  "/wiki/Programming_language": "A programming language is a formal language , which comprises a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output . Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms . Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers . There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions , rather than general programming languages . Early ones preceded the invention of the digital computer , the first probably being the automatic flute player described in the 9th century by the brothers Musa in Baghdad , during the Islamic Golden Age . Since the early 1800s , programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms , music boxes and player pianos . The programs for these machines ( such as a player piano 's scrolls ) did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions . Thousands of different programming languages have been created , and more are being created every year . Many programming languages are written in an imperative form ( i.e. , as a sequence of operations to perform ) while other languages use the declarative form ( i.e . the desired result is specified , not how to achieve it ) . The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax ( form ) and semantics ( meaning ) . Some languages are defined by a specification document ( for example , the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard ) while other languages ( such as Perl ) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference .",

  "/wiki/Unix-like": "A Unix-like ( sometimes referred to as UN*X or *nix ) operating system is one that behaves in a manner similar to a Unix system , while not necessarily conforming to or being certified to any version of the Single UNIX Specification . A Unix-like application is one that behaves like the corresponding Unix command or shell . There is no standard for defining the term , and some difference of opinion is possible as to the degree to which a given operating system or application is Unix-like . The term can include free and open-source operating systems inspired by Bell Labs ' Unix or designed to emulate its features , commercial and proprietary work-alikes , and even versions based on the licensed UNIX source code ( which may be sufficiently Unix-like to pass certification and bear the UNIX trademark ) .",
  "/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License": "The GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL or GPL ) is a widely used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run , study , share , and modify the software . The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms . This is in distinction to permissive software licenses , of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples . GPL was the first copyleft license for general use . Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF . Developers can omit it when licensing their software ; the Linux kernel , for instance , is licensed under GPLv2 without the any later version clause .",
  "/wiki/C_(programming_language)": "C ( /si\u02d0/ , as in the letter c ) is a general-purpose , procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming , lexical variable scope , and recursion , while a static type system prevents unintended operations . By design , C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions and has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language . Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computers , from supercomputers to embedded systems . C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to make utilities running on Unix . Later , it was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system . During the 1980s , C gradually gained popularity . It has become one of the most widely used programming languages , with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems . C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989 ( see ANSI C ) and by the International Organization for Standardization . C is an imperative procedural language . It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions , all with minimal runtime support . Despite its low-level capabilities , the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming . A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code .",

  "/wiki/Cross-platform": "In computing , cross-platform software ( also multi-platform software or platform-independent software ) is computer software that is implemented on multiple computing platforms . Cross-platform software may be divided into two types ; one requires individual building or compilation for each platform that it supports , and the other one can be directly run on any platform without special preparation , e.g. , software written in an interpreted language or pre-compiled portable bytecode for which the interpreters or run-time packages are common or standard components of all platforms . For example , a cross-platform application may run on Microsoft Windows , Linux , and macOS . Cross-platform programs may run on as many as all existing platforms , or on as few as two platforms . Cross-platform frameworks ( such as Qt , Flutter , NativeScript , Xamarin , Phonegap , Ionic , and React Native ) exist to aid cross-platform development .",
  "/wiki/MIT_License": "The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) in the late 1980s . As a permissive license , it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has , therefore , reasonable license compatibility . It is compatible because it can be re-licensed under other licenses . The MIT license is compatible with many copyleft licenses , such as the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) ; MIT licensed software can be re-licensed as GPL software , and integrated with other GPL software , but not the other way around . The MIT license also permits reuse within proprietary software , provided that either all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the copyright notice , or the software is re-licensed to remove this requirement . MIT-licensed software can also be re-licensed as proprietary software , which distinguishes it from copyleft software licenses . As of 2015 [ update ] , MIT was the most popular software license on GitHub , ahead of any GPL variant and other free and open-source software ( FOSS ) licenses . Notable projects that use the MIT License include the X Window System , Ruby on Rails , and Node.js .",
  "/wiki/JavaScript": "JavaScript ( /\u02c8d\u0292\u0251\u02d0v\u0259\u02ccskr\u026apt/ ) , often abbreviated as JS , is an interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification . JavaScript is high-level , often just-in-time compiled , and multi-paradigm . It has curly-bracket syntax , dynamic typing , prototype-based object-orientation , and first-class functions . Alongside HTML and CSS , JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web . JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications . The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior , and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it . As a multi-paradigm language , JavaScript supports event-driven , functional , and imperative programming styles . It has application programming interfaces ( APIs ) for working with text , dates , regular expressions , standard data structures , and the Document Object Model ( DOM ) . However , the language itself does not include any input/output ( I/O ) , such as networking , storage , or graphics facilities , as the host environment ( usually a web browser ) provides those APIs . Originally used only in web browsers , JavaScript engines are also now embedded in server-side website deployments and non-browser applications . Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java , including language name , syntax , and respective standard libraries , the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design .",

  "/wiki/HTML": "Hypertext Markup Language ( HTML ) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser . It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) and scripting languages such as JavaScript . Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages . HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document . HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages . With HTML constructs , images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page . HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings , paragraphs , lists , links , quotes and other items . HTML elements are delineated by tags , written using angle brackets . Tags such as < img / > and < input / > directly introduce content into the page . Other tags such as < p > surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements . Browsers do not display the HTML tags , but use them to interpret the content of the page . HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript , which affects the behavior and content of web pages .",
  "/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets": "Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML . CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web , alongside HTML and JavaScript . CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content , including layout , colors , and fonts . This separation can improve content accessibility , provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics , enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file , and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content . Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods , such as on-screen , in print , by voice ( via speech-based browser or screen reader ) , and on Braille-based tactile devices . CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device . The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element . This cascading priority scheme is predictable . The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) . Internet media type ( MIME type ) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 ( March 1998 ) . The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents . In addition to HTML , other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML , plain XML , SVG , and XUL .",

  "/wiki/Java_(programming_language)": "Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based , object-oriented , and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible . It is intended to let application developers write once , run anywhere ( WORA ) , meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation . Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine ( JVM ) regardless of the underlying computer architecture . The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++ , but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them . As of 2019 [ update ] , Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub , particularly for client-server web applications , with a reported 9 million developers . Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems ( which has since been acquired by Oracle ) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems ' Java platform . The original and reference implementation Java compilers , virtual machines , and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses . As of May 2007 , in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process , Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License . Meanwhile , others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies , such as the GNU Compiler for Java ( bytecode compiler ) , GNU Classpath ( standard libraries ) , and IcedTea-Web ( browser plugin for applets ) . The latest versions are Java 13 , released in September 2019 , and Java 11 , a currently supported long-term support ( LTS ) version , released on September 25 , 2018 ; Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use , while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020 . Oracle ( and others ) highly recommend uninstalling older versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues . Since Java 9 ( and 10 and 12 ) is no longer supported , Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the latest version ( currently Java 13 ) or an LTS release .",

The language has expanded significantly over time , and modern C++ has object-oriented , generic , and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation . It is almost always implemented as a compiled language , and many vendors provide C++ compilers , including the Free Software Foundation , LLVM , Microsoft , Intel , Oracle , and IBM , so it is available on many platforms . C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded , resource-constrained software and large systems , with performance , efficiency , and flexibility of use as its design highlights . C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts , with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications , including desktop applications , video games , servers ( e.g . e-commerce , Web search , or SQL servers ) , and performance-critical applications ( e.g . telephone switches or space probes ) . C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) , with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as ISO/IEC 14882:2017 ( informally known as C++17 ) . The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998 , which was then amended by the C++03 , C++11 and C++14 standards . The current C++17 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library . Before the initial standardization in 1998 , C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language ; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization .

Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones .

  "/wiki/Java_Virtual_Machine": "A Java virtual machine ( JVM ) is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode . The JVM is detailed by a specification that formally describes what is required in a JVM implementation . Having a specification ensures interoperability of Java programs across different implementations so that program authors using the Java Development Kit ( JDK ) need not worry about idiosyncrasies of the underlying hardware platform . The JVM reference implementation is developed by the OpenJDK project as open source code and includes a JIT compiler called HotSpot . The commercially supported Java releases available from Oracle Corporation are based on the OpenJDK runtime . Eclipse OpenJ9 is another open source JVM for OpenJDK .",
  "/wiki/Solaris_(operating_system)": "Solaris is a non-free Unix operating system originally developed by Sun Microsystems . It superseded the company 's earlier SunOS in 1993 . In 2010 , after the Sun acquisition by Oracle , it was renamed Oracle Solaris . Solaris is known for its scalability , especially on SPARC systems , and for originating many innovative features such as DTrace , ZFS and Time Slider . Solaris supports SPARC and x86-64 workstations and servers from Oracle and other vendors . Solaris is registered as compliant with the Single UNIX Specification . Historically , Solaris was developed as proprietary software . In June 2005 , Sun Microsystems released most of the codebase under the CDDL license , and founded the OpenSolaris open-source project . With OpenSolaris , Sun wanted to build a developer and user community around the software . After the acquisition of Sun Microsystems in January 2010 , Oracle decided to discontinue the OpenSolaris distribution and the development model . In August 2010 , Oracle discontinued providing public updates to the source code of the Solaris kernel , effectively turning Solaris 11 back into a closed source proprietary operating system . Following that , OpenSolaris was forked as illumos and is alive through several illumos distributions .",

  "/wiki/Mozilla_Public_License": "The Mozilla Public License ( MPL ) is a free and open source software license developed and maintained by the Mozilla Foundation . It is a weak copyleft license , characterized as a middle ground between permissive free software licenses and the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) , that seeks to balance the concerns of proprietary and open source developers . As such , it allows re-licensing . MPL software can thus be converted into a copyleft license such as the GPL , or to a proprietary license ( example : KaiOS ) . It has undergone two revisions , a minor update to version 1.1 , and a major update to version 2.0 with the goals of greater simplicity and better compatibility with other licenses . The MPL is the license for Mozilla Firefox , Mozilla Thunderbird , and most other Mozilla software , but it has been used by others , such as Adobe to license their Flex product line , and The Document Foundation to license LibreOffice 4.0 ( also on LGPL 3+ ) . Version 1.1 was adapted by several projects to form derivative licenses like Sun Microsystems ' own Common Development and Distribution License .",
  "/wiki/Perl": "Perl is a family of two high-level , general-purpose , interpreted , dynamic programming languages . Perl refers to Perl 5 , but from 2000 to 2019 it also referred to its redesigned sister language , Perl 6 , before the latter 's name was officially changed to Raku in October 2019 . Though Perl is not officially an acronym , there are various backronyms in use , including Practical Extraction and Reporting Language . Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier . Since then , it has undergone many changes and revisions . Raku , which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000 , eventually evolved into a separate language . Both languages continue to be developed independently by different development teams and liberally borrow ideas from one another . The Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages including C , shell script ( sh ) , AWK , and sed ; Wall also alludes to BASIC and Lisp in the introduction to Learning Perl ( Schwartz & Christiansen ) and so on . They provide text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix command line tools , facilitating manipulation of text files . Perl 5 gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language , in part due to its unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities . In addition to CGI , Perl 5 is used for system administration , network programming , finance , bioinformatics , and other applications , such as for GUIs . It has been nicknamed the Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages because of its flexibility and power , and also its ugliness .",
  "/wiki/Python_(programming_language)": "Python is an interpreted , high-level , general-purpose programming language . Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991 , Python 's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace . Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear , logical code for small and large-scale projects . Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected . It supports multiple programming paradigms , including procedural , object-oriented , and functional programming . Python is often described as a batteries included language due to its comprehensive standard library . Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language . Python 2.0 , released in 2000 , introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of collecting reference cycles . Python 3.0 , released in 2008 , was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible , and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3 . The Python 2 language , i.e . Python 2.7.x , was officially discontinued on 1 January 2020 ( first planned for 2015 ) after which security patches and other improvements will not be released for it . With Python 2 's end-of-life , only Python 3.5.x and later are supported .",

It is commonly used embedded into C applications , for rapid prototyping , scripted applications , GUIs , and testing . Tcl interpreters are available for many operating systems , allowing Tcl code to run on a wide variety of systems . Because Tcl is a very compact language , it is used on embedded systems platforms , both in its full form and in several other small-footprint versions .

Such applications must be created using the Mozilla codebase ( or a fork of it ) ; the most prominent example is the Firefox web browser . In recent years , Mozilla has been reducing the usage of XUL in Firefox . The most notable example is the removal of add-on customization . Firefox originally permitted add-ons to extensively alter its user interface via custom XUL code , but this capability was removed in Firefox 57 and replaced with the less-permissive WebExtensions API . Several forks of Firefox , such as Pale Moon , Basilisk , and Waterfox , retain support for XUL add-ons .",

  "/wiki/GPL2": "The GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL or GPL ) is a widely used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run , study , share , and modify the software . The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms . This is in distinction to permissive software licenses , of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples . GPL was the first copyleft license for general use . Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF . Developers can omit it when licensing their software ; the Linux kernel , for instance , is licensed under GPLv2 without the any later version clause .",

Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones .
