  "/wiki/Tintin_(magazine)": "Tintin ( French : Le Journal de Tintin ; Dutch : Kuifje ) was a weekly Franco-Belgian comics magazine of the second half of the 20th century .

Originally published by Le Lombard , the first issue was released in 1946 , and it ceased publication in 1993 . Tintin magazine was part of an elaborate publishing scheme . The magazine 's primary content focused on a new page or two from several forthcoming comic albums that had yet to be published as a whole , thus drawing weekly readers who could not bear to wait for entire albums . There were several ongoing stories at any given time , giving wide exposure to lesser-known artists . Tintin was also available bound as a hardcover or softcover collection . The content always included filler material , some of which was of considerable interest to fans , for example alternate versions of pages of the Tintin stories , and interviews with authors and artists . Not every comic appearing in Tintin was later put into book form , which was another incentive to subscribe to the magazine . If the quality of Tintin printing was high compared to American comic books through the 1970s , the quality of the albums was superb , utilizing expensive paper and printing processes ( and having correspondingly high prices ) .",
