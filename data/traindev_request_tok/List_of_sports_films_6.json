The Harvard Corporation , chartered in 1650 , is the governing body of Harvard . In its early years , Harvard College primarily trained Congregational and Unitarian clergy , although it has never been formally affiliated with any denomination . Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century , and by the 19th century , Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites . Following the American Civil War , President Charles W. Eliot 's long tenure ( 1869-1909 ) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university ; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900 . A. Lawrence Lowell , who succeeded Eliot , further reformed the undergraduate curriculum and undertook aggressive expansion of Harvard 's land holdings and physical campus . James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II ; he began to liberalize admissions after the war . The university is organized into eleven principal academic units - ten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study - with campuses throughout Greater Boston : its 209-acre ( 85 ha ) original undergraduate campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge , approximately 3 miles ( 5 km ) northwest of Boston ; the business school and many athletics facilities , including Harvard Stadium , are across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston ; and the medical , dental , and public health schools are in the Longwood Medical Area .

  "/wiki/Mike_Donlin": "Michael Joseph Donlin ( May 30 , 1878 - September 24 , 1933 ) was an American Major League Baseball ( MLB ) outfielder and actor . As a professional baseball player , his MLB career spanned from 1899 to 1914 in which he played mainly in the National League for seven teams over 12 seasons . His most notable time was with the New York Giants , where he starred in the outfield for John McGraw 's 1904 pennant winners and 1905 World Series champions . One of the finest hitters of the dead-ball era , his .333 career batting average ranks 28th all time and he finished in the top three in batting five times . In each of those same seasons , he also finished in the top ten in the league in on-base percentage , slugging percentage , and home runs . A controversial character - Donlin , also known as Turkey Mike for his unique strut - his entertaining personality , flamboyant style of dress , and prodigious talent as a hitter caused him to be lionized as the baseball idol of Manhattan . However , alcoholism led to friction with club officials and incarceration . Donlin attempted to leverage his popularity as an athlete to launch a career in Broadway theatre where he met and married Vaudeville comedian Mabel Hite in 1906 . Together , they performed in the baseball-themed play Stealing Home for about three years . Between the waning popularity of the play in 1911 and Hite 's death the following year , Donlin attempted short-lived comebacks with the Giants , Boston Rustlers , and Pittsburgh Pirates . His forays into acting cut short an undeniable talent that could have been a much more successful major league career ; he reached 100 games in just five of his MLB seasons . After convincing McGraw to sign him for the last time in 1914 , Donlin endured a disappointing 35-game cameo with the Giants , leading him to devote his efforts to launch his acting career .",

He was born in rural Narrows , Georgia . Cobb spent 22 seasons with the Detroit Tigers , the last six as the team 's player-manager , and finished his career with the Philadelphia Athletics . In 1936 Cobb received the most votes of any player on the inaugural Baseball Hall of Fame ballot , receiving 222 out of a possible 226 votes ( 98.2% ) ; no other player received a higher percentage of votes until Tom Seaver in 1992 . In 1999 , editors at the Sporting News ranked Ty Cobb third on their list of Baseball 's 100 Greatest Players . Cobb is widely credited with setting 90 MLB records during his career . His combined total of 4,065 runs scored and runs batted in ( after adjusting for home runs ) is still the highest ever produced by any major league player . He still holds several records as of the end of the 2019 season , including the highest career batting average ( .366 or .367 , depending on source ) and most career batting titles with 11 ( or 12 , depending on source ) .

He still holds the career record for stealing home ( 54 times ) and for stealing second base , third base , and home in succession ( 5 times ) , and as the youngest player ever to compile 4,000 hits and score 2,000 runs . Cobb ranks fifth all-time in number of games played and committed 271 errors , the most by any American League ( AL ) outfielder . Cobb 's legacy , which includes a large college scholarship fund for Georgia residents financed by his early investments in Coca-Cola and General Motors , has been somewhat tarnished by allegations of racism and violence , largely stemming from a couple of largely-discredited biographies that were released following his death .",

Ruth is regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in American culture and is considered by many to be the greatest baseball player of all time . In 1936 , Ruth was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame as one of its first five inaugural members . At age seven , Ruth was sent to St. Mary 's Industrial School for Boys , a reformatory where he was mentored by Brother Matthias Boutlier of the Xaverian Brothers , the school 's disciplinarian and a capable baseball player . In 1914 , Ruth was signed to play minor-league baseball for the Baltimore Orioles but was soon sold to the Red Sox . By 1916 , he had built a reputation as an outstanding pitcher who sometimes hit long home runs , a feat unusual for any player in the pre-1920 dead-ball era . Although Ruth twice won 23 games in a season as a pitcher and was a member of three World Series championship teams with the Red Sox , he wanted to play every day and was allowed to convert to an outfielder . With regular playing time , he broke the MLB single-season home run record in 1919 . After that season , Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold Ruth to the Yankees amid controversy .
