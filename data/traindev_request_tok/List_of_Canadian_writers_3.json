  "/wiki/Louis_Dantin": "Louis Dantin was the pen name of Eug\u00e8ne Seers ( November 28 , 1865 - January 17 , 1945 ) , a Canadian writer and editor from Quebec . He is historically most noted as the original editor and publisher of the poetry of \u00c9mile Nelligan , although he also published numerous works as a poet , novelist and essayist in his own right . Originally from Beauharnois , Quebec , he studied at the Coll\u00e8ge de Montr\u00e9al and later attended seminary to become a Roman Catholic priest . Associated with the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament , he wrote religious poetry and short stories during this era . He was later associated with the \u00c9cole litt\u00e9raire de Montr\u00e9al , becoming acquainted there with writers such as Nelligan and Arthur de Bussi\u00e8res . He subsequently left the priesthood in 1903 , marrying Clotilde Lacroix and moving to Boston , Massachusetts , where he worked as a printer for Harvard University Press . He resided in Boston for the remainder of his life , although he continued to publish French language literary work in Quebec . Most of his published work was as an essayist and critic , including volumes such as Po\u00e8tes de lAm\u00e9rique fran\u00e7aise ( 1928 ) and Gloses critiques ( 1931 ) , although he also published a volume of poetry ( Le Coffret de Cruso\u00e9 , 1932 ) and a posthumous novel ( Les Enfances de Fanny , 1951 ) . Several volumes of his correspondence with other Quebec writers were also published , as well as several posthumous volumes of poetry from his archives . Two writers , Claude-Henri Grignon in his 1936 Les Pamphlets de Valdombre and Yvette Francoli in her 2013 Le Naufrag\u00e9 du Vaisseau d'or , have alleged that Dantin was the actual author of most of the poetry credited to Nelligan . Dantin denied Grignon 's claims in several of his letters to other writers . In 2016 , the University of Ottawa 's literary journal @ nalyses published an article by Annette Hayward and Christian Vandendorpe which rejected the claim , based on textual comparisons of the poetry credited to Nelligan with the writings of Dantin .",

  "/wiki/A_Strange_Manuscript_Found_in_a_Copper_Cylinder": "A Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper Cylinder is the most popular book by James De Mille . It was serialized posthumously and anonymously in Harper 's Weekly , and published in book form by Harper and Brothers of New York City during 1888 . It was serialized subsequently in the United Kingdom and Australia , and published in book form in the United Kingdom and Canada . Later editions were published from the plates of the Harper and Brothers first edition , during the late 19th and early 20th centuries . The satiric and fantastic romance is set in an imaginary semi-tropical land in Antarctica inhabited by prehistoric monsters and a cult of death-worshipers called the Kosekin . Begun many years before it was published , it is reminiscent of Edgar Allan Poe 's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket and anticipates the exotic locale and fantasy-adventure elements of works of the Lost World genre such as Arthur Conan Doyle 's The Lost World and Edgar Rice Burroughs ' The Land That Time Forgot , as well as innumerable prehistoric world movies based loosely on these and other works . The title and locale were inspired by Edgar Allan Poe 's Ms. Found in a Bottle . It was unfortunate for De Mille 's reputation as a writer that this work was published after She and King Solomon 's Mines . Although H. Rider Haggard 's works were well known by then , the actual composition of De Mille 's romance pre-dated the publication of the popular romances and his ideas were not in the least derivative from Haggard 's better known works .",
