  "/wiki/USS_Alabama_(BB-60)": "USS Alabama ( BB-60 ) is a retired battleship . She was the fourth and final member of the South Dakota class of fast battleships built for the United States Navy in the 1930s . The first American battleships designed after the Washington treaty system began to break down in the mid-1930s , they took advantage of an escalator clause that allowed increasing the main battery to 16-inch ( 406 mm ) guns , but Congressional refusal to authorize larger battleships kept their displacement close to the Washington limit of 35,000 long tons ( 36,000 t ) . A requirement to be armored against the same caliber of guns as they carried , combined with the displacement restriction , resulted in cramped ships . Overcrowding was exacerbated by wartime modifications that considerably strengthened their anti-aircraft batteries and significantly increased their crews . After entering service , Alabama was briefly deployed to strengthen the British Home Fleet , tasked with protecting convoys to the Soviet Union . In 1943 , she was transferred to the Pacific for operations against Japan ; the first of these was the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign that began in November that year . While operating in the Pacific , she served primarily as an escort for the fast carrier task force to protect the aircraft carriers from surface and air attacks . She also frequently bombarded Japanese positions in support of amphibious assaults . She took part in the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign in June-September and the Philippines campaign in October-December . After a refit in early 1945 , she returned to the fleet for operations during the Battle of Okinawa and the series of attacks on the Japanese mainland in July and August , including several bombardments of coastal industrial targets . Alabama assisted in Operation Magic Carpet after the war , carrying some 700 men home from the former war zone .",

  "/wiki/South_Dakota-class_battleship_(1939)": "The South Dakota class was a group of four fast battleships built by the United States Navy . They were the second class of battleships to be named after the 40th state ; the first were designed in the 1920s and canceled under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty . Four ships comprised the class : South Dakota , Indiana , Massachusetts , and Alabama . They were designed to the same treaty standard displacement limit of 35,000 long tons ( 35,600 t ) as the preceding North Carolina class and had the same main battery of nine 16/45 caliber Mark 6 guns in three-gun turrets , but were more compact and better protected . The ships can be visually distinguished from the earlier vessels by their single funnel , compared to twin funnels in the North Carolinas . According to naval historians William Garzke and Robert Dulin , the South Dakota design was the best treaty battleship ever built . Construction began shortly before World War II , with Fiscal Year ( FY ) 1939 appropriations . Commissioning through the summer of 1942 , the four ships served in both the Atlantic , ready to intercept possible German capital ship sorties , and the Pacific , in carrier groups and shore bombardments . All four ships were retired shortly after World War II ; South Dakota and Indiana were scrapped in the 1960s , Massachusetts and Alabama were retained as museum ships .",
  "/wiki/Ship_commissioning": "Ship commissioning is the act or ceremony of placing a ship in active service , and may be regarded as a particular application of the general concepts and practices of project commissioning . The term is most commonly applied to the placing of a warship in active duty with its country 's military forces . The ceremonies involved are often rooted in centuries old naval tradition . Ship naming and launching endow a ship hull with her identity , but many milestones remain before she is completed and considered ready to be designated a commissioned ship . The engineering plant , weapon and electronic systems , galley , and multitudinous other equipment required to transform the new hull into an operating and habitable warship are installed and tested . The prospective commanding officer , ship 's officers , the petty officers , and seamen who will form the crew report for training and intensive familiarization with their new ship . Prior to commissioning , the new ship undergoes sea trials to identify any deficiencies needing correction . The preparation and readiness time between christening-launching and commissioning may be as much as three years for a nuclear powered aircraft carrier to as brief as twenty days for a World War II landing ship . USS Monitor , of American Civil War fame , was commissioned less than three weeks after launch .",

Because of the complementary roles of the United States Army and the United States Navy in conducting war in the Pacific Theater , there was no single Allied or U.S. commander ( comparable to General Dwight D. Eisenhower in the European Theater of Operations ) . There was no actual command ; rather , the Asiatic-Pacific Theater was divided into SWPA , POA , and other forces and theaters , such as the China Burma India Theater .",

Their original homelands are in what now comprises southern Tennessee , all of Alabama , western Georgia and part of northern Florida . Like the Cherokees in northeastern Alabama , most of the Muscogee people were forcibly relocated from their original lands in the 1830s during the Trail of Tears to Indian Territory ( now Oklahoma ) . Some Muscogee fled European encroachment in 1797 and 1804 to establish two small tribal territories that continue to exist today in Louisiana and Texas . Another small branch of the Muscogee Creek Confederacy managed to remain in Alabama and is now known as the Poarch Band of Creek Indians . A large population of Muscogee people moved into Florida between roughly 1767 and 1821 and these people intermarried with local tribes to become the Seminole people , thereby establishing a separate identity from the Creek Confederacy . Muscogee people in these waves of migration into Florida were fleeing conflict and encroachment by European settlers . The great majority of Seminoles were also later forcibly relocated to Oklahoma , where they reside today , although the Seminole Tribe of Florida and Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida remain in Florida . The respective languages of all of these modern day branches , bands and tribes , except one , are all closely related variants called Muscogee , Mvskoke and Hitchiti-Mikasuki , all of which belong to the Eastern Muskogean branch of the Muscogean language family . All of these languages are , for the most part , mutually intelligible . The Yuchi people today are part of the Muscogee ( Creek ) Nation but their Yuchi language is a linguistic isolate , unrelated to any other language . The ancestors of the Muscogee people were part of the Mississippian Ideological Interaction Sphere , who between AD 800 and AD 1600 built complex cities and surrounding networks of satellite towns ( suburbs ) centered around massive earthwork mounds , some of which had physical footprints larger than the Egyptian pyramids .",

Although some indigenous peoples of the Americas were traditionally hunter-gatherers - and many , especially in the Amazon basin , still are - many groups practiced aquaculture and agriculture . The impact of their agricultural endowment to the world is a testament to their time and work in reshaping and cultivating the flora indigenous to the Americas . Although some societies depended heavily on agriculture , others practiced a mix of farming , hunting and gathering . In some regions the indigenous peoples created monumental architecture , large-scale organized cities , city-states , chiefdoms , states , kingdoms and empires . Among these are the Aztec , Inca and Maya states that until the 16th century were among the most politically and socially advanced nations in the world . They had a vast knowledge of engineering , architecture , mathematics , astronomy , writing , physics , medicine , planting and irrigation , geology , mining , sculpture and goldsmithing . Many parts of the Americas are still populated by indigenous peoples ; some countries have sizable populations , especially Belize , Bolivia , Canada , Chile , Ecuador , Greenland , Guatemala , Mexico , Panama , Paraguay , Peru and the United States . At least a thousand different indigenous languages are spoken in the Americas . Some , such as the Quechuan languages , Aymara , Guaran\u00ed , Mayan languages and Nahuatl , count their speakers in millions .

  "/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland .",

  "/wiki/Civil_Rights_Movement": "The civil rights movement ( also known as the American civil rights movement and other terms ) [ b ] in the United States was a decades-long struggle by African Americans to end legalized racial discrimination , disenfranchisement and racial segregation in the United States . The movement has its origins in the Reconstruction era during the late 19th century , although the movement achieved its largest legislative gains in the mid-1960s after years of direct actions and grassroots protests . The social movement 's major nonviolent resistance campaigns eventually secured new protections in federal law for the human rights of all Americans . After the American Civil War and the abolition of slavery in the 1860s , the Reconstruction Amendments to the United States Constitution granted emancipation and constitutional rights of citizenship to all African Americans , most of whom had recently been enslaved . For a period , African Americans voted and held political office , but they were increasingly deprived of civil rights , often under Jim Crow laws , and subjected to discrimination and sustained violence by whites in the South . Over the following century , various efforts were made by African Americans to secure their legal rights . In 1954 , the separate but equal policy which aided the enforcement of Jim Crow laws was weakened with the United States Supreme Court 's Brown v. Board of Education ruling and other subsequent rulings which followed . Between 1955 and 1968 , acts of nonviolent protest and civil disobedience produced crisis situations and productive dialogues between activists and government authorities . Federal , state , and local governments , businesses , and communities often had to respond immediately to these situations , which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans across the country . The lynching of Chicago teenager Emmett Till in Mississippi , and the outrage generated by seeing how he had been abused , when his mother decided to have an open-casket funeral , mobilized the African-American community nationwide . Forms of protest and/or civil disobedience included boycotts , such as the successful Montgomery bus boycott ( 1955-56 ) in Alabama ; sit-ins such as the Greensboro sit-ins ( 1960 ) in North Carolina and successful Nashville sit-ins in Tennessee ; marches , such as the 1963 Birmingham Children 's Crusade and 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches ( 1965 ) in Alabama ; and a wide range of other nonviolent activities . At the culmination of a legal strategy pursued by African Americans , the U.S. Supreme Court began , in 1954 under the leadership of Earl Warren , to find unconstitutional many of the laws that had allowed racial segregation and discrimination to be legal in the United States .",
  "/wiki/Racial_segregation": "Racial segregation is the systemic separation of people into racial or other ethnic groups in daily life . Segregation can involve spatial separation of the races , and mandatory use of different institutions , such as schools and hospitals by people of different races . Specifically , it may apply to activities such as eating in a restaurant , drinking from a water fountain , using a public toilet , attending school , going to the movies , riding on a bus , or in the rental or purchase of a home or of hotel rooms . In addition , segregation often allowed close contact in hierarchical situations , such as allowing a person of one race to work as a servant for a member of another race . Segregation is defined by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance as the act by which a ( natural or legal ) person separates other persons on the basis of one of the enumerated grounds without an objective and reasonable justification , in conformity with the proposed definition of discrimination . As a result , the voluntary act of separating oneself from other people on the basis of one of the enumerated grounds does not constitute segregation . According to the UN Forum on Minority Issues , The creation and development of classes and schools providing education in minority languages should not be considered impermissible segregation , if the assignment to such classes and schools is of a voluntary nature . Racial segregation has been generally outlawed worldwide . In the United States , segregation was mandated by law in some states ( such as the Jim Crow laws ) and came with anti-miscegenation laws ( prohibitions against interracial marriage ) , until the U.S. Supreme Court led by Chief Justice Earl Warren started a liberal Constitutional Revolution in 1950s and 1960s which outlawed racial segregation throughout the United States . However , racial segregation may exist de facto through social norms , even when there is no strong individual preference for it , as suggested by Thomas Schelling 's models of segregation and subsequent work . Segregation may be maintained by means ranging from discrimination in hiring and in the rental and sale of housing to certain races to vigilante violence ( such as lynchings ) . Generally , a situation that arises when members of different races mutually prefer to associate and do business with members of their own race would usually be described as separation or de facto separation of the races rather than segregation .",
  "/wiki/Racial_discrimination": "Racial discrimination is any discrimination against individuals on the basis of their skin color , or racial or ethnic origin . Individuals can discriminate by refusing to do business with , socialize with , or share resources with people of a certain group . Governments can discriminate in a de facto fashion or explicitly in law , for example through policies of racial segregation , disparate enforcement of laws , or disproportionate allocation of resources . Some jurisdictions have anti-discrimination laws which prohibit the government or individuals from discriminating based on race ( and sometimes other factors ) in various circumstances . Some institutions and laws use affirmative action to attempt to overcome or compensate for the effects of racial discrimination . In some cases , this is simply enhanced recruitment of members of underrepresented groups ; in other cases there are firm racial quotas . Opponents of strong remedies like quotas characterize them as reverse discrimination , where members of a dominant or majority group are discriminated against .",

The marches were organized by nonviolent activists to demonstrate the desire of African-American citizens to exercise their constitutional right to vote , in defiance of segregationist repression ; they were part of a broader voting rights movement underway in Selma and throughout the American South . By highlighting racial injustice , they contributed to passage that year of the Voting Rights Act , a landmark federal achievement of the civil rights movement . Southern state legislatures had passed and maintained a series of discriminatory requirements and practices that had disenfranchised most of the millions of African Americans across the South throughout the 20th century . The African-American group known as the Dallas County Voters League ( DCVL ) launched a voter registration campaign in Selma in 1963 . Joined by organizers from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) , they began working that year in a renewed effort to register black voters . Finding resistance by white officials to be intractable , even after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ended legal segregation , the DCVL invited Rev . Martin Luther King , Jr. and the activists of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference ( SCLC ) to join them . SCLC brought many prominent civil rights and civic leaders to Selma in January 1965 . Local and regional protests began , with 3,000 people arrested by the end of February . According to Joseph A. Califano Jr. , who served as head of domestic affairs for U.S. President Lyndon Johnson between the years 1965 and 1969 , the President viewed King as an essential partner in getting the Voting Rights Act enacted . Califano , whom the President also assigned to monitor the final march to Montgomery , said that Johnson and King talked by telephone on January 15 to plan a strategy for drawing attention to the injustice of using literacy tests and other barriers to stop black Southerners from voting , and that King later informed the President on February 9 of his decision to use Selma to achieve this objective .",

Other general provisions specifically outlaw literacy tests and similar devices that were historically used to disenfranchise racial minorities . The Act also contains special provisions that apply to only certain jurisdictions . A core special provision is the Section 5 preclearance requirement , which prohibits certain jurisdictions from implementing any change affecting voting without receiving preapproval from the U.S. Attorney General or the U.S. District Court for D.C. that the change does not discriminate against protected minorities .

  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",

It is located between the Atlantic Ocean and the Western United States , with the Midwestern United States and Northeastern United States to its north and the Gulf of Mexico and Mexico to its south . The South does not fully match the geographic south of the United States but is commonly defined as including the states that fought for the Confederate States of America in the American Civil War . The Deep South is fully located in the southeastern corner . California , Arizona and New Mexico , which are geographically in the southern part of the country , are rarely considered part , while West Virginia , which separated from Virginia in 1863 , commonly is . Some scholars have proposed definitions of the South that do not coincide neatly with state boundaries . While the states of Delaware and Maryland , as well as the District of Columbia , permitted slavery prior to and during the Civil War , they remained with the Union . Since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s , they became more culturally , economically , and politically aligned with the industrial Northern states , and are often identified as part of the Mid-Atlantic or Northeast by many residents , businesses , public institutions , and private organizations ; however , the United States Census Bureau continues to define them as in the South with regard to census regions . Usually , the South is defined as including the southeastern and south-central United States . The region is known for its culture and history , having developed its own customs , musical styles , and cuisines , which have distinguished it in some ways from the rest of the United States . The Southern ethnic heritage is diverse and includes strong European ( mostly English , Italian , Scottish , Scotch-Irish , Irish , German , French , Portuguese and Spanish American ) , African and some Native American components . Some other aspects of the historical and cultural development of the South have been influenced by the institution of slave labor on plantations in the Deep South to an extent seen nowhere else in the United States ; the presence of a large proportion of African Americans in the population ; support for the doctrine of states ' rights , and the legacy of racism magnified by the Civil War and Reconstruction Era , as seen in thousands of lynchings ( mostly from 1880 to 1930 ) , the segregated system of separate schools and public facilities known as Jim Crow laws , that lasted until the 1960s , and the widespread use of poll taxes and other methods to frequently deny black people of the right to vote or hold office until the 1960s .",

Submarines are referred to as boats rather than ships irrespective of their size . Although experimental submarines had been built before , submarine design took off during the 19th century , and they were adopted by several navies . Submarines were first widely used during World War I ( 1914-1918 ) , and are now used in many navies large and small . Military uses include attacking enemy surface ships ( merchant and military ) , or other submarines , aircraft carrier protection , blockade running , ballistic missile submarines as part of a nuclear strike force , reconnaissance , conventional land attack ( for example using a cruise missile ) , and covert insertion of special forces . Civilian uses for submarines include marine science , salvage , exploration and facility inspection and maintenance . Submarines can also be modified to perform more specialized functions such as search-and-rescue missions or undersea cable repair . Submarines are also used in tourism and undersea archaeology .

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

The current capitol building temporarily served as the Confederate Capitol while Montgomery served as the first political capital of the Confederate States of America in 1861 , before being moved to Richmond , Virginia . Meeting in the Senate Chamber , the Provisional Constitution of the Confederate States was drawn up by the Montgomery Convention on February 4 , 1861 . The convention also adopted the Permanent Constitution here on March 11 , 1861 .

  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country . [ f ] The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union . [ g ] The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years .",
  "/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America": "The Confederate States of America ( CSA or C.S . ) - commonly referred to as the Confederacy - was an unrecognized republic in North America that existed from 1861 to 1865 . The Confederacy was originally formed by seven secessionist slave-holding states - South Carolina , Mississippi , Florida , Alabama , Georgia , Louisiana , and Texas - in the Lower South region of the United States , whose economy was heavily dependent upon agriculture , particularly cotton , and a plantation system that relied upon the labor of African-American slaves . Convinced that the institution of slavery was threatened by the November 1860 election of Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln to the U.S. presidency on a platform which opposed the expansion of slavery into the western territories , the Confederacy declared its secession in rebellion against the United States , with the loyal states becoming known as the Union during the ensuing American Civil War . Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens described its ideology as being centrally based upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man ; that slavery , subordination to the superior race , is his natural and normal condition . Before Lincoln took office in March , a new Confederate government was established in February 1861 which was considered illegal by the government of the United States . States volunteered militia units , and the new government hastened to form its own Confederate States Army from nothing practically overnight . After the American Civil War began in April , four slave states of the Upper South - Virginia , Arkansas , Tennessee , and North Carolina - also seceded and joined the Confederacy . The Confederacy later accepted Missouri and Kentucky as members , although neither officially declared secession nor were they ever largely controlled by Confederate forces ; Confederate shadow governments attempted to control the two states but were later exiled from them . The government of the United States ( the Union ) rejected the claims of secession , considering it illegitimate . The war began April 12 , 1861 , when the Confederates attacked Fort Sumter , a Union fort in the harbor of Charleston , South Carolina . No foreign government ever officially recognized the Confederacy as an independent country , although Great Britain and France granted it belligerent status , which allowed Confederate agents to contract with private concerns for arms and other supplies .",

As a member of the Democratic Party , he represented Mississippi in the United States Senate and the House of Representatives before the American Civil War . He previously served as the United States Secretary of War from 1853 to 1857 under President Franklin Pierce . Davis was born in Fairview , Kentucky , to a moderately prosperous farmer , the youngest of ten children . He grew up in Wilkinson County , Mississippi , and also lived in Louisiana . His eldest brother Joseph Emory Davis secured the younger Davis 's appointment to the United States Military Academy . After graduating , Jefferson Davis served six years as a lieutenant in the United States Army . He fought in the Mexican-American War ( 1846-1848 ) , as the colonel of a volunteer regiment . Before the American Civil War , he operated a large cotton plantation in Mississippi , which his brother Joseph gave him , and owned as many as 113 slaves . Although Davis argued against secession in 1858 , he believed that states had an unquestionable right to leave the Union . Davis married Sarah Knox Taylor , daughter of general and future President Zachary Taylor , in 1835 , when he was 27 years old . They were both stricken with malaria soon thereafter , and Sarah died after three months of marriage .",
  "/wiki/Portico": "A portico is a porch leading to the entrance of a building , or extended as a colonnade , with a roof structure over a walkway , supported by columns or enclosed by walls . This idea was widely used in ancient Greece and has influenced many cultures , including most Western cultures . Some noteworthy examples of porticos are the East Portico of the United States Capitol , the portico adorning the Pantheon in Rome and the portico of University College London . Porticos are sometimes topped with pediments . Palladio was a pioneer of using temple-fronts for secular buildings . In the UK , the temple-front applied to The Vyne , Hampshire , was the first portico applied to an English country house .

  "/wiki/Congress_of_the_Confederate_States": "The Confederate States Congress was both the provisional and permanent legislative assembly of the Confederate States of America that existed from 1861 to 1865 . Its actions were for the most part concerned with measures to establish a new national government for the Southern revolution , and to prosecute a war that had to be sustained throughout the existence of the Confederacy . At first , it met as a provisional congress both in Montgomery , Alabama and Richmond , Virginia . The precursor to the permanent legislature was the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States , which helped establish the Confederacy as a state . Following elections held in states , refugee colonies and army camps in November 1861 , the 1st Confederate Congress met in four sessions . The 1863 elections led to many former Democrats losing to former Whigs . The 2nd Confederate Congress met in two sessions following an intersession during the military campaign season beginning November 7 , 1864 and ending on March 18 , 1865 , shortly before the downfall of the Confederacy . All legislative considerations of the Confederate Congress were secondary to winning the war for independence from the United States . These included debates whether to pass Jefferson Davis ' war measures and deliberations on alternatives to administration proposals , both of which were often denounced as discordant , regardless of the outcome . Congress was often held in low regard regardless what it did . Amidst early battlefield victories , few sacrifices were asked of the Southern people , and Congress and President Davis were in essential agreement . During the second half of the war , the Davis administration 's program became more demanding , and Congress responded by becoming more assertive in the law-making process even before the 1863 midterm elections .",

  "/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States": "Native Americans , also known as American Indians , Indigenous Americans and other terms , are the indigenous peoples of the United States , except Hawaii and territories of the United States . More than 570 federally recognized tribes live within the US , about half of which are associated with Indian reservations . The term American Indian excludes Native Hawaiians and some Alaskan Natives , while Native Americans ( as defined by the US Census ) are American Indians , plus Alaska Natives of all ethnicities . The US Census does not include Native Hawaiians or Chamorro , instead being included in the Census grouping of Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander . The ancestors of living Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago , possibly much earlier , from Asia via Beringia . A vast variety of peoples , societies and cultures subsequently developed . Native Americans were greatly affected by the European colonization of the Americas , which began in 1492 , and their population declined precipitously overwhelmingly due to introduced diseases as well as warfare , including biological warfare , territorial confiscation and slavery . After its creation , the United States , as part of its policy of settler colonialism , waged war and perpetrated massacres against many Native American peoples , removed them from their ancestral lands , and subjected them to one-sided treaties and to discriminatory government policies into the 20th century . Since the 1960s , Native American self-determination movements have resulted in changes to the lives of Native Americans , though there are still many contemporary issues faced by Native Americans . Today , there are over five million Native Americans in the United States , 78% of whom live outside reservations . When the United States was created , established Native American tribes were generally considered semi-independent nations , as they generally lived in communities separate from British settlers . The federal government signed treaties at a government-to-government level until the Indian Appropriations Act of 1871 ended recognition of independent native nations , and started treating them as domestic dependent nations subject to federal law .",

Their original homelands are in what now comprises southern Tennessee , all of Alabama , western Georgia and part of northern Florida . Like the Cherokees in northeastern Alabama , most of the Muscogee people were forcibly relocated from their original lands in the 1830s during the Trail of Tears to Indian Territory ( now Oklahoma ) . Some Muscogee fled European encroachment in 1797 and 1804 to establish two small tribal territories that continue to exist today in Louisiana and Texas . Another small branch of the Muscogee Creek Confederacy managed to remain in Alabama and is now known as the Poarch Band of Creek Indians . A large population of Muscogee people moved into Florida between roughly 1767 and 1821 and these people intermarried with local tribes to become the Seminole people , thereby establishing a separate identity from the Creek Confederacy . Muscogee people in these waves of migration into Florida were fleeing conflict and encroachment by European settlers . The great majority of Seminoles were also later forcibly relocated to Oklahoma , where they reside today , although the Seminole Tribe of Florida and Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida remain in Florida . The respective languages of all of these modern day branches , bands and tribes , except one , are all closely related variants called Muscogee , Mvskoke and Hitchiti-Mikasuki , all of which belong to the Eastern Muskogean branch of the Muscogean language family . All of these languages are , for the most part , mutually intelligible . The Yuchi people today are part of the Muscogee ( Creek ) Nation but their Yuchi language is a linguistic isolate , unrelated to any other language .

  "/wiki/Planter_(American_South)": "The planter class , known alternatively in the United States as the Southern aristocracy , was a socio-economic caste of Pan-American society that dominated seventeenth- and eighteenth-century agricultural markets through the forced labor of slaves of African origin . The Atlantic slave trade permitted planters access to inexpensive labor for the planting and harvesting of crops such as tobacco , cotton , indigo , coffee , tea , cocoa , sugar cane , sisal , oil seeds , oil palms , hemp , rubber trees , and fruits . Planters were considered part of the American gentry . In the Southern United States , planters maintained a distinct culture , characterized by its similarity to the manners and customs of the British nobility and gentry , whom many planters were related to . This culture had an emphasis on chivalry , gentility , and hospitality , the latter becoming a marked trait of modern Southern society . This Culture of the Southern United States , with its landed gentry , was distinctly different from areas north of the Mason-Dixon line and west of the Appalachians . The northern and western areas were characterized by small landed property , worked by yeoman farmers without slave labor . After the American Civil War ( 1861-1865 ) , many in this social class saw their wealth greatly reduced , as the enslaved Africans were freed . Union forces under Generals William Tecumseh Sherman and Phillip Sheridan had also cut wide swaths of destruction through portions of Virginia , the Carolinas and Georgia . The Union forces destroyed crops , killed or confiscated livestock , burned barns and gristmills , and in some cases torched plantation houses and even entire cities such as Atlanta , in using scorched earth tactics designed to starve the Confederacy into submission . After emancipation , many plantations were converted to sharecropping with African freedmen working as sharecroppers on the same land which they had worked as slaves before the war . During the Gilded Age , many plantations , no longer viable as agricultural operations , were purchased by wealthy northern industrialists as hunting retreats .",
  "/wiki/Doric_order": "The Doric order was one of the three orders of ancient Greek and later Roman architecture ; the other two canonical orders were the Ionic and the Corinthian . The Doric is most easily recognized by the simple circular capitals at the top of columns . Originating in the western Dorian region of Greece , it is the earliest and in its essence the simplest of the orders , though still with complex details in the entablature above . The Greek Doric column was fluted or smooth-surfaced , and had no base , dropping straight into the stylobate or platform on which the temple or other building stood . The capital was a simple circular form , with some mouldings , under a square cushion that is very wide in early versions , but later more restrained . Above a plain architrave , the complexity comes in the frieze , where the two features originally unique to the Doric , the triglyph and guttae , are skeuomorphic memories of the beams and retaining pegs of the wooden constructions that preceded stone Doric temples . In stone they are purely ornamental . The relatively uncommon Roman and Renaissance Doric retained these , and often introduced thin layers of moulding or further ornament , as well as often using plain columns . More often they used versions of the Tuscan order , elaborated for nationalistic reasons by Italian Renaissance writers , which is in effect a simplified Doric , with un-fluted columns and a simpler entablature with no triglyphs or guttae . The Doric order was much used in Greek Revival architecture from the 18th century onwards ; often earlier Greek versions were used , with wider columns and no bases to them . Since at least Vitruvius , it has been customary for writers to associate the Doric with masculine virtues ( the Ionic representing the feminine ) . It is also normally the cheapest of the orders to use .",
  "/wiki/Ionic_order": "The Ionic order forms one of the three classical orders of classical architecture , the other two canonic orders being the Doric and the Corinthian . There are two lesser orders : the Tuscan ( a plainer Doric ) , and the rich variant of Corinthian called the composite order , both added by 16th-century Italian architectural writers , based on Roman practice . Of the three canonic orders , the Ionic order has the narrowest columns . The Ionic capital is characterized by the use of volutes . The Ionic columns normally stand on a base which separates the shaft of the column from the stylobate or platform ; the cap is usually enriched with egg-and-dart . Since Vitruvius , a female character has been ascribed to the Ionic ( in contrast to the masculine Doric ) .",
  "/wiki/Corinthian_order": "The Corinthian order is the last developed of the three principal classical orders of ancient Greek and Roman architecture . The other two are the Doric order which was the earliest , followed by the Ionic order . When classical architecture was revived during the Renaissance , two more orders were added to the canon : the Tuscan order and the Composite order . The Corinthian , with its offshoot the Composite , is the most ornate of the orders . This architectural style is characterized by slender fluted columns and elaborate capitals decorated with acanthus leaves and scrolls . There are many variations . The name Corinthian is derived from the ancient Greek city of Corinth , although the style had its own model in Roman practice , following precedents set by the Temple of Mars Ultor in the Forum of Augustus ( c. 2 AD ) . It was employed in southern Gaul at the Maison Carr\u00e9e , N\u00eemes and at the comparable Temple of Augustus and Livia [ fr ] at Vienne . Other prime examples noted by Mark Wilson Jones are the lower order of the Basilica Ulpia and the Arch of Trajan at Ancona ( both of the reign of Trajan , 98-117 AD ) , the Column of Phocas ( re-erected in Late Antiquity but 2nd century in origin ) , and the Temple of Bacchus at Baalbek ( c. 150 AD ) .",
