To date , Bujold has never revisited the settings of Athos or Kline Station in her many subsequent novels , but the events of Ethan of Athos are later referred to indirectly in the novels Borders of Infinity ( 1989 ) and Cetaganda ( 1995 ) . Bujold had written her first novel Shards of Honor and its sequel The Warrior 's Apprentice - both unpublished - when she wrote Ethan of Athos , a standalone work that was purposely short because the current cargo-cult rumor amongst the wanna-be-published back then was that editors would be more likely to read a short manuscript . All three novels were subsequently sold , and published in 1986 . Bujold named Athos , a planet founded and maintained as an exclusively male-populated colony with a planetary religion and ideology supporting this single-sex structure , after the Greek Mount Athos , which has prohibited the entry of women for religious reasons since even before the ban was officially proclaimed by the Byzantine emperor Constantine Monomachos in 1046 . Ethan of Athos has been reprinted several times , and appeared in the 2001 Bujold omnibus Miles , Mystery and Mayhem alongside Cetaganda and the novella Labyrinth .
