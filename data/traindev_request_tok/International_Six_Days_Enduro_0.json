Carlisle is located at the confluence of the rivers Eden , Caldew and Petteril , 10 miles ( 16 km ) south of the Scottish border . Originally in the historic county of Cumberland , it is now the largest settlement in the county of Cumbria , and serves as the administrative centre for both Carlisle City Council and Cumbria County Council . At the time of the 2001 census , the population of Carlisle was 71,773 , with 100,734 living in the wider city . Ten years later , at the 2011 census , the city 's population had risen to 75,306 , with 107,524 in the wider city . The early history of Carlisle is marked by its status as a Roman settlement , established to serve the forts on Hadrian 's Wall . During the Middle Ages , because of its proximity to the Kingdom of Scotland , Carlisle became an important military stronghold ; Carlisle Castle , still relatively intact , was built in 1092 by William Rufus , and once served as a prison for Mary , Queen of Scots . The castle now houses the Duke of Lancaster 's Regiment and the Border Regiment Museum . In the early 12th century , Henry I allowed the foundation of a priory in Carlisle . The town gained the status of a city when its diocese was formed in 1133 , and the priory became Carlisle Cathedral . The introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution began a process of socioeconomic transformation in Carlisle , which developed into a densely populated mill town . This , combined with its strategic position , allowed for the development of Carlisle as an important railway town , with seven railway companies sharing Carlisle railway station .",

  "/wiki/World_War_I": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",
