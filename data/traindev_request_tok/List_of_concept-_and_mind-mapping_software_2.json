  "/wiki/3D_Topicscape": "3D Topicscape , a software application , is a Personal Information Manager that provides a template loosely based on mind-mapping or concept mapping . It presents the mind map as a 3D scene where each node is a cone ( or pyramid , or variation on such a shape ) . It can also display in a 2D format . Nodes are arranged in a way that indicates how they are related in much the same way as a mind map . In addition to its use for information management it is claimed to be suitable as a task manager , and for use in project management . A Topicscape is created by importing folders ( by Drag-and-drop or menus ) , importing from other mind mapping software including FreeMind , PersonalBrain and MindManager or by hand with mouse clicks or keyboard shortcuts . Import sources may be converted to a new Topicscape or added as a portion of an existing one . The number of levels that can be stored is not limited , but up to seven levels of the hierarchy may be viewed at once . Any node may be chosen as the centre of the 3D scene and choosing one at the edge will cause more to come into view . Topicscape 's most obvious difference from 2D mind mapping software is that it provides a zooming interface and simulates flying as noted by Wall Street Journal columnist Jeremy Wagstaff in his column Fly through your computer . The BBC World Service and PC World have also reviewed 3D Topicscape .",
  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

The Omni Group was informally founded as a NEXTSTEP consulting company in 1989 by Wil Shipley , who immediately brought on Ken Case and Tim Wood . The three incorporated together under the name Omni Development , Inc. in 1993 , because the name Omni Group was taken by another Seattle firm . Omni initially produced custom database software for the NEXTSTEP platform for clients such as the William Morris Agency and McCaw Cellular Communications ( then Cingular Wireless ; now AT & T Inc. ) . During this period they also ported a number of games to NEXTSTEP , then later to Mac OS X ( after Apple acquired NeXT in 1997 ) . Around 2000 the company decided to start focusing on their own consumer applications for the Mac , and as of 2004 the vast majority of their revenue came from their consumer products . In 2003 Ken Case took over as the chief officer of Omni , and in March 2004 Wil Shipley left with another Omni employee , interface designer Mike Matas , to form Delicious Monster . Matas later left for Apple . The Omni Group also administers several mailing lists related to macOS and software development . They also provide several frameworks for Cocoa software development under an open source license . OmniGraffle and OmniOutliner have won Macworld Editors ' Choice Awards . At the Macintosh Worldwide Developers Conference in 2001 , OmniWeb 4.0 won two Apple Design Awards : Best Mac OS X User Experience and Best New Mac OS X Product .",
