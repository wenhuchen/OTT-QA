  "/wiki/Troy_Trojans_(MLB_team)": "The Troy Trojans were a Major League Baseball team in the National League for four seasons from 1879 to 1882 . Their home games were played at Putnam Grounds ( 1879 ) and Haymakers ' Grounds ( 1880-1881 ) in the upstate New York city of Troy , and at Troy Ball Clubs Grounds ( 1882 ) across the Hudson in Watervliet , or West Troy as it was known at the time . The first Grand Slam home run in Major League history was hit by Roger Connor of this franchise in 1881 in East Albany ( now known as Rensselaer ) in what is now the Rensselaer Riverfront Park . The site in present day Rensselaer was infrequently used to host games when their normal field was unavailable . A baseball diamond in the park is currently in use very close to where the diamond would have been back in the 1880s . The site of the historic grand slam was only recently discovered as it was previously assumed to have occurred in eastern Albany . Overall , the franchise won 131 games and lost 194 . The Trojans , along with the Worcester NL team , were expelled from the league shortly before the end of the 1882 season , as Troy and Worcester were seen as too small for the league 's ambitions , but were encouraged to play out the rest of their seasons as lame-duck teams . On September 28 , 1882 , only six fans appeared to watch Worcester host the Trojans in the second-to-last game of the season , then only 25 arrived for the last game between the two teams . Among games that have had at least one paying attendee , the attendance figure of six is the lowest attendance ever recorded at a Major League baseball game . In 1883 the New York Gothams , later known as the Giants , took the Trojans ' former slot in the National League . Four of the original Gotham players were former members of the disbanded Trojans , including three Hall of Famers : Buck Ewing , Roger Connor and Mickey Welch .",
