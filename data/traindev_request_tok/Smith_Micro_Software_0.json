  "/wiki/United_States_Dollar": "The United States dollar ( sign : $ ; code : USD ; also abbreviated US $ and referred to as the dollar , U.S. dollar , or American dollar ) is the official currency of the United States and its territories per the Coinage Act of 1792 . One dollar is divided into 100 cents ( Symbol : \u00a2 ) or 1000 mills ( for accounting purposes and for taxing . Symbol : \u20a5 ) . The Coinage Act of 1792 created a decimal currency by creating the following coins : tenth dollar , one-twentieth dollar , one-hundredth dollar . In addition the act created the dollar , half dollar , and quarter dollar coins . All of these coins are still minted in 2020 . In addition , several forms of paper money were introduced by Congress over the years . The latest of these , the Federal Reserve Note , was authorized by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , while all existing U.S. currency remains legal tender . Issuance of the previous form of the currency ( U.S. notes ) was discontinued in January 1971 . As a result , currently circulating paper money consists primarily of Federal Reserve Notes that are denominated in United States dollars ( 12 U.S.C . \u00a7 418 ) . Since the suspension in 1971 of convertibility of paper U.S. currency into any precious metal , the U.S. dollar is de facto fiat money .",

  "/wiki/Software": "Computer software , or simply software , is a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work . This is in contrast to physical hardware , from which the system is built and actually performs the work . In computer science and software engineering , computer software is all information processed by computer systems , programs and data . Computer software includes computer programs , libraries and related non-executable data , such as online documentation or digital media . Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own . At the lowest programming level , [ clarification needed ] executable code consists of machine language instructions supported by an individual processor - typically a central processing unit ( CPU ) or a graphics processing unit ( GPU ) . A machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state . For example , an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer - an effect that is not directly observable to the user . An instruction may also invoke one of many input or output operations , for example displaying some text on a computer screen ; causing state changes which should be visible to the user . The processor executes the instructions in the order they are provided , unless it is instructed to jump to a different instruction , or is interrupted by the operating system . As of 2015 [ update ] , most personal computers , smartphone devices and servers have processors with multiple execution units or multiple processors performing computation together , and computing has become a much more concurrent activity than in the past . The majority of software is written in high-level programming languages .",
  "/wiki/Data_compression": "In signal processing , data compression , source coding , or bit-rate reduction is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation . Any particular compression is either lossy or lossless . Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy . No information is lost in lossless compression . Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information . Typically , a device that performs data compression is referred to as an encoder , and one that performs the reversal of the process ( decompression ) as a decoder . The process of reducing the size of a data file is often referred to as data compression . In the context of data transmission , it is called source coding ; encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted . Source coding should not be confused with channel coding , for error detection and correction or line coding , the means for mapping data onto a signal . Compression is useful because it reduces resources required to store and transmit data . Computational resources are consumed in the compression and decompression processes . Data compression is subject to a space-time complexity trade-off .",
  "/wiki/United_States": "The United States of America ( USA ) , commonly known as the United States ( U.S. or US ) or America , is a country consisting of 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . [ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",
  "/wiki/Image_editing": "Image editing encompasses the processes of altering images , whether they are digital photographs , traditional photo-chemical photographs , or illustrations . Traditional analog image editing is known as photo retouching , using tools such as an airbrush to modify photographs or editing illustrations with any traditional art medium . Graphic software programs , which can be broadly grouped into vector graphics editors , raster graphics editors , and 3D modelers , are the primary tools with which a user may manipulate , enhance , and transform images . Many image editing programs are also used to render or create computer art from scratch .",

It has land borders with Lebanon to the north , Syria to the northeast , Jordan on the east , the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west , respectively , and Egypt to the southwest . The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area . Israel 's economic and technological center is Tel Aviv , while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem , although the state 's sovereignty over Jerusalem has only partial recognition . [ fn 4 ] Israel has evidence of the earliest migration of hominids out of Africa . Canaanite tribes are archaeologically attested since the Middle Bronze Age , while the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah emerged during the Iron Age . The Neo-Assyrian Empire destroyed Israel around 720 BCE . Judah was later conquered by the Babylonian , Persian and Hellenistic empires and had existed as Jewish autonomous provinces . The successful Maccabean Revolt led to an independent Hasmonean kingdom by 110 BCE , which in 63 BCE however became a client state of the Roman Republic that subsequently installed the Herodian dynasty in 37 BCE , and in 6 CE created the Roman province of Judea . Judea lasted as a Roman province until the failed Jewish revolts resulted in widespread destruction , the expulsion of the Jewish population and the renaming of the region from Iudaea to Syria Palaestina . Jewish presence in the region has persisted to a certain extent over the centuries . In the 7th century CE , the Levant was taken from the Byzantine Empire by the Arabs and remained in Muslim control until the First Crusade of 1099 , followed by the Ayyubid conquest of 1187 .",
  "/wiki/Digital_distribution": "Digital distribution ( also referred to as content delivery , online distribution , or electronic software distribution ( ESD ) , among others ) is the delivery or distribution of digital media content such as audio , video , e-books , video games , and other software . The term is generally used to describe distribution over an online delivery medium , such as the Internet , thus bypassing physical distribution methods , such as paper , optical discs , and VHS videocassettes . The term online distribution is typically applied to freestanding products ; downloadable add-ons for other products are more commonly known as downloadable content . With the advancement of network bandwidth capabilities , online distribution became prominent in the 21st century , with prominent platforms such as Amazon Video , and Netflix 's streaming service starting in 2007 . Content distributed online may be streamed or downloaded , and often consists of books , films and television programs , music , software , and video games . Streaming involves downloading and using content at a user 's request , or on-demand , rather than allowing a user to store it permanently . In contrast , fully downloading content to a hard drive or other form of storage media may allow offline access in the future . Specialist networks known as content delivery networks help distribute content over the Internet by ensuring both high availability and high performance . Alternative technologies for content delivery include peer-to-peer file sharing technologies . Alternatively , content delivery platforms create and syndicate content remotely , acting like hosted content management systems . Unrelated to the above , the term Digital distribution is also used in film distribution to describe distribution of content through physical digital media , in opposition to distribution by analog media such as photographic film and magnetic tape ( see digital cinema ) .",

  "/wiki/Wireless": "Wireless communication - otherwise known as over the air - is the transfer of information or power between two or more points that are not connected by an electrical conductor . The most common wireless technologies use radio waves . With radio waves , intended distances can be short , such as a few meters for Bluetooth or as far as millions of kilometers for deep-space radio communications . It encompasses various types of fixed , mobile , and portable applications , including two-way radios , cellular telephones , personal digital assistants ( PDAs ) , and wireless networking . Other examples of applications of radio wireless technology include GPS units , garage door openers , wireless computer mouse , keyboards and headsets , headphones , radio receivers , satellite television , broadcast television and cordless telephones . Somewhat less common methods of achieving wireless communications include the use of other electromagnetic wireless technologies , such as light , magnetic , or electric fields or the use of sound . The term wireless has been used twice in communications history , with slightly different meaning . It was initially used from about 1890 for the first radio transmitting and receiving technology , as in wireless telegraphy , until the new word radio replaced it around 1920 . The term was revived in the 1980s and 1990s mainly to distinguish digital devices that communicate without wires , such as the examples listed in the previous paragraph , from those that require wires or cables . This became its primary usage in the 2000s , due to the advent of technologies such as mobile broadband , Wi-Fi and Bluetooth . Wireless operations permit services , such as mobile and interplanetary communications , that are impossible or impractical to implement with the use of wires . The term is commonly used in the telecommunications industry to refer to telecommunications systems ( e.g .",

  "/wiki/Portugal": "Portugal ( Portuguese : [ pu\u027etu\u02c8\u0263al ] ) , officially the Portuguese Republic ( Portuguese : Rep\u00fablica Portuguesa [ \u0281\u025b\u02c8pu\u03b2lik\u0250 pu\u027etu\u02c8\u0263ez\u0250 ] ) , [ note 5 ] is a country located mostly on the Iberian Peninsula , in southwestern Europe . It is the westernmost sovereign state of mainland Europe , being bordered to the west and south by the Atlantic Ocean and to the north and east by Spain . Its territory also includes the Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira , both autonomous regions with their own regional governments . Portugal is the oldest nation state on the Iberian Peninsula and one of the oldest in Europe and the world , its territory having been continuously settled , invaded and fought over since prehistoric times . The pre-Celtic people , Iberians , Celts , Carthaginians and Romans were followed by the invasions of the Visigoths and Suebi Germanic peoples . After the Muslim conquests of the Iberian Peninsula , most of the territory was part of Al-Andalus until their expulsion . Portugal as a country was established during the early Christian Reconquista . Founded in 868 , the County of Portugal gained prominence after the Battle of S\u00e3o Mamede in 1128 . The Kingdom of Portugal was later proclaimed following the Battle of Ourique in 1139 , and independence from Le\u00f3n was recognised by the Treaty of Zamora in 1143 . On 12 December 2017 , the Portuguese Navy commemorated the 700th anniversary of its official creation by King Denis of Portugal . Tracing its origins back to the 12th century , it is the oldest continuously serving navy in the world . In the 15th and 16th centuries , Portugal established the first global empire , becoming one of the world 's major economic , political and military powers ."
