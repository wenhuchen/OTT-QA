He came to public attention in July 2003 when an unauthorised discussion he had off the record with BBC journalist Andrew Gilligan about the UK Government 's dossier on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was cited by Gilligan and led to a major controversy . Kelly 's name became known to the media as Gilligan 's source and he was called to appear on 15 July before a parliamentary Foreign Affairs Select Committee investigating the issues Gilligan had reported . Kelly was questioned aggressively about his actions . He was found dead two days later . Prime Minister Tony Blair 's government set up the Hutton Inquiry , a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Kelly 's death . The inquiry concluded that Kelly had committed suicide , with the cause of death as haemorrhage due to incised wounds of the left wrist in combination with coproxamol ingestion and coronary artery atherosclerosis . Lord Hutton also decided that evidence related to the death , including the post-mortem report and photographs of the body , should remain classified for seventy years . Hutton said he had done so to protect Kelly 's family from the distress of further media reports about the death , and concealed no relevant evidence . In 2009 , Hutton 's verdict was challenged by a group of British doctors who had not had access to the evidence , including Michael Powers , who is also a barrister and former coroner . Offering their opinion based on published reports that the cause of death was untenable , they argued that the artery is small and difficult to access , and severing it would not have triggered sufficient blood loss to cause death . This opinion was challenged by several forensic pathologists who also had not had access to the evidence , who told The Guardian that the combination of Kelly 's heart disease and the overdose would have meant a smaller loss of blood could have killed him than would be needed to kill a healthier person .",
