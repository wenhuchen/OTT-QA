Such degrees are generally preparation for legal careers ; but while their curricula may be reviewed by legal authority , they do not themselves confer a license . A legal license is granted ( typically by examination ) and exercised locally ; while the law degree can have local , international , and world-wide aspects- e.g. , in Britain the Legal Practice Course is required to become a British solicitor or the Bar Professional Training Course ( BPTC ) to become a barrister .",
  "/wiki/Ghana": "Ghana ( /\u02c8\u0261\u0251\u02d0n\u0259/ ( listen ) ) , officially the Republic of Ghana , is a country located along the Gulf of Guinea and Atlantic Ocean , in the subregion of West Africa . Spanning a land mass of 238,535 km2 ( 92,099 sq mi ) , Ghana is bordered by the Ivory Coast in the west , Burkina Faso in the north , Togo in the east , and the Gulf of Guinea and Atlantic Ocean in the south . Ghana means Warrior King in the Soninke language . The first permanent state in the territory of present-day Ghana dates back to the 11th century . Numerous kingdoms and empires emerged over the centuries , of which the most powerful was the Kingdom of Ashanti . Beginning in the 15th century , numerous European powers contested the area for trading rights , with the British ultimately established control of the coast by the late 19th century . Following over a century of native resistance , Ghana 's current borders were established by the 1900s as the British Gold Coast . It became independent of the United Kingdom on 6 March 1957 . Ghana 's population of approximately 30 million spans a variety of ethnic , linguistic and religious groups . According to the 2010 census , 71.2% of the population was Christian , 17.6% was Muslim , and 5.2% practised traditional faiths . Its diverse geography and ecology ranges from coastal savannahs to tropical rain forests . Ghana is a unitary constitutional democracy led by a president who is both head of state and head of the government .",

Cairo is associated with ancient Egypt , as the famous Giza pyramid complex and the ancient city of Memphis are located in its geographical area . Located near the Nile Delta , Cairo was founded in 969 AD by the Fatimid dynasty , but the land composing the present-day city was the site of ancient national capitals whose remnants remain visible in parts of Old Cairo . Cairo has long been a centre of the region 's political and cultural life , and is titled the city of a thousand minarets for its preponderance of Islamic architecture . Cairo is considered a World City with a Beta + classification according to GaWC .

With a population of 5,200,000 , Alexandria is the largest city on the Mediterranean , the sixth-largest city in the Arab world and the ninth-largest in Africa . The city extends about 40 km ( 25 mi ) at the northern coast of Egypt along the Mediterranean Sea . Alexandria is a popular tourist destination , and also an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez . Alexandria was founded in c. 331 BC by Alexander the Great , king of Macedon and leader of the Greek League of Corinth , during his conquest of the Achaemenid Empire . An Egyptian village named Rhacotis existed at the location and grew into the Egyptian quarter of Alexandria . Alexandria grew rapidly to become an important center of Hellenistic civilization and remained the capital of Ptolemaic Egypt and Roman and Byzantine Egypt for almost 1,000 years , until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in AD 641 , when a new capital was founded at Fustat ( later absorbed into Cairo ) . Hellenistic Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria ( Pharos ) , one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World ; its Great Library ( the largest in the ancient world ) ; and the Necropolis , one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages . Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural center of the ancient Mediterranean world for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity . It was at one time the largest city in the ancient world before being eventually overtaken by Rome . The city was a major center of early Christianity and was the center of the Patriarchate of Alexandria , which was one of the major centers of Christianity in the Eastern Roman Empire . In the modern world , the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage .",

  "/wiki/Barrister": "A barrister is a type of lawyer in common law jurisdictions . Barristers mostly specialise in courtroom advocacy and litigation . Their tasks include taking cases in superior courts and tribunals , drafting legal pleadings , researching the philosophy , hypothesis and history of law , and giving expert legal opinions . Barristers are distinguished from solicitors , who have more direct access to clients , and may do transactional-type legal work . It is mainly barristers who are appointed as judges , and they are rarely hired by clients directly . In some legal systems , including those of Scotland , South Africa , Scandinavia , Pakistan , India , Bangladesh , and the British Crown dependencies of Jersey , Guernsey and the Isle of Man , the word barrister is also regarded as an honorific title . In a few jurisdictions , barristers are usually forbidden from conducting litigation , and can only act on the instructions of a solicitor , who performs tasks such as corresponding with parties and the court , and drafting court documents . In England and Wales , barristers may seek authorisation from the Bar Standards Board to conduct litigation . This allows a barrister to practise in a 'dual capacity ' , fulfilling the role of both barrister and solicitor . In some countries with common law legal systems , such as New Zealand and some regions of Australia , lawyers are entitled to practise both as barristers and solicitors , but it remains a separate system of qualification to practise exclusively as a barrister .",

After tampering with the lineside signals in order to bring the train to a halt , a gang of fifteen , led by Bruce Reynolds , attacked the train .

  "/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice": "The High Court of Justice in London , together with the Court of Appeal and the Crown Court , are the Senior Courts of England and Wales . Its name is abbreviated as EWHC for legal citation purposes . The High Court deals at first instance with all high value and high importance cases , and also has a supervisory jurisdiction over all subordinate courts and tribunals , with a few statutory exceptions . The High Court consists of three divisions : the Queen 's Bench Division , the Chancery Division , and the Family Division . Their jurisdictions overlap in some cases , and cases started in one division may be transferred by court order to another where appropriate . The differences of procedure and practice between divisions are partly historical , derived from the separate courts which were merged into the single High Court by the 19th-century Judicature Acts , but are mainly driven by the usual nature of their work , for example , conflicting evidence of fact is quite commonly given in person in the Queen 's Bench Division , but evidence by affidavit is more usual in the Chancery Division which is primarily concerned with points of law . Most High Court proceedings are heard by a single judge , but certain kinds of proceedings , especially in the Queen 's Bench Division , are assigned to a divisional court , a bench of two or more judges . Exceptionally the court may sit with a jury , but in practice normally only in defamation cases or cases against the police . Litigants are normally represented by counsel but may be represented by solicitors qualified to hold a right of audience , or they may act in person . In principle , the High Court is bound by its own previous decisions , but there are conflicting authorities as to what extent this is so . Appeal from the High Court in civil matters normally lies to the Court of Appeal , and thence in cases of importance to the Supreme Court ( the House of Lords before 2009 ) ; in some cases a leapfrog appeal may be made directly to the Supreme Court . In criminal matters appeals from the Queen 's Bench Divisional Court are made directly to the Supreme Court .",

At this trial , he was opposed to the king 's power to suspend laws in ecclesiastical matters , taking the view that there would be no parliament if this was allowed .

  "/wiki/Court_of_Common_Pleas_(England)": "The Court of Common Pleas , or Common Bench , was a common law court in the English legal system that covered common pleas ; actions between subject and subject , which did not concern the king . Created in the late 12th to early 13th century after splitting from the Exchequer of Pleas , the Common Pleas served as one of the central English courts for around 600 years . Authorised by Magna Carta to sit in a fixed location , the Common Pleas sat in Westminster Hall for its entire existence , joined by the Exchequer of Pleas and Court of King 's Bench . The court 's jurisdiction was gradually undercut by the King 's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas with legal fictions , the Bill of Middlesex and Writ of Quominus respectively . The Common Pleas maintained its exclusive jurisdiction over matters of real property until its dissolution , and due to its wide remit was considered by Sir Edward Coke to be the lock and key of the common law . It was staffed by one Chief Justice and a varying number of puisne justices , who were required to be Serjeants-at-Law , and until the mid 19th century only Serjeants were allowed to plead there . As one of the two principal common law courts with the King 's Bench , the Common Pleas fought to maintain its jurisdiction and caseload , in a way that during the 16th and 17th centuries was categorised as conservative and reactionary . Reaching an acceptable medium with the King 's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas proved to be the downfall of all three courts ; with several courts of near-identical jurisdiction , there was little need for separate bodies , and the superior courts of Westminster were merged by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 into a single High Court of Justice . With an Order in Council issued on 16 December 1880 , the Common Pleas Division of the High Court ceased to exist , marking the end of the Court of Common Pleas .",
  "/wiki/Court_of_King's_Bench_(England)": "The Court of King 's Bench ( or Court of Queen 's Bench during the reign of a female monarch ) , formally known as The Court of the King Before the King Himself , was an English court of common law in the English legal system . Created in the late 12th to early 13th century from the curia regis , the King 's Bench initially followed the monarch on his travels . The King 's Bench finally joined the Court of Common Pleas and Exchequer of Pleas in Westminster Hall in 1318 and making its last travels in 1421 . The King 's Bench was merged into the High Court of Justice by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 , after which point the King 's Bench was a division within the High Court . The King 's Bench was staffed by one Chief Justice ( now the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales ) and usually three Puisne Justices . In the 15th and 16th centuries , the King 's Bench 's jurisdiction and caseload was significantly challenged by the rise of the Court of Chancery and equitable doctrines as one of the two principal common law courts along with the Common Pleas . To recover , the King 's Bench undertook a scheme of revolutionary reform , creating less expensive , faster and more versatile types of pleading in the form of bills as opposed to the more traditional writs . Although not immediately stemming the tide , it helped the King 's Bench to recover and increase its workload in the long term . While there was a steep decline in business from 1460 to 1540 , as the new reforms began to take effect the King 's Bench 's business was significantly boosted ; between 1560 and 1640 , it rose tenfold . The Common Pleas became suspicious of the new developments , as legal fictions such as the Bill of Middlesex damaged its own business . Fighting against the King 's Bench in a reactionary and increasingly conservative way , an equilibrium was eventually reached in the 17th century until the merger in 1873 . The King 's Bench 's jurisdiction initially covered a wide range of criminal matters , any business not claimed by the other courts , and any cases concerning the monarch .",
  "/wiki/Seven_Bishops": "The Seven Bishops were members of the Church of England tried and acquitted for seditious libel in June 1688 . In November 1685 , James II dismissed the English Parliament for refusing to pass measures removing legal restrictions on Catholics and Protestant Nonconformists . In August 1686 , the Scottish Parliament suffered the same fate and neither body met again until 1689 . The measures were imposed in April 1687 by issuing a Declaration of Indulgence in both countries ; very few clergy in the Church of England or Church of Scotland actively promoted it , a reflection of opinion in their congregations . Some Nonconformists also opposed it , since many were more anti-Catholic than their colleagues in the national churches . In April 1688 , the Declaration was reissued and James ordered the bishops to have it read in every church in England . The seven 'petitioned ' to be excused , arguing it relied on an interpretation of Royal authority declared illegal by Parliament . After the petition was printed and publicly distributed , the bishops were charged with seditious libel and held in the Tower of London . They were tried and found not guilty on 30 June , a result that destroyed James ' political authority in both England and Scotland . The birth of James Francis on 10 June raised the prospect of a Catholic dynasty , while the trial resulted in widespread anti-Catholic riots throughout England and Scotland . The combination is seen as a key turning point in the process that resulted in the deposition of James in the November 1688 Glorious Revolution . The right to petition used by the bishops was included in the 1215 Magna Carta .",

Adjacent to the central buildings are the Wadham Gardens . Amongst Wadham 's most famous alumni is Sir Christopher Wren . Wren was one of a brilliant group of experimental scientists at Oxford in the 1650s , the Oxford Philosophical Club , which included Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke . This group held regular meetings at Wadham College under the guidance of the warden , John Wilkins , and the group formed the nucleus which went on to found the Royal Society . Wadham is a liberal and progressive college which aims to maintain the diversity of its student body and a friendly atmosphere . Founded as a men 's college , in 1974 it was among the first become coeducational , and the college has a strong reputation as a promoter of gay rights . In 2011 it became the first Oxford college to fly the rainbow flag as part of queer week , a celebration of sexual diversity and individuality .",

  "/wiki/Lord_Chief_Baron_of_the_Exchequer": "The Chief Baron of the Exchequer was the first baron ( i.e. , judge ) of the English Exchequer of Pleas . In the absence of both the Treasurer of the Exchequer or First Lord of the Treasury , and the Chancellor of the Exchequer , it was he who presided in the equity court and answered the bar i.e . spoke for the court . Practically speaking , he held the most important office of the Exchequer of Pleas . The chief baron , along with the three puisne barons , sat as a court of common law , heard suits in the court of equity , and settled revenue disputes . A puisne baron was styled Mr Baron X and the chief baron as Lord Chief Baron X . From 1550 to 1579 , there was a major distinction between the chief baron and the second , third and fourth puisne barons . The difference was in social status and education . All of the chief barons had been trained as lawyers in the inns of court . With the exception of Henry Bradshaw and Sir Clement Higham , both barristers-at-law , all of the chief barons who served Queen Elizabeth I , had attained the highest and most prestigious rank of a lawyer , serjeant-at-law . In 1875 , the Court of Exchequer became the Exchequer Division of the High Court . Following the death of the last chief baron in 1880 , the division and that of Common Pleas were merged into the Queen 's Bench Division .",

  "/wiki/Lord_Chancellor": "The Lord Chancellor , formally the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain , is the highest ranking among the Great Officers of State who are appointed regularly in the United Kingdom , nominally outranking the Prime Minister . The Lord Chancellor is outranked only by the Lord High Steward , another Great Officer of State , who is appointed only for the day of coronations . The Lord Chancellor is appointed by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister . Prior to the Union there were separate lord chancellors [ a ] for England and for Scotland ; there were Lord Chancellors of Ireland until 1922 . The Lord Chancellor is a member of the Cabinet and , by law , is responsible for the efficient functioning and independence of the courts . In 2007 , there were a number of changes to the legal system and to the office of the Lord Chancellor . Formerly , the Lord Chancellor was also the presiding officer of the House of Lords , the head of the judiciary in England and Wales and the presiding judge of the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice , but the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 transferred these roles to the Lord Speaker , the Lord Chief Justice and the Chancellor of the High Court respectively . The current Lord Chancellor , as at January 2020 , is Robert Buckland , who is also Secretary of State for Justice . One of the Lord Chancellor 's responsibilities is to act as the custodian of the Great Seal of the Realm , kept historically in the Lord Chancellor 's Purse . A Lord Keeper of the Great Seal may be appointed instead of a Lord Chancellor . The two offices entail exactly the same duties ; the only distinction is in the mode of appointment . Furthermore , the office of Lord Chancellor may be exercised by a committee of individuals known as Lords Commissioners of the Great Seal , usually when there is a delay between an outgoing chancellor and their replacement .",
  "/wiki/High_Steward_(academia)": "The High Steward in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge ( sometimes erroneously known as the Lord High Steward ) is a university official . Originally a deputy for the Chancellor , the office of High Steward had by the 18th century undergone the same evolution and become a position by which the universities honoured prominent external figures . The High Stewards still retain some functions relating to adjudication in disputes , appeals , and deputizing if there is a vacancy in the Chancellorship . In Oxford , the office of High Steward is now more similar to the office of Commissary in Cambridge . In Cambridge , the High Steward is elected by the members of the University Senate voting in person , one of that body 's few remaining functions , and holds office until he or she voluntarily resigns or until the Senate otherwise determines . The Deputy High Steward is appointed by the High Steward by Letters Patent . The High Steward and the Deputy High Steward perform such duties as have heretofore been customary and any duties prescribed by Statute or Ordinance . When the office of High Steward is vacant the duties of that office are performed by the Deputy High Steward . In Oxford , the High Steward is appointed by the Chancellor of the University .",

  "/wiki/Nuremberg_Trials": "A precedent for trying those accused of war crimes had been set at the end of World War I in the Leipzig War Crimes Trials held in May to July 1921 before the Reichsgericht ( German Supreme Court ) in Leipzig , although these had been on a very limited scale and largely regarded as ineffectual . At the beginning of 1940 , the Polish government-in-exile asked the British and French governments to condemn the German invasion of their country . The British initially declined to do so ; however , in April 1940 , a joint declaration was issued by the British , French and Polish . Relatively bland because of Anglo-French reservations , it proclaimed the trio 's desire to make a formal and public protest to the conscience of the world against the action of the German government whom they must hold responsible for these crimes which can not remain unpunished . Three-and-a-half years later , the stated intention to punish the Germans was much more trenchant . On 1 November 1943 , the Soviet Union , the United Kingdom and the United States published their Declaration on German Atrocities in Occupied Europe , which gave a full warning that , when the Nazis were defeated , the Allies would pursue them to the uttermost ends of the earth . in order that justice may be done . . The above declaration is without prejudice to the case of the major war criminals whose offences have no particular geographical location and who will be punished by a joint decision of the Government of the Allies . This intention by the Allies to dispense justice was reiterated at the Yalta Conference and at Potsdam in 1945 . British War Cabinet documents , released on 2 January 2006 , showed that as early as December 1944 the Cabinet had discussed their policy for the punishment of the leading Nazis if captured . The British Prime Minister , Winston Churchill , had then advocated a policy of summary execution in some circumstances , with the use of an Act of Attainder to circumvent legal obstacles , being dissuaded from this only by talks with US and Soviet leaders later in the war ."
