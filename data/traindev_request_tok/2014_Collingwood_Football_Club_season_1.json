  "/wiki/Australian_rules_football_positions": "In the sport of Australian rules football , each of the eighteen players in a team is assigned to a particular named position on the field of play . These positions describe both the player 's main role and by implication their location on the ground . As the game has evolved , tactics and team formations have changed , and the names of the positions and the duties involved have evolved too . There are 18 positions in Australian rules football , not including four ( sometimes 6-8 ) interchange players who may replace another player on the ground at any time during play . The fluid nature of the modern game means the positions in football are not as formally defined as in sports such as rugby or American football . Even so , most players will play in a limited range of positions throughout their career , as each position requires a particular set of skills . Footballers who are able to play comfortably in numerous positions are referred to as utility players .",
