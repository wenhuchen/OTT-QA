  "/wiki/A_Doll's_House": "A Doll 's House ( Danish and Bokm\u00e5l : Et dukkehjem ; also translated as A Doll House ) is a three-act play written by Norway 's Henrik Ibsen . It premiered at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen , Denmark , on 21 December 1879 , having been published earlier that month . The play is set in a Norwegian town circa 1879 . The play is significant for the way it deals with the fate of a married woman , who at the time in Norway lacked reasonable opportunities for self-fulfillment in a male-dominated world , despite the fact that Ibsen denies it was his intent to write a feminist play . It aroused a great sensation at the time , and caused a storm of outraged controversy that went beyond the theatre to the world newspapers and society . In 2006 , the centennial of Ibsen 's death , A Doll 's House held the distinction of being the world 's most performed play that year . UNESCO has inscribed Ibsen 's autographed manuscripts of A Doll 's House on the Memory of the World Register in 2001 , in recognition of their historical value . The title of the play is most commonly translated as A Doll 's House , though some scholars use A Doll House . John Simon says that A Doll 's House is the British term for what [ Americans ] call a 'dollhouse ' . Egil T\u00f6rnqvist says of the alternative title : Rather than being superior to the traditional rendering , it simply sounds more idiomatic to Americans .",

  "/wiki/Measure_for_Measure": "Measure for Measure is a play by William Shakespeare , believed to have been written in 1603 or 1604 . Originally published in the First Folio of 1623 , where it was listed as a comedy , the play 's first recorded performance occurred in 1604 . The play 's main themes include justice , morality and mercy in Vienna , and the dichotomy between corruption and purity : some rise by sin , and some by virtue fall . Mercy and virtue prevail , as the play does not end tragically , with virtues such as compassion and forgiveness being exercised at the end of the production . While the play focuses on justice overall , the final scene illustrates that Shakespeare intended for moral justice to temper strict civil justice : a number of the characters receive understanding and leniency , instead of the harsh punishment to which they , according to the law , could have been sentenced . Measure for Measure is often called one of Shakespeare 's problem plays . It continues to be classified as a comedy , albeit a dark one , though its tone may defy those expectations .",
