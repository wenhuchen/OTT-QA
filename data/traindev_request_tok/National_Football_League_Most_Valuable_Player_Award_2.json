They compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member club of the league 's National Football Conference ( NFC ) East division . The team plays its home games at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford , New Jersey , which it shares with the New York Jets . The Giants hold their summer training camp at the Quest Diagnostics Training Center at the Meadowlands Sports Complex . The Giants were one of five teams that joined the NFL in 1925 , and are the only one of that group still existing , as well as the league 's longest-established team in the Northeastern United States . The team ranks third among all NFL franchises with eight NFL championship titles : four in the pre-Super Bowl era ( 1927 , 1934 , 1938 , 1956 ) and four since the advent of the Super Bowl ( XXI ( 1986 ) , XXV ( 1990 ) , XLII ( 2007 ) , and XLVI ( 2011 ) ) , along with more championship appearances than any other team , with 19 overall appearances .

To distinguish themselves from the professional baseball team of the same name , the football team was incorporated as the New York National League Football Company , Inc. in 1929 and changed to New York Football Giants , Inc. in 1937 . While the baseball team moved to San Francisco after the 1957 season , the football team continues to use New York Football Giants , Inc. as its legal corporate name , and is often referred to by fans and sportscasters as the New York Football Giants . The team has also acquired several nicknames , including Big Blue , the G-Men , and the Jints , an intentionally mangled contraction seen frequently in the New York Post and New York Daily News , originating from the baseball team when they were based in New York .",
  "/wiki/Center_(American_football)": "Center ( C ) is a position in gridiron football . The center is the innermost lineman of the offensive line on a football team 's offense . The center is also the player who passes ( or snaps ) the ball between his legs to the quarterback at the start of each play . In recent years , the importance of centers for a football team has increased , due to the re-emergence of 3-4 defenses . According to Baltimore Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome , you need to have somebody who can neutralize that nose tackle . If you do n't , everything can get screwed up . Your running game wo n't be effective and you 'll also have somebody in your quarterback 's face on every play .",
  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",

When the principal ball carrier lines up deep in the backfield , and especially when that player is placed behind another player ( usually a blocking back ) , as in the I formation , that player is instead referred to as a tailback ( see History below ) . The halfback position is one of the more glamorous positions on the field , and is commonly viewed as a requirement for a team 's success . Sometimes the halfback can catch the ball from the backfield on short passing plays as he is an eligible receiver . Occasionally , they line up as additional wide receivers . When not running or catching the ball , the primary responsibility of a halfback is to aid the offensive linemen in blocking , either to protect the quarterback or another player carrying the football .",
