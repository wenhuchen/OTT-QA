A trainer aircraft based on the Pilatus PC-9 , the T-6 has replaced the Air Force 's Cessna T-37B Tweet and the Navy 's T-34C Turbo Mentor . The T-6A is used by the United States Air Force for basic pilot training and Combat Systems Officer ( CSO ) training , the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps for primary and intermediate Naval Flight Officer ( NFO ) training , and by the Royal Canadian Air Force ( CT-156 Harvard II designation ) , Greek Air Force , Israeli Air Force ( with the Efroni nickname ) , and Iraqi Air Force for basic flight training . The T-6B is the primary trainer for U.S. student naval aviators ( SNAs ) . The T-6C is used for training by the Mexican Air Force , Royal Air Force , Royal Moroccan Air Force , and the Royal New Zealand Air Force .",
  "/wiki/Naval_Air_Training_Command": "The Naval Air Training Command ( NATRACOM ) is a one star command that conducts flight training of student Naval Aviators , and Naval Flight Officers . Though it does not conduct Naval Aircrew training which is conducted by Naval Education and Training Command 's Naval Aviation Schools Command ( NASC ) , it is responsible for monitoring the production of Aircrewmen through the Naval Aviator Production Process ( NAPP ) . Through the NAPP , NATRACOM is also responsible for programming and monitoring the production of all ( currently 19 ) Navy and Marine Corps Fleet Replacement Squadrons . It conducts operations aboard five Naval Air Stations in three states . The Mission of Naval Air Training Command is to train the worlds finest combat quality aviation professionals , delivering them at the right time , in the right numbers , and at the right cost . Commanded by Rear Admiral Gregory Harris , the Chief of Naval Air Training ( CNATRA ) , CNATRA and NATRACOM are headquartered on board Naval Air Station Corpus Christi , Texas . As recently as 2009 , NATRACOM 's 739 aircraft logged 358,449 flight hours , nearly a third of the Department of the Navy total for that fiscal year . To put those numbers in perspective , CNATRA flew 28% of the combined Navy and Marine Corps flight hours with 19% of the aircraft . In that same time more than 2,400 Naval Aviators , Naval Flight Officers ( NFO ) and Naval Aircrewmen earned their Wings of Gold .",

  "/wiki/Naval_Flight_Officer": "A Naval Flight Officer ( NFO ) is a commissioned officer in the United States Navy or United States Marine Corps who specializes in airborne weapons and sensor systems . NFOs are not pilots ( naval aviators ) per se , but they may perform many co-pilot functions , depending on the type of aircraft . Until 1966 , their duties were performed by both commissioned officer and senior enlisted naval aviation observers ( NAO ) . In 1966 , enlisted personnel were removed from naval aviation observer duties but continued to serve in enlisted aircrew roles , while NAO officers received the newly established NFO designation , and the NFO insignia was introduced . NFOs in the US Navy all begin their careers as unrestricted line officers ( URL ) , eligible for command at sea and ashore in the various naval aviation aircraft type/model/series ( T/M/S ) communities and , at a senior level , in command of carrier air wings and aircraft carriers afloat and functional air wings , naval air stations and other activities ashore . They are also eligible for promotion to senior flag rank positions , including command of aircraft carrier strike groups , expeditionary strike groups , joint task forces , numbered fleets , naval component commands and unified combatant commands . A small number of US Navy NFOs have later opted for a lateral transfer to the restricted line ( RL ) as aeronautical engineering duty officers ( AEDO ) , while continuing to retain their NFO designation and active flight status . Such officers are typically graduates of the U.S . Naval Test Pilot School and/or the U.S . Naval Postgraduate School with advanced academic degrees in aerospace engineering or similar disciplines . AEDO/NFOs are eligible to command test and evaluation squadrons , naval air test centers , naval air warfare centers , and hold major program management responsibilities within the Naval Air Systems Command ( NAVAIR ) . Similarly , Marine Corps NFOs are also considered eligible for command at sea and ashore within Marine aviation , and are also eligible to hold senior general officer positions , such as command of Marine aircraft wings , Marine air-ground task forces ( MAGTFs ) , joint task forces , Marine expeditionary forces , Marine Corps component commands and unified combatant commands .",
  "/wiki/NAS_Pensacola": "Naval Air Station Pensacola or NAS Pensacola ( IATA : NPA , ICAO : KNPA , FAA LID : NPA ) ( formerly NAS/KNAS until changed circa 1970 to allow Nassau International Airport , now Lynden Pindling International Airport , to have IATA code NAS ) , The Cradle of Naval Aviation , is a United States Navy base located next to Warrington , Florida , a community southwest of the Pensacola city limits . It is best known as the initial primary training base for all U.S. Navy , Marine Corps and Coast Guard officers pursuing designation as naval aviators and naval flight officers , the advanced training base for most naval flight officers , and as the home base for the United States Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron , the precision-flying team known as the Blue Angels . Because of contamination by heavy metals and other hazardous materials during its history , it is designated as a Superfund site needing environmental cleanup . The air station also hosts the Naval Education and Training Command ( NETC ) and the Naval Aerospace Medical Institute ( NAMI ) , the latter of which provides training for all naval flight surgeons , aviation physiologists , and aerospace experimental psychologists . With the closure of Naval Air Station Memphis in Millington , Tennessee , and the transition of that facility to Naval Support Activity Mid-South , NAS Pensacola also became home to the Naval Air Technical Training Center ( NATTC ) Memphis , which relocated to Pensacola and was renamed NATTC Pensacola . NATTC provides technical training schools for nearly all enlisted aircraft maintenance and enlisted aircrew specialties in the U.S. Navy , U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Coast Guard . The NATTC facility at NAS Pensacola is also home to the USAF Detachment 1 , a geographically separated unit ( GSU ) whose home unit is the 359th Training Squadron located at nearby Eglin AFB . Detachment 1 trains over 1,100 airmen annually in three structural maintenance disciplines : low observable , non-destructive inspection , and aircraft structural maintenance . NAS Pensacola contains Forrest Sherman Field , home of Training Air Wing SIX ( TRAWING 6 ) , providing undergraduate flight training for all prospective naval flight officers for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps , and flight officers/navigators for other NATO/Allied/Coalition partners . TRAWING SIX consists of the Training Squadron 4 ( VT-4 ) Warbucks , Training Squadron 10 ( VT-10 ) Wildcats and Training Squadron 86 ( VT-86 ) Sabrehawks , flying the T-45C Goshawk and T-6A Texan II . A select number of prospective U.S. Air Force navigator/combat systems officers , destined for certain fighter/bomber or heavy aircraft , were previously trained via TRAWING SIX , under VT-4 or VT-10 , with command of VT-10 rotating periodically to a USAF officer . This previous track for USAF navigators was termed Joint Undergraduate Navigator Training ( JUNT ) .",

  "/wiki/Beechcraft_King_Air": "The Beechcraft King Air family is part of a line of American utility aircraft produced by Beechcraft . The King Air line comprises a number of twin-turboprop models that have been divided into two families . The Model 90 and 100 series developed in the 1960s are known as King Airs , while the later T-tail Model 200 and 300 series were originally marketed as Super King Airs , with the name Super being dropped by Beechcraft in 1996 ( although it is still often used to differentiate the 200 and 300 series King Airs from their smaller stablemates ) . The King Air was the first aircraft in its class and has been in continuous production since 1964 . It has outsold all of its turboprop competitors combined . It now faces competition from jet aircraft such as the Embraer Phenom 100 , Honda HA-420 HondaJet and Cessna Citation Mustang ; as well as from newer turboprop aircraft including the Piaggio P180 Avanti , and single-engine Piper Malibu Meridian , Pilatus PC-12 , and Socata TBM .",
