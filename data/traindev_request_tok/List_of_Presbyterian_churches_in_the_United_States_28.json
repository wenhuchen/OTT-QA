Effective January 26 , 1995 , it again became a borough . Grover Cleveland , the 22nd and 24th President of the United States , and the only president to serve two non-consecutive terms , was born in Caldwell on March 18 , 1837 . His father , Rev . Richard Falley Cleveland , was pastor of the First Presbyterian Church . The Grover Cleveland birthplace - the church 's former rectory - is now a museum and is open to the public .

When it was formed , miles of woods separated downtown Caldwell from Newark or any of its developing suburbs .
