According to Hood , he attempted to weave together what we know about Austen 's world from her books and letters , and believed Austen 's personal life was the inspiration for Pride and Prejudice . Jarrold began production of the film in early 2006 , opting to shoot primarily in Ireland as he found it had better-preserved locations than Hampshire , England , where Austen was raised . Released firstly in the United Kingdom on 9 March 2007 and in other countries later in the year , Becoming Jane earned approximately $ 37 million worldwide .
