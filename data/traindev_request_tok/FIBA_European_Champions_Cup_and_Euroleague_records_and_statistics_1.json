For much of the High and Late Middle Ages , Split enjoyed autonomy as a free city of the Dalmatian city-states , caught in the middle of a struggle between Venice and Croatia ( in union with Hungary ) for control over the Dalmatian cities . Venice eventually prevailed and during the early modern period Split remained a Venetian city , a heavily fortified outpost surrounded by Ottoman territory . Its hinterland was won from the Ottomans in the Morean War of 1699 , and in 1797 , as Venice fell to Napoleon , the Treaty of Campo Formio rendered the city to the Habsburg Monarchy . In 1805 , the Peace of Pressburg added it to the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy and in 1806 it was included in the French Empire , becoming part of the Illyrian Provinces in 1809 .",

'White City ' , pronounced [ be\u01d2\u0261rad ] ( listen ) ; names in other languages ) is the capital and largest city of Serbia . It is located at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers and the crossroads of the Pannonian Plain and the Balkan Peninsula . The urban area of Belgrade has a population of 1.23 million , while nearly 1.7 million people live within the administrative limits of the City of Belgrade ( which encompasses almost all of its metropolitan area ) , a quarter of the total population of Serbia . One of the most important prehistoric cultures of Europe , the Vin\u010da culture , evolved within the Belgrade area in the 6th millennium BC . In antiquity , Thraco-Dacians inhabited the region and , after 279 BC , Celts settled the city , naming it Singid\u016bn . It was conquered by the Romans under the reign of Augustus and awarded Roman city rights in the mid-2nd century . It was settled by the Slavs in the 520s , and changed hands several times between the Byzantine Empire , the Frankish Empire , the Bulgarian Empire , and the Kingdom of Hungary before it became the seat of the Serbian king Stefan Dragutin in 1284 . In 1521 , Belgrade was conquered by the Ottoman Empire and became the seat of the Sanjak of Smederevo . It frequently passed from Ottoman to Habsburg rule , which saw the destruction of most of the city during the Austro-Ottoman wars . Belgrade was again named the capital of Serbia in 1841 . Northern Belgrade remained the southernmost Habsburg post until 1918 , when it was attached to the city , due to former Austro-Hungarian territories becoming the part of the new Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes after World War I .",
