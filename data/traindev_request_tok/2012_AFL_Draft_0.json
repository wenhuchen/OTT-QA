He spent most of the season developing in Carlton 's VFL-affiliate , the Northern Bullants . In 2006 , he broke into the senior team , playing ten games , mostly off the bench . Russell expressed his desire to move back to South Australia for the 2007 season , with Port Adelaide seeking to trade for him , but no deal was made between the two clubs , and Russell re-signed with Carlton on 16 October 2006 to a two-year deal . In 2007 , Russell played 18 games , but had not yet stamped himself as a definite future player . Under coach Denis Pagan , he struggled for game time , and usually played completely defensive tagging roles , with reasonable success . Pagan was replaced as coach by Brett Ratten in late 2007 , and he began to play Russell in the midfield and half-forward line . He played 21 of 22 games in 2008 , and earned another two-year contract . In 2009 , Russell played 20 of 23 games , but was dropped briefly at midseason on form . This turned out to be a major turning point in Russell 's career , as his form upon return to the seniors was outstanding .",
