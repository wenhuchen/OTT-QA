  "/wiki/Afrikaans": "Afrikaans ( UK : /\u02cc\u00e6fr\u026a\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0ns/ , US : /\u02cc\u0251\u02d0f-/ ) is a West Germanic language spoken in South Africa , Namibia and , to a lesser extent , Botswana and Zimbabwe . It evolved from the Dutch vernacular of Holland ( Hollandic dialect ) spoken by the largely Dutch settlers ( and then by the native Africans who associated with them ) in the south-west of what is now South Africa , where it gradually began to develop distinguishing characteristics in the course of the 18th century . Hence , it is a daughter language of Dutch . Although Afrikaans has adopted words from other languages , including German and the Khoisan languages , an estimated 90 to 95% of the vocabulary of Afrikaans is of Dutch origin . [ note 1 ] Therefore , differences with Dutch often lie in the more analytic-type morphology and grammar of Afrikaans , and a spelling that expresses Afrikaans pronunciation rather than standard Dutch . There is a large degree of mutual intelligibility between the two languages - especially in written form . With about 7 million native speakers in South Africa , or 13.5% of the population , it is the third-most-spoken language in the country . Estimates of the total number of Afrikaans speakers range between 15 and 23 million . [ note 2 ] It has the widest geographical and racial distribution of all the 11 official languages of South Africa , and is widely spoken and understood as a second or third language . [ note 3 ] It is the majority language of the western half of South Africa - the provinces of the Northern Cape and Western Cape - and the first language of 75.8% of Coloured South Africans ( 4.8 million people ) , 60.8% of White South Africans ( 2.7 million ) ; 4.6% of Asian South Africans ( 58,000 people ) , and 1.5% of Black South Africans ( 600,000 people ) .",

  "/wiki/English_language": "English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and eventually became a global lingua franca . It is named after the Angles , one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name , as England . Both names derive from Anglia , a peninsula in the Baltic Sea . The language is closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon , and its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages , particularly Norse ( a North Germanic language ) , and to a greater extent by Latin and French . English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years . The earliest forms of English , a group of West Germanic ( Ingvaeonic ) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century , are collectively called Old English . Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England ; this was a period in which the language was influenced by French . Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London , the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift . Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States . Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries , English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science , navigation and law . English is the largest language by number of speakers , and the third most-spoken native language in the world , after Standard Chinese and Spanish . It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states .",
