The name New College , however , soon came to be used following its completion in 1386 to distinguish it from the older existing college of St Mary , now known as Oriel College . In 2017 , the college ranked first in the Norrington Table , a table assessing the relative performance of Oxford 's undergraduates in final examinations . Historically , it has been ranked highly . It has the 3rd highest average Norrington Table ranking over the previous decade . The college is between Holywell Street and New College Lane ( known for Oxford 's Bridge of Sighs ) , next to All Souls College , Harris Manchester College , Hertford College , The Queen 's College and St Edmund Hall .

  "/wiki/Entomologist": "Entomology ( from Ancient Greek \u1f14\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd ( entomon ) , meaning 'insect ' , and -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 ( -logia ) , meaning 'study of ' ) is the scientific study of insects , a branch of zoology . In the past the term insect was vaguer , and historically the definition of entomology included the study of terrestrial animals in other arthropod groups or other phyla , such as arachnids , myriapods , earthworms , land snails , and slugs . This wider meaning may still be encountered in informal use . Like several of the other fields that are categorized within zoology , entomology is a taxon-based category ; any form of scientific study in which there is a focus on insect-related inquiries is , by definition , entomology . Entomology therefore overlaps with a cross-section of topics as diverse as molecular genetics , behavior , biomechanics , biochemistry , systematics , physiology , developmental biology , ecology , morphology , and paleontology . At some 1.3 million described species , insects account for more than two-thirds of all known organisms , date back some 400 million years , and have many kinds of interactions with humans and other forms of life on earth .",

His best known works on marine larvae were his poems published as Larval Forms and Other Zoological Verses , especially The Ballad of the Veliger . They describe the form and function of several marine larvae as well as illustrating some controversies in evolutionary biology of the time . Garstang was known for his vehement opposition to Ernst Haeckel 's Biogenetic Law , now discredited .

The college was founded in 1592 by Queen Elizabeth I as the mother of a university that was modeled after the collegiate universities of Oxford and Cambridge , but unlike these institutions , only one college was ever established ; as such , the designations Trinity College and University of Dublin are usually synonymous for practical purposes . The college is legally incorporated by the Provost , Fellows , Foundation Scholars and other members of the Board as outlined by its founding charter . It is one of the seven ancient universities of Britain and Ireland , as well as Ireland 's oldest surviving university . Trinity College is widely considered the most prestigious university in Ireland , in part due to its extensive history . It is consistently ranked as one of the top universities in Europe , and is particularly acclaimed in the fields of Law , Literature and Humanities . In accordance with the formula of ad eundem gradum , a form of recognition that exists among the three universities , a graduate of Oxford , Cambridge , or Dublin can be conferred with the equivalent degree at either of the other two universities without further examination . Trinity College , Dublin is a sister college to St John 's College , Cambridge and Oriel College , Oxford . Originally Trinity was established outside the city walls of Dublin in the buildings of the outlawed Catholic Augustinian Priory of All Hallows . Trinity College was set up in part to consolidate the rule of the Tudor monarchy in Ireland , and as a result was the university of the Protestant Ascendancy for much of its history . While Catholics were admitted from 1793 , certain restrictions on membership of the college remained , as professorships , fellowships and scholarships were reserved for Protestants . These restrictions were lifted by Act of Parliament in 1873 .",

He invented the term sympatric for evolution of species in the same place , and in his book The Colours of Animals ( 1890 ) was the first to recognise frequency-dependent selection . Poulton is also remembered for his pioneering work on animal coloration .
