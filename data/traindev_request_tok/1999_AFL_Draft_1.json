Priority draft picks are additional draft picks , located at or near the start of the draft , which are given only to the poorest performing teams , to provide additional help for those teams to improve on-field performances in future years . Prior to 2012 , a team automatically received a priority draft pick if its win-loss record met pre-defined eligibility criteria ; since 2012 , priority draft picks will be awarded on a discretionary basis by the AFL commission . The priority draft pick has been the consistent subject of controversy , as several poor-performing teams have been accused of tanking during the later part of the season to ensure that they qualify for the additional draft pick .",
