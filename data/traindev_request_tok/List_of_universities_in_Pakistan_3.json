It lies about 32 km ( 20 mi ) north-west of Islamabad and Rawalpindi , just off the famous Grand Trunk Road . Ancient Taxila was situated at the pivotal junction of the Indian subcontinent and Central Asia . The origin of Taxila as a city goes back to c. 1000 BCE . Some ruins at Taxila date to the time of the Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century BCE , followed successively by Mauryan Empire , Indo-Greek , Indo-Scythian , and Kushan Empire periods . Owing to its strategic location , Taxila has changed hands many times over the centuries , with many empires vying for its control . When the great ancient trade routes connecting these regions ceased to be important , the city sank into insignificance and was finally destroyed by the nomadic Hunas in the 5th century . The renowned archaeologist Sir Alexander Cunningham rediscovered the ruins of Taxila in the mid-19th century . In 1980 , Taxila was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site . In 2006 it was ranked as the top tourist destination in Pakistan by The Guardian newspaper . By some accounts , the University of Ancient Taxila was considered to be one of the earliest ( or the earliest ) universities in the world . Others do not consider it a university in the modern sense , in that the teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges , and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in Taxila , in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India .",
