The passenger manifest was lost with the collision , but the sinking of Lady Elgin resulted in the loss of about 300 lives in what was called one of the greatest marine horrors on record . Four years after the disaster , a new rule required sailing vessels to carry running lights . The Lady Elgin disaster remains the greatest loss of life on open water in the history of the Great Lakes . In 1994 , a process began to list the shipwreck on the National Register of Historic Places . After it was determined to be eligible for listing in 1999 , the process ended after an objection by the owner , so the shipwreck is not listed on the Register .",

After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 , which destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless , the city made a concerted effort to rebuild . The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades , and by 1900 , less than 30 years after the great fire , Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world . Chicago made noted contributions to urban planning and zoning standards , including new construction styles ( including the Chicago School of architecture ) , the development of the City Beautiful Movement , and the steel-framed skyscraper . Chicago is an international hub for finance , culture , commerce , industry , education , technology , telecommunications , and transportation . It is the site of the creation of the first standardized futures contracts , issued by the Chicago Board of Trade , which today is the largest and most diverse derivatives market in the world , generating 20% of all volume in commodities and financial futures alone .

  "/wiki/Flood": "A flood is an overflow of water that submerges land that is usually dry . In the sense of flowing water , the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tide . Floods are an area of study of the discipline hydrology and are of significant concern in agriculture , civil engineering and public health . Flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies , such as a river , lake , or ocean , in which the water overtops or breaks levees , resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries , or it may occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground in an areal flood . While the size of a lake or other body of water will vary with seasonal changes in precipitation and snow melt , these changes in size are unlikely to be considered significant unless they flood property or drown domestic animals . Floods can also occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the capacity of the river channel , particularly at bends or meanders in the waterway . Floods often cause damage to homes and businesses if they are in the natural flood plains of rivers . While riverine flood damage can be eliminated by moving away from rivers and other bodies of water , people have traditionally lived and worked by rivers because the land is usually flat and fertile and because rivers provide easy travel and access to commerce and industry . Some floods develop slowly , while others can develop in just a few minutes and without visible signs of rain . Additionally , floods can be local , impacting a neighborhood or community , or very large , affecting entire river basins .",

California , Arizona and New Mexico , which are geographically in the southern part of the country , are rarely considered part , while West Virginia , which separated from Virginia in 1863 , commonly is . Some scholars have proposed definitions of the South that do not coincide neatly with state boundaries . While the states of Delaware and Maryland , as well as the District of Columbia , permitted slavery prior to and during the Civil War , they remained with the Union . Since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s , they became more culturally , economically , and politically aligned with the industrial Northern states , and are often identified as part of the Mid-Atlantic or Northeast by many residents , businesses , public institutions , and private organizations ; however , the United States Census Bureau continues to define them as in the South with regard to census regions . Usually , the South is defined as including the southeastern and south-central United States .

  "/wiki/Fire": "Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the exothermic chemical process of combustion , releasing heat , light , and various reaction products . Slower oxidative processes like rusting or digestion are not included by this definition . Fire is hot because the conversion of the weak double bond in molecular oxygen , O2 , to the stronger bonds in the combustion products carbon dioxide and water releases energy ( 418 kJ per 32 g of O2 ) ; the bond energies of the fuel play only a minor role here . At a certain point in the combustion reaction , called the ignition point , flames are produced . The flame is the visible portion of the fire . Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide , water vapor , oxygen and nitrogen . If hot enough , the gases may become ionized to produce plasma . Depending on the substances alight , and any impurities outside , the color of the flame and the fire 's intensity will be different . Fire in its most common form can result in conflagration , which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning . Fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe . The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems . The negative effects of fire include hazard to life and property , atmospheric pollution , and water contamination .",

Forty-seven of the 50 were released in January 1946 ; the remaining three served additional months in prison . During and after the trial , questions were raised about the fairness and legality of the court-martial proceedings . Owing to public pressure , the United States Navy reconvened the courts-martial board in 1945 ; the court affirmed the guilt of the convicted men . Widespread publicity surrounding the case turned it into a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre among certain Americans ; it and other race-related Navy protests of 1944-45 led the Navy to change its practices and initiate the desegregation of its forces beginning in February 1946 .

  "/wiki/Cyclonic": "In meteorology , a cyclone is a large scale air mass that rotates around a strong center of low atmospheric pressure . Cyclones are characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of low pressure . The largest low-pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the largest scale ( the synoptic scale ) . Warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale . Mesocyclones , tornadoes , and dust devils lie within smaller mesoscale . Upper level cyclones can exist without the presence of a surface low , and can pinch off from the base of the tropical upper tropospheric trough during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere . Cyclones have also been seen on extraterrestrial planets , such as Mars , Jupiter , and Neptune . Cyclogenesis is the process of cyclone formation and intensification . Extratropical cyclones begin as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones . These zones contract and form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies . Later in their life cycle , extratropical cyclones occlude as cold air masses undercut the warmer air and become cold core systems . A cyclone 's track is guided over the course of its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the subtropical jet stream .",

  "/wiki/Tulsa_race_riot": "The Tulsa race massacre ( also called the Tulsa race riot , the Greenwood Massacre , or the Black Wall Street Massacre ) of 1921 took place on May 31 and June 1 , 1921 , when mobs of white residents attacked black residents and businesses of the Greenwood District in Tulsa , Oklahoma . It has been called the single worst incident of racial violence in American history . The attack , carried out on the ground and from private aircraft , destroyed more than 35 square blocks of the district - at that time the wealthiest black community in the United States , known as Black Wall Street . More than 800 people were admitted to hospitals and as many as 6,000 black residents were interned at large facilities , many for several days . The Oklahoma Bureau of Vital Statistics officially recorded 36 dead , but the American Red Cross declined to provide an estimate . A 2001 state commission examination of events was able to confirm 39 dead , 26 black and 13 white , based on contemporary autopsy reports , death certificates and other records . :114 The commission gave overall estimates from 75-100 to 150-300 dead . :13:23 The riot began over Memorial Day weekend after 19-year-old Dick Rowland , a black shoeshiner , was accused of assaulting Sarah Page , the 17-year-old white elevator operator of the nearby Drexel Building . He was taken into custody . A subsequent gathering of angry local whites outside the courthouse where Rowland was being held , and the spread of rumors he had been lynched , alarmed the local black population , some of whom arrived at the courthouse armed . Shots were fired and twelve people were killed : ten white and two black . As news of these deaths spread throughout the city , mob violence exploded .",

  "/wiki/Mass_murder": "Mass murder is the act of murdering a number of people , typically simultaneously or over a relatively short period of time and in close geographic proximity . The FBI defines mass murder as murdering four or more people during an event with no cooling-off period between the murders . A mass murder typically occurs in a single location where one or more people kill several others . A mass murder may be committed by individuals or organizations whereas a spree killing is committed by one or two individuals . Mass murderers differ from spree killers , who kill at two or more locations with almost no time break between murders and are not defined by the number of victims , and serial killers , who may kill people over long periods of time .",
  "/wiki/Mass_shooting": "A mass shooting is an incident involving multiple victims of firearm violence . There is no widely accepted definition of the term mass shooting . The United States ' FBI defines a mass murder as four or more murdered during an event with no cooling-off period between the murders . Based on this , it is generally agreed that a mass shooting is whenever four or more people are shot ( injured or killed ) , not including the shooter ( s ) . Different media outlets and research groups use different definitions for the term mass shooting For example , crime violence research group Gun Violence Archive defines a mass shooting as four or more shot ( injured or killed ) in a single incident , at the same general time and location , not including the shooter , differentiating between mass shooting and mass murder and not counting shooters as victims . The United States Congressional Research Service acknowledges that there is not a broadly accepted definition and defines a public mass shooting as an event where someone selects four or more people and shoots them with firearms in an indiscriminate manner , echoing the FBI 's definition of the term mass murder , but adding the indiscriminate factor .",
  "/wiki/Wounded_Knee_Massacre": "The Wounded Knee Massacre , also called the Battle of Wounded Knee , was a domestic massacre of several hundred Lakota Indians , almost half of whom were women and children , by soldiers of the United States Army . It occurred on December 29 , 1890 , near Wounded Knee Creek ( Lakota : \u010cha\u014bkp\u00e9 \u00d3pi Wakp\u00e1la ) on the Lakota Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in the U.S. state of South Dakota , following a botched attempt to disarm the Lakota camp . The previous day , a detachment of the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment commanded by Major Samuel M. Whitside intercepted Spotted Elk 's band of Miniconjou Lakota and 38 Hunkpapa Lakota near Porcupine Butte and escorted them 5 miles ( 8.0 km ) westward to Wounded Knee Creek , where they made camp . The remainder of the 7th Cavalry Regiment , led by Colonel James W. Forsyth , arrived and surrounded the encampment . The regiment was supported by a battery of four Hotchkiss mountain guns . On the morning of December 29 , the U.S. Cavalry troops went into the camp to disarm the Lakota . One version of events claims that during the process of disarming the Lakota , a deaf tribesman named Black Coyote was reluctant to give up his rifle , claiming he had paid a lot for it . Simultaneously , an old man was performing a ritual called the Ghost Dance . Black Coyote 's rifle went off at that point , and the U.S. army began shooting at the Native Americans . The Lakota warriors fought back , but many had already been stripped of their guns and disarmed . By the time the massacre was over , between 250 and 300 men , women , and children of the Lakota had been killed and 51 were wounded ( 4 men and 47 women and children , some of whom died later ) ; some estimates placed the number of dead at 300 . Twenty-five soldiers also died , and thirty-nine were wounded ( six of the wounded later died ) .",

  "/wiki/South_Dakota": "South Dakota ( /- d\u0259\u02c8ko\u028at\u0259/ ( listen ) ) is a U.S. state in the Midwestern region of the United States . It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes , who compose a large portion of the population and historically dominated the territory . South Dakota is the seventeenth largest by area , but the fifth smallest by population and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States . As the southern part of the former Dakota Territory , South Dakota became a state on November 2 , 1889 , simultaneously with North Dakota . Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls , with a population of about 187,200 , is South Dakota 's largest city . South Dakota is bordered by the states of North Dakota ( to the north ) , Minnesota ( to the east ) , Iowa ( to the southeast ) , Nebraska ( to the south ) , Wyoming ( to the west ) , and Montana ( to the northwest ) . The state is bisected by the Missouri River , dividing South Dakota into two geographically and socially distinct halves , known to residents as East River and West River . Eastern South Dakota is home to most of the state 's population , and the area 's fertile soil is used to grow a variety of crops . West of the Missouri River , ranching is the predominant agricultural activity , and the economy is more dependent on tourism and defense spending . Most of the Native American reservations are in West River . The Black Hills , a group of low pine-covered mountains sacred to the Sioux , are in the southwest part of the state . Mount Rushmore , a major tourist destination , is there .",
  "/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States": "Native Americans , also known as American Indians , Indigenous Americans and other terms , are the indigenous peoples of the United States , except Hawaii and territories of the United States . More than 570 federally recognized tribes live within the US , about half of which are associated with Indian reservations . The term American Indian excludes Native Hawaiians and some Alaskan Natives , while Native Americans ( as defined by the US Census ) are American Indians , plus Alaska Natives of all ethnicities . The US Census does not include Native Hawaiians or Chamorro , instead being included in the Census grouping of Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander . The ancestors of living Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago , possibly much earlier , from Asia via Beringia . A vast variety of peoples , societies and cultures subsequently developed . Native Americans were greatly affected by the European colonization of the Americas , which began in 1492 , and their population declined precipitously overwhelmingly due to introduced diseases as well as warfare , including biological warfare , territorial confiscation and slavery . After its creation , the United States , as part of its policy of settler colonialism , waged war and perpetrated massacres against many Native American peoples , removed them from their ancestral lands , and subjected them to one-sided treaties and to discriminatory government policies into the 20th century . Since the 1960s , Native American self-determination movements have resulted in changes to the lives of Native Americans , though there are still many contemporary issues faced by Native Americans . Today , there are over five million Native Americans in the United States , 78% of whom live outside reservations . When the United States was created , established Native American tribes were generally considered semi-independent nations , as they generally lived in communities separate from British settlers . The federal government signed treaties at a government-to-government level until the Indian Appropriations Act of 1871 ended recognition of independent native nations , and started treating them as domestic dependent nations subject to federal law .",

  "/wiki/December_1960_nor'easter": "The December 1960 nor'easter was a significant early-season winter storm that impacted the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions of the United States . Moderate to heavy snowfall fell from West Virginia to eastern Maine , amounting to 10 in ( 25 cm ) or more in parts of 13 states and peaking at 21.4 in ( 54.4 cm ) at Newark , New Jersey . The storm was accompanied by strong winds , gusting to over 90 mph ( 145 km/h ) in coastal New England , and left in its wake a dangerously cold air mass . The storm originated in a weak low pressure area which formed over the western Gulf of Mexico on December 10 . A secondary low developed over South Carolina on the next day , supported by the merger of two troughs aloft . Sliding southeast of New England , the new storm explosively deepened to become a full-fledged nor'easter , with a minimum central air pressure of 966 mbar . It began to weaken over the Canadian Maritimes . Widespread blizzard conditions wrought havoc on transportation ; streets and highways throughout the hardest-hit areas were clogged with stalled and abandoned vehicles , and multiple major airports were forced to close . Many schools and businesses were closed , some for days after the storm departed . The New York Stock Exchange opened an hour late on December 12 , marking its first delayed opening in over 25 years . Extensive drifting of snow left communities isolated and unable to receive deliveries of food and heating fuel . Overall , the storm and subsequent cold snap were blamed for at least 286 deaths across a wide area , but primarily in Pennsylvania , New Jersey , New York , and the New England states .",
  "/wiki/Wildfire": "A wildfire , wildland fire or rural fire is an uncontrolled fire in an area of combustible vegetation occurring in rural areas . Depending on the type of vegetation present , a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire , bushfire ( in Australia ) , desert fire , forest fire , grass fire , hill fire , peat fire , vegetation fire , or veld fire . Many organizations consider wildfire to mean an unplanned and unwanted fire , while wildland fire is a broader term that includes prescribed fire as well as wildland fire use ( WFU ; these are also called monitored response fires ) . Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago . Wildfire 's occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems ' flora and fauna . Earth is an intrinsically flammable planet owing to its cover of carbon-rich vegetation , seasonally dry climates , atmospheric oxygen , and widespread lightning and volcanic ignitions . Wildfires can be characterized in terms of the cause of ignition , their physical properties , the combustible material present , and the effect of weather on the fire . Wildfires can cause damage to property and human life , although naturally occurring wildfires may have beneficial effects on native vegetation , animals , and ecosystems that have evolved with fire . High-severity wildfire creates complex early seral forest habitat ( also called snag forest habitat ) , which often has higher species richness and diversity than unburned old forest . Many plant species depend on the effects of fire for growth and reproduction . Wildfires in ecosystems where wildfire is uncommon or where non-native vegetation has encroached may have strongly negative ecological effects . Wildfire behavior and severity result from a combination of factors such as available fuels , physical setting , and weather .",
  "/wiki/Thumb_Fire": "The Thumb Fire took place on September 5 , 1881 , in the Thumb area of Michigan in the United States . The fire , which burned over a million acres ( 4,000 km\u00b2 ) in less than a day , was the consequence of drought , hurricane-force winds , heat , the after-effects of the Port Huron Fire of 1871 , and the ecological damage wrought by the era 's logging techniques . The blaze , also called the Great Thumb Fire , the Great Forest Fire of 1881 and the Huron Fire , killed 282 people in Sanilac , Lapeer , Tuscola and Huron counties . The damage estimate was $ 2,347,000 in 1881 , equivalent to $ 62,179,314 when adjusted for inflation . The fire sent enough soot and ash up into the atmosphere that sunlight was partially obscured at many locations on the East Coast of the United States . In New England cities , the sky appeared yellow and projected a strange luminosity onto buildings and vegetation . Twilight appeared at 12 noon . September 6 , 1881 immediately became known as Yellow Tuesday or Yellow Day due to the ominous nature of this atmospheric event ."
