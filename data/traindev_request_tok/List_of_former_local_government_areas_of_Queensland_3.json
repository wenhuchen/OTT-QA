  "/wiki/City_of_Brisbane": "The City of Brisbane is a local government area that has jurisdiction over the inner portion of the metropolitan area of Brisbane , the capital of Queensland , Australia . Brisbane is located in the county of Stanley and is the largest city followed by Ipswich with bounds in part of the county . Unlike LGAs in the other mainland state capitals ( Sydney , Melbourne , Perth and Adelaide ) , which are generally responsible only for the central business districts and inner neighbourhoods of those cities , the City of Brisbane administers a significant portion of the Brisbane metropolitan area , serving almost half of the population of the Brisbane Greater Capital City Statistical Area ( GCCSA , formerly statistical division ) . As such , it has a larger population than any other local government area in Australia . The City of Brisbane was the first Australian LGA to reach a population of more than one million . Its population is roughly equivalent to the populations of Tasmania , the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory combined . In 2016-2017 , the council administers a budget of over $ 3 billion , by far the largest budget of any LGA in Australia . The City derives from cities , towns and shires that merged in 1925 . The main offices and Central Library of the Council are at 266 George Street , also known as Brisbane Square . Brisbane City Hall houses the Council Chamber , the offices of the Lord Mayor and Deputy Mayor , meeting and reception rooms and the Museum of Brisbane .",
