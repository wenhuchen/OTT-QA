  "/wiki/Call_sign": "In broadcasting and radio communications , a call sign ( also known as a call name or call letters - and historically as a call signal - or abbreviated as a call ) is a unique designation for a transmitter station . In the United States of America , they are used for all FCC-licensed transmitters . A call sign can be formally assigned by a government agency , informally adopted by individuals or organizations , or even cryptographically encoded to disguise a station 's identity . The use of call signs as unique identifiers dates to the landline railroad telegraph system . Because there was only one telegraph line linking all railroad stations , there needed to be a way to address each one when sending a telegram . In order to save time , two-letter identifiers were adopted for this purpose . This pattern continued in radiotelegraph operation ; radio companies initially assigned two-letter identifiers to coastal stations and stations aboard ships at sea . These were not globally unique , so a one-letter company identifier ( for instance , 'M ' and two letters as a Marconi station ) was later added . By 1912 , the need to quickly identify stations operated by multiple companies in multiple nations required an international standard ; an ITU prefix would be used to identify a country , and the rest of the call sign an individual station in that country .",
  "/wiki/Effective_radiated_power": "Effective radiated power ( ERP ) , synonymous with equivalent radiated power , is an IEEE standardized definition of directional radio frequency ( RF ) power , such as that emitted by a radio transmitter . It is the total power in watts that would have to be radiated by a half-wave dipole antenna to give the same radiation intensity ( signal strength or power flux density in watts per square meter ) as the actual source antenna at a distant receiver located in the direction of the antenna 's strongest beam ( main lobe ) . ERP measures the combination of the power emitted by the transmitter and the ability of the antenna to direct that power in a given direction . It is equal to the input power to the antenna multiplied by the gain of the antenna . It is used in electronics and telecommunications , particularly in broadcasting to quantify the apparent power of a broadcasting station experienced by listeners in its reception area . An alternate parameter that measures the same thing is equivalent ( sometimes effective ) isotropically radiated power ( EIRP ) . Equivalent isotropically radiated power is the hypothetical power that would have to be radiated by an isotropic antenna to give the same ( equivalent ) signal strength as the actual source antenna in the direction of the antenna 's strongest beam . The difference between EIRP and ERP is that ERP compares the actual antenna to a half-wave dipole antenna , while EIRP compares it to a theoretical isotropic antenna . Since a half-wave dipole antenna has a gain of 1.64 ( or 2.15 dB ) compared to an isotropic radiator , if ERP and EIRP are expressed in watts their relation is",
  "/wiki/Watt": "The watt ( symbol : W ) is a unit of power . In the International System of Units ( SI ) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second , and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer . In SI base units , the watt is described as k g m 2 s \u2212 3 { \\displaystyle kg\\ , m^ { 2 } s^ { -3 } } , which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis . The watt is named after James Watt , an 18th century scottish inventor .",
  "/wiki/Height_above_average_terrain": "Height above average terrain ( HAAT ) , or ( less popularly ) effective height above average terrain ( EHAAT ) , is a measure of how high an antenna site is above the surrounding landscape . HAAT is used extensively in FM radio and television , as it is more important than effective radiated power ( ERP ) in determining the range of broadcasts ( VHF and UHF in particular , as they are line of sight transmissions ) . For international coordination , it is officially measured in meters , even by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States , as Canada and Mexico have extensive border zones where stations can be received on either side of the international boundaries . Stations that want to increase above a certain HAAT must reduce their power accordingly , based on the maximum distance their station class is allowed to cover ( see List of North American broadcast station classes for more information on this ) . The FCC procedure to calculate HAAT is : from the proposed or actual antenna site , either 12 or 16 radials were drawn , and points at 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 miles ( 16 km ) radius along each radial were used . The entire radial graph could be rotated to achieve the best effect for the station . The altitude of the antenna site , minus the average altitude of all the specified points , is the HAAT . This can create some unusual cases , particularly in mountainous regions - it is possible to have a negative number for HAAT ( the transmitter would not be located underground , but rather in a valley , with hills on both sides taller than the transmitter itself , for example ) . The FCC has divided the Contiguous United States into three zones for the determination of spacing between FM and TV stations using the same frequencies . FM and TV stations are assigned maximum ERP and HAAT values , depending on their assigned zones , to prevent co-channel interference .",
  "/wiki/Metre": "The metre ( Commonwealth spelling and BIPM spelling ) or meter ( American spelling ) ( from the French unit m\u00e8tre , from the Greek noun \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd , measure ) is the base unit of length in the International System of Units ( SI ) . The SI unit symbol is m. The metre is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second . The metre was originally defined in 1793 as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole along a great circle , so the Earth 's circumference is approximately 40,000 km . In 1799 , the metre was redefined in terms of a prototype metre bar ( the actual bar used was changed in 1889 ) . In 1960 , the metre was redefined in terms of a certain number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of krypton-86 . In 1983 , the current definition was adopted .",
  "/wiki/Foot_(unit)": "The foot ( pl . feet ; abbreviation : ft ; symbol : \u2032 , the prime symbol ) is a unit of length in the imperial and US customary systems of measurement . Since the International Yard and Pound Agreement of 1959 , one foot is defined as 0.3048 meter exactly . In customary and imperial units , the foot comprises 12 inches and three feet compose a yard . Historically the foot was a part of many local systems of units , including the Greek , Roman , Chinese , French , and English systems . It varied in length from country to country , from city to city , and sometimes from trade to trade . Its length was usually between 250 mm and 335 mm and was generally , but not always , subdivided into 12 inches or 16 digits . The United States is the only industrialized nation that uses the international foot and the survey foot ( a customary unit of length ) in preference to the meter in its commercial , engineering , and standards activities . The foot is legally recognized in the United Kingdom ; road signs must use imperial units ( however , distances on road signs are always marked in miles or yards , not feet ) , while its usage is widespread among the British public as a measurement of height . The foot is recognized as an alternative expression of length in Canada officially defined as a unit derived from the meter although both the U.K. and Canada have partially metricated their units of measurement . The measurement of altitude in international aviation is one of the few areas where the foot is used outside the English-speaking world . The length of the international foot corresponds to a human foot with shoe size of 13 ( UK ) , 14 ( US male ) , 15.5 ( US female ) or 47 ( EU sizing ) .",
