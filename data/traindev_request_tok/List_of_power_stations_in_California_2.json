  "/wiki/Shasta_Dam": "Shasta Dam ( called Kennett Dam before its construction ) is a concrete arch-gravity dam across the Sacramento River in Northern California in the United States . At 602 feet ( 183 m ) high , it is the eighth-tallest dam in the United States . Located at the north end of the Sacramento Valley , Shasta Dam creates Shasta Lake for long-term water storage , flood control , hydroelectricity and protection against the intrusion of saline water . The largest reservoir in the state , Shasta Lake can hold about 4,500,000 acre feet ( 5,600 GL ) . Envisioned as early as 1919 as an effort to conserve , control , store , and distribute water to the Central Valley , California 's main agricultural region , Shasta was first authorized in the 1930s as a state undertaking . However , bonds did not sell due to the onset of the Great Depression and Shasta was transferred to the federal Bureau of Reclamation as a public works project . Construction started in earnest in 1937 under the supervision of Chief Engineer Frank Crowe . During its building , the dam provided thousands of much-needed jobs ; it was finished twenty-six months ahead of schedule in 1945 . When completed , the dam was the second-tallest in the United States after Hoover , and was considered one of the greatest engineering feats of all time . Even before its dedication , Shasta Dam served an important role in World War II providing electricity to California factories , and still plays a vital part in the management of state water resources today . However , it has greatly changed the environment and ecology of the Sacramento River , and flooded sacred Native American tribal lands . In recent years , there has been debate over whether or not to raise the dam in order to allow for increased water storage and power generation , a proposal opposed by tribes and environmental experts because of negative impacts from water diversions from river flows needed by endangered fish including salmon species .",

  "/wiki/Oroville_Dam": "Oroville Dam is an earthfill embankment dam on the Feather River east of the city of Oroville , California , in the Sierra Nevada foothills east of the Sacramento Valley . At 770 feet ( 235 m ) high , it is the tallest dam in the U.S. and serves mainly for water supply , hydroelectricity generation and flood control . The dam impounds Lake Oroville , the second largest man-made lake in the state of California , capable of storing more than 3.5 million acre feet ( 1.1 trillion US gallons ; 4.3 trillion litres ) . Built by the California Department of Water Resources ( DWR ) , Oroville Dam is one of the key features of the California State Water Project ( SWP ) , one of two major projects passed that set up California 's statewide water system . Construction was initiated in 1961 , and despite numerous difficulties encountered during its construction , including multiple floods and a major train wreck on the rail line used to transport materials to the dam site , the embankment was topped out in 1967 and the entire project was ready for use in 1968 . The dam began to generate electricity shortly afterwards with completion of the Edward Hyatt Pump-Generating Plant , then the country 's largest underground power station . Since its completion in 1968 , the Oroville Dam has allocated the flow of the Feather River from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta into the State Water Project 's California Aqueduct , which provides a major supply of water for irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley as well as municipal and industrial water supplies to coastal Southern California , and has prevented large amounts of flood damage to the area - more than $ 1.3 billion between the years of 1987 and 1999 . The dam has confined fish migration up the Feather River and the controlled flow of the river as a result of the Oroville Dam has affected riparian habitat . Multiple attempts at trying to counter the dam 's impacts on fish migration have included the construction of a salmon/steelhead fish incubator on the river , which began shortly after the dam was completed . In February 2017 , the main and emergency spillways threatened to fail , leading to the evacuation of 188,000 people living near the dam . After deterioration of the main spillway largely stabilized and the water level of the dam 's reservoir dropped below the top of the emergency spillway , the evacuation order was lifted .",

The water impounded by the 625-foot ( 191 m ) -tall dam forms New Melones Lake , California 's fourth largest reservoir , in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada east of the San Joaquin Valley . The dam serves mainly for irrigation water supply , and also provides hydropower generation , flood control , and recreation benefits . The dam was authorized in 1944 as a unit of the federal Central Valley Project , a system designed to provide irrigation water to the fertile agricultural region of the Central Valley . It would be built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ( Corps ) , and transferred to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation ( Reclamation ) upon completion . In 1966 , work began to clear the foundations for a high dam that would replace an earlier , much smaller structure built by two irrigation districts . Construction of the main embankment began in 1976 , and was topped out in late 1978 . The filling of New Melones Lake commenced in 1978 , and the dam 's hydroelectric station produced its first power in mid-1979 . New Melones was the focus of a long environmental battle during the 1970s and early 1980s ; critics protested the flooding of a long scenic stretch of the Stanislaus River , which flowed over whitewater rapids through the deepest limestone canyon in the western United States . The protestors employed a variety of methods , some extreme , to prevent the filling of New Melones Lake until 1983 , when record-setting floods filled the reservoir and nearly breached the dam 's emergency spillway . The fight over New Melones galvanized the river conservation movement in California and influenced major water policy changes on the state and federal levels ; since its completion , no other dams of its size or importance have been built in the United States . The New Melones project has continued to generate controversy , due to the water yield from the project being lower than expected , and the use of New Melones water to meet federal environmental standards at the expense of farming .",

The dam and reservoir are the source for the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct , which provides water for over two million people in San Francisco and other municipalities of the west Bay Area . The dam is named for engineer Michael O'Shaughnessy , who oversaw its construction . Although San Francisco had sought Tuolumne River water as early as the 1890s , this project did not move forward until the disastrous earthquake and fire of 1906 , which underscored the insufficiency of the existing water supply . The Hetch Hetchy Valley - then compared to Yosemite Valley for its scenic beauty - was chosen for its water quality and hydroelectric potential , but the location within the national park generated controversy . An act of Congress was required to circumvent federal protection of the Tuolumne River , with the reasoning that public land should be developed for the public benefit . Construction of the dam started in 1919 and was finished in 1923 , with the first water delivered in 1934 after numerous delays . From 1935-38 the dam was raised to increase its capacity for water supply and power generation . The dam , aqueduct and appurtenant hydroelectric systems are collectively known as the Hetch Hetchy Project . Deriving from a largely wild and pristine area of the Sierra Nevada , the Hetch Hetchy supply is some of the cleanest municipal water in the US , requiring only primary filtration and disinfection .

Almost 95% of the park is designated wilderness . On average , about four million people visit Yosemite each year , and most spend the majority of their time in the seven square miles ( 18 km2 ) of Yosemite Valley . The park set a visitation record in 2016 , surpassing five million visitors for the first time in its history . Yosemite was central to the development of the national park idea . Galen Clark and others lobbied to protect Yosemite Valley from development , ultimately leading to President Abraham Lincoln 's signing the Yosemite Grant in 1864 . John Muir led a successful movement to have Congress establish a larger national park by 1890 , one which encompassed the valley and its surrounding mountains and forests , paving the way for the National Park System . Yosemite is one of the largest and least fragmented habitat blocks in the Sierra Nevada , and the park supports a diversity of plants and animals . The park has an elevation range from 2,127 to 13,114 feet ( 648 to 3,997 m ) and contains five major vegetation zones : chaparral and oak woodland , lower montane forest , upper montane forest , subalpine zone , and alpine .
