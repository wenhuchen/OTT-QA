  "/wiki/English_language": "English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and eventually became a global lingua franca . It is named after the Angles , one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name , as England . Both names derive from Anglia , a peninsula in the Baltic Sea . The language is closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon , and its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages , particularly Norse ( a North Germanic language ) , and to a greater extent by Latin and French . English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years . The earliest forms of English , a group of West Germanic ( Ingvaeonic ) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century , are collectively called Old English . Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England ; this was a period in which the language was influenced by French . Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London , the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift . Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States . Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries , English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science , navigation and law . English is the largest language by number of speakers , and the third most-spoken native language in the world , after Standard Chinese and Spanish . It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states .",
  "/wiki/Irish_language": "Irish ( Gaeilge ) is a Goidelic language of the Celtic languages family , itself a branch of the Indo-European language family . Irish originated in Ireland and was historically spoken by Irish people throughout Ireland . Irish is spoken as a first language in substantial areas of counties Galway , Kerry , Cork and Donegal , smaller areas of Waterford , Mayo and Meath , and a few other locations . It is also spoken by a much larger group of habitual but non-traditional speakers across the country , mostly in urban areas and mostly as a second language . Irish has been the dominant language of the Irish people for most of their recorded history , and they took it with them to other regions , notably Scotland and the Isle of Man , where Middle Irish gave rise to Scottish Gaelic and Manx respectively . It has the oldest vernacular literature in Western Europe . Irish has constitutional status as the national and first official language of the Republic of Ireland and is an officially recognised minority language in Northern Ireland . It is also among the official languages of the European Union . The public body Foras na Gaeilge is responsible for the promotion of the language throughout the island of Ireland .",

Up to the 9th century it consisted of several independent major kingdoms ( L\u00faighne , U\u00ed Maine , and Iarthar Connacht ) . Between the reigns of Conchobar mac Taidg M\u00f3r ( died 882 ) and his descendant , Aedh mac Ruaidri \u00d3 Conchobair ( reigned 1228-33 ) , it became a kingdom under the rule of the U\u00ed Bri\u00fain A\u00ed dynasty , whose ruling sept adopted the surname Ua Conchobair . At its greatest extent , it incorporated the often independent Kingdom of Breifne , as well as vassalage from the lordships of western Mide and west Leinster . Two of its greatest kings , Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair ( 1088-1156 ) and his son Ruaidri Ua Conchobair ( c.1115-1198 ) greatly expanded the kingdom 's dominance , so much so that both became Kings of Ireland . The Kingdom of Connacht collapsed in the 1230s because of civil war within the royal dynasty , which enabled widespread Anglo-Irish settlement under Richard M\u00f3r de Burgh , 1st Baron of Connaught , and his successors . The English colony in Connacht shrank from c. 1300 to c. 1360 , with events such as the 1307 battle of Ahascragh ( see Donnchad Muimnech \u00d3 Cellaigh ) , the 1316 Second Battle of Athenry and the murder in June 1333 of William Donn de Burgh , 3rd Earl of Ulster , all leading to Gaelic resurgence and colonial withdrawal to towns such as Ballinrobe , Loughrea , Athenry , and Galway . Well into the 16th century kingdoms such as U\u00ed Maine and T\u00edr Fh\u00edacrach M\u00faaidhe remained beyond English rule , while many Anglo-Irish families such as de Burgh , de Bermingham , de Exeter , de Staunton , became entirely Gaelicised . Only in the late 1500s , during the Tudor conquest of Ireland , was Connacht shired into its present counties . The province of Connacht has the highest number of Irish language speakers among the four Irish provinces .
