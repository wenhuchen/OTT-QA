  "/wiki/Megawatt": "The watt ( symbol : W ) is a unit of power . In the International System of Units ( SI ) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second , and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer . In SI base units , the watt is described as k g m 2 s \u2212 3 { \\displaystyle kg\\ , m^ { 2 } s^ { -3 } } , which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis .

  "/wiki/Fugen": "Fugen \u3075\u3052\u3093 ( Fugen ) was a prototype Japanese nuclear test reactor . Fugen was a domestic Japanese design for a demonstration Advanced Thermal Reactor . It was a heavy water moderated , boiling light water cooled reactor . The reactor was started in 1979 and shut down in 2003 . As of 2018 , it is undergoing decommissioning . It is located in My\u014djin-ch\u014d , in the city of Tsuruga , Fukui . The name Fugen is derived from Fugen Bosatsu ( Samantabhadra ) , a Buddhist deity . The reactor was the first in the world to use a full MOX fuel core . It had 772 assemblies , the most in the world . It has received the title of a historic landmark from the American Nuclear Society . The design boils ordinary water like a boiling water reactor ( BWR ) but uses heavy water as a moderator as in a CANDU reactor . The electrical output was 165 MW and the thermal output was 557 MW .",

The plant suffered major damage from the magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan on March 11 , 2011 . The chain of events caused radiation leaks and permanently damaged several reactors , making them impossible to restart . By political decision , the remaining reactors were not restarted . First commissioned in 1971 , the plant consists of six boiling water reactors . These light water reactors drove electrical generators with a combined power of 4.7 GWe , making Fukushima Daiichi one of the 15 largest nuclear power stations in the world . Fukushima was the first nuclear plant to be designed , constructed , and run in conjunction with General Electric and Tokyo Electric Power Company ( TEPCO ) . The March 2011 disaster disabled the reactor cooling systems , leading to releases of radioactivity and triggering a 30 km ( 19 mi ) evacuation zone surrounding the plant ; the releases continue to this day . On April 20 , 2011 , the Japanese authorities declared the 20 km ( 12 mi ) evacuation zone a no-go area which may only be entered under government supervision . In November 2011 , the first journalists were allowed to visit the plant . They described a scene of devastation in which three of the reactor buildings were destroyed ; the grounds were covered with mangled trucks , crumpled water tanks and other debris left by the tsunami ; and radioactive levels were so high that visitors were only allowed to stay for a few hours . In April 2012 , Units 1-4 were shut down .",
