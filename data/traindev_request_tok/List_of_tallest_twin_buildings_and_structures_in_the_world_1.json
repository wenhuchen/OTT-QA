The sovereign constitutional monarchy is a federation of seven emirates consisting of Abu Dhabi ( which serves as the capital ) , Ajman , Dubai , Fujairah , Ras Al Khaimah , Sharjah and Umm Al Quwain . Their boundaries are complex , with numerous enclaves within the various emirates . Each emirate is governed by a ruler ; together , they jointly form the Federal Supreme Council . One of the rulers serves as the President of the United Arab Emirates . In 2013 , the UAE 's population was 9.2 million , of which 1.4 million are Emirati citizens and 7.8 million are expatriates . Human occupation of the present UAE has been traced back to the emergence of anatomically modern humans from Africa some 125,000 BCE through finds at the Faya-1 site in Mleiha , Sharjah . Burial sites dating back to the Neolithic Age and the Bronze Age include the oldest known such inland site at Jebel Buhais . Known as Magan to the Sumerians , the area was home to a prosperous Bronze Age trading culture during the Umm Al Nar period , which traded between the Indus Valley , Bahrain and Mesopotamia as well as Iran , Bactria and the Levant . The ensuing Wadi Suq period and three Iron Ages saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior . The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the Sasanians and the subsequent Battle of Dibba . The UAE 's long history of trade led to the emergence of Julfar , in the present-day emirate of Ras Al Khaimah , as a major regional trading and maritime hub in the area .",

Multi-disciplinary architecture firm William Kaven Architecture proposed the complex as a potential part of the Broadway Corridor redevelopment project . The twin-towered skyscrapers would reach 970 feet ( 300 m ) in height and would have become the tallest building in Oregon , the tallest twin towers in the Western Hemisphere and fifth-tallest in the world . A significant obstacle to the proposal was that current zoning at the site limits building heights to 400 feet ( 120 m ) .
