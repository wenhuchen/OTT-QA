  "/wiki/Karla_Homolka": "Karla Leanne Homolka ( born May 4 , 1970 ) , also known as Leanne Teale , is a Canadian serial killer who , with her first husband Paul Bernardo , raped and murdered at least three minors . She attracted worldwide media attention when she was convicted of manslaughter following a plea bargain in the 1991 and 1992 rape-murders of two Ontario teenage girls , Leslie Mahaffy and Kristen French , as well as the rape and death of her sister Tammy . Homolka and Bernardo were arrested in 1993 . In 1995 , Bernardo was convicted of the two teenagers ' murders and received life in prison and a dangerous offender designation , the full maximum sentence allowed in Canada . During the 1993 investigation , Homolka stated to investigators that Bernardo had abused her and that she had been an unwilling accomplice to the murders . As a result , she struck a deal with prosecutors for a reduced prison sentence of 12 years in exchange for a guilty plea to the charge of manslaughter . Homolka scored 5/40 on the Psychopathy Checklist , in contrast to Bernardo 's 35/40 . However , videotapes of the crimes surfaced after the plea bargain and demonstrated that she was a more active participant than she had claimed . As a result , the deal that she had struck with prosecutors was dubbed in the Canadian press the Deal with the Devil . Public outrage about Homolka 's plea deal continued until her high-profile release from prison in 2005 . Following her release from prison , she settled in the province of Quebec , where she married again . She briefly lived in the Antilles and Guadeloupe but by 2014 was back in Canada and living in Quebec .",
