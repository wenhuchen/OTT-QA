There are three types of senator : Lords of Session ( judges of the Court of Session ) ; Lords Commissioners of Justiciary ( judges of the High Court of Justiciary ) ; and the Chairman of the Scottish Land Court . Whilst the High Court and Court of Session historically maintained separate judiciary , these are now one and the same , and the term , Senator , is almost exclusively used in referring to the judges of these courts . Senators of the college use the title Lord or Lady along with a surname or a territorial name . Note , however , that some senators have a peerage title , which would be used instead of the senatorial title . All senators of the college have the honorific , The Honourable , before their titles , while those who are also privy counsellors or peers have the honorific , The Right Honourable . Senators are made privy counsellors upon promotion to the Inner House . Under section 11 of the Treason Act 1708 , it is treason to kill a Senator of the College of Justice sitting in Judgment in the Exercise of their Office within Scotland .",

  "/wiki/Tory_(British_political_party)": "The Tories were members of two political parties which existed sequentially in the Kingdom of England , the Kingdom of Great Britain and later the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from the 17th to the early 19th centuries . The first Tories emerged in 1678 in England , when they opposed the Whig-supported Exclusion Bill which set out to disinherit the heir presumptive James , Duke of York , who eventually became James II of England and VII of Scotland . This party ceased to exist as an organised political entity in the early 1760s , although it was used as a term of self-description by some political writers . A few decades later , a new Tory party would rise to establish a hold on government between 1783 and 1830 , with William Pitt the Younger followed by Robert Jenkinson , 2nd Earl of Liverpool . The Earl of Liverpool was succeeded by fellow Tory Arthur Wellesley , 1st Duke of Wellington , whose term included the Catholic Emancipation , which occurred mostly due to the election of Daniel O'Connell as a Catholic MP from Ireland . When the Whigs subsequently regained control , the Representation of the People Act 1832 removed the rotten boroughs , many of which were controlled by Tories . In the following general election , the Tory ranks were reduced to 180 MPs . Under the leadership of Robert Peel , the Tamworth Manifesto was issued , which began to transform the Tories into the Conservative Party . However , Peel lost many of his supporters by repealing the Corn Laws , causing the party to break apart . One faction , led by Edward Smith-Stanley , 14th Earl of Derby and Benjamin Disraeli , survived to become the modern Conservative Party , whose members are commonly still referred to as Tories as they still often follow and promote the ideology of Toryism .",

It was formed to trade in the Indian Ocean region , initially with Mughal India and the East Indies , and later with Qing China . The company ended up seizing control of large parts of the Indian subcontinent , colonised parts of Southeast Asia , and colonised Hong Kong after a war with Qing China . Originally chartered as the Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East-Indies , the company rose to account for half of the world 's trade , particularly in basic commodities including cotton , silk , indigo dye , salt , spices , saltpetre , tea , and opium . The company also ruled the beginnings of the British Empire in India . In his speech to the House of Commons in July 1833 , Lord Macaulay explained that since the beginning , the East India company had always been involved in both trade and politics , just as its French and Dutch counterparts had been . The company received a Royal Charter from Queen Elizabeth I on 31 December 1600 , coming relatively late to trade in the Indies . Before them the Portuguese Estado da \u00cdndia had traded there for much of the 16th century and the first of half a dozen Dutch Companies sailed to trade there from 1595 . These Dutch companies amalgamated in March 1602 into the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) , which introduced the first permanent joint stock from 1612 ( meaning investment into shares did not need to be returned , but could be traded on a stock exchange ) . By contrast , wealthy merchants and aristocrats owned the EIC 's shares . Initially the government owned no shares and had only indirect control until 1657 when permanent joint stock was established . During its first century of operation , the focus of the company was trade , not the building of an empire in India .",

  "/wiki/Scottish_Enlightenment": "The Scottish Enlightenment ( Scots : Scots Enlichtenment , Scottish Gaelic : Soillseachadh na h-Alba ) was the period in 18th- and early-19th-century Scotland characterised by an outpouring of intellectual and scientific accomplishments . By the eighteenth century , Scotland had a network of parish schools in the Lowlands and four universities . The Enlightenment culture was based on close readings of new books , and intense discussions took place daily at such intellectual gathering places in Edinburgh as The Select Society and , later , The Poker Club , as well as within Scotland 's ancient universities ( St Andrews , Aberdeen , Glasgow , and Edinburgh ) . Sharing the humanist and rationalist outlook of the European Enlightenment of the same time period , the thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment asserted the importance of human reason combined with a rejection of any authority that could not be justified by reason . In Scotland , the Enlightenment was characterised by a thoroughgoing empiricism and practicality where the chief values were improvement , virtue , and practical benefit for the individual and society as a whole . Among the fields that rapidly advanced were philosophy , political economy , engineering , architecture , medicine , geology , archaeology , botany and zoology , law , agriculture , chemistry and sociology . Among the Scottish thinkers and scientists of the period were Francis Hutcheson , David Hume , Adam Smith , Dugald Stewart , Thomas Reid , Robert Burns , Adam Ferguson , John Playfair , Joseph Black and James Hutton . The Scottish Enlightenment had effects far beyond Scotland , not only because of the esteem in which Scottish achievements were held outside Scotland , but also because its ideas and attitudes were carried all over Europe and across the Atlantic world as part of the Scottish diaspora , and by European and American students who studied in Scotland .",

  "/wiki/Freemason": "Freemasonry or Masonry consists of fraternal organisations that trace their origins to the local fraternities of stonemasons that from the end of the fourteenth century regulated the qualifications of stonemasons and their interaction with authorities and clients . The degrees of Freemasonry retain the three grades of medieval craft guilds , those of Apprentice , Journeyman or fellow ( now called Fellowcraft ) , and Master Mason . The candidate of these three degrees is progressively taught the meanings of the symbols of Freemasonry , and entrusted with grips , signs and words to signify to other members that he has been so initiated . The degrees are part allegorical morality play and part lecture . Three degrees are offered by Craft ( or Blue Lodge ) Freemasonry , and members of any of these degrees are known as Freemasons or Masons . There are additional degrees , which vary with locality and jurisdiction , and are usually administered by their own bodies ( separate from those who administer the Craft degrees ) . The basic , local organisational unit of Freemasonry is the Lodge . These private Lodges are usually supervised at the regional level ( usually coterminous with either a state , province , or national border ) by a Grand Lodge or Grand Orient . There is no international , worldwide Grand Lodge that supervises all of Freemasonry ; each Grand Lodge is independent , and they do not necessarily recognise each other as being legitimate . Modern Freemasonry broadly consists of two main recognition groups . Regular Freemasonry insists that a volume of scripture be open in a working lodge , that every member profess belief in a Supreme Being , that no women be admitted ( although , in some jurisdictions , those who transition to women after being initiated may stay ; see below ) , and that the discussion of religion and politics be banned . Continental Freemasonry is now the general term for the jurisdictions which have removed some , or all , of these restrictions .",
  "/wiki/Natural_philosopher": "Natural philosophy or philosophy of nature ( from Latin philosophia naturalis ) was the philosophical study of nature and the physical universe that was dominant before the development of modern science . It is considered to be the precursor of natural science . From the ancient world , starting with Aristotle , to the 19th century , natural philosophy was the common term for the practice of studying nature . It was in the 19th century that the concept of science received its modern shape with new titles emerging such as biology and biologist , physics and physicist among other technical fields and titles ; institutions and communities were founded , and unprecedented applications to and interactions with other aspects of society and culture occurred . Isaac Newton 's book Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica ( 1687 ) , whose title translates to Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy , reflects the then-current use of the words natural philosophy , akin to systematic study of nature . Even in the 19th century , a treatise by Lord Kelvin and Peter Guthrie Tait , which helped define much of modern physics , was titled Treatise on Natural Philosophy ( 1867 ) . In the German tradition , Naturphilosophie ( philosophy of nature ) persisted into the 18th and 19th century as an attempt to achieve a speculative unity of nature and spirit . Some of the greatest names in German philosophy are associated with this movement , including Goethe , Hegel and Schelling . Naturphilosophie was associated with Romanticism and a view that regarded the natural world as a kind of giant organism , as opposed to the philosophical approach of figures such as John Locke and Isaac Newton who espoused a more mechanical view of the world , regarding it as being like a machine .",
