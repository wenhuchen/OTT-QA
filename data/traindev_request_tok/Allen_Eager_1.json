  "/wiki/Coleman_Hawkins": "Coleman Randolph Hawkins ( November 21 , 1904 - May 19 , 1969 ) , nicknamed Hawk and sometimes Bean , was an American jazz tenor saxophonist . One of the first prominent jazz musicians on his instrument , as Joachim E. Berendt explained : there were some tenor players before him , but the instrument was not an acknowledged jazz horn . Hawkins biographer John Chilton described the prevalent styles of tenor saxophone solos prior to Hawkins as mooing and rubbery belches . Hawkins cited as influences Happy Caldwell , Stump Evans , and Prince Robinson , although he was the first to tailor his method of improvisation to the saxophone rather than imitate the techniques of the clarinet . Hawkins ' virtuosic , arpeggiated approach to improvisation , with his characteristic rich , emotional , loud , and vibrato-laden tonal style , was the main influence on a generation of tenor players that included Chu Berry , Charlie Barnet , Tex Beneke , Ben Webster , Vido Musso , Herschel Evans , Buddy Tate , and Don Byas , and through them the later tenormen , Arnett Cobb , Illinois Jacquet , Flip Phillips , Ike Quebec , Al Sears , Paul Gonsalves , and Lucky Thompson . While Hawkins became well known with swing music during the big band era , he had a role in the development of bebop in the 1940s . Fellow saxophonist Lester Young , known as Pres , commented in a 1959 interview with The Jazz Review : As far as I 'm concerned , I think Coleman Hawkins was the President first , right ? As far as myself , I think I 'm the second one . Miles Davis once said : When I heard Hawk , I learned to play ballads .",
  "/wiki/Dizzy_Gillespie": "John Birks Dizzy Gillespie ( /\u0261\u026a\u02c8l\u025bspi/ ; October 21 , 1917 - January 6 , 1993 ) was an American jazz trumpeter , bandleader , composer , and singer . Gillespie was a trumpet virtuoso and improviser , building on the virtuoso style of Roy Eldridge but adding layers of harmonic and rhythmic complexity previously unheard in jazz . His combination of musicianship , showmanship , and wit made him a leading popularizer of the new music called bebop . His beret and horn-rimmed spectacles , his scat singing , his bent horn , pouched cheeks , and his light-hearted personality provided some of bebop 's most prominent symbols . In the 1940s Gillespie , with Charlie Parker , became a major figure in the development of bebop and modern jazz . He taught and influenced many other musicians , including trumpeters Miles Davis , Jon Faddis , Fats Navarro , Clifford Brown , Arturo Sandoval , Lee Morgan , Chuck Mangione , and balladeer Johnny Hartman . Scott Yanow wrote , Dizzy Gillespie 's contributions to jazz were huge . One of the greatest jazz trumpeters of all time , Gillespie was such a complex player that his contemporaries ended up being similar to those of Miles Davis and Fats Navarro instead , and it was not until Jon Faddis 's emergence in the 1970s that Dizzy 's style was successfully recreated [ . ] Arguably Gillespie is remembered , by both critics and fans alike , as one of the greatest jazz trumpeters of all time .",

Konitz 's association with the cool jazz movement of the 1940s and 1950s includes participation in Miles Davis 's Birth of the Cool sessions and his work with pianist Lennie Tristano . He was notable during this era as one of relatively few alto saxophonists to retain a distinctive style when Charlie Parker exerted a massive influence . Like other students of Tristano , Konitz was noted for improvising long , melodic lines with the rhythmic interest coming from odd accents , or odd note groupings suggestive of the imposition of one time signature over another . Other saxophonists were strongly influenced by Konitz , notably Paul Desmond and Art Pepper .",
  "/wiki/Mosaic_Records": "Mosaic Records is an American jazz record company and label established in 1982 by Michael Cuscuna and Charlie Lourie . It produces limited-edition box sets that are available only by mail . The sets are leased from the major record companies , usually for a three- or five-year period , with the edition limited to a specific number of copies typically 5,000 . Sometimes the complete catalog of a label would appear : the complete masters of Milt Gabler 's Commodore Records were contained in three sets consisting of some 66 LPs . In 2003 , the company initiated the Select series of smaller sets , not necessarily complete in the usual sense . In 2006 , the company began a third line , Mosaic Singles , a series dedicated to reissuing individual albums on CD that have not previously been available in US editions , or at all . In 2009 , Mosaic returned to the vinyl format with the HQ Vinyl Series and began issuing three and four LP sets of 2,500-5,000 copies . Mosaic 's sets are primarily sold and distributed directly to customers , initially promoted through leading jazz publications , then mail order catalog , and now the internet . The first three years of releases did not sell particularly well . In 1986 , Cuscuna reached out to a record-producing acquaintance , Fred Seibert , for help . With partner Alan Goodman their company , Fred/Alan Inc. in New York , devised a catalog and strategy that immediately increased sales almost tenfold and put the company on a solid footing for the first time . Mr. Goodman continues to write the copy for all new release sales ."
