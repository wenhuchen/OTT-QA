In team sports , matches of this type are often used to help coaches and managers select and condition players for the competitive matches of a league season or tournament . If the players usually play in different teams in other leagues , exhibition games offer an opportunity for the players to learn to work with each other . The games can be held between separate teams or between parts of the same team . An exhibition game may also be used to settle a challenge , to provide professional entertainment , to promote the sport , to commemorate an anniversary or a famous player , or to raise money for charities . Several sports leagues hold all-star games to showcase their best players against each other , while other exhibitions games may pit participants from two different leagues or countries to unofficially determine who would be the best in the world .

The Olympic Games are held every four years , with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart .

The Deaflympics and Special Olympics are also endorsed by the IOC . The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic , political , and technological advancements . The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism , as envisioned by Coubertin , to allowing participation of professional athletes . The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games .",
