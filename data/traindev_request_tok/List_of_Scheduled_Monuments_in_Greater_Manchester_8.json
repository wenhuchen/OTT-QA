  "/wiki/Astley,_Greater_Manchester": "Astley is a village in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan in Greater Manchester , England , which is crossed by the Bridgewater Canal and the A580 East Lancashire Road . Continuous with Tyldesley , it is equidistant from Wigan and Manchester , both 8.3 miles ( 13.4 km ) away . The Astley Mosley Common ward had a population of 11,270 at the 2011 Census . Historically in Lancashire , Astley 's name is Old English , indicating Anglo-Saxon settlement . It means either east Leigh , a reference to its location relative to Leigh , or \u0113astl\u0113ah the eastern wood or clearing . Throughout the Middle Ages , Astley constituted a township within the parish of Leigh and hundred of West Derby . Astley appears in written form as Asteleghe in 1210 , when its lord of the manor granted land to the religious order of Premonstratensian canons at Cockersand Abbey . Medieval and Early Modern Astley is distinguished by the dignitaries who occupied Damhouse , the local manor house around which a settlement expanded . The Bridgewater Canal reached Astley in 1795 , and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1830 . The Industrial Revolution introduced the factory system when the village 's cotton mill was built in 1833 . Coal mining became an important industry . Mining subsidence coupled with structural and political changes to the mining industry began the decline in Astley 's industrial activities during the mid-20th century ; its cotton mill closed in 1955 , and the last coal was brought to the surface in 1970 .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

Wigan is the largest settlement in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan and is its administrative centre . The town has a population of 103,608 , whilst the wider borough has a population of 318,100 . Historically in Lancashire , Wigan during classical antiquity was in the territory of the Brigantes , an ancient Celtic tribe that ruled much of what is now northern England . The Brigantes were subjugated in the Roman conquest of Britain during the 1st century , and it is asserted that the Roman settlement of Coccium was established where Wigan lies . Wigan is believed to have been incorporated as a borough in 1246 following the issue of a charter by King Henry III of England . At the end of the Middle Ages , it was one of four boroughs in Lancashire established by Royal charter . During the Industrial Revolution Wigan experienced dramatic economic expansion and a rapid rise in population . Although porcelain manufacture and clock making had been major industries , Wigan became known as a major mill town and coal mining district . A coal mine was recorded in 1450 and at its peak , there were 1,000 pit shafts within 5 miles ( 8 km ) of the town centre . Mining was so extensive that a town councillor remarked that a coal mine in the backyard was not uncommon in Wigan . Coal mining ceased during the latter part of the 20th century .",

  "/wiki/Timber_framing": "Timber framing and post-and-beam construction are traditional methods of building with heavy timbers , creating structures using squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs . It is commonplace in wooden buildings through the 19th century . If the structural frame of load-bearing timber is left exposed on the exterior of the building it may be referred to as half-timbered , and in many cases the infill between timbers will be used for decorative effect . The country most known for this kind of architecture is Germany . Timber framed houses are spread all over the country except in the southeast . The method comes from working directly from logs and trees rather than pre-cut dimensional lumber . Hewing this with broadaxes , adzes , and draw knives and using hand-powered braces and augers ( brace and bit ) and other woodworking tools , artisans or framers could gradually assemble a building . Since this building method has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world , many styles of historic framing have developed . These styles are often categorized by the type of foundation , walls , how and where the beams intersect , the use of curved timbers , and the roof framing details .",

The moat was revetted on the south side but the stonework is destroyed and is bridged on the same side by a modern stone bridge which replaced a timber structure . The rectangular island , measuring 60 metres by 40 metres , encloses an area of 0.25 hectares ( 0.62 acres ) and is 0.4 metres above the surrounding land .

Following the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain , Tyldesley was part of the manor of Warrington , until the Norman conquest of England , when the settlement constituted a township called Tyldesley-with-Shakerley in the ancient parish of Leigh . The factory system and textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution triggered population growth and urbanisation , and by the early 20th century it was said that the mill town was eminently characteristic of an industrial district whose natural features have been almost entirely swept away to give place to factories , iron foundries , and collieries . After industrial activity declined in the late 20th century , land reclamation and post-war residential developments have altered the landscape and encouraged economic activity along Elliott Street .",

It is named after King James I of England , with whose reign ( 1603-1625 in England ) it is associated . At the start of James ' reign there was little stylistic break in architecture , as Elizabethan trends continued their development . However his death in 1625 came as a decisive change towards more classical architecture , with Italian influence , was in progress , led by Inigo Jones ; the style this began is sometimes called Stuart architecture , or English Baroque ( though the latter term may be regarded as starting later ) . Courtiers continued to build large prodigy houses , even though James spent less time on summer progresses round his realm than Elizabeth had . The influence of Flemish and German Northern Mannerism increased , now often executed by immigrant craftsmen and artists , rather than obtained from books as in the previous reign . There continued to be very little building of new churches , though a considerable amount of modifications to old ones , but a great deal of secular building ."
