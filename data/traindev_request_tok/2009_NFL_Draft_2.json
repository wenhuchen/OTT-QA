  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",

The conference 's members participated in 24 NCAA sports . The conference had a history of success at the national level in basketball throughout its history , while its shorter ( 1991 to 2013 ) football program , created by inviting one college and four other associate members ( their football programs only ) into the conference , resulted in two national championships . In basketball , Big East teams made 18 Final Four appearances and won seven NCAA Championships ( UConn with three , Villanova , Georgetown , Syracuse , and Louisville with one each ) . Of the Big East 's full members , all but South Florida attended the Final Four , the most of any conference , though Marquette , DePaul , Notre Dame , Rutgers , Cincinnati , and Pittsburgh made all their trips before joining the Big East . In 2011 , the Big East set the record for the most teams sent to the NCAA Division I Men 's Basketball Championship by a single conference with eleven out of their sixteen teams qualifying . In football , the Big East entered competition as a conference in 1991 , after inviting five football colleges to become members of the Big East , joining three teams from the Big East whose football teams were competing as Division I independents ( Boston College , Pittsburgh and Syracuse ) to form a new Division I football league . The strength of this league earned the Big East an automatic berth in the Bowl Championship Series , when that series was created in 1998 . The Big East won two national football championships , both by University of Miami .

  "/wiki/Long_snapper": "In gridiron football , the long snapper ( or deep snapper ) is a special teams specialist whose duty is to snap the football over a longer distance , typically around 15 yards during punts , and 7-8 yards during field goals and extra point attempts . During field goal and point after touchdown attempts , the snap is received by the holder , typically 7-8 yards away . During punts , the snap is delivered to the punter from 13-15 yards away . Following a punt snap , the snapper often executes a blocking assignment and then must cover the kick by running downfield and attempting to stop the opposing team 's punt returner from advancing the ball in the opposite direction . If the punt goes uncaught , it is the snapper 's responsibility to make sure the ball does not enter the end zone or bounce backward resulting in loss of yards . The majority of snappers at the highest levels of competition are specialized , meaning that they uniquely play the position of snapper , or have limited responsibilities elsewhere . A good punt snap should hit the target -- the punter 's hands at the abdomen or waistline -- between .65 and .75 seconds and with a tight spiral for easy handling . A bad snap is an off-target snap which causes the delay or failure of a kick or forces the punter into some other potentially compromising situation .",

As professional and college football have become more focused on the passing game , safeties have become more involved in covering the eligible pass receivers . Safeties are the last line of defense ; they are expected to be reliable tacklers , and many safeties rank among the hardest hitters in football . Safety positions can also be converted cornerbacks , either by design ( Byron Jones ) or as a cornerback ages ( Charles Woodson , DeAngelo Hall , Lardarius Webb , Tramon Williams ) .
