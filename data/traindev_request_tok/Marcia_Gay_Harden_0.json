  "/wiki/Lee_Krasner": "Lenore Lee Krasner ( October 27 , 1908 - June 19 , 1984 ) was an American abstract expressionist painter , with a strong speciality in collage , who was married to Jackson Pollock . This somewhat overshadowed her contribution at the time , though there was much cross-pollination between their two styles . Krasners training , influenced by George Bridgman and Hans Hofmann , was the more formalized , especially in the depiction of human anatomy , and this enriched Pollocks more intuitive and unstructured output . Krasner is now seen as a key transitional figure within abstraction , who connected early-20th-century art with the new ideas of postwar America , and her work fetches high prices at auction . She is one of the few female artists to have had a retrospective show at the Museum of Modern Art .",
