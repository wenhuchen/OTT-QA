Sutherland borders Caithness and Moray Firth to the east , Ross-shire and Cromartyshire ( later combined into Ross and Cromarty ) to the south and the Atlantic to the north and west . Like its southern neighbour Ross-shire , Sutherland has some of the most dramatic scenery in the whole of Europe , especially on its western fringe where the mountains meet the sea . These include high sea cliffs , and very old mountains composed of Precambrian and Cambrian rocks . The name Sutherland dates from the era of Norwegian Viking rule and settlement over much of the Highlands and Islands , under the rule of the jarl of Orkney . Although it contains some of the northernmost land in the island of Great Britain , it was called Su\u00f0rland ( southern land ) from the standpoint of Orkney and Caithness . In Gaelic , the area is referred to according to its traditional areas : D\u00f9thaich MhicAoidh ( or D\u00f9thaich 'IcAoidh ) in the northeast , Asainte ( Assynt ) in the west , and Cataibh in the east . Cataibh is also sometimes used to refer to the area as a whole . The northwest corner of Sutherland , traditionally known as the Province of Strathnaver , was not incorporated into Sutherland until 1601 . This was the home of the powerful and warlike Clan Mackay , and as such was named in Gaelic , D\u00f9thaich 'Ic Aoidh , the Homeland of Mackay . Even today this part of Sutherland is known as Mackay Country , and , unlike other areas of Scotland where the names traditionally associated with the area have become diluted , there is still a preponderance of Mackays in the D\u00f9thaich .",

Orkney was colonised and later annexed by Norway in 875 and settled by the Norse . The Scottish Parliament then absorbed the earldom to the Scottish Crown in 1472 , following the failed payment of a dowry for James III 's bride Margaret of Denmark . In addition to the Mainland , most of the remaining islands are in two groups , the North and South Isles , all of which have an underlying geological base of Old Red Sandstone .
