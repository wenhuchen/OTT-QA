It is now the measurement unit used for expressing distances between geographical places on land in most of the world ; notable exceptions are the United States and the United Kingdom where the statute mile is the unit used . The abbreviations k or K ( pronounced /ke\u026a/ ) are commonly used to represent kilometre , but are not recommended by the BIPM .

The asteroid was named after Asterope ( or Sterope ) , one of the Pleiades . It is a rare T-type asteroid and has a relatively dark surface . The spectrum of 233 Asterope bears a resemblance to Troilite , a sulfurous iron mineral found in most iron meteorites . Photometric observations during 1995 show a rotation period of 19.743 hours . Measurements made with the IRAS observatory give a diameter of 109.56 \u00b1 5.04 km and a geometric albedo of 0.08 \u00b1 0.01 . By comparison , the MIPS photometer on the Spitzer Space Telescope gives a diameter of 97.54 \u00b1 10.32 km and a geometric albedo of 0.10 \u00b1 0.01 .",

  "/wiki/Centaur_(minor_planet)": "Centaurs are small Solar System bodies with either a perihelion or a semi-major axis between those of the outer planets . They generally have unstable orbits because they cross or have crossed the orbits of one or more of the giant planets ; almost all their orbits have dynamic lifetimes of only a few million years , but there is one Centaur , 514107 Ka\u02bbepaoka\u02bbawela , which may be in a stable ( though retrograde ) orbit . [ how is this a centaur if the Trojans are n't ? ] Centaurs typically behave with characteristics of both asteroids and comets . They are named after the mythological centaurs that were a mixture of horse and human . Observational bias toward large objects makes determination of the total Centaur population difficult . Estimates for the number of Centaurs in the Solar System more than 1 km in diameter range from as low as 44,000 to more than 10,000,000 The first Centaur to be discovered , under the definition of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the one used here , was 944 Hidalgo in 1920 . However , they were not recognized as a distinct population until the discovery of 2060 Chiron in 1977 . The largest confirmed Centaur is 10199 Chariklo , which at 260 kilometers in diameter is as big as a mid-sized main-belt asteroid , and is known to have a system of rings . It was discovered in 1997 . However , the lost Centaur 1995 SN55 may be somewhat larger .

Based on the lightcurve data obtained from Nausikaa , a possible satellite was reported in 1985 . However , this has not been confirmed . A shape model of Nausikaa has been constructed , also based on the lightcurve data . It indicates a roughly cut , but not very elongated body . In 1998 an occultation of a star by the asteroid was observed from the United States . In 1988 a search for satellites or dust orbiting this asteroid was performed using the UH88 telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatories , but the effort came up empty .

Lutetia has an irregular shape and is heavily cratered , with the largest impact crater reaching 45 km in diameter . The surface is geologically heterogeneous and is intersected by a system of grooves and scarps , which are thought to be fractures . It has a high average density , meaning that it is made of metal-rich rock . The Rosetta probe passed within 3,162 km ( 1,965 mi ) of Lutetia in July 2010 .

  "/wiki/M-type_asteroids": "Differentiation was a fundamental process in shaping many asteroids and all terrestrial planet M-type asteroids are asteroids of partially known composition ; they are moderately bright ( albedo 0.1-0.2 ) .

These are thought to be pieces of the metallic core of differentiated asteroids that were fragmented by impacts , and are thought to be the source of iron meteorites . M-type asteroids are the third most common asteroid type . There are also M-types whose composition is uncertain . For example , 22 Kalliope has an accurately known density that is far too low for a solid metallic object or even a metal rubble pile : a rubble pile of iron-nickel metal would need about 70% porosity which is inconsistent with packing considerations . 22 Kalliope and 21 Lutetia have features in their spectra which appear to indicate the presence of hydration minerals and silicates , anomalously low radar albedos inconsistent with a metallic surface , as well as characteristics more in common with C-type asteroids . A variety of other M-type asteroids do not fit well into a metallic body picture . M-type spectra are flat to reddish and usually devoid of large features , although subtle absorption features longward of 0.75 \u03bcm and shortward of 0.55 \u03bcm are sometimes present .",

At other locations , a small object would go into its own orbit around one of the large bodies , but at the Lagrangian points the gravitational forces of the two large bodies , the centripetal force of orbital motion , and ( for certain points ) the Coriolis acceleration all match up in a way that cause the small object to maintain a stable or nearly stable position relative to the large bodies . There are five such points , labeled L1 to L5 , all in the orbital plane of the two large bodies , for each given combination of two orbital bodies . For instance , there are five Lagrangian points L1 to L5 for the Sun-Earth system , and in a similar way there are five different Lagrangian points for the Earth-Moon system . L1 , L2 , and L3 are on the line through the centers of the two large bodies . L4 and L5 each form an equilateral triangle with the centers of the large bodies . L4 and L5 are stable , which implies that objects can orbit around them in a rotating coordinate system tied to the two large bodies .
