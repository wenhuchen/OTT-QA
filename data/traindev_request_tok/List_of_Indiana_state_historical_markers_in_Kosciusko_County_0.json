  "/wiki/Papakeecha": "Papakeecha or ( Pa-hed-ke-teh-a ) meaning Flat Belly was the most influential Miami chief in the region around Lake Wawasee , in what is now Kosciusko County , Indiana , United States leading his people from 1820 until 1837 . Lake Papakeechie was named after him . Papakeecha was about 60 years old when white men entered the area . He was described as dark copper in color with a silver ring through his nose . Historical accounts have him weighing 300 pounds . He claimed to have participated in the Battle of Tippecanoe . In 1828 he was given reservation land totalling 36 square miles ( 93 km2 ) which nearly bisected Lake Wawasee north to south . He was the brother of Miami chief Wawasee ( Wau-wa-aus-see ) , who Lake Wawasee was named after . His reservation town was located near present-day Indian Village in Noble County and had some 75 residents . The United States government built him a one-story brick house in 1827 for $ 562 , located in the southeast corner of his village , which was later destroyed by a tornado or great wind as the historical marker indicates . This marker was erected in 1967 by the Noble County Historical Society . Another marker by the Indiana Historical Society 1962 states : You are now leaving Papakeechie 's Reservation , 36 square miles ( 93 km2 ) .",

  "/wiki/Continental_divide": "A continental divide is a drainage divide on a continent such that the drainage basin on one side of the divide feeds into one ocean or sea , and the basin on the other side either feeds into a different ocean or sea , or else is endorheic , not connected to the open sea . Every continent on earth except Antarctica ( which has no free-flowing surface water ) has at least one continental drainage divide ; islands , even small ones like Killiniq Island on the Labrador Sea in Canada , may also host part of a continental divide or have their own island-spanning divide . The endpoints of a continental divide may be coastlines of gulfs , seas or oceans , the boundary of an endorheic basin , or another continental divide . One case , the Great Basin Divide , is a closed loop around an endoreic basin . The endpoints where a continental divide meets the coast are not always definite since the exact border between adjacent bodies of water is usually not clearly defined . The International Hydrographic Organization 's publication Limits of Oceans and Seas defines exact boundaries of oceans , but it is not universally recognized . Where a continental divide meets an endorheic basin , such as the Great Divide Basin of Wyoming , the continental divide splits and encircles the basin . Where two divides intersect , they form a triple divide , where three watersheds meet . Whether a divide is considered a continental divide distinguished from other secondary drainage divides may depend on whether the associated gulfs , seas , or oceans are considered separate . For example , the Gulf of Mexico is considered separate from the Atlantic Ocean , so the Eastern Continental Divide separates their respective watersheds . But the Sea of Cortez is usually not considered separate from the Pacific Ocean , so the divide between the Colorado River watershed which drains to the Sea of Cortez , and Columbia River Watershed which drains to the Pacific Ocean , is not considered to be a continental divide . Together , continental divides demarcate a set of drainage basins or watersheds , each of which drains to a specific ocean , sea or gulf , such as the North American Atlantic seaboard watershed which is demarcated by the Eastern Continental Divide and Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Divide .",
  "/wiki/Indiana_State_Road_13": "State Road 13 ( SR 13 ) is a north-south state road in the US state of Indiana . The southern terminus is at an intersection with U.S. Highway 36 ( US 36 ) and SR 67 , in the town of Fortville , and its northern terminus is at the Michigan state line . At its northern end , signage for SR 13 ends at the interchange with the Indiana Toll Road ; the highway continues unsigned for an additional 0.6 miles ( 0.97 km ) running concurrently with US 131 to the state line . The state road runs through six counties in central and north-central Indiana mostly through rural farm fields and small towns . Dating back to the early days of the state road system , SR 13 was first signed in the eastern and northeastern part of the state . It was moved to its modern routing in 1931 , running in two segments with the southern end in Indianapolis and the northern end at the Michigan state line . During the late 1930s , SR 13 was moved onto its modern routing in far southern Elkhart County . The southern end was moved from Indianapolis to Greenfield in the late 1930s or early 1940s . The north-south concurrency with US 33 was added in the early 1970s and the southern terminus was moved to Fortville in the mid-to-late 1970s .",

  "/wiki/Kosciusko_County_Jail": "The first jail was built in 1837 of 14 inches ( 36 cm ) square logs . It was two stories tall with a trap door from the second story floor to access the ground floor . The next jail was made of brick . Like the first jail , it was located on Courthouse Square . By 1869 this second structure was in serious need of repair . Frequent jail breaks from the second jail , led the county to hire George Garnsey of Chicago to design a new jail . The most notable jailbreak resulted when prisoners pushed bricks out of the wall . The Castellated Gothic design represents the late 1800s American jail design standards . The massive , rough stone blocks suggest a feeling of strength and permanence . Narrow windows and second story main entrance imply the restrictive function of the structure . To stop future jailbreaks , iron dowel rods pierced the stone blocks . This would prevent the stones from being pushed out .",
  "/wiki/Chinworth_Bridge": "The bridge is significant locally as the only Pratt through truss bridge remaining in Kosciusko County , and is important regionally as one of the few surviving spans built by the Bellefontaine Bridge and Iron Company . Just west of the bridge was a ford across the Tippecanoe River . The Yellowstone Trail passed on the south side of the river . A marker has been maintained at this location . A post with yellows bands and a Y in a black circle In 1884 , a new bridge across the Tippecanoe River was requested to connect Warsaw , on the south with a to Atwood and Etna Green on the north . It crossed the property of Robert Chinworth . Capt . David Braden working for the Bellefontaine Bridge and Iron Company agreed to erect a 140 feet ( 43 m ) span over the Tippecanoe River , at a total cost of $ 2520.00 . The bridge opened in August , 1897 . In 1924 , with the construction of U.S. 30 the Chinworth Bridge was bypassed as it could not handle modern vehicular traffic . The Indiana State Highway Commission , created Tippecanoe Rest Area adjacent to the Chinworth Bridge . In 1975 , the enhanced 4-lane U.S. 30 was located north of the Chinworth Bridge .",
  "/wiki/Tippecanoe_River": "The Tippecanoe River ( /\u02cct\u026apik\u0259\u02c8nu\u02d0/ TIP-ee-k\u0259-NOO ) is a gentle , 182-mile-long ( 293 km ) river in the Central Corn Belt Plains ecoregion in northern Indiana . It flows from Big Lake in Noble County to the Wabash River near what is now Battle Ground , about 12 miles ( 19 km ) northeast of Lafayette . The name Tippecanoe was derived from a Miami-Illinois word for buffalo fish , reconstructed as */kiteepihkwana/ or as kiteepihkwana siipiiwi . The Tippecanoe River is fed by 88 natural lakes and has a drainage area of 1,250,000 acres ( 5,100 km2 ) , spanning 14 counties . It supports more numerous imperiled species and overall species diversity than most streams of the upper Midwest . The Nature Conservancy has identified it as one of the top ten rivers in the United States to preserve due to its ecological diversity and the high proportion of endangered species found in it .",
  "/wiki/U.S._Route_30": "U.S. Route 30 or U.S. Highway 30 ( US 30 ) is an east-west main route in the system of the United States Numbered Highways , with the highway traveling across the northern tier of the country . With a length of 3,073 miles ( 4,946 km ) , it is the third longest U.S. highway , after U.S. Route 20 and U.S. Route 6 . The western end of the highway is at US 101 in Astoria , Oregon ; the eastern end is at Virginia Avenue , Absecon Boulevard , and Adriatic Avenue in Atlantic City , New Jersey . Despite long stretches of parallel and concurrent Interstate Highways , it has not been decommissioned unlike other long haul routes such as U.S. Route 66 . The 0 as the last number in the digit indicates that it is a coast-to-coast route and a major east-west route . Much of the historic Lincoln Highway , the first road across America ( from New York City to San Francisco ) , became part of US 30 ; it is still known by that name in many areas . US 30 and US 20 break the general U.S. Route numbering guidelines in Oregon , since US 20 actually starts south of US 30 in Newport , Oregon and US 30 runs parallel to the north throughout the state ( the Columbia River and Interstate 84 ) . The two run concurrently and continue in the correct positioning near Caldwell , Idaho . This is because US 20 was not a planned coast-to-coast route while US 30 was . US 20 originally ended at the eastern entrance of Yellowstone National Park ; it was extended in 1940 ."
