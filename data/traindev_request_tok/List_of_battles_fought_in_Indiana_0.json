As of the 2010 census , the city had a total of 101,168 residents ; its metropolitan statistical area had a population of 318,586 and its combined statistical area , 721,296 . It is the fourth-largest city in Indiana , serving as the economic and cultural hub of northern Indiana . The University of Notre Dame is located just to the north in unincorporated Notre Dame . The area was originally settled in the early 19th century by fur traders and was established as a city in 1865 . The St. Joseph River shaped South Bend 's economy through the mid-20th century . River access assisted heavy industrial development such as that of the Studebaker Corporation , the Oliver Chilled Plow Company , and other large corporations . The population of South Bend declined after 1960 , when it had a peak population of 132,445 . This was chiefly due to migration to suburban areas as well as the demise of Studebaker and other heavy industry . Today , the largest industries in South Bend are health care , education , small business , and tourism . Remaining large corporations include Crowe , Honeywell , and AM General . Recently , the city population has begun to grow for the first time in nearly fifty years .",
  "/wiki/Beaver_Wars": "The Beaver Wars , also known as the Iroquois Wars or the French and Iroquois Wars , encompass a series of conflicts fought intermittently during the 17th century in America . They were battles for economic welfare throughout the Saint Lawrence River valley in Canada and the lower Great Lakes region which pitted the Iroquois against the northern Algonquians and the Algonquians ' French allies . From medieval times , Europeans had obtained furs from Russia and Scandinavia . American pelts came on the market during the 16th century , decades before the French , English , and Dutch established permanent settlements and trading posts on the continent . Basque fishermen chasing cod off Newfoundland 's Grand Banks bartered with local Indians for beaver robes to help fend off the Atlantic chill . By virtue of their location , the tribes wielded considerable influence in European-Indian relations from the early seventeenth century onwards . The Iroquois sought to expand their territory into the Ohio Country and to monopolize the fur trade with European markets . They originally were a confederacy of the Mohawk , Oneida , Onondaga , Cayuga , and Seneca tribes inhabiting the lands in Upstate New York along the shores of Lake Ontario east to Lake Champlain and Lake George on the Hudson river , and the lower-estuary of the Saint Lawrence River . The Iroquois Confederation led by the Mohawks mobilized against the largely Algonquian-speaking tribes and Iroquoian-speaking Huron and related tribes of the Great Lakes region . The Iroquois were armed by their Dutch and English trading partners ; the Algonquians and Hurons were backed by the French , their chief trading partner . The Iroquois effectively destroyed several large tribal confederacies , including the Mahicans ( Mohicans ) , Huron ( Wyandot ) , Neutral , Erie , Susquehannock ( Conestoga ) , and northern Algonquins . They became dominant in the region and enlarged their territory , realigning the American tribal geography .",

They were known during the colonial years to the French as the Iroquois League , and later as the Iroquois Confederacy , and to the English as the Five Nations , comprising the Mohawk , Onondaga , Oneida , Cayuga , and Seneca . After 1722 , they accepted the Tuscarora people from the Southeast into their confederacy , as they were also Iroquoian-speaking , and became known as the Six Nations . The Iroquois have absorbed many other individuals from various peoples into their tribes as a result of warfare , adoption of captives , and by offering shelter to displaced peoples . Culturally , all are considered members of the clans and tribes into which they are adopted by families . The historic St. Lawrence Iroquoians , Wyandot ( Huron ) , Erie , and Susquehannock , all independent peoples , also spoke Iroquoian languages .

  "/wiki/French_and_Indian_War": "The French and Indian War ( 1754-1763 ) pitted the colonies of British America against those of New France , each side supported by military units from the parent country and by American indigenous allies . At the start of the war , the French colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 settlers , compared with 2 million in the British colonies . The outnumbered French particularly depended on the Indians . The European nations declared a wider war upon one another overseas in 1756 , two years into the French and Indian war , and some view the French and Indian War as being merely the American theater of the worldwide Seven Years ' War of 1756-63 ; however , the French and Indian War is viewed in the United States as a singular conflict which was not associated with any European war . French Canadians call it Guerre de la Conqu\u00eate ( War of the Conquest ) The British colonists were supported at various times by the Iroquois , Catawba , and Cherokee tribes , and the French colonists were supported by Wabanaki Confederacy member tribes Abenaki and Mi'kmaq , and the Algonquin , Lenape , Ojibwa , Ottawa , Shawnee , and Wyandot tribes . Fighting took place primarily along the frontiers between New France and the British colonies , from the Province of Virginia in the south to Newfoundland in the north . It began with a dispute over control of the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River called the Forks of the Ohio , and the site of the French Fort Duquesne in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . The dispute erupted into violence in the Battle of Jumonville Glen in May 1754 , during which Virginia militiamen under the command of 22-year-old George Washington ambushed a French patrol . In 1755 , six colonial governors met with General Edward Braddock , the newly arrived British Army commander , and planned a four-way attack on the French . None succeeded , and the main effort by Braddock proved a disaster ; he lost the Battle of the Monongahela on July 9 , 1755 and died a few days later . British operations failed in the frontier areas of the Province of Pennsylvania and the Province of New York during 1755-57 due to a combination of poor management , internal divisions , effective Canadian scouts , French regular forces , and Indian warrior allies .

Warriors from numerous tribes joined the uprising in an effort to drive British soldiers and settlers out of the region . The war is named after Odawa leader Pontiac , the most prominent of many Indian leaders in the conflict . The war began in May 1763 when American Indians were offended by the policies of British General Jeffrey Amherst and attacked a number of British forts and settlements . Eight forts were destroyed and hundreds of colonists were killed or captured , with many more fleeing the region .

  "/wiki/Kekionga": "Long occupied by successive cultures of indigenous peoples , Kekionga was a large village of the Miami people at the time of European encounter . It became an important trading post for Europeans because it was on the six-mile portage between the Maumee and the Little rivers , which connected Lake Erie to the Wabash River and Mississippi River . Due to the mid-17th century French and Iroquois Wars over the fur trade , most traders believed the route was too dangerous . Following the wars , however , the portage proved to be the shortest route between the French colonies of New France ( Canada ) and La Louisiane . The area was full of wildlife as it had not been densely inhabited for years . The Miami at first benefited from trade with the Europeans , who were primarily Canadiens from Quebec . Under Jean Baptiste Bissot , Sieur de Vincennes , the Canadiens established a trading post and fort , first at the St. Joseph River , and later at Kekionga . Vincennes and the Miami developed a strong and enduring friendship . Kekionga remained a central site for the Miami for several decades ; their other villages were more temporary . The large meeting house hosted official tribal councils . However , a smallpox epidemic struck Kekionga in 1733 and people evacuated the village for a year .

The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster . The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI of Scotland became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Elizabeth I , bringing about the Union of the Crowns . Since its inception , the kingdom was in legislative and personal union with the Kingdom of Ireland . Following the accession of George I to the throne of Great Britain in 1714 , the kingdom was in a personal union with the Electorate of Hanover . The early years of the newly-united kingdom were marked by Jacobite risings , which ended in defeat for the Stuart cause at the Battle of Culloden in 1746 . In 1763 , victory in the Seven Years ' War led to the dominance of the British Empire , which was to become the foremost global power for over a century , slowly growing to become the largest empire in history .

  "/wiki/Illinois_campaign": "The Illinois campaign , also known as Clark 's Northwestern campaign ( 1778-1779 ) , was a series of events during the American Revolutionary War in which a small force of Virginia militiamen , led by George Rogers Clark , seized control of several British posts in the Illinois Country , in what are now Illinois and Indiana in the Midwestern United States . The campaign is the best-known action of the western theater of the war and the source of Clark 's reputation as an early American military hero . In July 1778 , Clark and his men crossed the Ohio River from Kentucky and took control of Kaskaskia , Vincennes , and several other villages in British territory . The occupation was accomplished without firing a shot because most of the Canadien and Native American inhabitants , who peacefully co-existed with one another , were unwilling to take up arms on behalf of the British Empire . To counter Clark 's advance , Henry Hamilton , the British lieutenant governor at Fort Detroit , reoccupied Vincennes with a small force . In February 1779 , Clark returned to Vincennes in a surprise winter expedition and retook the town , capturing Hamilton in the process . Virginia capitalized on Clark 's success by establishing the region as Illinois County , Virginia . The importance of the Illinois campaign has been the subject of much debate . Because the British ceded the entire Northwest Territory to the United States in the 1783 Treaty of Paris , some historians have credited Clark with nearly doubling the size of the original Thirteen Colonies by seizing control of the Illinois Country during the war . For this reason , Clark was nicknamed the Conqueror of the Northwest , and his Illinois campaign - particularly the surprise march to Vincennes - was greatly celebrated and romanticized . Other historians have downplayed the importance of the campaign , arguing that Clark 's conquest was a temporary occupation that had no impact on the boundary negotiations in Europe .",

  "/wiki/Lochry's_Defeat": "Lochry 's Defeat , also known as the Lochry massacre , was a battle fought on August 24 , 1781 , near present-day Aurora , Indiana , in the United States . The battle was part of the American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) , which began as a conflict between Great Britain and the Thirteen Colonies before spreading to the western frontier , where American Indians entered the war as British allies . The battle was short and decisive : about one hundred Indians of local tribes led by Joseph Brant , a Mohawk military leader who was temporarily in the west , ambushed a similar number of Pennsylvania militiamen led by Archibald Lochry . Brant and his men killed or captured all of the Pennsylvanians without suffering any casualties . Lochry 's force was part of an army being raised by George Rogers Clark for a campaign against Detroit , the British regional headquarters . Clark , the preeminent American military leader on the northwestern frontier , worked with Governor Thomas Jefferson of Virginia in planning an expedition to capture Detroit , by which they hoped to bring an end to British support of the Indian war effort . In early August 1781 , Clark and about 400 men left Fort Pitt in Pennsylvania by boat , floating down the Ohio River a few days ahead of Lochry and his men , who were trying to catch up . Joseph Brant 's force was part of a combined British and Indian army being raised to counter Clark 's offensive . Brant had too few men to challenge Clark , but when he intercepted messengers traveling between Clark and Lochry , he learned about Lochry 's smaller group bringing up the rear . When Lochry landed to feed his men and horses , Brant launched his overwhelmingly successful ambush . Because Clark had been able to recruit only a fraction of the men he needed for his campaign , the loss of Lochry 's men resulted in the cancellation of Clark 's expedition .",

It followed centuries of conflict over this territory , first among Native American tribes , and then with the added shifting alliances among the tribes and the European powers of France and Great Britain , and their colonials . The United States Army considers it their first of the United States Indian Wars . Under the Treaty of Paris ( 1783 ) , which ended the American Revolutionary War , Great Britain ceded to the U.S. control of what were known as the Ohio Country and the Illinois Country , which were occupied by numerous Native American peoples . Despite the treaty , the British kept forts there and continued policies that supported the Native Americans . With the encroachment of European settlers west of the Appalachians after the War , a Huron-led confederacy formed in 1785 to resist usurpation of Indian lands , declaring that lands north and west of the Ohio River were Indian territory . President George Washington directed the United States Army to enforce U.S. sovereignty over the territory . The U.S. Army , consisting mostly of untrained recruits and volunteer militiamen , suffered a series of major defeats , including the Harmar Campaign ( 1790 ) and St. Clair 's Defeat ( 1791 ) . About 1,000 soldiers and militiamen were killed and the United States forces suffered many more casualties than their opponents .

As tensions and violence increased , Governor Harrison marched with an army of about 1,000 men to disperse the confederacy 's headquarters at Prophetstown , near the confluence of the Tippecanoe River and the Wabash River . Tecumseh was not yet ready to oppose the United States by force and was away recruiting allies when Harrison 's army arrived .

Born in the Ohio Country ( present-day Ohio ) , and growing up during the American Revolutionary War and the Northwest Indian War , Tecumseh was exposed to warfare and envisioned the establishment of an independent Native American nation east of the Mississippi River under British protection . He worked to recruit additional members to his tribal confederacy from the southern United States . Tecumseh was among the most celebrated Native American leaders in history and was known as a strong and eloquent orator who promoted tribal unity . He was also ambitious , willing to take risks , and make significant sacrifices to repel the settlers from Native American lands in the Old Northwest Territory . In 1808 , with his brother Tenskwatawa ( The Prophet ) , Tecumseh founded the Native American village the European Americans called Prophetstown , north of present-day Lafayette , Indiana . Prophetstown grew into a large , multi-tribal community and a central point in Tecumseh 's political and military alliance . Tecumseh 's confederation fought the United States during Tecumseh 's War , but he was unsuccessful in getting the U.S. government to rescind the Treaty of Fort Wayne ( 1809 ) and other land-cession treaties . In 1811 , as he traveled south to recruit more allies , his brother Tenskwatawa defended Prophetstown against William Henry Harrison 's army at the Battle of Tippecanoe , but the Native Americans retreated from the field and the European Americans unearthed graves and burned Prophetstown . Although Tecumseh remained the military leader of the pan-Native American confederation , his plan to enlarge the Native American alliance was never fulfilled .

  "/wiki/War_of_1812": "The War of 1812 was a conflict fought between the United States and the United Kingdom , with their respective allies , from June 1812 to February 1815 . Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars ; historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right . From the outbreak of war with Napoleonic France , Britain had enforced a naval blockade to choke off neutral trade to France , which the US contested as illegal under international law . To man the blockade , Britain pressed American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy . American sentiment grew increasingly hostile toward Britain due to incidents such as the Chesapeake-Leopard affair , which happened five years before the war . The British were in turn outraged by the Little Belt affair in 1811 , in which 11 British sailors died . Britain supplied arms to American Indians who raided American settlers on the frontier , hindering American expansion and provoking resentment . Historians debate whether the desire to annex some or all of British North America ( Canada ) contributed to the American decision to go to war . However , the Western interest was in expansion into American territories such as Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , and Wisconsin , where they were threatened by Indians supported by the British . On June 18 , 1812 , President James Madison signed into law the American declaration of war , after heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress . With most of its army in Europe fighting Napoleon , Britain adopted a defensive strategy , with offensive operations initially limited to the border and the western frontier . American prosecution of the war effort suffered from its unpopularity , especially in New England , where it was referred to as Mr. Madison 's War .",
