Pope Innocent was one of the most powerful and influential of the medieval popes . He exerted a wide influence over the Christian states of Europe , claiming supremacy over all of Europe 's kings . He was central in supporting the Catholic Church 's reforms of ecclesiastical affairs through his decretals and the Fourth Lateran Council . This resulted in a considerable refinement of Western canon law . He is furthermore notable for using interdict and other censures to compel princes to obey his decisions , although these measures were not uniformly successful . Innocent greatly extended the scope of the crusades , directing crusades against Muslim Spain and the Holy Land as well as the Albigensian Crusade against the Cathars in southern France . He organized the Fourth Crusade of 1202-1204 , which ended in the disastrous sack of Constantinople . Although the attack on Constantinople went against his explicit orders , and the Crusaders were subsequently excommunicated , Innocent reluctantly accepted this result , seeing it as the will of God to reunite the Latin and Orthodox Churches . In the event , the sack of Constantinople and the subsequent period of Frankokratia heightened the hostility between the Latin and Greek churches .
