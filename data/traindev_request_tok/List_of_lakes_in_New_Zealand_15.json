The South Island covers 150,437 square kilometres ( 58,084 sq mi ) , making it the world 's 12th-largest island . It has a temperate climate . It has a 32 percent larger landmass than the North Island , and as a result is nicknamed the mainland of New Zealand , especially by South Island residents , but only 23 percent of New Zealand 's 4.8 million inhabitants live there . In the early stages of European ( P\u0101keh\u0101 ) settlement of the country , the South Island had the majority of the European population and wealth due to the 1860s gold rushes . The North Island population overtook the South in the early 20th century , with 56 percent of the population living in the North in 1911 , and the drift north of people and businesses continued throughout the century .",
  "/wiki/Blue_Lake_(Otago)": "Blue Lake is a small lake adjacent to the town of Saint Bathans in Central Otago , New Zealand . The lake is man-made , the result of sluicing operations that began in 1873 when John Ewing ( 1844-1922 ) formed the St.Bathans Channel Company , to mine the Kildare Hill Gold Claim in St Bathans . His company constructed a tailings channel and introduced hydraulic elevating to work the claim . As this work progressed the Kildare Hill Claim became the site of the deepest hydraulic elevating operation in the world , that would turn a 120-metre hill into a 68-metre hole . Work stopped in 1902 when there was insufficient fall in the tailings channel to carry away the tailings . By 1905 John Ewing was bankrupt as a result of poor investments in other locations . The Kildare Hill Claim was then taken up by the Scandinavian Water Race Company in that year . This company restarted operations and worked the claim until 1932 , when it was finally abandoned due to the fear of undermining the town of St Bathans . Natural drainage from the surrounding hills filled the hole with water and created the present day lake . The Blue Lake is a key feature of modern-day St. Bathans and is used for swimming , fishing , bodyboarding , and kayaking .",

The coast attracts numerous marine mammals , among them New Zealand fur seals and Hooker 's sea lions . In general terms the area enjoys a maritime temperate climate . Its exposed location leads to its frequently wild weather and heavy ocean swells , which are an attraction to big-wave surfers , and have also caused numerous shipwrecks . People have lived in the area since around 1350 AD . Prior to European settlement , the region was sparsely inhabited by nomadic groups of M\u0101ori , most of whom lived close to river mouths . In the early days of European settlement the area was frequented by whalers and sealers , and saw milling became a major local industry from the mid-19th century until the 1930s .
