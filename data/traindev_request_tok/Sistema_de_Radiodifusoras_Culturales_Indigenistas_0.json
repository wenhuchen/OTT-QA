Varieties of Nahuatl are spoken by about 1.7 million Nahua peoples , most of whom live in central Mexico . Nahuatl has been spoken in central Mexico since at least the seventh century CE . It was the language of the Aztecs , who dominated what is now central Mexico during the Late Postclassic period of Mesoamerican history . During the centuries preceding the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire , the Aztecs had expanded to incorporate a large part of central Mexico , and their influence caused the variety of Nahuatl spoken by the residents of Tenochtitlan to become a prestige language in Mesoamerica . At the conquest , with the introduction of the Latin alphabet , Nahuatl also became a literary language , and many chronicles , grammars , works of poetry , administrative documents and codices were written in it during the 16th and 17th centuries . This early literary language based on the Tenochtitlan variety has been labeled Classical Nahuatl , and is among the most studied and best-documented languages of America . Today , Nahuan languages are spoken in scattered communities , mostly in rural areas throughout central Mexico and along the coastline . There are considerable differences among varieties , and some are not mutually intelligible . Huasteca Nahuatl , with over one million speakers , is the most-spoken variety . All varieties have been subject to varying degrees of influence from Spanish . No modern Nahuan languages are identical to Classical Nahuatl , but those spoken in and around the Valley of Mexico are generally more closely related to it than those on the periphery .",

With an estimated population of around 17.2 million , it is the most populous country in Central America . Guatemala is a representative democracy ; its capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunci\u00f3n , also known as Guatemala City . The territory of modern Guatemala once formed the core of the Maya civilization , which extended across Mesoamerica . Most of the country was conquered by the Spanish in the 16th century , becoming part of the viceroyalty of New Spain . Guatemala attained independence in 1821 as part of the Federal Republic of Central America , which dissolved by 1841 . From the mid- to late-19th century , Guatemala experienced chronic instability and civil strife . Beginning in the early 20th century , it was ruled by a series of dictators backed by the United Fruit Company and the United States government . In 1944 , the authoritarian leader Jorge Ubico was overthrown by a pro-democratic military coup , initiating a decade-long revolution that led to sweeping social and economic reforms . A U.S.-backed military coup in 1954 ended the revolution and installed a dictatorship . From 1960 to 1996 , Guatemala endured a bloody civil war fought between the US-backed government and leftist rebels , including genocidal massacres of the Maya population perpetrated by the military . Since a United Nations-negotiated peace accord , Guatemala has witnessed both economic growth and successful democratic elections , though it continues to struggle with high rates of poverty , crime , drug trade , and instability .",

Partially as a result of these migrations , during which the Tzeltal people and other cultural groups found each other in close proximity , four different dialects of Tzeltal have been described : north , central ( including Oxchuc ) , south , and southeast , though the southeastern dialect is today spoken only by a few elderly and geographically dispersed speakers .
