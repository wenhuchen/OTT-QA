  "/wiki/Discworld": "Discworld is a comic fantasy book series written by the English author Terry Pratchett , set on the Discworld , a flat planet balanced on the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant turtle . The series began in 1983 with The Colour of Magic and continued until the final novel The Shepherd 's Crown was published in 2015 , following Pratchett 's death . The books frequently parody or take inspiration from J. R. R. Tolkien , Robert E. Howard , H. P.

[ citation needed ] Forty-one Discworld novels have been published . The original British editions of the first 26 novels , up to Thief of Time ( 2001 ) , had cover art by Josh Kirby . The American editions , published by Harper Collins , used their own cover art . Since Kirby 's death in 2001 , the covers have been designed by Paul Kidby . Companion publications include eleven short stories ( some only loosely related to the Discworld ) , four popular science books , and a number of supplementary books and reference guides . The series has been adapted for graphic novels , theatre , computer and board games , and television . Newly released Discworld books regularly topped The Sunday Times best-sellers list , making Pratchett the UK 's best-selling author in the 1990s .

  "/wiki/The_Jungle_Book": "The Jungle Book ( 1894 ) is a collection of stories by the English author Rudyard Kipling . Most of the characters are animals such as Shere Khan the tiger and Baloo the bear , though a principal character is the boy or man-cub Mowgli , who is raised in the jungle by wolves . The stories are set in a forest in India ; one place mentioned repeatedly is Seonee ( Seoni ) , in the central state of Madhya Pradesh . A major theme in the book is abandonment followed by fostering , as in the life of Mowgli , echoing Kipling 's own childhood . The theme is echoed in the triumph of protagonists including Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and The White Seal over their enemies , as well as Mowgli 's . Another important theme is of law and freedom ; the stories are not about animal behaviour , still less about the Darwinian struggle for survival , but about human archetypes in animal form . They teach respect for authority , obedience , and knowing one 's place in society with the law of the jungle , but the stories also illustrate the freedom to move between different worlds , such as when Mowgli moves between the jungle and the village . Critics have also noted the essential wildness and lawless energies in the stories , reflecting the irresponsible side of human nature . The Jungle Book has remained popular , partly through its many adaptations for film and other media . Critics such as Swati Singh have noted that even critics wary of Kipling for his supposed imperialism have admired the power of his storytelling . The book has been influential in the scout movement , whose founder , Robert Baden-Powell , was a friend of Kipling 's . Percy Grainger composed his Jungle Book Cycle around quotations from the book .",

  "/wiki/Fictional_character": "In fiction , a character ( sometimes known as a fictional character ) is a person or other being in a narrative ( such as a novel , play , television series , film , or video game ) . The character may be entirely fictional or based on a real-life person , in which case the distinction of a fictional versus real character may be made . Derived from the ancient Greek word \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 , the English word dates from the Restoration , although it became widely used after its appearance in Tom Jones in 1749 . From this , the sense of a part played by an actor developed . Character , particularly when enacted by an actor in the theatre or cinema , involves the illusion of being a human person . In literature , characters guide readers through their stories , helping them to understand plots and ponder themes . Since the end of the 18th century , the phrase in character has been used to describe an effective impersonation by an actor . Since the 19th century , the art of creating characters , as practiced by actors or writers , has been called characterisation . A character who stands as a representative of a particular class or group of people is known as a type . Types include both stock characters and those that are more fully individualised . The characters in Henrik Ibsen 's Hedda Gabler ( 1891 ) and August Strindberg 's Miss Julie ( 1888 ) , for example , are representative of specific positions in the social relations of class and gender , such that the conflicts between the characters reveal ideological conflicts . The study of a character requires an analysis of its relations with all of the other characters in the work .",
  "/wiki/Horton_Hatches_the_Egg": "Horton Hatches the Egg is a children 's book written and illustrated by Theodor Geisel under the pen name Dr. Seuss and published in 1940 by Random House . The book tells the story of Horton the Elephant , who is tricked into sitting on a bird 's egg while its mother , Mayzie , takes a permanent vacation to Palm Beach . Horton endures a number of hardships but persists , often stating , I meant what I said , and I said what I meant . An elephant 's faithful , one hundred percent ! Ultimately , the egg hatches , revealing an elephant-bird , a creature with a blend of Mayzie 's and Horton 's features . According to Geisel 's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan , Geisel claimed the story was born in early 1940 when he left a window open in his studio , and the wind fortuitously blew a sketch of an elephant on top of a sketch of a tree . However , according to later biographer Charles Cohen , this account is probably apocryphal . He found elements of Horton in earlier Dr. Seuss works , most notably the 1938 short story Matilda , the Elephant with a Mother Complex . Horton Hatches the Egg was published to immediate critical acclaim and financial success and has remained popular with the general public . The book has also been used as the basis for academic articles on a variety of topics , including economics , Christianity , feminism , and adoption . Horton appeared again in the 1954 Dr. Seuss book Horton Hears a Who ! These two books later provided the thrust of the plot for the 2000 Broadway musical Seussical .",

His novels include The Adventures of Tom Sawyer ( 1876 ) and its sequel , the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn ( 1884 ) , the latter often called The Great American Novel . Twain was raised in Hannibal , Missouri , which later provided the setting for Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn . He served an apprenticeship with a printer and then worked as a typesetter , contributing articles to the newspaper of his older brother Orion Clemens . He later became a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River before heading west to join Orion in Nevada . He referred humorously to his lack of success at mining , turning to journalism for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise . His humorous story , The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County , was published in 1865 , based on a story that he heard at Angels Hotel in Angels Camp , California , where he had spent some time as a miner . The short story brought international attention and was even translated into French . His wit and satire , in prose and in speech , earned praise from critics and peers , and he was a friend to presidents , artists , industrialists , and European royalty . Twain earned a great deal of money from his writings and lectures , but he invested in ventures that lost most of it - such as the Paige Compositor , a mechanical typesetter that failed because of its complexity and imprecision .

Three subspecies are recognised - E. m. maximus from Sri Lanka , E. m. indicus from mainland Asia and E. m. sumatranus from the island of Sumatra . The Asian elephant is the largest living land animal in Asia . Since 1986 , the Asian elephant has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List , as the population has declined by at least 50 percent over the last three generations , estimated to be 60-75 years . It is primarily threatened by loss of habitat , habitat degradation , fragmentation and poaching . In 2003 , the wild population was estimated at between 41,410 and 52,345 individuals . Female captive elephants have lived beyond 60 years when kept in semi-natural surroundings , such as forest camps . In zoos , Asian elephants die at a much younger age ; captive populations are declining due to a low birth and high death rate . The genus Elephas originated in Sub-Saharan Africa during the Pliocene and spread throughout Africa before expanding into the southern half of Asia . The earliest indications of captive use of Asian elephants are engravings on seals of the Indus Valley Civilisation dated to the 3rd millennium BC .",
