The Paddle Steamer Waverley and MV Balmoral offer day sea trips from Knightstone Island to various destinations along the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary .

Burnham-on-Sea is most famous for its low lighthouse . The now-decommissioned lighthouse was built in 1832 and is a Grade-II listed building . The lighthouse is famous for its red and white striped facade . The position of the town on the edge of the Somerset Levels and moors where they meet the Bristol Channel , has resulted in a history dominated by land reclamation and sea defences since Roman times . Burnham was seriously affected by the Bristol Channel floods of 1607 , with the present curved concrete wall being completed in 1988 . There have been many shipwrecks on the Gore Sands , which lie just offshore and can be exposed at low tides . Lighthouses are hence prominent landmarks in the town , with the original lighthouse known as the Round Tower built to replace the light on the top of the 14th-century tower of St Andrews Church . The 110-foot ( 34-metre ) pillar or High Lighthouse and the low wooden pile lighthouse or Lighthouse on legs on the beach were built to replace it .",
