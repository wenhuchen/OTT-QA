Lee and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia in the American Civil War . Both armies suffered heavy casualties , around 5,000 men killed in total , a harbinger of a bloody war of attrition by Grant against Lee 's army and , eventually , the Confederate capital , Richmond , Virginia . The battle was tactically inconclusive , as Grant disengaged and continued his offensive . Grant attempted to move quickly through the dense underbrush of the Wilderness of Spotsylvania , but Lee launched two of his corps on parallel roads to intercept him . On the morning of May 5 , the Union V Corps under Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren attacked the Confederate Second Corps , commanded by Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell , on the Orange Turnpike . That afternoon the Third Corps , commanded by Lt. Gen. A. P. Hill , encountered Brig . Gen. George W. Getty 's division ( VI Corps ) and Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock 's II Corps on the Orange Plank Road . Fighting until dark was fierce but inconclusive as both sides attempted to maneuver in the dense woods . At dawn on May 6 , Hancock attacked along the Plank Road , driving Hill 's Corps back in confusion , but the First Corps of Lt. Gen. James Longstreet arrived in time to prevent the collapse of the Confederate right flank . Longstreet followed up with a surprise flanking attack from an unfinished railroad bed that drove Hancock 's men back to the Brock Road , but the momentum was lost when Longstreet was wounded by his own men . An evening attack by Brig . Gen. John B. Gordon against the Union right flank caused consternation at Union headquarters , but the lines stabilized and fighting ceased .",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Shiloh": "The Battle of Shiloh ( also known as the Battle of Pittsburg Landing ) was a battle in the Western Theater of the American Civil War , fought April 6-7 , 1862 , in southwestern Tennessee . A Union force known as the Army of the Tennessee ( Major General Ulysses S. Grant ) had moved via the Tennessee River deep into Tennessee and was encamped principally at Pittsburg Landing on the west bank of the Tennessee River , where the Confederate Army of Mississippi ( General Albert Sidney Johnston , P. G. T. Beauregard second-in-command ) launched a surprise attack on Grant 's army from its base in Corinth , Mississippi . Johnston was mortally wounded during the fighting ; Beauregard took command of the army and decided against pressing the attack late in the evening . Overnight , Grant was reinforced by one of his divisions stationed further north and was joined by three divisions from the Army of the Ohio ( Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell ) . The Union forces began an unexpected counterattack the next morning which reversed the Confederate gains of the previous day . On April 6 , the first day of the battle , the Confederates struck with the intention of driving the Union defenders away from the river and into the swamps of Owl Creek to the west . Johnston hoped to defeat Grant 's army before the anticipated arrival of Buell and the Army of the Ohio . The Confederate battle lines became confused during the fighting , and Grant 's men instead fell back to the northeast , in the direction of Pittsburg Landing . A Union position on a slightly sunken road , nicknamed the Hornet 's Nest and defended by the divisions of Brig . Gens . Benjamin Prentiss and William H. L. Wallace , provided time for the remainder of the Union line to stabilize under the protection of numerous artillery batteries . Wallace was mortally wounded when the position collapsed , while several regiments from the two divisions were eventually surrounded and surrendered .",

George Meade 's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia , halting Lee 's invasion of the North . After his success at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863 , Lee led his army through the Shenandoah Valley to begin his second invasion of the North - the Gettysburg Campaign . With his army in high spirits , Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , or even Philadelphia . Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln , Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved his army in pursuit , but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade . Elements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1 , 1863 , as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there , his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it . Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig . Gen. John Buford , and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry . However , two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north , collapsing the hastily developed Union lines , sending the defenders retreating through the streets of the town to the hills just to the south .
