A three-time Super Bowl champion with the Cowboys , he is the league 's all-time leading rusher . Smith grew up in Pensacola , Florida and became the second-leading rusher in American high school football history while playing for Escambia High School . Smith played three years of college football for the Florida Gators , where he set numerous school rushing records . After being named a unanimous All-American in 1989 , Smith chose to forgo his senior year of eligibility and play professionally . The Cowboys selected Smith in the first round of the 1990 NFL draft . During his long professional career , he rushed for 18,355 yards , breaking the record formerly held by Walter Payton . He also holds the record for career rushing touchdowns with 164 . Smith is the only running back to ever win a Super Bowl championship , the NFL Most Valuable Player award , the NFL rushing crown , and the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player award all in the same season ( 1993 ) . He is also one of four running backs to lead the NFL in rushing three or more consecutive seasons , joining Steve Van Buren , Jim Brown and Earl Campbell .

The team is headquartered in Frisco , Texas , and plays its home games at AT & T Stadium in Arlington , Texas , which opened for the 2009 season . The stadium took its current name prior to the 2013 season . The Cowboys joined the NFL as an expansion team in 1960 . The team 's national following might best be represented by its NFL record of consecutive sell-outs . The Cowboys ' streak of 190 consecutive sold-out regular and post-season games ( home and away ) began in 2002 . The franchise has made it to the Super Bowl eight times , tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Denver Broncos for second most Super Bowl appearances in history , just behind the New England Patriots record eleven Super Bowl appearances . This has also corresponded to eight NFC championships , most in the NFC . The Cowboys have won five of those Super Bowl appearances , tying them with their NFC rivals , the San Francisco 49ers ; both are second to Pittsburgh 's and New England 's record six Super Bowl championships . The Cowboys are the only NFL team to record 20 straight winning seasons ( 1966-85 ) , in which they missed the playoffs only twice ( 1974 and 1984 ) . In 2015 , the Dallas Cowboys became the first sports team to be valued at $ 4 billion , making it the most valuable sports team in the world , according to Forbes .",
  "/wiki/1990_NFL_season": "The 1990 NFL season was the 71st regular season of the National Football League . To increase revenue , the league , for the first time since 1966 , reinstated bye weeks , so that all NFL teams would play their 16-game schedule over a 17-week period . Furthermore , the playoff format was expanded from 10 teams to 12 teams by adding another wild card from each conference , thus adding two more contests to the postseason schedule ; this format remains in use today ( although there are now four division spots and two wild card spots available with realignment in 2002 ) . During four out of the five previous seasons , at least one team with a 10-6 record missed the playoffs , including the 11-5 Denver Broncos in 1985 ; meanwhile , the 10-6 San Francisco 49ers won Super Bowl XXIII , leading for calls to expand the playoff format to ensure that 10-6 teams could compete for a Super Bowl win . Ironically , the first ever sixth-seeded playoff team would not have a 10-6 record , but instead , the New Orleans Saints , with an 8-8 record , took the new playoff spot . This was also the first full season for Paul Tagliabue as the league 's Commissioner , after taking over from Pete Rozelle midway through the previous season . ABC was given the rights to televise the two additional playoff games . Meanwhile , Turner 's TNT network started to broadcast Sunday night games for the first half of the season . On October 8 , the league announced that the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award would be named the Pete Rozelle Trophy . The season ended with Super Bowl XXV when the New York Giants defeated the Buffalo Bills 20-19 at Tampa Stadium . This would be the first Super Bowl appearance for Buffalo , who would lose the next three Super Bowls as well . Late in the season , with the Gulf War looming closer , the NFL announced that starting in Week 16 ( and continuing until Super Bowl XXV ) , the league would add American flag decals to the back of the helmet .",

Also , a selection committee of media and league personnel named a special NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team , honoring the best NFL players from the first 75 seasons . The Phoenix Cardinals changed their name to Arizona Cardinals in an attempt to widen their appeal to the entire state of Arizona instead of just the Phoenix area . The name was initially resisted by Bill Bidwill . The Seattle Seahawks played their first three regular season home games at Husky Stadium because the Kingdome , the Seahawks ' regular home field , was undergoing repairs for damaged tiles on its roof .

The Rams ' relocation to St. Louis gave the city a professional football team for the first time since the end of the 1987 season . That was the last year that the now-Arizona Cardinals played there before moving to Tempe in 1988 . The relocation was the second in Rams franchise history ; the team previously called Cleveland , Ohio home until 1946 . The Rams played their home games at what is now known as The Dome at America 's Center in downtown St. Louis , which the city had been constructing for the previous few years in the hopes of gaining an NFL team . The city was left out of the expansion that brought Charlotte and Jacksonville into the league for 1995 and another attempt to secure a franchise fell through when the ownership group controlling the New England Patriots was forced out of power by their stadium 's owner and operator . The Rams new stadium was not ready for them when they initially arrived in Missouri , so they were forced to temporarily share Busch Memorial Stadium with the St. Louis Cardinals . Their first game in St. Louis against the New Orleans Saints was played on September 10 , 1995 with the Rams winning 17-13 . The then- Trans World Dome opened on November 12 , 1995 with the home team scoring a 28-17 victory against the Carolina Panthers .

The return of the Browns increased the number of teams to 31 , the first time the league had played with an odd number of teams since 1966 . This required the NFL to give at least one team a bye each week ; previously , barring extreme circumstances , a club never received a bye during the first two weeks or last seven weeks of the season . Under a new system , for ten weeks of the season ( Week # 1 , Week # 2 and Week # 10 to Week # 17 ) , one team received a bye , and for seven weeks of the season ( Week # 3 to Week # 9 ) , three teams received a bye . This format would continue until the Houston Texans joined the NFL in 2002 , returning the league to an even number of teams . The start of the 1999 NFL Season was pushed back one week and started the weekend after Labor Day , a change from the previous seasons : due to the Y2K concerns , the NFL did not want to hold the opening round of the playoffs on Saturday January 1 , 2000 , and did not want teams traveling on that day . This was also done to avoid competing against college football 's New Years Day bowl games . Week 17 games were held on January 2 , 2000 , and the opening round of the playoffs would be scheduled for January 8 and 9 , with the bye week before the Super Bowl removed to accommodate the one-week adjustment .

  "/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals": "The Cincinnati Bengals are a professional American football franchise based in Cincinnati , Ohio . The Bengals compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member club of the league 's American Football Conference ( AFC ) North division . Their home stadium is Paul Brown Stadium , located in downtown Cincinnati . Their divisional opponents are the Baltimore Ravens , Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers . The Bengals were founded in 1966 as a member of the American Football League ( AFL ) by former Cleveland Browns head coach Paul Brown , and began play in the 1968 season . Brown was the Bengals ' head coach from their inception to 1975 . After being dismissed as the Browns ' head coach by Art Modell ( who had purchased majority interest in the team in 1961 ) in January 1963 , Brown had shown interest in establishing another NFL franchise in Ohio and looked at both Cincinnati and Columbus . He ultimately chose the former when a deal between the city , Hamilton County , and Major League Baseball 's Cincinnati Reds ( who were seeking a replacement for the obsolete Crosley Field ) was struck that resulted in an agreement to build a multipurpose stadium which could host both baseball and football games . Due to the impending merger of the AFL and the NFL , which was scheduled to take full effect in the 1970 season , Brown agreed to join the AFL as its tenth and final franchise . The Bengals , like the other former AFL teams , were assigned to the AFC following the merger . Cincinnati was also selected because , like their neighbors the Reds , they could draw from several large neighboring cities ( Louisville and Lexington , Kentucky ; Columbus , Dayton , and Springfield , Ohio ) that are all no more than 110 miles ( 180 km ) away from downtown Cincinnati , along with Indianapolis , until the Baltimore Colts relocated there prior to the 1984 NFL season . The Bengals won the AFC championship in 1981 and 1988 , but lost Super Bowls XVI and XXIII to the San Francisco 49ers ."
