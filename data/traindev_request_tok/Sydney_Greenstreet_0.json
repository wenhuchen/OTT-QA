Initially , it was planned that the film would portray an attempt to avert a Japanese plan to bomb Pearl Harbor . When the real-life Pearl Harbor bombing occurred , the script was quickly rewritten to change the location of the planned attack to Panama . Director John Huston was called up to military service during filming ; he claimed he left at the point near the end of the film in which Bogart is trapped in a house at gun-point .
