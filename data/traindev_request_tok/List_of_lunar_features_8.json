  "/wiki/Diameter": "In geometry , a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle . It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle . Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere . In more modern usage , the length of a diameter is also called the diameter . In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter ( which refers to the line segment itself ) , because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length , this being twice the radius r .",

He traced the plications from minor to major stages , and illustrated the remarkable foldings and overthrust faultings in numerous sections and with the aid of pictorial drawings . His initial misinterpretation of the Glarus Alps as resulting entirely from folding rather than from a major thrust fault , an error which he acknowledged in 1901 , did not detract measurably from his considerable contributions .

Niggli was born in Zofingen and studied at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ( ETH ) in Zurich and the University of Zurich , where he obtained a doctorate . His 1919 book , Geometrische Kristallographie des Diskontinuums , played a seminal role in the refinement of space group theory . In this book , Niggli demonstrated that although X-ray reflection conditions do not always uniquely determine the space group to which a crystal belongs , they do reveal a small number of possible space groups to which it could belong . Niggli used morphological methods to account for internal structure and , in his 1928 Kristallographische und Strukturtheoretische Grundbegriffe , he took up what is essentially the reverse process , the task of establishing the connection between space lattices and external crystal morphology . The great aim of his life was to integrate the whole field of Earth sciences . In 1920 , Niggli became the lead scientist at the ETH 's Institut f\u00fcr Mineralogie und Petrographie , where he brought his systematic approach to the study of crystal morphologies using X-ray diffraction . In 1935 , Niggli and his doctoral student Werner Nowacki ( 1909-1988 ) determined the 73 three-dimensional arithmetic crystal classes ( symmorphic space groups ) . Niggli retired from the Institute in 1949 . He was also professor of mineralogy at the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule and at the University of Zurich .

It has the longest documented history of any living Indo-European language , spanning at least 3,500 years of written records . Its writing system has been the Greek alphabet for the major part of its history ; other systems , such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary , were used previously . The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin , Cyrillic , Armenian , Coptic , Gothic , and many other writing systems . The Greek language holds an important place in the history of the Western world and Christianity ; the canon of ancient Greek literature includes works in the Western canon such as the epic poems Iliad and Odyssey . Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science , especially astronomy , mathematics and logic and Western philosophy , such as the Platonic dialogues and the works of Aristotle , are composed ; the New Testament of the Christian Bible was written in Koin\u00e9 Greek . Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world , the study of the Greek texts and society of antiquity constitutes the discipline of Classics . During antiquity , Greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world , West Asia and many places beyond . It would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire and develop into Medieval Greek . In its modern form , Greek is the official language in two countries , Greece and Cyprus , a recognised minority language in seven other countries , and is one of the 24 official languages of the European Union . The language is spoken by at least 13.2 million people today in Greece , Cyprus , Italy , Albania , and Turkey and by the Greek diaspora .
