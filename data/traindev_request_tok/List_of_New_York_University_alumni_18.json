The United States courts of appeals are considered among the most powerful and influential courts in the United States .

The D.C . Circuit in particular is very influential , since it covers Washington , D.C. , and thus covers Congress and many U.S. government agencies . The Ninth Circuit , which covers the entire west coast of the United States and contains 20% of the American population , is also an influential court .
