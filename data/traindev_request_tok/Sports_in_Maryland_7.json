The Atlantic League requires cities to have the market for a 4,000 to 7,500-seat ballpark and for the facility to be maintained at or above Triple-A standards . When Atlantic League professionals are signed by MLB clubs , they usually start in their Double-A or Triple-A affiliates .

In 2019 , the Atlantic League began a three-year partnership with Major League Baseball allowing MLB to implement changes to Atlantic League playing rules , in order to observe the effects of potential future rule changes and equipment .",

The Federal League came together in early 1913 through the work of John T. Powers , and immediately challenged the operations of organized baseball . Playing in what detractors called the outlaw league allowed players to avoid the restrictions of the organized leagues ' reserve clause . The competition of another , better paying league caused players ' salaries to skyrocket , demonstrating the bargaining potential of free agency for the first time . Interference by the National and American Leagues in their operations caused the Federal League to fold after the 1915 season . This resulted in a landmark federal lawsuit , Federal Baseball Club v. National League , in which the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ruled that the Sherman Antitrust Act did not apply to Major League Baseball . The Federal League left its mark on baseball history in the field now known as Wrigley Field , which was originally built for the Chicago Whales Federal League team . The league itself and many sports writers considered it a major league during its existence ; organized baseball recognized its major league status in 1968 .
