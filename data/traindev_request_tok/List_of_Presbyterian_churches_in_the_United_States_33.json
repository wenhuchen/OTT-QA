Local Presbyterians were organized into a congregation in 1837 , but nearly two decades passed before the building was built ; it was constructed in 1855 according to a design produced by Jacob Merkle . The local economy at the time was heavily dependent on nearby stone quarries , and the congregation was no different : when the quarries closed in 1905 , the congregation was also disorganized . After twenty years of vacancy , the building became home to another Presbyterian congregation in 1925 . Growth forced the building 's replacement in the 1960s , and a new structure was finished on an adjacent property in 1963 .
