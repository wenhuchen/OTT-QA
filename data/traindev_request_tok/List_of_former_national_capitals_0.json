It forms part of the Macaronesia ecoregion , along with the Azores , Canary Islands , Madeira , and the Savage Isles . Located 570 kilometres ( 350 mi ) west of the Cape Verde Peninsula off the coast of Northwest Africa , the islands cover a combined area of slightly over 4,000 square kilometres ( 1,500 sq mi ) . The Cape Verde archipelago was uninhabited until the 15th century , when Portuguese explorers discovered and colonized the islands , establishing the first European settlement in the tropics . Ideally located for the Atlantic slave trade , the islands grew prosperous throughout the 16th and 17th centuries , attracting merchants , privateers , and pirates . The end of transatlantic slavery in the 19th century led to economic decline and emigration . Cape Verde gradually recovered as an important commercial center and stopover for shipping routes . Incorporated as an overseas department of Portugal in 1951 , the islands continued to campaign for independence , which was achieved in 1975 . Since the early 1990s , Cape Verde has been a stable representative democracy , and remains one of the most developed and democratic countries in Africa . Lacking natural resources , its developing economy is mostly service-oriented , with a growing focus on tourism and foreign investment . Its population of around 540,000 is mostly of mixed European , Moorish , Arab and African heritage , and predominantly Roman Catholic , reflecting the legacy of Portuguese rule .

  "/wiki/Congo_Free_State": "The Congo Free State , also known as the Independent State of the Congo ( French : \u00c9tat ind\u00e9pendant du Congo , Dutch : Kongo-Vrijstaat ) , was a large state in Central Africa from 1885 to 1908 . It was ruled personally by Leopold II and not by the government of Belgium , of which he was the constitutional monarch . Leopold II was able to procure the region by convincing other Eurasian states at the Berlin Conference that he was involved in humanitarian and philanthropic work and would not tax trade . Via the International Association of the Congo , he was able to lay claim to most of the Congo basin . On 29 May 1885 , after the closure of the Berlin Conference , the king announced that he planned to name his possessions the Congo Free State , an appellation which was not yet used at the Berlin Conference and which officially replaced International Association of the Congo on 1 August 1885 . The Congo Free State operated as a corporate state privately controlled by Leopold II , although he never personally visited the state . The state included the entire area of the present Democratic Republic of the Congo and existed from 1885 to 1908 , when the government of Belgium reluctantly annexed the area . Leopold 's reign in the Congo eventually earned infamy on account of the atrocities perpetrated on the locals . Leopold II 's Free State extracted ivory , rubber and minerals in the upper Congo basin for sale on the world market through a series of international concessionary companies , even though its ostensible purpose in the region was to uplift the local people and develop the area . Under Leopold II 's administration , the Congo Free State became one of the greatest international scandals of the early 20th century . The Casement Report of the British Consul Roger Casement led to the arrest and punishment of officials who had been responsible for killings during a rubber-collecting expedition in 1903 . The loss of life and atrocities inspired literature such as Joseph Conrad 's novel Heart of Darkness and raised an international outcry .",

It was formerly called Zaire ( 1971-1997 ) . It is , by area , the largest country in sub-Saharan Africa , the second-largest in all of Africa ( after Algeria ) , and the 11th-largest in the world . With a population of over 84 million , the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most populous officially Francophone country , the fourth-most-populous country in Africa , and the 16th-most-populous country in the world . Eastern DR Congo has been the scene of ongoing military conflict in Kivu , since 2015 . Centred on the Congo Basin , the territory of the DRC was first inhabited by Central African foragers around 90,000 years ago and was reached by the Bantu expansion about 3,000 years ago . In the west , the Kingdom of Kongo ruled around the mouth of the Congo River from the 14th to 19th centuries . In the centre and east , the kingdoms of Luba and Lunda ruled from the 16th and 17th centuries to the 19th century . In the 1870s , just before the onset of the Scramble for Africa , European exploration of the Congo Basin was carried out , first led by Henry Morton Stanley under the sponsorship of Leopold II of Belgium . Leopold formally acquired rights to the Congo territory at the Berlin Conference in 1885 and made the land his private property , naming it the Congo Free State . During the Free State , his colonial military unit , the Force Publique , forced the local population to produce rubber . From 1885 to 1908 , millions of the Kongo people died as a consequence of disease and exploitation .",

The former colony adopted its present-day name , the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) , in 1964 . Colonial rule in the Congo began in the late 19th century . King Leopold II of Belgium attempted to persuade the Belgian government to support colonial expansion around the then-largely unexplored Congo Basin . Their ambivalence resulted in Leopold 's establishing a colony himself . With support from a number of Western countries , Leopold achieved international recognition for a personal colony , the Congo Free State , in 1885 . By the turn of the century , however , the violence used by Free State officials against indigenous Congolese and a ruthless system of economic exploitation led to intense diplomatic pressure on Belgium to take official control of the country , which it did by creating the Belgian Congo in 1908 . Belgian rule in the Congo was based on the colonial trinity ( trinit\u00e9 coloniale ) of state , missionary and private-company interests . The privileging of Belgian commercial interests meant that large amounts of capital flowed into the Congo and that individual regions became specialised . On many occasions , the interests of the government and of private enterprise became closely linked , and the state helped companies to break strikes and to remove other barriers raised by the indigenous population . The colony was divided into hierarchically organised administrative subdivisions , and run uniformly according to a set native policy ( politique indig\u00e8ne ) . This contrasted the practice of British and French colonial policy , which generally favoured systems of indirect rule , retaining traditional leaders in positions of authority under colonial oversight .",

Built in a fertile agricultural area , it developed from the 3rd century BC onward as a Berber , then proto-Carthaginian , settlement before being the capital of the kingdom of Mauretania . It grew rapidly under Roman rule from the 1st century AD onward and expanded to cover about 42 hectares ( 100 acres ) with a 2.6 km ( 1.6 mi ) circuit of walls . The city gained a number of major public buildings in the 2nd century , including a basilica , temple and triumphal arch . Its prosperity , which was derived principally from olive growing , prompted the construction of many fine town-houses with large mosaic floors . The city fell to local tribes around 285 and was never retaken by Rome because of its remoteness and indefensibility on the south-western border of the Roman Empire . It continued to be inhabited for at least another 700 years , first as a Latinised Christian community , then as an early Islamic settlement . In the late 8th century it became the seat of Idris ibn Abdallah , the founder of the Idrisid dynasty and the state of Morocco . By the 11th century Volubilis had been abandoned after the seat of power was relocated to Fes . Much of the local population was transferred to the new town of Moulay Idriss Zerhoun , about 5 km ( 3.1 mi ) from Volubilis . The ruins remained substantially intact until they were devastated by an earthquake in the mid-18th century and subsequently looted by Moroccan rulers seeking stone for building Meknes .

The city was one of Morocco 's four imperial cities . In the 12th century , the Almoravids built many madrasas ( Quranic schools ) and mosques in Marrakesh that bear Andalusian influences . The red walls of the city , built by Ali ibn Yusuf in 1122-1123 , and various buildings constructed in red sandstone during this period , have given the city the nickname of the Red City or Ochre City .

It established an empire in the 11th century that stretched over the western Maghreb and Al-Andalus .

The dynasty originated among the Lamtuna and the Gudala , nomadic Berber tribes of the Sahara , traversing the territory between the Draa , the Niger , and the Senegal rivers . The Almoravids were crucial in preventing the fall of Al-Andalus to the Iberian Christian kingdoms , when they decisively defeated a coalition of the Castilian and Aragonese armies at the Battle of Sagrajas in 1086 . This enabled them to control an empire that stretched 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) north to south . However , the rule of the dynasty was relatively short-lived . The Almoravids fell - at the height of their power - when they failed to stop the Masmuda-led rebellion initiated by Ibn Tumart .

They then extended their power over all of the Maghreb by 1159 . Al-Andalus soon followed , and all of Muslim Iberia was under Almohad rule by 1172 . The Almohad dominance of Iberia continued until 1212 , when Muhammad III , al-Nasir ( 1199-1214 ) was defeated at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in the Sierra Morena by an alliance of the Christian princes of Castile , Aragon and Navarre . Nearly all of the Moorish dominions in Iberia were lost soon afterwards , with the great Moorish cities of Cordova and Seville falling to the Christians in 1236 and 1248 respectively . The Almohads continued to rule in Africa until the piecemeal loss of territory through the revolt of tribes and districts enabled the rise of their most effective enemies , the Marinids , in 1215 . The last representative of the line , Idris al-Wathiq , was reduced to the possession of Marrakesh , where he was murdered by a slave in 1269 ; the Marinids seized Marrakesh , ending the Almohad domination of the Western Maghreb .",

In 1244 , the Marinid rulers overthrew the Almohad Caliphate , which had controlled present-day Morocco . The Marinid dynasty briefly held sway over all the Maghreb in the mid-14th century . It supported the Kingdom of Granada in al-Andalus in the 13th and 14th centuries ; an attempt to gain a direct foothold on the European side of the Strait of Gibraltar was however defeated at the Battle of R\u00edo Salado in 1340 and finished after the Castilian conquest of Algeciras from the Marinids in 1344 .

He was the seventh son of Moulay Sharif and was governor of the Kingdom of Fez and the north of Morocco from 1667 until the death of his half-brother , Sultan Moulay Rashid in 1672 . He was proclaimed sultan at Fez , but spent several years in conflict with his nephew Moulay Ahmed ben Mehrez , who also claimed the throne , until the latter 's death in 1687 . Moulay Ismail 's 55-year reign is the longest of any sultan of Morocco . The reign of Moulay Ismail marked a high watermark for Moroccan power . His military successes are explained by the creation of a strong army , originally relying on the 'Guichs ' ( especially the Udaya ) and on the Black Guard ( or Abid al-Bukhari ) , black slaves who were totally devoted to him . As a result , the central power could be less reliant on tribes that often rebelled . Moulay Ismail successfully campaigned against the Ottomans in Algiers and their vassals and expelled the Europeans from the ports they had occupied : Larache , Asilah , Mehdya , and Tangiers . He took thousands of Christians prisoner and nearly took Ceuta . Ismail controlled a fleet of corsairs based at Sal\u00e9-le-Vieux and Sal\u00e9-le-Neuf ( now Rabat ) , which supplied him with Christian slaves and weapons through their raids in the Mediterranean and all the way to the Black Sea . He established significant diplomatic relations with foreign powers , especially the Kingdom of France , Great Britain , and Spain .

It was the centre of administrative power in Egypt , until it was ordered burnt in 1168 by its own vizier , Shawar , to keep its wealth out of the hands of the invading Crusaders .

Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan , across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia , and across the Mediterranean lie Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , although none share a land border with Egypt . Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism .

  "/wiki/Ancient_Greeks": "Ancient Greece ( Greek : \u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 , romanized : Hell\u00e1s ) was a civilization belonging to a period of Greek history from the Greek Dark Ages of the 12th-9th centuries BC to the end of antiquity ( c. AD 600 ) . Immediately following this period was the beginning of the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine era . Roughly three centuries after the Late Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece , Greek urban poleis began to form in the 8th century BC , ushering in the Archaic period and colonization of the Mediterranean Basin . This was followed by the period of Classical Greece , an era that began with the Greco-Persian Wars , lasting from the 5th to 4th centuries BC . Due to the conquests by Alexander the Great of Macedon , Hellenistic civilization flourished from Central Asia to the western end of the Mediterranean Sea . The Hellenistic period came to an end with the conquests and annexations of the eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic , which established the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece , and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire . Classical Greek culture , especially philosophy , had a powerful influence on ancient Rome , which carried a version of it to many parts of the Mediterranean Basin and Europe . For this reason , Classical Greece is generally considered to be the seminal culture which provided the foundation of modern Western culture and is considered the cradle of Western civilization . Classical Greek culture gave great importance to knowledge . Science and religion were not separate and getting closer to the truth meant getting closer to the gods . In this context , they understood the importance of mathematics as an instrument for obtaining more reliable ( divine ) knowledge . Greek culture , in a few centuries and with a limited population , managed to explore and make progress in many fields of science , mathematics , philosophy and knowledge in general .",
  "/wiki/Ancient_Egypt": "Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient North Africa , concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River , situated in the place that is now the country Egypt . Ancient Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3100 BC ( according to conventional Egyptian chronology ) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes ( often identified with Narmer ) . The history of ancient Egypt occurred as a series of stable kingdoms , separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods : the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age , the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age . Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power in the New Kingdom , ruling much of Nubia and a sizable portion of the Near East , after which it entered a period of slow decline . During the course of its history Egypt was invaded or conquered by a number of foreign powers , including the Hyksos , the Libyans , the Nubians , the Assyrians , the Achaemenid Persians , and the Macedonians under the command of Alexander the Great . The Greek Ptolemaic Kingdom , formed in the aftermath of Alexander 's death , ruled Egypt until 30 BC , when , under Cleopatra , it fell to the Roman Empire and became a Roman province . The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River valley for agriculture . The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops , which supported a more dense population , and social development and culture . With resources to spare , the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions , the early development of an independent writing system , the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects , trade with surrounding regions , and a military intended to assert Egyptian dominance . Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes , religious leaders , and administrators under the control of a pharaoh , who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs . The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying , surveying and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental pyramids , temples , and obelisks ; a system of mathematics , a practical and effective system of medicine , irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques , the first known planked boats , Egyptian faience and glass technology , new forms of literature , and the earliest known peace treaty , made with the Hittites .
