Outside the US , Knock Three Times also claimed the number-one spot on the UK Singles Chart . The composers of this song , L. Russell Brown and Irwin Levine , were thinking of the song Up on the Roof and they wanted to write a song with that kind of lyrical flavor , about tenement living . In the song , the singer has fallen in love with a woman who lives in the apartment directly below him but has no clue as to her interest , so he asks her to respond by either knocking three times on the ceiling ( yes ) or banging twice on the pipe ( no ) , and the chorus includes sound effects of the two choices . Michael Anthony Orlando Cassavitis was , at the time of the recording , working as a producer/singer for a rival record label , and first heard the tune recorded by another artist and immediately knew the song could be a hit if produced as he envisioned . Cassavitis cut the track discreetly under the name Dawn , hoping that his current record label would not find out . Upon release , the song became a great success . Knock Three Times appears in several motion pictures including Now and Then .",
