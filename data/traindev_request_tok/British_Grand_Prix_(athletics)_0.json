Powell and fellow Jamaican Sprinter , Sherone Simpson had taken the supplement Ephiphany D1 as part of their training regimen , not knowing it contained oxilofrine .",
  "/wiki/200_metres": "The 200 metres ( also spelt 200 meters ) is a sprint running event . On an outdoor race 400 m track , the race begins on the curve and ends on the home straight , so a combination of techniques are needed to successfully run the race . A slightly shorter race , called the stadion and run on a straight track , was the first recorded event at the ancient Olympic Games . The 200 m places more emphasis on speed endurance than shorter sprint distances as athletes predominantly rely on anaerobic energy system during the 200 m sprint . Similarly to other sprint distances , the 200 m begins from the starting blocks . When the sprinters adopt the 'set ' position in the blocks they are able to adopt a more efficient starting posture and isometrically preload their muscles . This enables them to stride forwards more powerfully when the race begins and start faster . In the United States and elsewhere , athletes previously ran the 220-yard dash ( 201.168 m ) instead of the 200 m ( 218.723 yards ) , though the distance is now obsolete . The standard adjustment used for the conversion from times recorded over 220 yards to 200 m times is to subtract 0.1 seconds , but other conversion methods exist . Another obsolete version of this race is the 200 metres straight , which was run on tracks that contained such a straight . Initially , when the International Amateur Athletic Association ( now known as the International Association of Athletics Federations ) started to ratify world records in 1912 , only records set on a straight track were eligible for consideration . In 1951 , the IAAF started to recognise records set on a curved track .",
  "/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(athlete)": "Michael Duane Johnson ( born September 13 , 1967 ) is an American retired sprinter who won four Olympic gold medals and eight World Championships gold medals in the span of his career . He formerly held the world and Olympic records in the 200 m and 400 m , as well as the world record in the indoor 400 m. He also once held the world 's best time in the 300 m. Johnson is generally considered one of the greatest and most consistent sprinters in the history of track and field . Johnson is the only male athlete in history to win both the 200 metres and 400 metres events at the same Olympics , a feat he accomplished at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta . Johnson is also the only man to successfully defend his Olympic title in the 400 m , having done so at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney . Aside from his Olympic success , Johnson accumulated eight gold medals at the World Championships and is tied with Carl Lewis for the third most gold medals won by a runner ( after Usain Bolt and Allyson Felix ) . Johnson 's stiff upright running position and very short steps defied the conventional wisdom that a high knee lift was necessary for maximum speed . As of 2012 , Johnson holds 13 of the top 100 times for the 200 metres and 27 of the top 100 times for the 400 metres . Of those , he holds 14 of the top 25 times for the 400 metres . He broke 44 seconds for the 400 metres twenty-two times , more than twice as many times as any other athlete . Johnson currently holds the national records for the 200 , 300 and 400 metres . The 4 x 400 metres relay world record was anchored by Johnson .",

He failed a drugs test in 1998 for an anabolic steroid , nandrolone , one of a number of high-profile positives in that year attributed to a tainted supplement , Maximuscle but was acquitted in 1999 by UK Athletics . IAAF did however overturn that decision and he received a two-year doping ban in 2000 .

  "/wiki/400_metres": "The 400 metres , or 400 metre dash , is a sprinting event in track and field competitions . It has been featured in the athletics programme at the Summer Olympics since 1896 for men and since 1964 for women . On a standard outdoor running track , it is one lap around the track . Runners start in staggered positions and race in separate lanes for the entire course . In many countries , athletes previously competed in the 440 yard dash ( 402.336 m ) - which is a quarter of a mile and was referred to as the 'quarter-mile ' - instead of the 400 m ( 437.445 yards ) , though this distance is now obsolete . Like other sprint disciplines , the 400 m involves the use of starting blocks . The runners take up position in the blocks on the 'ready ' command , adopt a more efficient starting posture which isometrically preloads their muscles on the 'set ' command , and stride forwards from the blocks upon hearing the starter 's pistol . The blocks allow the runners to begin more powerfully and thereby contribute to their overall sprint speed capability . Maximum sprint speed capability is a significant contributing factor to success in the event , but athletes also require substantial speed endurance and the ability to cope well with high amounts of lactic acid to sustain a fast speed over a whole lap . While considered to be predominantly an anaerobic event , there is some aerobic involvement and the degree of aerobic training required for 400 metre athletes is open to debate . The current men 's world record is held by Wayde van Niekerk of South Africa , with a time of 43.03 seconds ; van Niekerk is also the Olympic champion . Steven Gardiner is the reigning World Champion .",

  "/wiki/800_metres": "The 800 metres , or 800 meters ( US spelling ) , is a common track running event . It is the shortest common middle-distance running event . The 800 metres is run over two laps of the track ( 400-metre track ) and has been an Olympic event since the first games in 1896 . During indoor track season the event is usually run on a 200-metre track , therefore requiring four laps . The event was derived from the imperial measurement of a half a mile ( 880 yards ) , a traditional English racing distance . Imperial racing distances were common in the United States . American high schools ( in the name of the NFHS ) were the last to convert to metric distances in 1980 , following the NCAA 's conversion in 1976 . Countries associated to the English system converted to metric distances after the 1966 Commonwealth Games . 800 m is 4.67 m less than half a mile . The event combines aerobic endurance with anaerobic conditioning and sprint speed . Both the aerobic and anaerobic systems are being taxed to a high extent , thus the 800-metre athlete is required to combine training between both systems . Runners in this event are often fast enough to compete in the 400 metres or the 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay but only Alberto Juantorena and Jarmila Kratochv\u00edlov\u00e1 have won major international titles at 400 m and 800 m.

The demands of the race are similar to that of the 800 metres , but with a slightly higher emphasis on aerobic endurance and a slightly lower sprint speed requirement . The 1500 metre race is predominantly aerobic , but anaerobic conditioning is also required . Each lap run during the world-record race run by Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco in 1998 in Rome , Italy averaged just under 55 seconds ( or under 13.8 seconds per 100 metres ) . 1,500 metres is three and three-quarter laps around a 400-metre track . During the 1970s and 1980s this race was dominated by British runners , along with an occasional Finn , American , or New Zealander , but through the 1990s many African runners began to win Olympic medals in this race , especially runners from Kenya , Morocco and Algeria . In the Modern Olympic Games , the men 's 1,500-metre race has been contested from the beginning , and at every Olympic Games since . The first winner , in 1896 , was Edwin Flack of Australia , who also won the first gold medal in the 800-metre race . The women 's 1,500-metre race was first added to the Summer Olympics in 1972 , and the winner of the first gold medal was Lyudmila Bragina of the Soviet Union .

  "/wiki/Mile_run": "The mile run ( 1,760 yards or exactly 1,609.344 metres ) is a middle-distance foot race . The history of the mile run event began in England , where it was used as a distance for gambling races . It survived track and field 's switch to metric distances in the 1900s and retained its popularity , with the chase for the four-minute mile in the 1950s a high point for the race . In spite of the roughly equivalent 1500 metres race , the mile run is present in all fields of athletics and it remains the only imperial distance for which the IAAF records an official world record .

  "/wiki/3000_metres": "The 3000 metres or 3000-metre run is a track running event , also commonly known as the 3K or 3K run , where 7.5 laps are completed around an outdoor 400 m track or 15 laps around a 200 m indoor track . It is debated whether the 3000m should be classified as a middle distance or long distance event . In elite level competition , 3000 m pace is more comparable to the pace found in the longer 5000 metres event , rather than mile pace . The world record performance for 3000 m equates to a pace of 58.76 seconds per 400 m , which is closer to the 60.58 seconds for 5000 m than the 55.46 seconds for the mile . However , the 3000 m does require some anaerobic conditioning and an elite athlete needs to develop a high tolerance to lactic acid , as does the mile runner . Thus , the 3000 m demands a balance of aerobic endurance needed for the 5000 m and lactic acid tolerance needed for the Mile . In men 's athletics , 3000 metres has been an Olympic discipline only as a team race at the 1912 , 1920 and 1924 Summer Olympics . It has not been contested at any of the IAAF outdoor championships , but is occasionally hosted at annual elite track and field meetings . It is often featured in indoor track and field programmes and is the longest distance event present at the IAAF World Indoor Championships . In women 's athletics , 3000 metres was a standard event in the Olympic Games ( 1984 to 1992 ) and World Championships ( 1980 to 1993 ) . The event was discontinued at World Championship and Olympic level after the 1993 World Championships in Athletics - Qu Yunxia being the final gold medal winner at the event .

Fallen hurdles do not carry a fixed time penalty for the runners , but they have a significant pull-over weight which slows down the run . Like the 100 metres sprint , the 110 metres hurdles begins in the starting blocks . For the 110 m hurdles , the first hurdle is placed after a run-up of 13.72 metres ( 45 ft ) from the starting line .
