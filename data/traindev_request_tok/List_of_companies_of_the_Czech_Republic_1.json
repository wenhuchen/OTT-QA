  "/wiki/Aero_Vodochody": "Aero Vodochody ( commonly referred to as Aero ) is a Czech ( previous Czechoslovak ) aircraft company . The factory and factory airport is located in Prague-East District , on the territory between Vodochody and Odolena Voda region . It was active from 1919 , notable for producing the L-29 Delfin , L-39 Albatros , L-59 Super Albatros , and the L-159 Alca military light combat jet . From 1929 until 1951 Aero also made a range of small and medium-sized cars with two-stroke engines , and in 1946-47 it built the \u0160koda 150 truck under licence . After the fall of the communist government in Czechoslovakia ( 1989 ) and in the rest of Central Europe , the company lost a major portion of its main market in jet trainers . Sales of military aircraft declined in the early 1990s in Eastern Europe as well as in NATO countries where the entry of a new producer was obviously unwanted . Aero was controlled for several years , 1998 to 2004 , by Boeing . At the end of October 2006 Aero Vodochody was privatized once again . A Czech-Slovak investment group Penta Investments bought it for roughly 3 billion CZK . Currently , Aero Vodochody produces the Sikorsky S-76 , center wing box for the Alenia C27 , door subassemblies for the Embraer 170 and Embraer 190 , cockpit for the UH-60 , gun bay doors for the F/A-18 Super Hornet , subassemblies and parts for the Airbus A320 family , fixed leading edge kits for the Boeing 767 , and the L-159 advanced light combat aircraft . Aero is also likely to upgrade the runway at its Vodochody Airport near Prague to international airport standards which would serve mainly the low-cost air-carriers and charter flights heading to Prague .",
