  "/wiki/Impact_crater": "An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet , moon , or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere , formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body . In contrast to volcanic craters , which result from explosion or internal collapse , impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain . Impact craters range from small , simple , bowl-shaped depressions to large , complex , multi-ringed impact basins . Meteor Crater is a well-known example of a small impact crater on Earth . Impact craters are the dominant geographic features on many solid Solar System objects including the Moon , Mercury , Callisto , Ganymede and most small moons and asteroids . On other planets and moons that experience more active surface geological processes , such as Earth , Venus , Mars , Europa , Io and Titan , visible impact craters are less common because they become eroded , buried or transformed by tectonics over time . Where such processes have destroyed most of the original crater topography , the terms impact structure or astrobleme are more commonly used . In early literature , before the significance of impact cratering was widely recognised , the terms cryptoexplosion or cryptovolcanic structure were often used to describe what are now recognised as impact-related features on Earth . The cratering records of very old surfaces , such as Mercury , the Moon , and the southern highlands of Mars , record a period of intense early bombardment in the inner Solar System around 3.9 billion years ago . The rate of crater production on Earth has since been considerably lower , but it is appreciable nonetheless ; Earth experiences from one to three impacts large enough to produce a 20-kilometre-diameter ( 12 mi ) crater about once every million years on average . This indicates that there should be far more relatively young craters on the planet than have been discovered so far . The cratering rate in the inner solar system fluctuates as a consequence of collisions in the asteroid belt that create a family of fragments that are often sent cascading into the inner solar system .",
  "/wiki/Diameter": "In geometry , a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle . It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle . Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere . In more modern usage , the length of a diameter is also called the diameter . In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter ( which refers to the line segment itself ) , because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length , this being twice the radius r .",

  "/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach": "Johann Sebastian Bach [ a ] ( 31 March [ O.S . 21 March ] 1685 - 28 July 1750 ) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period . He is known for instrumental compositions such as the Brandenburg Concertos and the Goldberg Variations , and for vocal music such as the St Matthew Passion and the Mass in B minor . Since the 19th-century Bach Revival he has generally been regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time . The Bach family already counted several composers when Johann Sebastian was born as the last child of a city musician in Eisenach . After being orphaned at age 10 , he lived for five years with his eldest brother Johann Christoph , after which he continued his musical formation in L\u00fcneburg . From 1703 he was back in Thuringia , working as a musician for Protestant churches in Arnstadt and M\u00fchlhausen and , for longer stretches of time , at courts in Weimar , where he expanded his organ repertory , and K\u00f6then , where he was mostly engaged with chamber music . From 1723 he was employed as Thomaskantor ( cantor at St. Thomas ) in Leipzig . He composed music for the principal Lutheran churches of the city , and for its university 's student ensemble Collegium Musicum . From 1726 he published some of his keyboard and organ music . In Leipzig , as had happened during some of his earlier positions , he had difficult relations with his employer , a situation that was little remedied when he was granted the title of court composer by his sovereign , Augustus , Elector of Saxony and King of Poland , in 1736 . In the last decades of his life he reworked and extended many of his earlier compositions .",

The novel sequence La Com\u00e9die humaine , which presents a panorama of post-Napoleonic French life , is generally viewed as his magnum opus . Owing to his keen observation of detail and unfiltered representation of society , Balzac is regarded as one of the founders of realism in European literature . He is renowned for his multi-faceted characters ; even his lesser characters are complex , morally ambiguous and fully human . Inanimate objects are imbued with character as well ; the city of Paris , a backdrop for much of his writing , takes on many human qualities . His writing influenced many famous writers , including the novelists \u00c9mile Zola , Charles Dickens , Gustave Flaubert , and Henry James , filmmaker Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut as well as important philosophers such as Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx . Many of Balzac 's works have been made into films , and they continue to inspire other writers . An enthusiastic reader and independent thinker as a child , Balzac had trouble adapting to the teaching style of his grammar school . His willful nature caused trouble throughout his life and frustrated his ambitions to succeed in the world of business . When he finished school , Balzac was apprenticed in a law office , but he turned his back on the study of law after wearying of its inhumanity and banal routine . Before and during his career as a writer , he attempted to be a publisher , printer , businessman , critic , and politician ; he failed in all of these efforts .

He was a crucial figure in the transition between the classical and romantic eras in classical music and is considered to be one of the greatest composers of all time . Beethoven was born in Bonn , the capital of the Electorate of Cologne , which was part of the Holy Roman Empire . His musical talent was obvious at an early age , and he was harshly and intensively taught by his father Johann van Beethoven , who thought this would enable him to become a child prodigy like Mozart . He was later taught by the composer and conductor Christian Gottlob Neefe . At age 21 , he moved to Vienna and studied composition with Joseph Haydn . Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist , and he was soon courted by Karl Alois , Prince Lichnowsky for compositions , which resulted in Opus 1 in 1795 . The piece was a great critical and commercial success and was followed by Symphony No . 1 in 1800 . This composition was distinguished by its frequent use of sforzandi , sudden shifts in tonal centers ( which were uncommon for traditional symphonic form ) , and the prominent , more independent use of wind instruments . In 1801 , he also gained fame for his six String Quartets and for the ballet The Creatures of Prometheus .

The young prince Amenhotep ( who became the pharaoh Akhenaten ) had a palace here , and it is likely that his religious views were formed in part by the Heliopolitan teachings . Bek followed his lord to Akhet-Aten , the city founded by Akhenaten . He oversaw the construction of the great temple statues of the king and the opening of the Aswan and Gebel es-Silsila stone quarries , from where the stone was transported .

The statue is very likely to be one of the colossi of the pharaoh that was made by Men . This side of the stela reflects the traditional artistic style of the 18th dynasty , and the only indication of the Amarna period is that the name Amenhotep is left out , instead of it the pharaoh 's throne name Nebmaatre is repeated , in order to avoid having to mention the god Amun whose cult was forbidden .

  "/wiki/Hector_Berlioz": "Louis-Hector Berlioz [ n 1 ] ( 11 December 1803 - 8 March 1869 ) was a French Romantic composer . His output includes orchestral works such as the Symphonie fantastique and Harold in Italy , choral pieces including the Requiem and L'Enfance du Christ , his three operas Benvenuto Cellini , Les Troyens and B\u00e9atrice et B\u00e9n\u00e9dict , and works of hybrid genres such as the dramatic symphony Rom\u00e9o et Juliette and the dramatic legend La Damnation de Faust . The elder son of a provincial doctor , Berlioz was expected to follow his father into medicine , and he attended a Parisian medical college before defying his family by taking up music as a profession . His independence of mind and refusal to follow traditional rules and formulas put him at odds with the conservative musical establishment of Paris . He briefly moderated his style sufficiently to win France 's premier music prize , the Prix de Rome , in 1830 but he learned little from the academics of the Paris Conservatoire . Opinion was divided for many years between those who thought him an original genius and those who viewed his music as lacking in form and coherence . At the age of twenty-two Berlioz fell in love with the Irish Shakespearean actress Harriet Smithson , and he pursued her obsessively until she finally accepted him seven years later . Their marriage was happy at first but eventually foundered . Harriet inspired his first major success , the Symphonie fantastique , in which an idealised depiction of her occurs throughout . Berlioz completed three operas , the first of which , Benvenuto Cellini , was an outright failure . The second , the huge epic Les Troyens ( The Trojans ) , was so large in scale that it was never staged in its entirety during his lifetime . His last opera , B\u00e9atrice et B\u00e9n\u00e9dict - based on Shakespeare 's comedy Much Ado About Nothing - was a success at its premiere but did not enter the regular operatic repertoire .",
  "/wiki/Bernini_(crater)": "Bernini is a crater on Mercury . It has a diameter of 146 kilometers . Its name was adopted by the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) in 1976 . Bernini is named for the Italian architect and sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini , who lived from 1598 to 1680 .",
  "/wiki/Gian_Lorenzo_Bernini": "Gian Lorenzo ( or Gianlorenzo ) Bernini ( /b\u025b\u0259r\u02c8ni\u02d0ni/ , also US : /b\u0259r\u02c8-/ , Italian : [ \u02c8d\u0292an lo\u02c8r\u025bntso ber\u02c8ni\u02d0ni ] ; also Giovanni Lorenzo ; 7 December 1598 - 28 November 1680 ) was an Italian sculptor and architect . While a major figure in the world of architecture , he was , also and even more prominently , the leading sculptor of his age , credited with creating the Baroque style of sculpture . As one scholar has commented , What Shakespeare is to drama , Bernini may be to sculpture : the first pan-European sculptor whose name is instantaneously identifiable with a particular manner and vision , and whose influence was inordinately powerful . In addition , he was a painter ( mostly small canvases in oil ) and a man of the theater : he wrote , directed and acted in plays ( mostly Carnival satires ) , for which he designed stage sets and theatrical machinery . He produced designs as well for a wide variety of decorative art objects including lamps , tables , mirrors , and even coaches . As architect and city planner , he designed secular buildings , churches , chapels , and public squares , as well as massive works combining both architecture and sculpture , especially elaborate public fountains and funerary monuments and a whole series of temporary structures ( in stucco and wood ) for funerals and festivals . His broad technical versatility , boundless compositional inventiveness and sheer skill in manipulating marble ensured that he would be considered a worthy successor of Michelangelo , far outshining other sculptors of his generation . His talent extended beyond the confines of sculpture to a consideration of the setting in which it would be situated ; his ability to synthesize sculpture , painting , and architecture into a coherent conceptual and visual whole has been termed by the late art historian Irving Lavin the unity of the visual arts .",
