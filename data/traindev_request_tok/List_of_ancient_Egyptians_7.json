He had many titles , including Superintendent of the Granaries , Superintendent of the Royal Buildings , Superintendent of the Workmen in the Karnak Treasuries , etc . Ineni came from an aristocratic family and likely began his career as an architect under Amenhotep I. Amenhotep I commissioned Ineni to expand the Temple of Karnak . The expansion included a barque shrine of Amun and a new treasury . Ineni probably also oversaw the construction of Amenhotep I 's tomb and mortuary temple . The mortuary temple was the first to be disconnected from the actual tomb , presumably so it would not draw attention to the burial site . Amenhotep I died before the treasury could be completed , but Ineni was retained by his successor , Thutmose I . An avid builder , Thutmose I commissioned many construction projects during his rule , including the first tomb carved out at the Valley of the Kings .

The arrival of the Hyksos led to the end of the Thirteenth Dynasty and initiated the Second Intermediate Period of Egypt . In the context of Ancient Egypt , the term Asiatic refers to people native to areas east of Egypt . Immigration by Canaanite populations preceded the Hyksos . Canaanites first appeared in Egypt at the end of the 12th Dynasty c. 1800 BC or c. 1720 BC and established an independent realm in the eastern Nile Delta . The Canaanite rulers of the Delta regrouped and founded the Fourteenth Dynasty , which coexisted with the Egyptian Thirteenth Dynasty and was based in Itjtawy .

On this basis , Kim Ryholt assigns a large heart-scarab , which was , and indeed still is , set in a large gold mount containing the name of 'Sobekemsaf ' to Sekhemre Wadjkhau Sobekemsaf I here since the tomb robbers would not overlook such a large object on the mummy of the king if it came from Sobekemsaf II 's tomb . For much the same reason , a wooden canopic chest also bearing the name 'Sobekemsaf ' on it has also been attributed to this king by Ryholt and Aidan Dodson . In contrast to the extensive damage that might have been expected had the chest been in the burned and looted tomb of Sobekemsaf II , the damage suffered by Cat . 26 ( i.e. , Sobekemsaf I 's chest ) is minor , consistent with what it might have suffered at the hands of Qurnawi dealers ."
