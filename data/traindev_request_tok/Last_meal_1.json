He was tasked by SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Reinhard Heydrich with facilitating and managing the logistics involved in the mass deportation of Jews to ghettos and extermination camps in Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe during World War II . Eichmann was captured by the Mossad in Argentina on 11 May 1960 and subsequently found guilty of war crimes in a widely publicised trial in Jerusalem , where he was executed by hanging in 1962 . After an unremarkable school career , Eichmann briefly worked for his father 's mining company in Austria , where the family had moved in 1914 . He worked as a travelling oil salesman beginning in 1927 , and joined both the Nazi Party and the SS in 1932 . He returned to Germany in 1933 , where he joined the Sicherheitsdienst ( SD , Security Service ) ; there he was appointed head of the department responsible for Jewish affairs - especially emigration , which the Nazis encouraged through violence and economic pressure . After the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 , Eichmann and his staff arranged for Jews to be concentrated in ghettos in major cities with the expectation that they would be transported either farther east or overseas . He also drew up plans for a Jewish reservation , first at Nisko in southeast Poland and later in Madagascar , but neither of these plans were ever carried out . The Nazis began the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 , and their Jewish policy changed from emigration to extermination . To co-ordinate planning for the genocide , Heydrich , who was Eichmann 's superior , hosted the regime 's administrative leaders at the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942 . Eichmann collected information for him , attended the conference , and prepared the minutes . Eichmann and his staff became responsible for Jewish deportations to extermination camps , where the victims were gassed .",
  "/wiki/The_Holocaust": "The Holocaust , also known as the Shoah , [ b ] was the World War II genocide of the European Jews . Between 1941 and 1945 , across German-occupied Europe , Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically murdered some six million Jews , around two-thirds of Europe 's Jewish population . [ a ] [ c ] The murders were carried out in pogroms and mass shootings ; by a policy of extermination through work in concentration camps ; and in gas chambers and gas vans in German extermination camps , chiefly Auschwitz , Be\u0142\u017cec , Che\u0142mno , Majdanek , Sobib\u00f3r , and Treblinka in occupied Poland . Germany implemented the persecution in stages . Following Adolf Hitler 's appointment as Chancellor on 30 January 1933 , the regime built a network of concentration camps in Germany for political opponents and those deemed undesirable , starting with Dachau on 22 March 1933 . After the passing of the Enabling Act on 24 March , which gave Hitler plenary powers , the government began isolating Jews from civil society ; this included boycotting Jewish businesses in April 1933 and enacting the Nuremberg Laws in September 1935 . On 9-10 November 1938 , eight months after Germany annexed Austria , Jewish businesses and other buildings were ransacked , smashed or set on fire throughout Germany and Austria during what became known as Kristallnacht ( the Night of Broken Glass ) . After Germany invaded Poland in September 1939 , triggering World War II , the regime set up ghettos to segregate Jews from the rest of the population . Eventually thousands of camps and other detention sites were established across German-occupied Europe . The segregation of Jews in ghettos culminated in the policy of extermination the Nazis called the Final Solution to the Jewish Question , discussed by senior Nazi officials at the Wannsee Conference in Berlin in January 1942 . As German forces captured territories in the East , all anti-Jewish measures were radicalized . Under the coordination of the SS , with directions from the highest leadership of the Nazi Party , killings were committed within Germany itself , throughout occupied Europe , and within territories controlled by Germany 's allies .",

It has land borders with Lebanon to the north , Syria to the northeast , Jordan on the east , the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west , respectively , and Egypt to the southwest . The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area . Israel 's economic and technological center is Tel Aviv , while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem , although the state 's sovereignty over Jerusalem has only partial recognition . [ fn 4 ] Israel has evidence of the earliest migration of hominids out of Africa . Canaanite tribes are archaeologically attested since the Middle Bronze Age , while the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah emerged during the Iron Age . The Neo-Assyrian Empire destroyed Israel around 720 BCE . Judah was later conquered by the Babylonian , Persian and Hellenistic empires and had existed as Jewish autonomous provinces . The successful Maccabean Revolt led to an independent Hasmonean kingdom by 110 BCE , which in 63 BCE however became a client state of the Roman Republic that subsequently installed the Herodian dynasty in 37 BCE , and in 6 CE created the Roman province of Judea . Judea lasted as a Roman province until the failed Jewish revolts resulted in widespread destruction , the expulsion of the Jewish population and the renaming of the region from Iudaea to Syria Palaestina . Jewish presence in the region has persisted to a certain extent over the centuries . In the 7th century CE , the Levant was taken from the Byzantine Empire by the Arabs and remained in Muslim control until the First Crusade of 1099 , followed by the Ayyubid conquest of 1187 .",

The modern Israeli wine industry was founded by Baron Edmond James de Rothschild , owner of the Bordeaux estate Ch\u00e2teau Lafite-Rothschild . Today , Israeli winemaking takes place in five vine-growing regions : Galil ( Galilee , including the Golan Heights ) , the region most suited for viticulture due to its high elevation , cool breezes , marked day and night temperature changes and rich , well-drained soils ; the Judean Hills , surrounding the city of Jerusalem ; Shimshon ( Samson ) , located between the Judean Hills and the Coastal Plain ; the Negev , a semi-arid desert region , where drip irrigation has made grape growing possible ; and the Sharon plain near the Mediterranean coast and just south of Haifa , surrounding the towns of Zichron Ya'akov and Binyamina , which is the largest grape growing area in Israel . Several of these terms for Israeli wine-growing regions , such as the Judean Hills , the Golan Heights and the Shimshon , actually refer to areas that are largely Israeli-occupied territories .

  "/wiki/Execution_by_firing_squad": "Execution by firing squad , in the past sometimes called fusillading ( from the French fusil , rifle ) , is a method of capital punishment , particularly common in the military and in times of war . Execution by shooting is a fairly old practice . Some reasons for its use are that firearms are usually readily available and a gunshot to a vital organ , such as brain or heart , usually kills relatively quickly . A firing squad is normally composed of several military personnel . Usually , all members of the group are instructed to fire simultaneously , thus preventing both disruption of the process by a single member and identification of the member who fired the lethal shot . To avoid the disfigurement of multiple shots to the head , the shooters are typically instructed to aim at the heart , sometimes aided by a paper target . The prisoner is typically blindfolded or hooded , as well as restrained , although in some cases prisoners have asked to be allowed to face the firing squad without their eyes covered . Media portrayals have frequently shown condemned being offered a final cigarette as well . Executions can be carried out with the condemned either standing or sitting . There is a tradition in some jurisdictions that such executions are carried out at first light or at sunrise . This gave rise to the phrase shot at dawn . Execution by firing squad is distinct from other forms of execution by firearms , such as an execution by shooting to the back of the head or neck .",
  "/wiki/KFC": "KFC , also known as Kentucky Fried Chicken , is an American fast food restaurant chain headquartered in Louisville , Kentucky , that specializes in fried chicken .

Brands , a restaurant company that also owns the Pizza Hut , Taco Bell , and WingStreet chains . KFC was founded by Colonel Harland Sanders , an entrepreneur who began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in Corbin , Kentucky , during the Great Depression . Sanders identified the potential of the restaurant franchising concept , and the first Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise opened in Utah in 1952 . KFC popularized chicken in the fast food industry , diversifying the market by challenging the established dominance of the hamburger . By branding himself as Colonel Sanders , Harland became a prominent figure of American cultural history , and his image remains widely used in KFC advertising to this day . However , the company 's rapid expansion overwhelmed the aging Sanders , and he sold it to a group of investors led by John Y . Brown Jr. and Jack C. Massey in 1964 . KFC was one of the first American fast food chains to expand internationally , opening outlets in Canada , the United Kingdom , Mexico , and Jamaica by the mid-1960s . Throughout the 1970s and 1980s , it experienced mixed fortunes domestically , as it went through a series of changes in corporate ownership with little or no experience in the restaurant business .",

A leading member of the revolutionary Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party , and later , the Baghdad-based Ba'ath Party and its regional organization the Iraqi Ba'ath Party - which espoused Ba'athism , a mix of Arab nationalism and socialism - Saddam played a key role in the 1968 coup ( later referred to as the 17 July Revolution ) that brought the party to power in Iraq . As vice president under the ailing General Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr , and at a time when many groups were considered capable of overthrowing the government , Saddam created security forces through which he tightly controlled conflicts between the government and the armed forces . In the early 1970s , Saddam nationalized oil and foreign banks leaving the system eventually insolvent mostly due to the Iran-Iraq War , the Gulf War , and UN sanctions . Through the 1970s , Saddam cemented his authority over the apparatus of government as oil money helped Iraq 's economy to grow at a rapid pace . Positions of power in the country were mostly filled with Sunni Arabs , a minority that made up only a fifth of the population . Saddam formally rose to power in 1979 , although he had already been the de facto head of Iraq for several years . He suppressed several movements , particularly Shi ' a and Kurdish movements which sought to overthrow the government or gain independence , respectively , and maintained power during the Iran-Iraq War and the Gulf War . Whereas some in the Arab world lauded Saddam for opposing the United States and attacking Israel , he was widely condemned for the brutality of his dictatorship . The total number of Iraqis killed by the security services of Saddam 's government in various purges and genocides is conservatively estimated to be 250,000 . Saddam 's invasions of Iran and Kuwait also resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths . In 2003 , a coalition led by the United States invaded Iraq to depose Saddam , in which U.S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair erroneously accused him of possessing weapons of mass destruction and having ties to al-Qaeda .",
