  "/wiki/Charlie_Byrne_(baseball)": "Charles H. Byrne ( September 1843-January 4 , 1898 ) was a New York realtor who was one of the original founders of the team that became the Brooklyn Dodgers . Byrne was a graduate of St. Francis Xavier College , and after graduation he worked as a writer for a newspaper . Byrne , his brother-in-law Joseph Doyle , New York Herald editor George J. Taylor , and Rhode Island casino owner Ferdinand Abell formed a group that raised the money to found the Brooklyn ball club in 1883 , known originally as simply the Brooklyns . They leased land on Fifth Avenue in Brooklyn to build Washington Park , the team 's original home , which cost $ 30,000 . In its first year , the team played in the minor-league Inter-State Association of Professional Baseball Clubs , winning the league championship . Having attracted a following , the owners moved the franchise in 1884 to the American Association ( AA ) , a competitor to the more established National League ( NL ) , that catered to a more working-class crowd . After managing the team from 1885-1887 , Byrne saw the franchise join the National League in 1890 , and remained in the ownership group until his death in 1898 . Under his tenure , the team , known variously as the Brooklyns , Bridegrooms and Grooms , posted a record of 567-506 and won two league championships ( the AA in 1889 and the NL in 1890 ) . Byrne was in ill health at the time of the National League meeting in November 1897 , but he insisted on making the journey from Virginia , where he had been recovering , to the event in Philadelphia . After the meeting concluded , his health took a turn for the worse , from which he never recovered . Byrne was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Woodside , Queens , New York .",
