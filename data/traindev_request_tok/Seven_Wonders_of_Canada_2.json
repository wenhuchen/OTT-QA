With an estimated population of 5.1 million as of 2019 [ update ] , it is Canada 's third-most populous province . The first British settlement in the area was Fort Victoria , established in 1843 , which gave rise to the City of Victoria , at first the capital of the separate Colony of Vancouver Island . Subsequently , on the mainland , the Colony of British Columbia ( 1858-1866 ) was founded by Richard Clement Moody and the Royal Engineers , Columbia Detachment , in response to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush . Moody was Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for the Colony and the first Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia : he was hand-picked by the Colonial Office in London to transform British Columbia into the British Empire 's bulwark in the farthest west , and to found a second England on the shores of the Pacific . Moody selected the site for and founded the original capital of British Columbia , New Westminster , established the Cariboo Road and Stanley Park , and designed the first version of the Coat of arms of British Columbia . Port Moody is named after him . In 1866 , Vancouver Island became part of the colony of British Columbia , and Victoria became the united colony 's capital . In 1871 , British Columbia became the sixth province of Canada . Its Latin motto is Splendor sine occasu ( Splendour without Diminishment ) . The capital of British Columbia is Victoria , the fifteenth-largest metropolitan region in Canada , named for Queen Victoria , who ruled during the creation of the original colonies .

  "/wiki/Crooked_Trees": "The Crooked Trees , Crooked Bush , Twisted Trees or the Crooked Trees of Alticane are a grove of deformed trembling aspen trees of type Populus tremuloides Michx . found in Saskatchewan , Canada . They are found approximately twenty kilometers north-north-west of the town of Hafford , Saskatchewan and just over five kilometers south-west of Alticane . The trees , prominent in Saskatchewan folklore , are dramatically different from the un-twisted aspens just across the road . Explanations have been offered which include various paranormal factors . However , cuttings from these trees , propagated in Manitoba , exhibit the same pattern of twisted growth , suggesting that the cause is rooted in genetics , possibly the result of a mutation . The trees ' unusual appearance was noticed in the 1940s and has attracted the attention of tourists for decades , but more so since the proliferation of websites and blogs that mention them . A wooden walkway was constructed through the grove to keep visitors from trampling any new growth . Because the deformity is likely genetic and aspens propagate by root suckers , it is likely that all the crooked trees in the grove are clones that originated from a single mutated tree . The grove is currently bounded on all sides by the grid road and a perimeter access road , so the size of the grove is static and is unlikely to continue spreading . The grove can be seen in the Disney true life adventure/fantasy film Perri ( 1957 ) . [ citation needed ]",
