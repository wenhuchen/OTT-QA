  "/wiki/2002\u20132003_Tamil_Nadu_Legislative_Assembly_by-election": "By-elections to Andipatti constituency was held in Tamil Nadu , India , on February 21 , 2002 . Three state assembly constituencies , Saidapet , Vaniyambadi , and Acharapakkam were held on May 31 , 2002 . In 2003 , by-election in Sathankulam was held on February 26 , 2003 . During this by-election , the DMK and all the other major parties supported the Congress candidate , while only BJP supported the AIADMK candidate . This election came after the support of the Anti-conversion bill by AIADMK chief , Jayalalithaa and increasing tension between DMK and BJP due to the passage of the bill . The AIADMK win in Sathankulam was significant , since it completes the AIADMK sweep in by-elections after its victory in 2001 . Also the anti-conversion bill was not an important factor in the congress-bastion Sathankulam , whose electorate consists of a large percentage of minorities . Despite attempts by the opposition to delay the Andipatti by-election , due to alleged voter list irregularities , the Election Commission of India decided to have the vacant seat in Andipatti , early in February and push off the other three vacant seats , in May . Andipatti seat was made vacant by the resignation of Thanga Tamil Selvan to facilitate the election of J. Jayalalithaa , who had her corruption charges cleared in late December in 2001 . She could be sworn in as Chief Minister only as MLA seat . As AIADMK had won 132 seats in 2001 State assembly election , even with the breakup of its previous alliance with Tamil Maanila Congress ( TMC ) , Indian National Congress ( INC ) , Communist Party of India ( CPI ) , Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) ( CPM ) and Pattali Makkal Katchi ( PMK ) , it would have still continued to stay in power , regardless of the results in the by-election . But since Jayalalithaa was legally not allowed to run for an MLA seat in 2001 , she made the decision to run for an MLA seat before swearing in as Chief Minister .",
