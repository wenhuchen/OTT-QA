The administrative counties of Aberdeenshire , the City of Aberdeen , Banffshire , Kincardineshire and most of Morayshire were merged to form Grampian Region , with the area of county being divided between the districts of City of Aberdeen , Banff and Buchan , Gordon and Kincardine and Deeside for administration . In 1996 Scottish local government system was reorganised a second time to form a single tier of unitary council areas .

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories .

It nearly became extinct by a combination of commercial hunting and slaughter in the 19th century and introduction of bovine diseases from domestic cattle . With a population in excess of 60 million in the late 18th century , the species was down to 541 animals by 1889 . Recovery efforts expanded in the mid-20th century , with a resurgence to roughly 31,000 animals today , largely restricted to a few national parks and reserves . Two subspecies or ecotypes have been described : the plains bison ( B. b. bison ) , smaller in size and with a more rounded hump , and the wood bison ( B. b. athabascae ) - the larger of the two and having a taller , square hump . Furthermore , the plains bison has been suggested to consist of a northern plains ( B. b. montanae ) and a southern plains ( B. b. bison ) subspecies , bringing the total to three . However , this is generally not supported . The wood bison is one of the largest wild species of bovid in the world , surpassed by only the Asian gaur and wild yak .
