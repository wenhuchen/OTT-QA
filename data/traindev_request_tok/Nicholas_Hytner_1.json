  "/wiki/The_Turn_of_the_Screw_(opera)": "The Turn of the Screw is a 20th-century English chamber opera composed by Benjamin Britten with a libretto by Myfanwy Piper , wife of the artist John Piper , who had been a friend of the composer since 1935 and had provided designs for several of the operas . The libretto is based on the novella The Turn of the Screw by Henry James . The opera was commissioned by the Venice Biennale and given its world premiere on 14 September 1954 , at the Teatro La Fenice , Venice . The original recording was made during that year , with the composer conducting . Described as one of the most dramatically appealing English operas , the opera in two acts has a prologue and sixteen scenes , each preceded by a variation on the twelve-note 'Screw ' theme . Typically of Britten , the music mixes tonality and dissonance , with Britten 's recurrent use of a twelve-tone figure being perhaps a nod to the approach of Arnold Schoenberg . Thematically , the play gives a central role to a line borrowed from W. B. Yeats ' poem The Second Coming : The ceremony of innocence is drowned .",

Born in Salzburg , Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood . Already competent on keyboard and violin , he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty . At 17 , Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position . While visiting Vienna in 1781 , he was dismissed from his Salzburg position . He chose to stay in the capital , where he achieved fame but little financial security . During his final years in Vienna , he composed many of his best-known symphonies , concertos , and operas , and portions of the Requiem , which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35 . The circumstances of his death have been much mythologized . He composed more than 600 works , many of which are acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic , concertante , chamber , operatic , and choral music . He is among the greatest and most enduringly popular of classical composers , and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music . Ludwig van Beethoven composed his early works in the shadow of Mozart , and Joseph Haydn wrote : posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years .",

The festival began in 1951 under Tom Walsh and a group of opera lovers who quickly generated considerable interest by programming unusual and rare works , a typical festival staging three operas . This concept has been maintained over the company 's history under the direction of seven different artistic directors . From the beginning , the company embraced new and upcoming young singers , many of whom were Irish , but it also included new international names who made first appearances there . By the 1960s Czech and Russian operas entered the repertory , while the 1970s saw an interest in the operas of Jules Massenet under director Thomson Smillie , followed by an emphasis on Italian operas from the end of that decade . However , into the mix there appeared more modern operas by Benjamin Britten and Carlisle Floyd while Elaine Padmore 's 12-year tenure resulted in more international singers making first appearances and the beginnings of commercial recordings and radio broadcasts . David Agler , the artistic director since 2005 , oversaw the creation of a new opera house with enhanced facilities on the site of the original theatre .",

  "/wiki/Michael_Tippett": "Sir Michael Kemp Tippett OM CH CBE ( 2 January 1905 - 8 January 1998 ) was an English composer who rose to prominence during and immediately after the Second World War . In his lifetime he was sometimes ranked with his contemporary Benjamin Britten as one of the leading British composers of the 20th century . Among his best-known works are the oratorio A Child of Our Time , the orchestral Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli , and the opera The Midsummer Marriage . Tippett 's talent developed slowly . He withdrew or destroyed his earliest compositions , and was 30 before any of his works were published . Until the mid-to-late 1950s his music was broadly lyrical in character , before changing to a more astringent and experimental style . New influences , including those of jazz and blues after his first visit to America in 1965 , became increasingly evident in his compositions . While Tippett 's stature with the public continued to grow , not all critics approved of these changes in style , some believing that the quality of his work suffered as a consequence . From around 1976 Tippett 's late works began to reflect the works of his youth through a return to lyricism . Although he was much honoured in his lifetime , critical judgement on Tippett 's legacy has been uneven , the greatest praise being generally reserved for his earlier works . His centenary in 2005 was a muted affair ; apart from the few best-known works , his music has been performed infrequently in the 21st century . Having briefly embraced communism in the 1930s , Tippett avoided identifying with any political party .",

It is one of the two principal opera companies in London , along with The Royal Opera , Covent Garden . ENO 's productions are sung in English . The company 's origins were in the late 19th century , when the philanthropist Emma Cons , later assisted by her niece Lilian Baylis , presented theatrical and operatic performances at the Old Vic , for the benefit of local people . Baylis subsequently built up both the opera and the theatre companies , and later added a ballet company ; these evolved into ENO , the Royal National Theatre and The Royal Ballet , respectively . Baylis acquired and rebuilt the Sadler 's Wells theatre in north London , a larger house , better suited to opera than the Old Vic . The opera company grew there into a permanent ensemble in the 1930s . During the Second World War , the theatre was closed and the company toured British towns and cities . After the war , the company returned to its home , but it continued to expand and improve . By the 1960s , a larger theatre was needed . In 1968 , the company moved to the London Coliseum and adopted its present name in 1974 .

  "/wiki/Rienzi": "Rienzi , der letzte der Tribunen ( Rienzi , the last of the tribunes ; WWV 49 ) is an early opera by Richard Wagner in five acts , with the libretto written by the composer after Edward Bulwer-Lytton 's novel of the same name ( 1835 ) .

Magnanimous at first , he is forced by events to crush the nobles ' rebellion against the people 's power , but popular opinion changes and even the Church , which had urged him to assert himself , turns against him .

Unlike most opera composers , Wagner wrote both the libretto and the music for each of his stage works . Initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works in the romantic vein of Carl Maria von Weber and Giacomo Meyerbeer , Wagner revolutionised opera through his concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk ( total work of art ) , by which he sought to synthesise the poetic , visual , musical and dramatic arts , with music subsidiary to drama . He described this vision in a series of essays published between 1849 and 1852 . Wagner realised these ideas most fully in the first half of the four-opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen ( The Ring of the Nibelung ) . His compositions , particularly those of his later period , are notable for their complex textures , rich harmonies and orchestration , and the elaborate use of leitmotifs - musical phrases associated with individual characters , places , ideas , or plot elements . His advances in musical language , such as extreme chromaticism and quickly shifting tonal centres , greatly influenced the development of classical music . His Tristan und Isolde is sometimes described as marking the start of modern music . Wagner had his own opera house built , the Bayreuth Festspielhaus , which embodied many novel design features . The Ring and Parsifal were premiered here and his most important stage works continue to be performed at the annual Bayreuth Festival , run by his descendants . His thoughts on the relative contributions of music and drama in opera were to change again , and he reintroduced some traditional forms into his last few stage works , including Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg ( The Mastersingers of Nuremberg ) . Until his final years , Wagner 's life was characterised by political exile , turbulent love affairs , poverty and repeated flight from his creditors .",

Handel received important training in Halle and worked as a composer in Hamburg and Italy before settling in London in 1712 ; he became a naturalised British subject in 1727 . He was strongly influenced both by the great composers of the Italian Baroque and by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition . Within fifteen years , Handel had started three commercial opera companies to supply the English nobility with Italian opera . Musicologist Winton Dean writes that his operas show that Handel was not only a great composer ; he was a dramatic genius of the first order . As Alexander 's Feast ( 1736 ) was well received , Handel made a transition to English choral works . After his success with Messiah ( 1742 ) he never composed an Italian opera again . Almost blind , and having lived in England for nearly fifty years , he died in 1759 , a respected and rich man . His funeral was given full state honours , and he was buried in Westminster Abbey in London .

The chorus Va , pensiero from his early opera Nabucco ( 1842 ) , and similar choruses in later operas , were much in the spirit of the unification movement , and the composer himself became esteemed as a representative of these ideals . An intensely private person , Verdi , however , did not seek to ingratiate himself with popular movements and as he became professionally successful was able to reduce his operatic workload and sought to establish himself as a landowner in his native region .

  "/wiki/The_Cunning_Little_Vixen": "The Cunning Little Vixen ( Czech : P\u0159\u00edhody li\u0161ky Bystrou\u0161ky ; alternative English title : Tales of Vixen Sharp-Ears ) is a Czech-language opera by Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek , composed in 1921 to 1923 . Its libretto was adapted by the composer from a 1920 serialized novella , Li\u0161ka Bystrou\u0161ka , by Rudolf T\u011bsnohl\u00eddek , which was first published in the newspaper Lidov\u00e9 noviny ( with illustrations by Stanislav Lolek ) . The opera incorporates Moravian folk music and rhythms as it recounts the life of a clever ( alternative reading : sharp-eared ) fox and accompanying wildlife , as well as a few humans , and their small adventures while traversing their lifecycles . Described as a comic opera , it has nonetheless been noted to contain a serious theme . Interpretations of the work remain varied , ranging from children 's entertainment to a tragedy .",
  "/wiki/Leo\u0161_Jan\u00e1\u010dek": "Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek ( Czech pronunciation : [ \u02c8l\u025bo\u0283 \u02c8jana\u02d0t\u0283\u025bk ] ( listen ) , baptised Leo Eugen Jan\u00e1\u010dek ; 3 July 1854 - 12 August 1928 ) was a Czech composer , musical theorist , folklorist , publicist and teacher . He was inspired by Moravian and other Slavic folk music to create an original , modern musical style . Until 1895 he devoted himself mainly to folkloristic research . While his early musical output was influenced by contemporaries such as Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k , his later , mature works incorporate his earlier studies of national folk music in a modern , highly original synthesis , first evident in the opera Jen\u016ffa , which was premiered in 1904 in Brno . The success of Jen\u016ffa ( often called the Moravian national opera ) at Prague in 1916 gave Jan\u00e1\u010dek access to the world 's great opera stages . Jan\u00e1\u010dek 's later works are his most celebrated . They include operas such as K\u00e1\u0165a Kabanov\u00e1 and The Cunning Little Vixen , the Sinfonietta , the Glagolitic Mass , the rhapsody Taras Bulba , two string quartets , and other chamber works . Along with Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and Bed\u0159ich Smetana , he is considered one of the most important Czech composers .",

The libretto was written by Lorenzo Da Ponte who also wrote Le nozze di Figaro and Don Giovanni . Although it is commonly held that Cos\u00ec fan tutte was written and composed at the suggestion of the Emperor Joseph II , recent research does not support this idea . There is evidence that Mozart 's contemporary Antonio Salieri tried to set the libretto but left it unfinished . In 1994 , John Rice uncovered two terzetti by Salieri in the Austrian National Library . The short title , Cos\u00ec fan tutte , literally means So do they all , using the feminine plural ( tutte ) to indicate women . It is usually translated into English as Women are like that . The words are sung by the three men in act 2 , scene 3 , just before the finale ; this melodic phrase is also quoted in the overture to the opera . Da Ponte had used the line Cos\u00ec fan tutte le belle earlier in Le nozze di Figaro ( in act 1 , scene 7 ) .",
  "/wiki/Don_Carlos": "Don Carlos is a five-act grand opera composed by Giuseppe Verdi to a French-language libretto by Joseph M\u00e9ry and Camille du Locle , based on the dramatic play Don Carlos , Infant von Spanien ( Don Carlos , Infante of Spain ) by Friedrich Schiller . In addition , it has been noted by David Kimball that the Fontainebleau scene and auto-da-f\u00e9 were the most substantial of several incidents borrowed from a contemporary play on Philip II by Eug\u00e8ne Cormon . The opera is most often performed in Italian translation , usually under the title Don Carlo . The opera 's story is based on conflicts in the life of Carlos , Prince of Asturias ( 1545-1568 ) . Though he was betrothed to Elisabeth of Valois , part of the peace treaty ending the Italian War of 1551-59 between the Houses of Habsburg and Valois demanded that she be married instead to his father Philip II of Spain . It was commissioned and produced by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Imp\u00e9rial de l'Op\u00e9ra ( Paris Opera ) and given its premiere at the Salle Le Peletier on 11 March 1867 . The first performance in Italian was given at Covent Garden in London in June 1867 . The first Italian version given in Italy was in Bologna in October 1867 . Revised again by Verdi , it was given in Naples in November/December 1872 . Finally , two other versions were prepared : the first was seen in Milan in January 1884 ( in which the four acts were based on some original French text which was then translated ) . That is now known as the Milan version , while the second - also sanctioned by the composer - became the Modena version and was presented in that city in December 1886 . It restored the Fontainebleau first act to the Milan four-act version .",
