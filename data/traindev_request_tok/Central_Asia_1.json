On 4 September 1860 , with the approval of the Kyrgyz , Russian forces led by Colonel Apollon Zimmermann destroyed the fortress . In 1868 a Russian settlement was established on the site of the fortress under its original name , Pishpek . It lay within the General Governorship of Russian Turkestan and its Semirechye Oblast . In 1925 the Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast was established in Russian Turkestan , promoting Pishpek to its capital . In 1926 the Communist Party of the Soviet Union renamed the city as Frunze , after the Bolshevik military leader Mikhail Frunze ( 1885-1925 ) , who was born there .

It is closely related to neighboring Dari Persian with which it forms a continuum of mutually intelligible varieties . Since the beginning of the twentieth century and independence of Tajikistan from Soviet Union , Tajik has been considered by a number of writers and researchers to be a variety of Persian . [ clarification needed ] The popularity of this conception of Tajik as a variety of Persian was such that , during the period in which Tajik intellectuals were trying to establish Tajik as a language separate from Persian language , Sadriddin Ayni , who was a prominent intellectual and educator , made a statement that Tajik was not a bastardized dialect of Persian . The issue of whether Tajik and Persian are to be considered two dialects of a single language or two discrete languages has political sides to it ( see Perry 1996 ) . By way of Early New Persian , Tajiki Persian , like Iranian Persian and Dari Persian , is a continuation of Middle Persian , the official religious and literary language of the Sasanian Empire ( 224-651 CE ) , itself a continuation of Old Persian , the language of the Achaemenids ( 550-330 BC ) . Tajik is the official language of Tajikistan . In Afghanistan ( where the Tajik people minority forms the principal part of the wider Persophone population ) , this language is less influenced by Turkic languages , is regarded as a form of Dari and as such has co-official language status . The Tajik of Tajikistan has diverged from Persian as spoken in Afghanistan and Iran due to political borders , geographical isolation , the standardization process and the influence of Russian and neighboring Turkic languages . The standard language is based on the northwestern dialects of Tajik ( region of old major city of Samarqand ) , which have been somewhat influenced by the neighboring Uzbek language as a result of geographical proximity . Tajik also retains numerous archaic elements in its vocabulary , pronunciation and grammar that have been lost elsewhere in the Persophone world , in part due to its relative isolation in the mountains of Central Asia .",

It is a pluricentric language predominantly spoken and used officially within Iran , Afghanistan and Tajikistan in three mutually intelligible standard varieties , namely Iranian Persian , Dari Persian ( officially named Dari since 1958 ) and Tajiki Persian ( officially named Tajik since the Soviet era ) . It is also spoken natively in the Tajik variety by a significant population within Uzbekistan , as well as within other regions with a Persianate history in the cultural sphere of Greater Iran . It is written officially within Iran and Afghanistan in the Persian alphabet , a derivation of the Arabic script , and within Tajikistan in the Tajik alphabet , a derivation of Cyrillic . The Persian language is a continuation of Middle Persian , the official religious and literary language of the Sasanian Empire ( 224-651 CE ) , itself a continuation of Old Persian , which was used in the Achaemenid Empire ( 550-330 BC ) . It originated in the region of Fars ( Persia ) in southwestern Iran . Its grammar is similar to that of many European languages . Throughout history , Persian has been a prestigious cultural language used by various empires in Western Asia , Central Asia , and South Asia . Old Persian written works are attested in Old Persian cuneiform on several inscriptions from between the 6th and the 4th centuries BC , and Middle Persian literature is attested in Aramaic-derived scripts ( Pahlavi and Manichaean ) on inscriptions from the time of the Parthian Empire and in books centered in Zoroastrian and Manichaean scriptures from between the 3rd to the 10th century AD . New Persian literature began to flourish after the Arab conquest of Iran with its earliest records from the 9th century , since then adopting the Arabic script . Persian was the first language to break through the monopoly of Arabic on writing in the Muslim world , with the writing of Persian poetry developed as a court tradition in many eastern courts . Some of the famous works of medieval Persian literature are the Shahnameh of Ferdowsi , the works of Rumi , the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam , the Panj Ganj of Nizami Ganjavi , the Div\u0101n of Hafez , The Conference of the Birds by Attar of Nishapur , and the miscellanea of Gulistan and Bustan by Saadi Shirazi .",
  "/wiki/Marketplace": "A market , or marketplace , is a location where people regularly gather for the purchase and sale of provisions , livestock , and other goods . In different parts of the world , a market place may be described as a souk ( from the Arabic ) , bazaar ( from the Persian ) , a fixed mercado ( Spanish ) , or itinerant tianguis ( Mexico ) , or palengke ( Philippines ) . Some markets operate daily and are said to be permanent markets while others are held once a week or on less frequent specified days such as festival days and are said to be periodic markets . The form that a market adopts depends on its locality 's population , culture , ambient and geographic conditions . The term market covers many types of trading , as market squares , market halls and food halls , and their different varieties . Due to this , marketplaces can be situated both outdoors and indoors . Markets have existed for as long as humans have engaged in trade . The earliest bazaars are believed to have originated in Persia , from where they spread to the rest of the Middle East and Europe . Documentary sources suggest that zoning policies confined trading to particular parts of cities from around 3,000 BCE , creating the conditions necessary for the emergence of a bazaar . Middle Eastern bazaars were typically long strips with stalls on either side and a covered roof designed to protect traders and purchasers from the fierce sun . In Europe , informal , unregulated markets gradually made way for a system of formal , chartered markets from the 12th century . Throughout the Medieval period , increased regulation of marketplace practices , especially weights and measures , gave consumers confidence in the quality of market goods and the fairness of prices .",

  "/wiki/Silk_Road": "The Silk Road was a network of trade routes which connected the East and West , and was central to the economic , cultural , political , and religious interactions between these regions from the 2nd century BCE to the 18th century . The Silk Road primarily refers to the land routes connecting East Asia and Southeast Asia with South Asia , Persia , the Arabian Peninsula , East Africa and Southern Europe . The Silk Road derives its name from the lucrative trade in silk carried out along its length , beginning in the Han dynasty in China ( 207 BCE-220 CE ) . The Han dynasty expanded the Central Asian section of the trade routes around 114 BCE through the missions and explorations of the Chinese imperial envoy Zhang Qian , as well as several military conquests . The Chinese took great interest in the security of their trade products , and extended the Great Wall of China to ensure the protection of the trade route . The Silk Road trade played a significant role in the development of the civilizations of China , Korea , Japan , the Indian subcontinent , Iran , Europe , the Horn of Africa and Arabia , opening long-distance political and economic relations between the civilizations . Though silk was the major trade item exported from China , many other goods and ideas were exchanged , including religions ( especially Buddhism ) , syncretic philosophies , sciences , and technologies like paper and gunpowder . So in addition to economic trade , the Silk Road was a route for cultural trade among the civilizations along its network . Diseases , most notably plague , also spread along the Silk Road . In June 2014 , UNESCO designated the Chang'an-Tianshan corridor of the Silk Road as a World Heritage Site . The Indian portion is on the tentative site list .",
