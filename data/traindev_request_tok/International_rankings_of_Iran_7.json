  "/wiki/United_Nations": "The United Nations ( UN ) is an intergovernmental organization that aims to maintain international peace and security , develop friendly relations among nations , achieve international cooperation , and be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations . It is the largest , most familiar , most internationally represented and most powerful intergovernmental organization in the world . The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City ; other main offices are in Geneva , Nairobi , Vienna and The Hague . The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars , succeeding the ineffective League of Nations . On 25 April 1945 , 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter , which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945 , when the UN began operations . Pursuant to the Charter , the organization 's objectives include maintaining international peace and security , protecting human rights , delivering humanitarian aid , promoting sustainable development , and upholding international law . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; this number grew to 193 in 2011 , representing the vast majority of the world 's sovereign states . The organization 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies . Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring , reporting and confidence-building roles . UN membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s . Since then , 80 former colonies have gained independence , including 11 trust territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council . By the 1970s , the UN 's budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping .",

  "/wiki/856_Damghan_earthquake": "The 856 Damghan earthquake or the 856 Qumis earthquake occurred on 22 December 856 ( 242 AH ) . The earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 7.9 , and a maximum intensity of X ( Extreme ) on the Mercalli intensity scale . The meizoseismal area ( area of maximum damage ) extended for about 350 kilometres ( 220 mi ) along the southern edge of the eastern Alborz mountains of present-day Iran including parts of Tabaristan and Gorgan . The earthquake 's epicenter is estimated to be close to the city of Damghan , which was then the capital of the Persian province of Qumis . It caused approximately 200,000 deaths and is listed by the USGS as the sixth deadliest earthquake in recorded history .",
  "/wiki/Earthquake": "An earthquake ( also known as a quake , tremor or temblor ) is the shaking of the surface of the Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the Earth 's lithosphere that creates seismic waves . Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they can not be felt to those violent enough to propel objects ( and people ) into the air , and wreak destruction across entire cities . The seismicity , or seismic activity , of an area is the frequency , type , and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time . The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling . At the Earth 's surface , earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the ground . When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore , the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami . Earthquakes can also trigger landslides and occasionally , volcanic activity . In its most general sense , the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event - whether natural or caused by humans - that generates seismic waves . Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological faults but also by other events such as volcanic activity , landslides , mine blasts , and nuclear tests . An earthquake 's point of initial rupture is called its focus or hypocenter . The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter .",
  "/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time": "Greenwich Mean Time ( GMT ) is the mean solar time at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich , London , reckoned from midnight . At different times in the past , it has been calculated in different ways , including being calculated from noon ; as a consequence , it can not be used to specify a precise time unless a context is given . English speakers often use GMT as a synonym for Coordinated Universal Time ( UTC ) . For navigation , it is considered equivalent to UT1 ( the modern form of mean solar time at 0\u00b0 longitude ) ; but this meaning can differ from UTC by up to 0.9 s. The term GMT should not thus be used for certain technical purposes requiring precision . Because of Earth 's uneven angular velocity in its elliptical orbit and its axial tilt , noon ( 12:00:00 ) GMT is rarely the exact moment the Sun crosses the Greenwich meridian and reaches its highest point in the sky there . This event may occur up to 16 minutes before or after noon GMT , a discrepancy calculated by the equation of time . Noon GMT is the annual average ( i.e . mean ) moment of this event , which accounts for the word mean in Greenwich Mean Time . Originally , astronomers considered a GMT day to start at noon , while for almost everyone else it started at midnight . To avoid confusion , the name Universal Time was introduced to denote GMT as counted from midnight . Astronomers preferred the old convention to simplify their observational data , so that each night was logged under a single calendar date . Today , Universal Time usually refers to UTC or UT1 .",

Typically , these individuals are defined as holding financial assets ( excluding their primary residence ) with a value greater than US $ 1 million . Very-HNWI ( VHNWI ) can refer to someone with a net worth of at least US $ 5 million . The Capgemini and Merrill Lynch World Wealth Report 2006 defines an additional class of ultra-high-net-worth individuals ( UHNWIs ) , those with US $ 30 million in liquid financial assets or with a disposable income of more than US $ 20 million . At the end of 2018 , there were estimated to be just over 14 million HNWIs in the world .

  "/wiki/Net_worth": "Net worth is the value of all the non-financial and financial assets owned by an institutional unit or sector minus the value of all its outstanding liabilities . Since financial assets minus outstanding liabilities equal net financial assets , net worth can also be conveniently expressed as non-financial assets plus net financial assets . Net worth can apply to companies , individuals , governments or economic sectors such as the sector of financial corporations or to entire countries .",
  "/wiki/Social_class_in_Iran": "Social classes in Iran have been divided up into upper class , propertied middle class , salaried middle class , working class , independent farmers , and rural wage earners . A more recent source divides Iranian classes into upper , middle class ( about 32% of the population in 2000 ) , working class ( about 45% of the labor force ) , and lower class . Former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad says 60 percent of his country 's wealth is controlled by just 300 people in Iran . The gini coefficient was 0.38 in 2010 and the Human Development Index at 0.749 in 2013 . One of the main objectives of the Iranian revolution was to have no social classes . [ citation needed ] In the post-revolutionary era , access to political power , an important basis for measuring influence and elite status in pre-revolutionary Iran , has continued to be important for ascribing status , even though the composition of the political elite has changed . For 10 years after 1979 , gaining entry to the political elite at the national or provincial level depended on having revolutionary credentials , that is , being able to provide evidence of having participated in the demonstrations and other revolutionary activities during 1978-79 , and having a reputation for being a good Muslim , that is , attending public prayers and observing Islamic codes of conduct in ones private life . Revolutionary credentials became less significant for the generation that matured after the early 1990s . Education , especially a college degree , became an informal substitute for revolutionary credentials .",

  "/wiki/MSv": "The sievert ( symbol : Sv [ note 1 ] ) is a derived unit of ionizing radiation dose in the International System of Units ( SI ) and is a measure of the health effect of low levels of ionizing radiation on the human body . The sievert is important in dosimetry and radiation protection , and is named after Rolf Maximilian Sievert , a Swedish medical physicist renowned for work on radiation dose measurement and research into the biological effects of radiation . The sievert is used for radiation dose quantities such as equivalent dose and effective dose , which represent the risk of external radiation from sources outside the body , and committed dose which represents the risk of internal irradiation due to inhaled or ingested radioactive substances . The sievert is intended to represent the stochastic health risk , which for radiation dose assessment is defined as the probability of radiation-induced cancer and genetic damage . One sievert carries with it a 5.5% chance of eventually developing cancer based on the linear no-threshold model . To enable consideration of stochastic health risk , calculations are performed to convert the physical quantity absorbed dose into equivalent dose and effective dose , the details of which depend on the radiation type and biological context . For applications in radiation protection and dosimetry assessment the International Commission on Radiological Protection ( ICRP ) and International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements ( ICRU ) have published recommendations and data which are used to calculate these . These are under continual review , and changes are advised in the formal Reports of those bodies . Conventionally , the sievert is not used for high dose rates of radiation that produce deterministic effects , which is the severity of acute tissue damage that is certain to happen , such as acute radiation syndrome ; these effects are compared to the physical quantity absorbed dose measured by the unit gray ( Gy ) . One sievert equals 100 rem . The rem is an older , non-SI unit of measurement .",
  "/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome": "Acute radiation syndrome ( ARS ) , also known as radiation sickness or radiation poisoning , is a collection of health effects due to exposure to high amounts of ionizing radiation over a short period of time . Symptoms can begin within an hour and may last for several months . Symptoms within the first few days typically include nausea , vomiting , and loss of appetite . This is followed by a few hours or weeks with little symptoms which later develops into additional symptoms followed by either recovery or death . Acute radiation syndrome involves a total dose of greater than 0.7 Gy ( 70 rads ) , that generally occurs from a source outside the body within minutes . Sources of such radiation can occur accidentally or intentionally . They may involve nuclear reactors , cyclotrons , and certain devices used in cancer therapy . It is generally divided into three types ; bone marrow , gastrointestinal , and neurovascular syndrome , with bone marrow syndrome occurring at 0.7 to 10 Gy , and neurovascular syndrome occurring at doses that exceed 50 Gy . The cells that are most affected are generally those that are rapidly dividing . At high doses , this causes DNA damage that may be irreparable . Diagnosis is based on a history of exposure and symptoms . Repeated complete blood counts ( CBCs ) can indicate the severity of exposure .",
  "/wiki/Ionizing_radiation": "Ionizing radiation ( ionising radiation ) is radiation , traveling as a particle or electromagnetic wave , that carries sufficient energy to detach electrons from atoms or molecules , thereby ionizing them . Ionizing radiation is made up of energetic subatomic particles , ions or atoms moving at high speeds ( usually greater than 1% of the speed of light ) , and electromagnetic waves on the high-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum . [ citation needed ] Gamma rays , X-rays , and the higher ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum are ionizing , whereas the lower ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum and all the spectrum below UV , including visible light ( including nearly all types of laser light ) , infrared , microwaves , and radio waves are considered non-ionizing radiation . The boundary between ionizing and non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation that occurs in the ultraviolet is not sharply defined , since different molecules and atoms ionize at different energies . Conventional definition places the boundary at a photon energy between 10 eV and 33 eV in the ultraviolet ( see definition boundary section below ) . Typical ionizing subatomic particles found in radioactive decay include alpha particles , beta particles and neutrons . Almost all products of radioactive decay are ionizing because the energy of radioactive decay is typically far higher than that required to ionize . Other subatomic ionizing particles which occur naturally are muons , mesons , positrons , and other particles that constitute the secondary cosmic particles that are produced after primary cosmic rays interact with Earth 's atmosphere . Cosmic rays are generated by stars and certain celestial events such as supernova explosions . Cosmic rays may also produce radioisotopes on Earth ( for example , carbon-14 ) , which in turn decay and produce ionizing radiation . Cosmic rays and the decay of radioactive isotopes are the primary sources of natural ionizing radiation on Earth referred to as background radiation . Ionizing radiation can also be generated artificially by X-ray tubes , particle accelerators , and any of the various methods that produce radioisotopes artificially .",

  "/wiki/Human_development_index": "The Human Development Index ( HDI ) is a statistic composite index of life expectancy , education , and per capita income indicators , which are used to rank countries into four tiers of human development . A country scores a higher HDI when the lifespan is higher , the education level is higher , and the gross national income GNI ( PPP ) per capita is higher . It was developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq and Indian Economist Amartya Sen and was further used to measure a country 's development by the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) 's Human Development Report Office . The 2010 Human Development Report introduced an Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index ( IHDI ) . While the simple HDI remains useful , it stated that the IHDI is the actual level of human development ( accounting for inequality ) , and the HDI can be viewed as an index of 'potential ' human development ( or the maximum IHDI that could be achieved if there were no inequality ) . The index does not take into account several factors , such as the net wealth per capita or the relative quality of goods in a country . This situation tends to lower the ranking for some of the most advanced countries , such as the G7 members and others . The index is based on the human development approach , developed by ul Haq , often framed in terms of whether people are able to be and do desirable things in life . Examples include - Being : well fed , sheltered , healthy ; Doing : work , education , voting , participating in community life . The freedom of choice is central - someone choosing to be hungry ( as during a religious fast ) is quite different from someone who is hungry because they can not afford to buy food , or because the country is in a famine .",

Both indices were developed by Yale University ( Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy ) and Columbia University ( Center for International Earth Science Information Network ) in collaboration with the World Economic Forum and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission . The ESI was developed to evaluate environmental sustainability relative to the paths of other countries . Due to a shift in focus by the teams developing the ESI , the EPI uses outcome-oriented indicators , then working as a benchmark index that can be more easily used by policy makers , environmental scientists , advocates and the general public . Other leading indices like the Global Green Economy Index ( GGEI ) provide an integrated measure of the environmental , social and economic dynamics of national economies . The GGEI utilizes EPI data for the environmental dimension of the index while also providing a performance assessment of efficiency sectors ( e.g . transport , buildings , energy ) , investment , green innovation and national leadership around climate change . In January 2012 four EPI reports have been released - the Pilot 2006 Environmental Performance Index , and the 2008 , 2010 , and 2012 Environmental Performance Index . For the 2012 report , a new Pilot Trend EPI was developed to rank countries based on the environmental performance changes occurred during the last decade , allowing to establish which countries are improving and which are declining . In the 2014 EPI ranking , the top five countries were Switzerland , Luxembourg , Australia , Singapore , and the Czech Republic .",

  "/wiki/Tea": "Tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis , an evergreen shrub ( bush ) native to East Asia . After water , it is the most widely consumed drink in the world . There are many different types of tea ; some , like Darjeeling and Chinese greens , have a cooling , slightly bitter , and astringent flavour , while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet , nutty , floral or grassy notes . Tea has a stimulating effect in humans primarily due to its caffeine content . Tea originated in Southwest China during the Shang dynasty , where it was used as a medicinal drink . An early credible record of tea drinking dates to the 3rd century AD , in a medical text written by Hua Tuo . It was popularised as a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang dynasty , and tea drinking spread to other East Asian countries . Portuguese priests and merchants introduced it to Europe during the 16th century . During the 17th century , drinking tea became fashionable among Britons , who started large-scale production and commercialisation of the plant in India . Combined , China and India supplied 62% of the world 's tea in 2016 . The term herbal tea refers to drinks not made from Camellia sinensis : infusions of fruit , leaves , or other parts of the plant , such as steeps of rosehip , chamomile , or rooibos . These are sometimes called tisanes or herbal infusions to prevent confusion with tea made from the tea plant .",

  "/wiki/Coffee": "Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans , the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species . The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa ( specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan ) and Madagascar , the Comoros , Mauritius , and R\u00e9union in the Indian Ocean . Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries , primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas , Southeast Asia , Indian subcontinent , and Africa . The two most commonly grown are C. arabica and C. robusta . Once ripe , coffee berries are picked , processed , and dried . Dried coffee seeds ( referred to as beans ) are roasted to varying degrees , depending on the desired flavor . Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee . Coffee is darkly colored , bitter , slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans , primarily due to its caffeine content . It is one of the most popular drinks in the world , and it can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways ( e.g. , espresso , French press , caff\u00e8 latte ) . It is usually served hot , although iced coffee is a popular alternative . Clinical studies indicate that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial in healthy adults , with continuing research on whether long-term consumption reduces the risk of some diseases , although those long-term studies are generally of poor quality . While coffee is native to Ethiopia and Sudan , the earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking as the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen in southern Arabia in the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines .",
