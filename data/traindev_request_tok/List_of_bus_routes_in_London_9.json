On the National Rail network it is also known as London Marylebone and is the southern terminus of the Chiltern Main Line to Birmingham . An accompanying Underground station is on the Bakerloo line between Edgware Road and Baker Street in Transport for London 's fare zone 1 . The station opened in 1899 as the London terminus of the Great Central Main Line ( GCML ) , the last major railway to open in Britain for 100 years , linking the capital to the cities of Nottingham , Sheffield and Manchester . Marylebone was the last of London 's main line termini to be built and is one of the smallest , opening with half of the platforms originally planned . There has been an interchange with the Bakerloo line since 1907 , but not with any other lines . Traffic declined at Marylebone station from the mid-20th century , particularly after the GCML closed . By the 1980s , it was threatened with closure , but was reprieved because of commuter traffic on the London to Aylesbury Line ( a remaining part of the GCML ) and from High Wycombe . In 1993 the station found a new role as the terminus of the Chiltern Main Line . Following the privatisation of British Rail , the station was expanded with two additional platforms in 2006 and improved services to Birmingham Snow Hill . In 2015 services began between Marylebone and Oxford Parkway via a new chord connecting the main line to the Oxford to Bicester Line and an extension to Oxford following in 2016 .
