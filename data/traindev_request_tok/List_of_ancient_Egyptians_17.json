His memory was also central to the origin myth of the Kushite kingdom , which was embellished with new elements over time .

He is noted for abandoning traditional Egyptian polytheism and introducing worship centered on the Aten ( notably instead of Amun , the temples of which he destroyed , the name of whom he rubbed off and the priests of whom he left without resources ) , which is sometimes described as monolatristic , henotheistic , or even quasi-monotheistic . An early inscription likens the Aten to the sun as compared to stars , and later official language avoids calling the Aten a god , giving the solar deity a status above mere gods . Akhenaten tried to shift his culture from Egypt 's traditional religion , but the shifts were not widely accepted . After his death , his monuments were dismantled and hidden , his statues were destroyed , and his name excluded from the king lists . Traditional religious practice was gradually restored , and when some dozen years later rulers without clear rights of succession from the 18th Dynasty founded a new dynasty , they discredited Akhenaten and his immediate successors , referring to Akhenaten himself as the enemy or that criminal in archival records . The stele of Merneptah values Amun who is represented giving the cemetery of victory to him , and is written on the back of a stele of Akhenaten stolen from one of his temples in Karnak . He was all but lost from history until the discovery during the 19th century of the site of Akhetaten , the city he built and designed for the worship of Aten , at Amarna . Early excavations at Amarna by Flinders Petrie sparked interest in the enigmatic pharaoh , and a mummy found in the tomb KV55 , which was unearthed in 1907 in a dig led by Edward R. Ayrton , is likely that of Akhenaten . DNA analysis has determined that the man buried in KV55 is the father of King Tutankhamun , but its identification as Akhenaten has been questioned . Modern interest in Akhenaten and his queen Nefertiti comes partly from his connection with Tutankhamun ( even though Tutankhamun 's mother was not Nefertiti , but a woman named by archaeologists The Younger Lady ) , partly from the unique style and high quality of the pictorial arts he patronized , and partly from ongoing interest in the religion he attempted to establish .",

She might have been identical with Takhat , a daughter of Ramesses II , who is mentioned on a Louvre ostracon . Thus she was the aunt of Seti II , but since she was among the youngest children of Ramesses , it is very likely that she was the same age or even younger than Seti II who was the grandson of Ramesses . It is also possible that she was a grandchild of Ramesses ; there are several examples of granddaughters bearing the title King 's Daughter , although it was not very common . The king she married was either Merenptah or Seti II . She is shown on several statues of Amenmesse , among them on two statues in the Karnak temple . On one of these , which still stands in Karnak , she is called King 's Daughter , King 's Wife ( Takhat ) and the word wife replaced the original mother . According to Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton , the title was recarved when Seti , the rightful heir regained the throne and usurped the statue , and that it proves either that Takhat married Seti when he became pharaoh , or that they had been married before , which means Amenmesse was Seti 's son and usurped the throne from his own father . This theory might be strengthened by the other statue ( now in Cairo ) , on which Takhat is also named as King 's Daughter and King 's Wife , but without any trace of recarving , while the king 's name replaced another name .

In addition , he also was hereditary prince , count , wearer of the royal seal , sole companion and high priest of Wepwawet . The main source about his life came from his biography , inscribed on the tomb III in Asyut . It is generally assumed that Tefibi was the second of a trio of related nomarchs datable to the Herakleopolite period ; he was likely preceded by his father Khety and followed by his son , also named Khety .",
  "/wiki/Thinis": "Thinis or This ( Egyptian : Tjenu ; Coptic : \u2ca6\u2c93\u2c9b ) was the capital city of the first dynasties of ancient Egypt . Thinis is , as yet , undiscovered but well attested by ancient writers , including the classical historian Manetho , who cites it as the centre of the Thinite Confederacy , a tribal confederation whose leader , Menes ( or Narmer ) , united Egypt and was its first pharaoh . Thinis began a steep decline in importance from Dynasty III , when the capital was relocated to Memphis , which was thought to be the first true and stable capital after unification of old Egypt by Menes . Thinis 's location on the border of the competing Heracleopolitan and Theban dynasties of the First Intermediate Period and its proximity to certain oases of possible military importance ensured Thinis some continued significance in the Old and New Kingdoms . This was a brief respite and Thinis eventually lost its position as a regional administrative centre by the Roman period . Due to its ancient heritage , Thinis remained a significant religious centre , housing the tomb and mummy of the regional deity . In ancient Egyptian religious cosmology , as seen ( for example ) in the Book of the Dead , Thinis played a role as a mythical place in heaven . Although the precise location of Thinis is unknown , mainstream Egyptological consensus places it in the vicinity of ancient Abydos and modern Girga .",
  "/wiki/Tefnakht": "Shepsesre Tefnakht ( in Greek known as Tnephachthos ) was a prince of Sais and founder of the relatively short Twenty-fourth dynasty of Egypt ; he rose to become a Chief of the Ma in his home city . He is thought to have reigned roughly 732 BCE to 725 BCE , or 7 years . Tefnakht I first began his career as the Great Chief of the West and Prince of Sais and was a late contemporary of the last ruler of the 22nd dynasty : Shoshenq V. Tefnakht I was actually the second ruler of Sais ; he was preceded by Osorkon C , who is attested by several documents mentioning him as this city 's Chief of the Ma and Army Leader , according to Kenneth Kitchen , while his predecessor as Great Chief of the West was a man named Ankhhor . A recently discovered statue , dedicated by Tefnakht I to Amun-Re , reveals important details about his personal origins . The statue 's text states that Tefnakht was the son of a certain Gemnefsutkapu and the grandson of Basa , a priest of Amun near Sais . Consequently , Tefnakht was not actually descended from either lines of Chiefs of the Ma and of the Libu as traditionally believed but rather came from a family of priests , and his ancestors being more likely Egyptians rather than Libyans . Tefnakht is absent from the Manethonian tradition , perhaps because of the abbreviated form in which the Aegyptiaca came to us , perhaps because Tefnakht was considered a usurper .",
  "/wiki/Tefnakht_II": "Tefnakht II or Stephinates , was an ancient Egyptian ruler of the city of Sais during the early 7th century BC . He is recognized as an early member of the so-called Proto-Saite Dynasty , which directly preceded the 26th Dynasty of Egypt ."
