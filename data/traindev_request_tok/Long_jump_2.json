The name of the city as well as the names of most of its boroughs and rivers are of Slavic origin . Dresden is the second largest city in the Thuringian-Upper Saxon dialect area , following only Leipzig . The Sorbian language area begins east of the city , in Lusatia .

The controversial American and British bombing of Dresden in World War II towards the end of the war killed approximately 25,000 people , many of whom were civilians , and destroyed the entire city centre .
