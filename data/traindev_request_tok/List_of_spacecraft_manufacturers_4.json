[ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

Germany is a very decentralised country . Its capital and largest metropolis is Berlin , while Frankfurt serves as its financial capital and has the country 's busiest airport . Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity . A region named Germania was documented before AD 100 . Beginning in the 10th century , German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire . During the 16th century , northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation . After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire , the German Confederation was formed in 1815 . The German revolutions of 1848-49 resulted in the Frankfurt Parliament establishing major democratic rights .",

In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed .

On 12 November , its lander module Philae performed the first successful landing on a comet , though its battery power ran out two days later . Communications with Philae were briefly restored in June and July 2015 , but due to diminishing solar power , Rosetta 's communications module with the lander was turned off on 27 July 2016 .

The Mars Express mission is exploring the planet Mars , and is the first planetary mission attempted by the agency . Express originally referred to the speed and efficiency with which the spacecraft was designed and built . However Express also describes the spacecraft 's relatively short interplanetary voyage , a result of being launched when the orbits of Earth and Mars brought them closer than they had been in about 60,000 years . Mars Express consists of two parts , the Mars Express Orbiter and Beagle 2 , a lander designed to perform exobiology and geochemistry research . Although the lander failed to fully deploy after it landed on the Martian surface , the orbiter has been successfully performing scientific measurements since early 2004 , namely , high-resolution imaging and mineralogical mapping of the surface , radar sounding of the subsurface structure down to the permafrost , precise determination of the atmospheric circulation and composition , and study of the interaction of the atmosphere with the interplanetary medium . Due to the valuable science return and the highly flexible mission profile , Mars Express has been granted several mission extensions . The latest one , as of November 2018 , is scheduled to end in late 2020 , when it is expected to receive another mission extension lasting until 2022 . Some of the instruments on the orbiter , including the camera systems and some spectrometers , reuse designs from the failed launch of the Russian Mars 96 mission in 1996 ( European countries had provided much of the instrumentation and financing for that unsuccessful mission ) . The design of Mars Express is based on ESA 's Rosetta mission , on which a considerable sum was spent on development . The same design was also used for the Venus Express mission in order to increase reliability and reduce development cost and time .
