  "/wiki/Innings_pitched": "In baseball , innings pitched ( IP ) are the number of innings a pitcher has completed , measured by the number of batters and baserunners that are put out while the pitcher is on the pitching mound in a game . Three outs made is equal to one inning pitched . One out counts as one-third of an inning , and two outs counts as two-thirds of an inning . Sometimes , the statistic is written 34.1 , 72.2 , or 91.0 , for example , to represent \u200b34 1\u20443 innings , \u200b72 2\u20443 innings , and 91 innings exactly , respectively . Runners left on base by a pitcher are not counted in determining innings pitched . It is possible for a pitcher to enter a game , give up several hits and possibly even several runs , and be removed before achieving any outs , thereby recording a total of zero innings pitched . Alternatively , it is possible for a pitcher to enter a situation where there are two runners on base and no outs . He 'll throw one pitch which will result in a triple play , and for that one pitch he 'll be credited with a full inning pitched .",

They are located in Beloit , Wisconsin , and play their home games at Harry C. Pohlman Field , which was built in 1982 . Beloit joined the Midwest League as an expansion franchise in 1982 . The club was a Milwaukee Brewers farm team from its inception through 2004 . Beloit switched to the Minnesota Twins ' farm system for the 2005 season . The organization adopted the Snappers nickname in 1995 after using its parent team 's nickname for its first 13 seasons . The name derives from the snapping turtle , because Beloit was formerly known as Turtle Village , and there is still a Turtle Creek and a town of Turtle . All of these are named for a turtle-shaped Indian mound on the campus of Beloit College . After the Milwaukee Brewers withdrew their affiliation with Beloit due to the lack of a new stadium , efforts were started to build one similar to facilities used by the Rockford RiverHawks or the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers . One possible scenario involved construction on a site near Janesville , which could have included renaming the team to reflect a broader Rock County audience . However , no new stadium was built and improvements , including redoing the entire field and repairing the concrete concourse , have been made to the existing site in recent years . After the 2012 season , the city of Beloit appropriated $ 100,000 in order to completely redo the outfield ."
