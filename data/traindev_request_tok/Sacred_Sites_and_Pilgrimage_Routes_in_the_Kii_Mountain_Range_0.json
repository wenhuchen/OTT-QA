The honden may however be completely absent , as for example when the shrine stands on a sacred mountain to which it is dedicated , and which is worshipped directly . The honden may also be missing when there are nearby altar-like structures called himorogi or objects believed to be capable of attracting spirits called yorishiro that can serve as a direct bond to a kami .

However , political entanglements during the Genpei War ( 1180-1185 ) led many disaffected monks to leave , and in some cases to establish their own schools of Buddhism such as J\u014ddo-sh\u016b , Nichiren-sh\u016b and the S\u014dt\u014d school of Zen .
