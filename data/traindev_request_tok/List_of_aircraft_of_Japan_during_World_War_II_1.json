  "/wiki/Aichi_D3A": "The Aichi D3A Type 99 Carrier Bomber ( Allied reporting name Val ) is a World War II carrier-borne dive bomber . It was the primary dive bomber of the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) and was involved in almost all IJN actions , including the attack on Pearl Harbor . The Aichi D3A was the first Japanese aircraft to bomb American targets in the war , commencing with Pearl Harbor and U.S. bases in the Philippines , such as Clark Air Force Base . Vals sank more Allied warships than any other Axis aircraft .",

The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force ( JMSDF ) was formed circa 1952-1954 after the dissolution of the IJN . The Imperial Japanese Navy was the third largest navy in the world by 1920 , behind the Royal Navy and the United States Navy ( USN ) . It was supported by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service for aircraft and airstrike operation from the fleet . It was the primary opponent of the Western Allies in the Pacific War . The origins of the Imperial Japanese Navy go back to early interactions with nations on the Asian continent , beginning in the early medieval period and reaching a peak of activity during the 16th and 17th centuries at a time of cultural exchange with European powers during the Age of Discovery . After two centuries of stagnation during the country 's ensuing seclusion policy under the sh\u014dgun of the Edo period , Japan 's navy was comparatively backward when the country was forced open to trade by American intervention in 1854 . This eventually led to the Meiji Restoration . Accompanying the re-ascendance of the Emperor came a period of frantic modernization and industrialization . The navy had several successes , sometimes against much more powerful enemies such as in the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War , before being largely destroyed in World War II .",

It was controlled by the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office and the Ministry of the Army , both of which were nominally subordinate to the Emperor of Japan as supreme commander of the army and the navy . Later an Inspectorate General of Aviation became the third agency with oversight of the army . During wartime or national emergencies , the nominal command functions of the emperor would be centralized in an Imperial General Headquarters ( IGHQ ) , an ad-hoc body consisting of the chief and vice chief of the Army General Staff , the Minister of the Army , the chief and vice chief of the Naval General Staff , the Inspector General of Aviation , and the Inspector General of Military Training .",
  "/wiki/Mitsubishi_Ki-51": "The Mitsubishi Ki-51 ( Army designation Type 99 Assault Plane . Allied nickname Sonia ) was a light bomber/dive bomber in service with the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II . It first flew in mid-1939 . Initially deployed against Chinese forces , it proved to be too slow to hold up against the fighter aircraft of the other Allied powers . However , it performed a useful ground-attack role in the China-Burma-India theater , notably from airfields too rough for many other aircraft . As the war drew to a close , the Japanese began using them in kamikaze attacks . Total production was around 2,385 units . On the day Hiroshima was destroyed by an atomic bomb , two Ki-51s were responsible for the last Japanese sinking of a US warship , sinking USS Bullhead ( SS-332 ) with all hands .

  "/wiki/Mitsubishi_B5M": "The Mitsubishi B5M was an Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service ( IJNAS ) land-based attack aircraft , originally intended for carrier use . The B5M was also given the long formal designation \u4e5d\u4e03\u5f0f\u4e8c\u53f7\u8266\u4e0a\u653b\u6483\u6a5f - Navy Type 97 No.2 Carrier Attack Bomber and Allied reporting name of Mabel . The B5M was designed in response to a 1935 specification for a new bomber for use on the IJNAS aircraft carriers ( Mitsubishi Navy Experimental 10-Shi Carrier Torpedo Attacker ) . The machine was to have a crew of three , folding wings for flight deck storage , a speed of not less than 322 km/h ( 200 mph ) , a flight endurance of not less than seven hours , and the ability to carry at least 800 kg ( 1,760 lb ) of bombs - a tall order for a single-engine aircraft of the mid-1930s . It was intended as a backup for the Nakajima B5N Kate torpedo bomber . Although designed as a carrier-based aircraft , it was relegated to land-based torpedo bomber duties in World War II . 125 were built .",
  "/wiki/Nakajima_B5N": "The Nakajima B5N ( Japanese : \u4e2d\u5cf6 B5N , Allied reporting name Kate ) was the standard carrier-based torpedo bomber of the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) for much of World War II . Although the B5N was substantially faster and more capable than its Allied counterparts , the American Douglas TBD Devastator monoplane ( the U.S. Navy 's first all-metal , carrier-borne monoplane of any type with retracting gear ) , and the British Fairey Swordfish and Fairey Albacore torpedo biplanes , it was nearing obsolescence by 1941 . Nevertheless , the B5N operated throughout the whole war , due to the delayed development of its successor , the B6N . In the early part of the Pacific War , flown by well-trained IJN aircrews and as part of well-coordinated attacks , the B5N achieved particular successes at the battles of Pearl Harbor , Coral Sea , Midway , and Santa Cruz Islands . Primarily a carrier-based aircraft , it was also occasionally used as a land-based bomber . The B5N carried a crew of three : pilot , navigator/bombardier/observer , and radio operator/gunner .",

Due to its protracted development , a shortage of experienced pilots and the United States Navy 's achievement of air superiority by the time of its introduction , the B6N was never able to fully demonstrate its combat potential .",

  "/wiki/Yokosuka_D4Y": "The Yokosuka D4Y Suisei ( \u5f57\u661f , Suisei , Comet , Allied reporting name Judy ) is a two-seat carrier-based dive bomber developed by the Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal and operated by the Imperial Japanese Navy from 1942 to 1945 during World War II . Development of the aircraft began in 1938 . The first D4Y1 was complete in November 1940 and made its maiden flight at Yokosuka the following month . While the aircraft was originally conceived as a dive bomber , the D4Y was used in other roles including reconnaissance , night fighter and special attack ( kamikaze ) . It made its combat debut as a reconnaissance aircraft when two pre-production D4Y1-Cs embarked aboard the S\u014dry\u016b to take part in the Battle of Midway in 1942 . It was not until March 1943 that it was accepted for use as a dive bomber . The early D4Y1 and D4Y2 featured the liquid-cooled Aichi Atsuta engine , a licensed version of the German Daimler-Benz DB 601 , while the later D4Y3 and D4Y4 featured the Mitsubishi MK8P Kinsei radial engine . Like many other Japanese aircraft of the time , the D4Y lacked armor and self-sealing fuel tanks and it was not until the final variant , the D4Y4 , that the aircraft was given bulletproof glass and armor protection for the crew and fuel tanks . Nevertheless , the D4Y was one of the fastest dive bombers of the war , particularly the D4Y4 whom Max Gadney said was the fastest dive-bomber of World War II and that it was faster than the zero if RATO was equipped . Only the delays in its development hindered its service while its predecessor , the slower fixed-gear Aichi D3A , remained in service much longer than intended . Famously , a D4Y was used in one of the final kamikaze attacks in 1945 , hours after the surrender of Japan , with Vice Admiral Matome Ugaki in the rear cockpit .",
