  "/wiki/Havre_Residential_Historic_District": "The Havre Residential Historic District is a site on the National Register of Historic Places encompassing 36 blocks in Havre , Montana . The Havre Residential Historic District represents Havre 's economic growth and social change from 1895 to the 1940s . Located primarily at the district 's northwestern edge , turn-of-the-century homes of the social and business elite are large residences built in Queen Anne/Colonial Revival and Neo-Colonial styles . Their owners fortunes were made from providing supplies and services to soldiers at nearby Fort Assinniboine , homesteaders , and Great Northern Railway employees . As a railroad division point , Havre became home to white-collar workers who built smaller homes in the district . By 1907 , the Craftsman bungalow was the preferred housing style . These smaller , one- or one-and-a-half-story dwellings reflect the security of the middle class in Montana during the first decades of the twentieth century . Havre 's establishment as Hill County seat in 1912 coincided with the Progressive political movement that sought clean cities with suitable housing for all . Between 1913 and 1917 , the Home Builders Investment Company - created by local Progressives - built more than 100 homes . Post World War I depression dampened construction in the district , but late-1920s railroad expansion caused a housing boom . Homes subsequently built here during the Great Depression utilized lower-cost materials and simpler designs .",
