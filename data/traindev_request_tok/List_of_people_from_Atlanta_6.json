  "/wiki/Rapper": "Rapping ( or rhyming , spitting , emceeing , MCing ) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates rhyme , rhythmic speech , and street vernacular , which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways , usually over a backing beat or musical accompaniment . The components of rap include content ( what is being said ) , flow ( rhythm , rhyme ) , and delivery ( cadence , tone ) . Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that it is usually performed in time to musical accompaniment . Rap being a primary ingredient of hip hop music , it is commonly associated with that genre in particular ; however , the origins of rap precede hip-hop culture . The earliest precursor to modern rap is the West African griot tradition , in which oral historians , or praise-singers , would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies , or use their rhetorical techniques for gossip or to praise or critique individuals . Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of black verbal reverence [ definition needed ] , through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs , to Muhammad Ali 's verbal taunts and the poems of The Last Poets . [ vague ] Therefore , rap lyrics and music are part of the Black rhetorical continuum , and aim to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies . The person credited with originating the style of delivering rhymes over extensive music , that would become known as rap , was Anthony DJ Hollywood Holloway from Harlem , New York . Rap is usually delivered over a beat , typically provided by a DJ , turntablist , beatboxer , or performed a cappella without accompaniment . Stylistically , rap occupies a gray area between speech , prose , poetry , and singing . The word , which predates the musical form , originally meant to lightly strike , and is now used to describe quick speech or repartee . The word had been used in British English since the 16th century .",
