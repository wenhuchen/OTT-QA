  "/wiki/.22_Short": ".22 Short is a variety of .22 caliber ( 5.6 mm ) rimfire ammunition . Developed in 1857 for the first Smith & Wesson revolver , the .22 rimfire was the first American metallic cartridge . The original loading was a 29 or 30 gr ( 0.066 or 0.069 oz ; 1.879 or 1.944 g ) bullet and 4 gr ( 0.0091 oz ; 0.2592 g ) of black powder . The original .22 rimfire cartridge was renamed .22 Short with the introduction of the .22 Long in 1871 . Developed for self defense , the modern .22 Short , though still used in a few pocket pistols and mini-revolvers , is mainly used as a quiet round for practice by the recreational shooter . The .22 Short was popularly used in shooting galleries at fairs and arcades ; several rifle makers produced gallery models for .22 Short exclusively . Due to its low recoil and good inherent accuracy , the .22 Short was used for the Olympic 25 meter rapid fire pistol event until 2004 , and they were allowed in the shooting part of modern pentathlon competitions before they switched to air pistols . Several makes of starter pistols use .22 Short blank cartridges . Some powder-actuated nail guns use the .22 Short cartridge as a power source .",
  "/wiki/.22_Long": ".22 Long is a variety of .22 caliber ( 5.6 mm ) rimfire ammunition . The .22 Long is the second-oldest of the surviving rimfire cartridges , dating back to 1871 , when it was loaded with a 29 grain ( 1.9 g ) bullet and 5 grains ( 0.32 g ) of black powder , 25% more than the .22 Short it was based on . It was designed for use in revolvers , but was soon chambered in rifles as well , in which it gained a strong reputation as a small game cartridge , and sold very well . In 1887 the .22 Long case was combined with the heavier 40 grain ( 2.6 g ) bullet of the .22 Extra Long of 1880 to produce the .22 Long Rifle giving a longer overall length , a higher muzzle energy and superior performance as a hunting and target round , rendering the .22 Long and .22 Extra Long obsolete . Many firearms designed for the .22 Long Rifle will chamber and fire the shorter round , though the .22 Long generally does not generate sufficient energy to operate semi-automatic guns . The one prominent survivor of the .22 Long is the .22 CB Long , a long-cased version of the .22 CB . While the original .22 Long loading used the same powder charge as the .22 Long Rifle , the .22 Long bullet was significantly lighter , and the combination did not result in higher velocities for the .22 Long when fired from a rifle . The large barrel volume to chamber volume ratio of a .22 rimfire rifle means that the powder gasses have expanded as far as they can well before the bullet reaches the muzzle of a normal length rifle barrel , and the light .22 Long bullet has less inertia than the .22 Long Rifle . This means that the .22 Long bullet ( and to a lesser extent the .22 Long Rifle in most loadings ) actually slows down significantly before it exits the barrel . For farmers , or for those who only hunted small game such as squirrel or cottontail rabbit , the differences in performance between the .22 Long and .22 Long Rifle cartridges were of little importance . The quieter report and lower penetration of the .22 Long cartridge were often seen as desirable qualities . Since the .22 Long Rifle performs as well in a short handgun barrel as the .22 Long and outperforms it significantly in a long rifle barrel , the development of the .22 Long Rifle assured the .22 Long 's path to obsolescence .",

While the .219 Zipper was supposed to compete against other varmint cartridges of the time , most lever-action rifles use tubular magazines , which prohibit the use of pointed bullets . This led to problems with accuracy . Winchester stopped producing .219 Zipper ammunition in 1962 , Remington Arms stopped production of the cartridge soon afterwards . The .219 Zipper is the parent case of the .219 Donaldson Wasp , and P.O . Ackley created the .219 Zipper Improved in 1937 . Leslie Lindahl 's Chucker and Super-chucker and wildcat case modifications by Hervey Lovell , Lysle Kilbourne , and W. F. Vickery offered similarly superior ballistics in stronger single-shot and bolt actions . Though the flat- or round-nosed slug causes rapid loss of velocity , the .219 Zipper is suitable for small game or varmints , including wolf or coyote , and even deer if loaded with a heavier 55 grain bullet .

It is similar in length to the .22 WMR ( Winchester Magnum Rimfire ) ( 5.7\u00d727mm ) and to some degree similar also to .22 Hornet or .22 K-Hornet . Unlike many new cartridges , it has no parent case ; the complete package was developed from scratch by FN . The 5.7\u00d728mm was developed in conjunction with the FN P90 PDW and FN Five-seven pistol , in response to NATO requests for a replacement for the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum cartridge . In 2002 and 2003 , NATO conducted a series of tests with the intention of standardizing a PDW cartridge as a replacement for the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum cartridge . The tests compared the relative merits of the 5.7\u00d728mm cartridge and the 4.6\u00d730mm cartridge , which was created by Heckler & Koch as a competitor to the 5.7\u00d728mm . The NATO group subsequently recommended the 5.7\u00d728mm cartridge , citing superior performance in testing , but the German delegation objected and the standardization process was indefinitely halted .

Once popular amongst match shooters in the 1940s it has since fallen by the wayside in favor of newer developments . It is however held in high regard for its accuracy and is widely considered the grandfather of benchrest cartridges . Today the round occupies a niche in the falling-block rifle market . There are three notable versions of the Wasp . The first , designed in the mid 1930s and today known as the 219 Gipson Wasp , was named after the gunsmith who chambered the first Wasp rifle for Donaldson . This version has a case length measuring 1.625 and was formed from rimless 25 Remington brass . Donaldson shifted his experimentation to the 219 Zipper brass soon after the introduction of that cartridge by Winchester in 1937 . By approximately 1940 Donaldson had lengthened the body of the Wasp case to increase capacity from around 24 to 28 grains of IMR 3031 powder - to see if velocity could be increased while maintaining accuracy . To Donaldson 's delight , the larger case produced both higher velocity and superior accuracy . This development work is detailed in a series of letters written by Donaldson and collectively published in Yours Truly . Donaldson later lengthened the neck by about 1/32 so as not to encroach on powder capacity when using a graphite wad behind the bullet .",

It was developed in 1891 for use in the new service rifles then under consideration by the United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway . The two nations had independent armies and consequently the normal procedure at the time was for their respective governments to use the same ammunition and then purchase small arms of their choice . Norway adopted the Krag-J\u00f8rgensen rifle , while Sweden adopted a Mauser rifle design .

  "/wiki/7mm_Remington_Magnum": "The 7mm Remington Magnum rifle cartridge was introduced as a commercially available round in 1962 , along with the new Remington Model 700 bolt-action rifle . It is a member of the belted magnum family that is directly derived from the venerable .375 H & H Magnum . The original purpose of the belted magnum concept taken from the .300 H & H Magnum and .375 H & H Magnum , was to provide precise headspace control , since the sloping shoulders , while easing cartridge extraction , were unsuitable for this purpose . Improved cartridge extraction reliability is desirable while hunting dangerous game , which would be of concern when needing a fast follow up shot . The 7mm Remington Magnum is based on the commercial .264 Winchester Magnum , .338 Winchester Magnum , and .458 Winchester Magnum , which were based on the same belted .300 H & H Magnum and .375 H & H Magnum cases , trimmed to nearly the same length as the .270 Weatherby Magnum . On its introduction , the 7mm Remington Magnum substantially usurped the market share held by the .264 Winchester Magnum , which went into sharp decline in popularity and sales after 1962 . Remington has offered Managed Recoil ammunition for achieving reduced recoil when shooting and for generating less meat damage when hunting smaller game .",

It is known as .275 Rigby in the United Kingdom . It was developed by Paul Mauser of the Mauser company in 1892 and adopted as a military cartridge by Spain in 1893 . It was subsequently adopted by several other countries as the standard military cartridge , and although now obsolete as a military cartridge , it remains in widespread international use as a sporting round . Many sporting rifles in this calibre were made by British riflemakers , among whom John Rigby was prominent ; and , catering for the British preference for calibres to be designated in inches , Rigby called this chambering the .275 bore after the measurement of a 7 mm rifle 's bore across the lands .",
  "/wiki/7\u00d764mm": "At the start of the 20th century the famous German gun and ammunition designer Wilhelm Brenneke ( 1865-1951 ) was experimenting with the engineering concept of lengthening and other dimensional changes regarding standard cartridge cases like the M/88 cartridge case , then used by the German military in their Mauser Gewehr 98 rifles , to obtain extra muzzle velocity . In 1912 , Brenneke designed the commercially rather unsuccessful 8\u00d764mm S cartridge ( again in production since 2001 ) . It was intended as a ballistic upgrade option for the Mauser Gewehr 98 rifles that were standard issue in the German military . The German military chose , however , to stay with their 8\u00d757mm IS rifle cartridge avoiding rechambering their service rifles for a cartridge that , due to its more favourable bore area to case volume ratio , would ballistically outperform the .30-06 Springfield cartridge of the United States Army . Brennekes engineering concept was to create new , very powerful ( for the era ) cartridges by enlarging exterior cartridge case dimensions like overall length and slightly larger case head diameter compared to the German 8\u00d757mm IS military cartridge case , coupled with an increase in maximum pressure . The concept was essentially sound , and he persisted in the development of new cartridges along this line . In 1917 Brenneke necked down his 8\u00d764mm S design of 1912 to 7 mm calibre , introduced it as the 7\u00d764mm , and achieved major commercial success . The 7\u00d764mm offered 10-12% more muzzle velocity than the 7\u00d757mm Mauser . This results in a flatter trajectory and better performance at longer range . In the years between World War I and World War II , the 7\u00d764mm was often regarded by German hunters as a miracle cartridge , and dozens of different factory loads were available on the German market . It was so highly regarded that the Nazi German Wehrmacht , during the 1930s , even considered replacing the 8\u00d757mm IS in favour of the 7\u00d764mm for their snipers . The Wehrmacht decided - just like the German Army had in 1912 - to stay with the 8\u00d757mm IS cartridges for their Mauser Karabiner 98ks to keep logistics as simple as possible .",

During the 1940s , the .300 Savage became the basis for experiments on behalf of the U.S. Military that resulted in the development of the T65 series of experimental cartridges . The original experimental case design by the Frankford Arsenal was designated the T65 and was similar to the .300 Savage case , but with less taper . The experimental cases were made from standard .30-06 Springfield cases which gave a little less capacity than standard .300 Savage cases because the Frankford Arsenal cases had slightly thicker case walls . The later T65 iterations were lengthened compared to the original T65 case and provided a ballistic performance roughly equal to the U.S. military .30-06 Springfield service cartridge . Over forty years of technical progress in the field of propellants allowed for similar service cartridge performance from a significantly shorter , smaller case with less case capacity . Winchester saw a market for a civilian model of the late T65 series designs and introduced it in 1952 , two years prior to the NATO adoption of the T65E5 experimental cartridge iteration under the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO designation in 1954 .
