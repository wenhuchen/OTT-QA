  "/wiki/Diameter": "In geometry , a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle . It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle . Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere . In more modern usage , the length of a diameter is also called the diameter . In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter ( which refers to the line segment itself ) , because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length , this being twice the radius r .",

  "/wiki/Aristarchus_(crater)": "Aristarchus , named after the Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos , is a prominent lunar impact crater that lies in the northwest part of the Moon 's near side . It is considered the brightest of the large formations on the lunar surface , with an albedo nearly double that of most lunar features . The feature is bright enough to be visible to the naked eye , and displays unusually bright features when viewed through a large telescope . It is also readily identified when most of the lunar surface is illuminated by earthshine . The crater is deeper than the Grand Canyon . The crater is located at the southeastern edge of the Aristarchus plateau , an elevated area that contains a number of volcanic features , such as sinuous rilles . This area is also noted for the large number of reported transient lunar phenomena , as well as recent emissions of radon gas as measured by the Lunar Prospector spacecraft .",
  "/wiki/Arzachel_(crater)": "Arzachel is a relatively young lunar impact crater located in the highlands in the south-central part of the visible Moon , close to the zero meridian ( the visible center of the Moon ) . It lies to the south of the crater Alphonsus , and together with Ptolemaeus further north the three form a prominent line of craters to the east of Mare Nubium . The smaller Alpetragius lies to the northwest , and Thebit is to the southwest along the edge of the mare .",
  "/wiki/Atlas_(crater)": "Atlas is a prominent lunar impact crater that is located in the northeast part of the Moon , to the southeast of Mare Frigoris . Just to the west is the slightly smaller but still prominent crater Hercules . Northeast of Atlas is the large Endymion . The inner wall of Atlas is multiply terraced and the edge slumped , forming a sharp-edged lip . This is a floor-fractured crater with a rough and hilly interior that has a lighter albedo than the surroundings . Floor-fractures are usually created as a result of volcanic modifications . There are two dark patches along the inner edge of the walls ; one along the north edge and another besides the southeast edges . A system of slender clefts named the Rimae Atlas crosses the crater floor , and were created by volcanism . Along the north and northeastern inner sides are a handful of dark-halo craters , most likely due to eruptions . Around the midpoint is a cluster of low central hills arranged in a circular formation .",

  "/wiki/Darwin_(lunar_crater)": "Darwin is a lunar impact crater of the type categorised as a walled plain . It lies in the southeastern part of the Moon , and is sufficiently close to the limb to appear significantly foreshortened when viewed from the Earth . Attached to its southern rim is Lamarck . To the northeast is the dark-floored crater Cr\u00fcger . The outer rim of this formation has been significantly disintegrated by the nearby impacts . The southern and northern parts of the rim in particular are all but destroyed . The eastern rim is somewhat worn but intact , and several small craters lie along the southwestern rim . The satellite crater Darwin B , a fairly large formation with a diameter of 56 kilometers , is attached to the outer western rim . Parts of the interior floor of Darwin have been resurfaced . The southern floor of Darwin is only roughly level , with irregular surface features and several small craters . There is a dune-like set of hills in the northeast part of the floor , which is decelerated surface-flow ejecta from the Orientale basin impact that struck the eastern rim . In the western floor is a large , low , somewhat irregular dome , one of the few such features not found on a mare .",
  "/wiki/Doppelmayer_(crater)": "Doppelmayer is the remains of a lunar impact crater that lies on the southwest edge of Mare Humorum . It was named after the German mathematician and astronomer Johann Gabriel Doppelmayr . To the south-southeast is another flooded crater designated Lee , and to the southeast is Vitello . Just to the east-northeast of Doppelmayer lies the nearly submerged crater Puiseux . The rim of Doppelmayer is nearly round , but is worn and eroded . The most intact section is the southwest half , while in the northeast the rim descends beneath the mare , leaving only a slight rise in the surface . The interior has been flooded by lava , leaving a large raised ridge in the center . A small range of hills curves to the west and north from the southern end of this ridge , forming a feature that is nearly concentric with the crater 's outer rim .",
  "/wiki/Focas_(lunar_crater)": "Focas is a small lunar impact crater that lies on the far side of the Moon , just past the southwestern limb . In this location the crater is occasionally brought into view due to libration , but not much detail can be seen because the crater is viewed from the side . The crater is situated in the wide valley between the ring-shaped Montes Rook in the north and Montes Cordillera range in the south . These ranges form a double-ring around the Mare Orientale impact basin . The crater is located toward the southern end of this immense feature , just to the north of the Montes Cordillera range . Focas is a relatively isolated crater , with the nearest craters of note being the Wright-Shaler crater pair some distance to the east along the same interior edge of the Montes Cordillera . This is a circular crater with an interior floor about half the total diameter . It is symmetrical in form , with only some slight appearance of wear along the rim . The interior floor contains no features or impacts of note . Focas Crater is named after Jean-Henri Focas ( 1909-1969 ) , a Greco-French astronomer .",

  "/wiki/De_Gasparis_(crater)": "de Gasparis is a lunar crater that is located in the southwest part of the Moon . It lies to the southwest of the crater Cavendish and south of Mersenius . The rim of de Gasparis is worn and eroded , and the interior has been flooded by basaltic lava . The surviving outer rim reaches a maximum altitude of about 0.8 km . This crater is notable for the formation of rilles that criss-cross the floor and the surrounding surface . This system of clefts in the surface is designated Rimae de Gasparis , and they span an area of about 130 kilometers in diameter . The rilles are thought to have been created due to tectonic faults deep below the surface . As they cut across de Gasparis , this indicates that they were formed after the crater .",
  "/wiki/Gassendi_(crater)": "Gassendi is a large lunar impact crater feature located at the northern edge of Mare Humorum . It was named after French astronomer Pierre Gassendi . The formation has been inundated by lava during the formation of the mare , so only the rim and the multiple central peaks remain above the surface . The outer rim is worn and eroded , although it retains a generally circular form . A smaller crater - Gassendi A - intrudes into the northern rim , and joins a rough uplift at the northwest part of the floor . The crater pair bear a curious resemblance to a diamond ring . In the southern part of the crater floor is a semi-circular ridge-like formation that is concentric with the outer rim . It is in the southern part where the rim dips down to its lowest portion , and a gap appears at the most southern point . The rim varies in height from as little as 200 meters to as high as 2.5 kilometers above the surface . The floor has numerous hummocks and rough spots . There is also a system of rilles that criss-crosses the floor , named the Rimae Gassendi . The fresh crater Gassendi A is adjacent to Gassendi to the north .",
  "/wiki/Gerard_(crater)": "Gerard is a lunar impact crater that lies along the western edge of the Oceanus Procellarum near the northwest limb of the Moon 's near side . It is located to the north-northwest of the crater von Braun , and northeast of Bunsen . Because of its location , Gerard appears strongly foreshortened when viewed from the Earth , hindering observation . This is a worn and eroded formation with a rim that has been nearly obliterated in some locations and distorted in others . The northern half of the rim has outward bulges to the northeast , north , and northwest . The interior floor is rough in places , with several small and tiny craters along the floor and the eastern rim . To the northwest of this formation is the unusual Gerard Q Inner ( eastern floor covered in dark-hued basaltic lava ) within the larger Gerard Q Outer , and a system of rilles named the Rimae Gerard . These extend for a distance of about 100 kilometers .",
  "/wiki/Goclenius_(crater)": "Goclenius is a lunar impact crater that is located near the west edge of Mare Fecunditatis . It lies to the southeast of the lava-flooded crater Gutenberg , and north of Magelhaens . To the northwest is a parallel rille system that follow a course toward the northwest , running for a length of up to 240 kilometers . This feature is named the Rimae Goclenius . The rim of this crater is worn , distorted and irregular , having a somewhat egg-like outline . The crater floor has been covered in lava , and a rille cuts across the floor towards the northwest , in the same direction as the other members of the Rimae Goclenius . A similar rille lies across the floor of Gutenberg , and it is likely that these features were all formed at the same time , after the original craters were created . There is a low central rise located to the northwest of the crater 's midpoint .",
  "/wiki/Grimaldi_(crater)": "Grimaldi is a large basin located near the western limb of the Moon . It lies to the southwest of the Oceanus Procellarum , and southeast of the crater Riccioli . Between Oceanus Procellarum is Damoiseau , and to the north is Lohrmann . The inner wall of Grimaldi has been so heavily worn and eroded by subsequent impacts that it forms a low , irregular ring of hills , ridges and peaks , rather than a typical crater rim . However , there are peaks remaining that reach heights of over 2 kilometers . The mare lava floor is the most notable feature of this crater , forming a flat , relatively smooth and featureless surface with a particularly low albedo . The dark shade of the floor contrasts with the brighter surroundings , making the crater easy to locate . The approximate diameter of the inner rim is 174 kilometers . Beyond the basin are the scattered remnants of an outer wall , which has a diameter of 220 kilometers . This exterior rim is more intact to the north and west of the crater than elsewhere . To the southeast of Grimaldi is a system of rilles named the Rimae Grimaldi . To the northwest , rilles belonging to the Rimae Riccioli approach the western edge of Grimaldis rim .",
  "/wiki/Hypatia_(crater)": "Hypatia is a lunar impact crater along the northwest edge of Sinus Asperitatis , a bay on the southwest edge of Mare Tranquillitatis . It was named after Egyptian mathematician Hypatia of Alexandria . The nearest crater with an eponym is Alfraganus to the west-southwest . However , farther to the south-southeast , across the lunar mare , is the prominent crater Theophilus . Hypatia is an asymmetrical formation with a rugged , irregular outer rim cut through in several places by narrow clefts . It is generally longer along an axis running to the north-northwest , with the widest outward bulge occurring on the west side at the northern end . It resembles a merger of several crater formations with a common interior floor . Attached to the exterior rim along the southwest is the satellite crater Hypatia A , a more symmetrical , bowl-shaped crater ."
