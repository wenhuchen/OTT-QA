Considered the first American star in ice hockey by the Hockey Hall of Fame , he was also an accomplished American football player . Born into a prominent family from Philadelphia , he enrolled at Princeton University in 1910 . Baker excelled on the university 's hockey and football teams , and became a noted amateur hockey player for the St. Nicholas Hockey Club in New York City . He was a member of three national championship teams , for football in 1911 and hockey in 1912 and 1914 , and helped the St. Nicholas Club win a national amateur championship in 1915 . Baker graduated from Princeton in 1914 and worked for J.P. Morgan Bank until he enlisted in the United States Army Air Service . During World War I he served with the 103rd and the 13th Aero Squadrons before being promoted to captain and named commander of the 141st Aero Squadron . Baker died in December 1918 after a plane he was test-piloting crashed , hours before he was due to leave France and return to America . Baker was widely regarded by his contemporaries as one of the best athletes of his time and is considered one of the best early American hockey players . When the Hockey Hall of Fame was founded in 1945 , Baker was named one of the first nine inductees , the only American among them . In 1973 , he became one of the initial inductees in the United States Hockey Hall of Fame . He was also inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1975 , and is the only person to be in both the hockey and college football halls of fame .",
  "/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association": "The National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) [ a ] is a nonprofit organization that regulates student athletes from 1,268 North American institutions and conferences . It also organizes the athletic programs of many colleges and universities in the United States and Canada , and helps more than 480,000 college student-athletes who compete annually in college sports . The organization is headquartered in Indianapolis , Indiana . In its 2016-17 fiscal year the NCAA took in $ 1.06 billion in revenue , over 82% of which was generated by the Division I Men 's Basketball Tournament . In August 1973 , the current three-division system of Division I , Division II , and Division III was adopted by the NCAA membership in a special convention . Under NCAA rules , Division I and Division II schools can offer scholarships to athletes for playing a sport . Division III schools may not offer any athletic scholarships . Generally , larger schools compete in Division I and smaller schools in II and III . Division I football was further divided into I-A and I-AA in 1978 . Subsequently , the term Division I-AAA was briefly added to delineate Division I schools which do not field a football program at all , but that term is no longer officially used by the NCAA . In 2006 , Divisions I-A and I-AA were respectively renamed the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) and Football Championship Subdivision ( FCS ) . Controversially , the NCAA severely caps the benefits that collegiate athletes can receive from their schools .",

  "/wiki/NCAA_Division_I": "NCAA Division I ( D-I ) is the highest level of intercollegiate athletics sanctioned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) in the United States . D-I schools include the major collegiate athletic powers , with larger budgets , more elaborate facilities and more athletic scholarships than Divisions II and III as well as many smaller schools committed to the highest level of intercollegiate competition . This level was once called the University Division of the NCAA , in contrast to the lower level College Division ; these terms were replaced with numeric divisions in 1973 . The University Division was renamed Division I , while the College Division was split in two ; the College Division members that offered scholarships or wanted to compete against those who did became Division II , while those who did not want to offer scholarships became Division III . For college football only , D-I schools are further divided into the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) , the Football Championship Subdivision ( FCS ) , and those institutions that do not have any football program . FBS teams have higher game attendance requirements and more players receiving athletic scholarships than FCS teams . The FBS is named for its series of postseason bowl games , with various polls ranking teams after the conclusion of these games , while the FCS national champion is determined by a multi-team bracket tournament . For the 2014-15 school year , Division I contained 345 of the NCAA 's 1,066 member institutions , with 125 in the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) , 125 in the Football Championship Subdivision ( FCS ) , and 95 non-football schools , with six additional schools in the transition from Division II to Division I . There was a moratorium on any additional movement up to D-I until 2012 , after which any school that wants to move to D-I must be accepted for membership by a conference and show the NCAA it has the financial ability to support a D-I program .",
  "/wiki/College_football": "College football is gridiron football consisting of American football played by teams of student athletes fielded by American universities , colleges , and military academies , or Canadian football played by teams of student athletes fielded by Canadian universities . It was through college football play that American football rules first gained popularity in the United States . Unlike most other sports in North America , no minor league farm organizations exist in American or Canadian football . Therefore , college football is generally considered to be the second tier of American football in the United States and Canadian football in Canada ; one step ahead of high school competition , and one step below professional competition . However , in some areas of the country , college football is more popular than professional football , and for much of the early 20th century , college football was seen as more prestigious than professional football . It is in college football where a player 's performance directly impacts his chances of playing professional football . The best collegiate players will typically declare for the professional draft after three to four years of collegiate competition , with the NFL holding its annual draft every spring in which 256 players are selected annually . Those not selected can still attempt to land an NFL roster spot as an undrafted free agent .",

The cases n = 1 and n = 2 have been known since antiquity to have an infinite number of solutions . The proposition was first conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 in the margin of a copy of Arithmetica ; Fermat added that he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin . However , there were doubts that he had a correct proof because his claim was published by his son without his consent and after his death . After 358 years of effort by mathematicians , the first successful proof was released in 1994 by Andrew Wiles , and formally published in 1995 ; it was described as a stunning advance in the citation for Wiles 's Abel Prize award in 2016 . It also proved much of the modularity theorem and opened up entire new approaches to numerous other problems and mathematically powerful modularity lifting techniques . The unsolved problem stimulated the development of algebraic number theory in the 19th century and the proof of the modularity theorem in the 20th century . It is among the most notable theorems in the history of mathematics and prior to its proof was in the Guinness Book of World Records as the most difficult mathematical problem in part because the theorem has the largest number of unsuccessful proofs .",

  "/wiki/American_football": "American football , referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron , [ nb 1 ] is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end . The offense , the team with possession of the oval-shaped football , attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it , while the defense , the team without possession of the ball , aims to stop the offense 's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves . The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays ; if they fail , they turn over the football to the defense , but if they succeed , they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive . Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins . American football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of soccer and rugby . The first American football match was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the Father of American Football , established the snap , the line of scrimmage , eleven-player teams , and the concept of downs . Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game ( although their rules were developed independently from that of Camp 's ) . Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football . The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football .",

Blackwell played an important role in both the United States and the United Kingdom as a social and moral reformer , and pioneered in promoting education for women in medicine . Her contributions remain celebrated with the Elizabeth Blackwell Medal , awarded annually to a woman who has made significant contribution to the promotion of women in medicine . Blackwell was initially uninterested in a career in medicine especially after her schoolteacher brought in a bull 's eye to use as a teaching tool . Therefore , she became a schoolteacher in order to support her family . This occupation was seen as suitable for women during the 1800s , however , she soon found it unsuitable for her . Blackwell 's interest in medicine was sparked after a friend fell ill and remarked that , had a female doctor cared for her , she might not have suffered so much . Blackwell began applying to medical schools , and immediately began to endure the prejudice against her sex that would persist throughout her career . She was rejected from each medical school she applied to , except Geneva Medical College , in which the male students voted on Blackwell 's acceptance . In 1847 , Blackwell became the first woman to attend medical school in the United States . Blackwell 's inaugural thesis on typhoid fever , published in 1849 the Buffalo Medical Journal , shortly after she graduated , was the first medical article published by a female student from the United States . It portrayed a strong sense of empathy and sensitivity to human suffering , as well as strong advocacy for economic and social justice .",
