  "/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States": "The cinema of the United States , often metonymously referred to as Hollywood , has had a large effect on the film industry in general since the early 20th century . The dominant style of American cinema is classical Hollywood cinema , which developed from 1913 to 1969 and characterizes most films made there to this day . While Frenchmen Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re are generally credited with the birth of modern cinema , American cinema soon came to be a dominant force in the emerging industry . It produces the largest number of films of any single-language national cinema , with more than 700 English-language films released on average every year . While the national cinemas of the United Kingdom ( 299 ) , Canada ( 206 ) , Australia , and New Zealand also produce films in the same language , they are not considered part of the Hollywood system . Hollywood has also been considered a transnational cinema . Hollywood produced multiple language versions of some titles , often in Spanish or French . Contemporary Hollywood off-shores production to Canada , Australia , and New Zealand . Hollywood is considered the oldest film industry where earliest film studios and production companies emerged , it is also the birthplace of various genres of cinema - among them comedy , drama , action , the musical , romance , horror , science fiction , and the war epic - having set an example for other national film industries . In 1878 , Eadweard Muybridge demonstrated the power of photography to capture motion . In 1894 , the world 's first commercial motion-picture exhibition was given in New York City , using Thomas Edison 's kinetoscope . The United States produced the world 's first sync-sound musical film , The Jazz Singer , in 1927 , and was at the forefront of sound-film development in the following decades .",

  "/wiki/Cinema_of_Italy": "The Cinema of Italy comprises the films made within Italy or by Italian directors . The first Italian director is considered to be Vittorio Calcina [ it ] , a collaborator of the Lumi\u00e8re Brothers , who filmed Pope Leo XIII in 1896 . Since its beginning , Italian cinema has influenced film movements worldwide . As of 2018 , Italian films have won 14 Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film ( the most of any country ) as well as 12 Palmes d'Or ( the second-most of any country ) , one Academy Award for Best Picture and many Golden Lions and Golden Bears . Italy is a birthplace of Art Cinema and the stylistic aspect of film has been the most important factor in the history of Italian movies . In the early 1900s , artistic and epic films such as Otello ( 1906 ) , The Last Days of Pompeii ( 1908 ) , L'Inferno ( 1911 ) , Quo Vadis ( 1913 ) , and Cabiria ( 1914 ) , were made as adaptations of books or stage plays . Italian filmmakers were utilizing complex set designs , lavish costumes , and record budgets , to produce pioneering films . One of the first cinematic avante-garde movements , Italian Futurism , took place in Italy in the late 1910s . After a period of decline in the 1920s , the Italian film industry was revitalized in the 1930s with the arrival of sound film . A popular Italian genre during this period , the Telefoni Bianchi , consisted of comedies with glamorous backgrounds . While Italy 's Fascist government provided financial support for the nation 's film industry , most notably the construction of the Cinecitt\u00e0 studios ( the largest film studio in Europe ) , it also engaged in censorship , and thus many Italian films produced in the late 1930s were propaganda films . Post-World War II Italy saw the rise of the influential Italian neorealist movement , which launched the directorial careers of Luchino Visconti , Roberto Rossellini , and Vittorio De Sica .",

  "/wiki/Lux_Film": "Lux Film was an Italian film distribution ( and later production ) company founded by Riccardo Gualino in 1934 . Gualino was an anti-fascist businessman who had clashed with the regime of Mussolini in 1931 and had been forced into internal exile on the island of Lipari . Founded in 1934 , the Turin-based company specialised in distributing non-Italian films during its first few years . Relocating in Rome in 1940 , Lux began making its own films around this time , with the aim of its output being low risk and low budget by packaging high-quality art films with cultural content . Unlike the studio system current in Hollywood at the time , the company did not have its own studios , but financed , distributed , and exhibited projects which others brought to it with 'fixed-price contracts ' where co-producers were liable for any budget overruns . Gualino did employ executive producers , among whom were Dino De Laurentiis and Carlo Ponti . Ponti joined the firm in 1940 and was allocated an adaptation of an Italian classic novel Piccolo mondo antico ( Small Old-fashioned World , 1941 ) directed by Mario Soldati and films starring the Italian comedian Tot\u00f2 . De Laurentiis , who became an executive producer for Lux in 1942 , oversaw such successful films as Alberto Lattuada 's Il bandito ( 1946 ) and Mario Camerini 's La figlia del capitano ( The Captain 's Daughter , 1947 ) and Riso Amaro ( Bitter Rice , 1949 ) . Bitter Rice , a neorealist film whose plot includes abortion , crime , illicit sex , a gruesome murder , suicide , nudity , and a realistic childbirth scene , was deliberately not submitted by Lux for PCA approval when it reached the United States . The Catholic Legion of Decency rated it ' C ' ( Condemned ) before the distributor agreed to cuts , and the controversy abated . De Laurentiis and Ponti remained with Lux until they formed a partnership in 1950 , though Ulysses ( 1954 ) and some of their other later productions benefited from the support of Lux . Lux suffered from a run of loss making productions during the 1950s , which led to a gradual reduction in its production schedule .",

It includes the highest-grossing films in the Soviet Union ( USSR ) , the highest-grossing domestic Soviet films , the domestic films with the greatest number of ticket sales by year , and the highest-grossing foreign films in the Soviet Union . Note that , in line with the definition above , this list does not include any Soviet television series or television movies , which were not shown in cinemas of the Soviet Union . The annual list includes sales during each year only , which often means that the total number of tickets sold was bigger . As an example , according to the list below the film The Red Snowball Tree , the top seller of the year 1974 , sold 62.5 million tickets during that year . But the total number of sold tickets during all years was bigger ( former deputy director of the USSR GosKino Boris Pavlenok named 140 million , however , it was clearly exaggeration ) . This figure is comparable to some of the United States ' all-time highest ticket sellers , such as The Sound of Music , E.T . the Extra-Terrestrial , and Titanic , in fact exceeding the latter 's estimated ticket sales of 135.5 million . In the mid-1960s , the Soviet Union sold 4 billion tickets and grossed 1 billion \u0440\u0443\u0431 annually . At the 1960s exchange rate of 0.9 \u0440\u0443\u0431 per US dollar , this was $ 1.11 billion ( equivalent to $ 9 billion adjusted for inflation ) . Soviet ticket prices were generally lower than American ticket prices , due to lower living costs in the Soviet Union , with average ticket prices ranging from 25 kopecks in the mid-1960s to 50 kopecks in the early 1980s . Both domestic Soviet films and foreign films were shown , the latter having a limited quota and thus drawing higher average ticket sales than domestic productions .",

Only a small portion of box office sales in Spain are generated by domestic films . The Spanish government has therefore implemented measures aimed at supporting local film production and movie theaters , which include the assurance of funding from the main national television stations .

While film production reached an all-time high in 1936 , the golden age of British cinema is usually thought to have occurred in the 1940s , during which the directors David Lean , Michael Powell , ( with Emeric Pressburger ) and Carol Reed produced their most critically acclaimed works .
