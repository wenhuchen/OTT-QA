  "/wiki/Vasili's_Garden": "Vasili 's Garden is an Australian television gardening program . Hosted by Vasili Kanidiadis , each episode of the show , which is unscripted , focuses on the plants and produce from home gardens in Melbourne and surrounding areas , with emphasis on traditional and organic methods of gardening and healthy eating . The show has become known for Vasili 's lively and sometimes outlandish methods of presentation of the show , his piano accordion playing at the end of the show and his use of the Greek phrase 'maresi ' ( translating to ' I like it ' in English ) throughout the show . The show first aired on community television station Channel 31 in 2002 and was produced by Vasili 's and Peter Deskes own production company , Maresi Productions . In 2007 , after two years of negotiations , the show moved to SBS , collaboratively produced by I Like It Productions ( a partnership between Maresi Productions and Renegade Films ) , with the main appeal being the reach of a national audience , unavailable up to that point on Channel 31 . The format remained largely unchanged , owing to Vasili 's insistence that the show retain its 'home video ' feel . Vasili sees this as an important aspect of the show , saying that he wants to make people feel like they are watching their next-door neighbour 's house or their aunty or uncle 's house . The show returned to Channel 31 on 6 February 2008 after further negotiations between SBS Deske and Kanidiadis about a possible restructuring of the show failed . Production moved to the ABC studios in Southbank in late 2009 and then C31 studios until 2015 . Vasili 's Garden has been broadcast on 7TWO since 2016 growing to a one hour episode .",

  "/wiki/Channel_31_(Australia)": "Community television in Australia ( CTV ) is a form of free-to-air non-commercial citizen media in which a television station is owned , operated and/or programmed by a community group to provide local programming to its broadcast area . In principle , community television is another model of facilitating media production and involvement by private citizens and can be likened to public-access television in the United States and community television in Canada . Each station is a not-for-profit entity and is subject to specific provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 . A Code of Conduct , registered with the Australian Communications and Media Authority , provides additional regulation of the sector . The community television stations operate independently so they are technically not a network ( in the commonly held definition of the term ) . However , some programs are broadcast on multiple stations in the group , and they do co-operate with each other in various ways . The stations act collectively through the Australian Community Television Alliance . Channel 31 is the colloquial name for metropolitan community-licensed television stations throughout Australia . The name originates from UHF 31 , the frequency and channel number reserved for analogue broadcasts by metropolitan community television stations . As of 2010 , all stations are now broadcasting in 576i standard definition on digital channel 44 since their analogue signals were switched off and replaced with digital .",
