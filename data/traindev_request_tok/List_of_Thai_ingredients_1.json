It was published by the Royal Institute of Thailand . It is used in road signs and government publications and is the closest method to a standard of transcription for Thai , but its use , by even the government , is inconsistent . The system is almost identical to the one that is defined by ISO 11940-2 .",

The Thai alphabet itself ( as used to write Thai ) has 44 consonant symbols ( Thai : \u0e1e\u0e22\u0e31\u0e0d\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e30 , phayanchana ) , 16 vowel symbols ( Thai : \u0e2a\u0e23\u0e30 , sara ) that combine into at least 32 vowel forms , and four tone diacritics ( Thai : \u0e27\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13\u0e22\u0e38\u0e01\u0e15\u0e4c or \u0e27\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13\u0e22\u0e38\u0e15 , wannayuk or wannayut ) to create characters mostly representing syllables . Although commonly referred to as the Thai alphabet , the script is in fact not a true alphabet but an abugida , a writing system in which the full characters represent consonants with diacritical marks for vowels ; the absence of a vowel diacritic gives an implied ' a ' or ' o ' . Consonants are written horizontally from left to right , with vowels arranged above , below , to the left , or to the right of the corresponding consonant , or in a combination of positions . Thai has its own set of Thai numerals that are based on the Hindu-Arabic numeral system ( Thai : \u0e40\u0e25\u0e02\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 , lek thai ) , but the standard western Hindu-Arabic numerals ( Thai : \u0e40\u0e25\u0e02\u0e2e\u0e34\u0e19\u0e14\u0e39\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e23\u0e1a\u0e34\u0e01 , lek hindu arabik ) are mainly used except for government documents and the license plates of military vehicles .",
  "/wiki/Long_pepper": "Long pepper ( Piper longum ) , sometimes called Indian long pepper or pipli , is a flowering vine in the family Piperaceae , cultivated for its fruit , which is usually dried and used as a spice and seasoning . Long pepper has a taste similar to , but hotter than , that of its close relative Piper nigrum - from which black , green and white pepper are obtained . The fruit of the pepper consists of many minuscule fruits - each about the size of a poppy seed - embedded in the surface of a flower spike that closely resembles a hazel tree catkin . Like Piper nigrum , the fruits contain the alkaloid piperine , which contributes to their pungency . Another species of long pepper , Piper retrofractum , is native to Java , Indonesia . The fruits of this plant are often confused with chili peppers , which belong to the genus Capsicum , originally from the Americas .",

The cultural development of the Northern Thai people had begun long before as successive kingdoms preceded Lan Na . As a continuation of the kingdom of Ngoenyang , Lan Na emerged strong enough in the 15th century to rival the Ayutthaya Kingdom , with whom wars were fought . However , the Lanna Kingdom was weakened and became a tributary state of the Taungoo Dynasty in 1558 . Lan Na was ruled by successive vassal kings , though some enjoyed autonomy . The Burmese rule gradually withdrew but then resumed as the new Konbaung Dynasty expanded its influence . In 1775 , Lan Na chiefs left the Burmese control to join Siam , leading to the Burmese-Siamese War ( 1775-76 ) . Following the retreat of the Burmese force , the Burmese control over Lan Na came to the end . Siam , under King Taksin of the Thonburi Kingdom gained control of Lan Na in 1776 . The kings of Lan Na states remained faithful to the Chakri Dynasty of Siam who provided them with protection against Burma .",
