  "/wiki/Addaura": "The Addaura cave ( Italian : Grotta dell'Addaura ) is a complex of three natural grottoes located on the northeast side of Mount Pellegrino in Palermo , Sicily , southern Italy . The importance of the complex is due to the presence of cave-wall engravings dated to the late Epigravettian ( contemporaneous with the Magdalenian ) and the Mesolithic . On the side of Mount Pellegrino , overlooking Palermo , to the southeast of Mondello beach at 70 metres ( 230 ft ) above sea level , there are some open grottoes and cavities where bones and tools used for hunting have been found , attesting the presence of humans who lived in them beginning in the Paleolithic and into the Mesolithic . The finds are now conserved in Palermo 's Regional Archaeological Museum . Their importance is mainly due to the presence of an extraordinary complex of rock engravings that decorate the walls , constituting a unique case in the panorama of prehistoric cave art . The name Addaura comes from Arabic : \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0631\u0629 al-dawrah , 'the circuit ' .",

The city is noted for its history , culture , architecture and gastronomy , playing an important role throughout much of its existence ; it is over 2,700 years old . Palermo is located in the northwest of the island of Sicily , right by the Gulf of Palermo in the Tyrrhenian Sea . The city was founded in 734 BC by the Phoenicians as Ziz . Palermo then became a possession of Carthage . Two Greek colonies were established , known collectively as Panormos or All-Port ; the Carthaginians used this name on their coins after the 5th century BC . As Panormus , the town became part of the Roman Republic and Empire for over a thousand years . From 831 to 1072 the city was under Arab rule during the Emirate of Sicily when the city first became a capital . The Arabs shifted the Greek name into Balarm ( Arabic : \u0628\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0645 ) , the root for Palermo 's present-day name . Following the Norman reconquest , Palermo became the capital of a new kingdom ( from 1130 to 1816 ) , the Kingdom of Sicily and the capital of the Holy Roman Empire under Emperor Frederick II and King Conrad IV . The population of Palermo urban area is estimated by Eurostat to be 855,285 , while its metropolitan area is the fifth most populated in Italy with around 1.2 million people . In the central area , the city has a population of around 676,000 people .",

It is one of the five Italian autonomous regions and is officially referred to as Regione Siciliana . Sicily is located in the central Mediterranean Sea , south of the Italian Peninsula , from which it is separated by the narrow Strait of Messina . Its most prominent landmark is Mount Etna , the tallest active volcano in Europe , and one of the most active in the world , currently 3,329 m ( 10,922 ft ) high . The island has a typical Mediterranean climate . The earliest archaeological evidence of human activity on the island dates from as early as 12,000 BC . By around 750 BC , Sicily had three Phoenician and a dozen Greek colonies and it was later the site of the Sicilian Wars and the Punic Wars . After the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD , Sicily was ruled during the Early Middle Ages by the Vandals , the Ostrogoths , the Byzantine Empire , and the Emirate of Sicily . The Norman conquest of southern Italy led to the creation of the Kingdom of Sicily , which was subsequently ruled by the Hohenstaufen , the Capetian House of Anjou , Spain , and the House of Habsburg . It was unified under the House of Bourbon with the Kingdom of Naples as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies . It became part of Italy in 1860 following the Expedition of the Thousand , a revolt led by Giuseppe Garibaldi during the Italian unification , and a plebiscite . Sicily was given special status as an autonomous region on 15 May 1946 , 18 days before the Italian constitutional referendum of 1946 .",

Since the island was finding itself disconnected from Byzantium 's scope of territorial influence , the Sardinians provided themselves with a self-ruling political organization , leading to the birth of the four Judicates . As the Italian maritime republics of Pisa and Genoa struggled to exercise increasing political interference upon the indigenous states , the Crown of Aragon subsumed the island as the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1324 .",
