Financed by the BBC , the radio series was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 , with the initial two television series premiering on BBC 3 and the fourth and final series on BBC 1 .

Each sketch was introduced by a voice-over narration ( Tom Baker ) suggesting that the programme was a guide - aimed at non-British people - to British society . Despite the narrator 's description of great British institutions , the comedy arises from the British audience 's self-deprecating understanding of either themselves or of people known to them . Recurring characters included Andy Pipkin , who falsely presented himself as being wheelchair bound to gain the attention of his carer , Lou Todd ; Daffyd Thomas , who claims to be the only gay in the village despite much evidence to the contrary ; and Vicky Pollard , presented as a working-class chav engaging in anti-social behaviour . The programme 's title is an amalgamation of the terms Little England and Great Britain . The programme 's title is in part an elaboration of the term Little England ( er ) : a reference to narrow-mindedness and complacent insularity - as exhibited , to humorous effect , by many of the ( recurring ) subjects of the sketches . The programme was a huge ratings success , receiving 9.5 million viewers following its move to BBC One in 2005 .
