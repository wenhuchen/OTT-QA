In the early 1960s the Reverend Teddy Boston became rector of All Saints ' Church , Cadeby .

In 1962 he purchased Pixie , a W.G . Bagnall 0-4-0ST from the Cranford quarry . The quarry owners donated a short length of track and two wagons and the Cadeby Light Railway was opened . Over the years , Boston built an extensive collection of ex-industrial narrow-gauge rolling stock which ran on the extremely short line in his garden . He also maintained an extensive OO gauge model railway at Cadeby . Although Boston died in 1986 , his widow Audrey kept the railway open for nearly twenty years , holding regular open days .

  "/wiki/British_Rail": "British Railways ( BR ) , which from 1965 traded as British Rail , was the state-owned company that operated most of the overground rail transport in Great Britain between 1948 and 1997 . It was formed from the nationalisation of the Big Four British railway companies and lasted until the gradual privatisation of British Rail , in stages between 1994 and 1997 . Originally a trading brand of the Railway Executive of the British Transport Commission , it became an independent statutory corporation in 1962 designated as the British Railways Board . The period of nationalisation saw sweeping changes in the national railway network . A process of dieselisation and electrification took place , and by 1968 steam locomotion had been entirely replaced by diesel and electric traction , except for the Vale of Rheidol Railway ( a narrow-gauge tourist line ) . Passengers replaced freight as the main source of business , and one third of the network was closed by the Beeching Axe of the 1960s in an effort to reduce rail subsidies . On privatisation , responsibility for track , signalling and stations was transferred to Railtrack ( which was later brought under public control as Network Rail ) and that for trains to the train operating companies . The British Rail double arrow logo is formed of two interlocked arrows showing the direction of travel on a double track railway and was nicknamed the arrow of indecision . It is now employed as a generic symbol on street signs in Great Britain denoting railway stations , and as part of the Rail Delivery Group 's ( RDG ) jointly-managed National Rail brand is still printed on railway tickets .",
