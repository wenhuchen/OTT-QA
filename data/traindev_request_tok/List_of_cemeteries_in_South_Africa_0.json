  "/wiki/Paul_Kruger": "Stephanus Johannes Paulus Paul Kruger ( Afrikaans pronunciation : [ \u02c8kr\u0153\u03c7\u0259r ] ; 10 October 1825 - 14 July 1904 ) was a South African politician . He was one of the dominant political and military figures in 19th-century South Africa , and President of the South African Republic ( or Transvaal ) from 1883 to 1900 . Nicknamed Oom Paul ( Uncle Paul ) , he came to international prominence as the face of the Boer cause - that of the Transvaal and its neighbour the Orange Free State - against Britain during the Second Boer War of 1899-1902 . He has been called a personification of Afrikanerdom , and remains a controversial and divisive figure ; admirers venerate him as a tragic folk hero , and critics view him as the obstinate guardian of an alledgedly unjust cause . Born near the eastern edge of the Cape Colony , Kruger took part in the Great Trek as a child during the late 1830s . He had almost no education apart from the Bible , and through his interpretation believed the Earth was flat . A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the Voortrekker leader Andries Pretorius , he witnessed the signing of the Sand River Convention with Britain in 1852 and over the next decade played a prominent role in the forging of the South African Republic , leading its commandos and resolving disputes between the rival Boer leaders and factions . In 1863 he was elected Commandant-General , a post he held for a decade before he resigned soon after the election of President Thomas Fran\u00e7ois Burgers . Kruger was appointed Vice-President in March 1877 , shortly before the South African Republic was annexed by Britain as the Transvaal . Over the next three years he headed two deputations to London to try to have this overturned . He became the leading figure in the movement to restore the South African Republic 's independence , culminating in the Boers ' victory in the First Boer War of 1880-81 . Kruger served until 1883 as a member of an executive triumvirate , then was elected President .",

  "/wiki/Hendrik_Verwoerd": "Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd ( [ f\u0259\u02c8vu\u02d0rt ] ; 8 September 1901 - 6 September 1966 ) was a Dutch-born South African politician , sociologist and journalist . As leader of South Africa 's National Party he served as the last prime minister of the Union of South Africa from 1958 until 1961 . In 1961 he proclaimed the founding of the Republic of South Africa , and continued as its prime minister from 1961 until his assassination in 1966 by Dimitri Tsafendas . Verwoerd was an authoritarian , socially conservative leader and an Afrikaner nationalist . His goal in founding the Republic of South Africa , thereby leaving the Commonwealth of Nations , was to preserve minority rule by white Afrikaners over the various non-white ethnic groups , including Bantu , Khoisan , Coloured and Indian people , who were the majority of South Africa 's population . To that end , he greatly expanded apartheid , the system of forced classification and segregation by race that existed in South Africa from 1948 to 1994 . [ citation needed ] Verwoerd characterised apartheid as merely good-neighbourliness , but its practical effects have been widely condemned , then and since , as a form of racism . Decisions that Prime Minister Verwoerd made in the areas of legislation , law enforcement and public policy caused almost the entire non-white population of South Africa to be disenfranchised , lose civil rights , and suffer from discrimination based on skin color . Verwoerd heavily repressed the Anti-Apartheid Movement , ordering the detention and imprisonment of tens of thousands of people and the exile of further thousands , while greatly empowering , modernising and enlarging the security forces and army . [ dubious - discuss ] Black-dominated political organisations such as the African National Congress and the Pan Africanist Congress were banned under Verwoerd , and future-president of South Africa , Nelson Mandela , were prosecuted for sabotage in the Rivonia Trial . Although apartheid existed before Verwoerd took office , his efforts to place it on a firmer legal and theoretical footing , in particular his opposition to even the limited form of integration known as baasskap , have led him to be dubbed the Architect of Apartheid . These actions prompted the passing of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1761 , condemning apartheid , and ultimately leading to international isolation and economic sanctions against South Africa .",

Initial Boer attacks were successful , and although British reinforcements later reversed these , the war continued for years with Boer guerrilla warfare , until harsh British counter-measures brought the Boers to terms . The war started with the British overconfident and under-prepared . The Boers were well armed and struck first , besieging Ladysmith , Kimberley , and Mafeking in early 1900 , and winning important battles at Colenso , Magersfontein and Stormberg . Staggered , the British brought in large numbers of soldiers and fought back . General Redvers Buller was replaced by Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener . They relieved the three besieged cities , and invaded the two Boer republics in late 1900 . The onward marches of the British Army , well over 400,000 men , were so overwhelming that the Boers did not fight staged battles in defence of their homeland . The British army seized control of all of the Orange Free State and Transvaal , as the civilian leadership went into hiding or exile . In conventional terms , the war was over . The British officially annexed the two countries in 1900 .",

Founded on 8 January 1912 by John Langalibalele Dube in Bloemfontein as the South African Native National Congress ( SANNC ) , its primary mission was to bring all Africans together as one people , to defend their rights and freedoms . This included giving full voting rights to black South Africans and mixed-race South Africans and , from 1948 onwards , to end the system of apartheid introduced by the Nationalist Party government after their election ( by White voters only ) in that year . The ANC originally attempted to use non-violent protests to end apartheid ; however , the Sharpeville massacre in March 1960 , in which 69 black Africans were shot and killed by police and hundreds wounded during a peaceful protest , contributed to deteriorating relations with the South African government . On 8 April 1960 , the administration of Charles Robberts Swart banned the ANC in South Africa . After the ban , the ANC formed the Umkhonto we Sizwe ( Spear of the Nation ) to fight against apartheid utilising guerrilla warfare and sabotage . After 30 years of exiled struggle , during which many ANC members had been imprisoned or forced abroad , the country began its move towards full democracy . On 3 February 1990 , State President F. W. de Klerk lifted the ban on the ANC and released Nelson Mandela from prison on 11 February 1990 .
