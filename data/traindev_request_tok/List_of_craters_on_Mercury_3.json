  "/wiki/Impact_crater": "An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet , moon , or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere , formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body . In contrast to volcanic craters , which result from explosion or internal collapse , impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain . Impact craters range from small , simple , bowl-shaped depressions to large , complex , multi-ringed impact basins . Meteor Crater is a well-known example of a small impact crater on Earth . Impact craters are the dominant geographic features on many solid Solar System objects including the Moon , Mercury , Callisto , Ganymede and most small moons and asteroids . On other planets and moons that experience more active surface geological processes , such as Earth , Venus , Mars , Europa , Io and Titan , visible impact craters are less common because they become eroded , buried or transformed by tectonics over time . Where such processes have destroyed most of the original crater topography , the terms impact structure or astrobleme are more commonly used . In early literature , before the significance of impact cratering was widely recognised , the terms cryptoexplosion or cryptovolcanic structure were often used to describe what are now recognised as impact-related features on Earth . The cratering records of very old surfaces , such as Mercury , the Moon , and the southern highlands of Mars , record a period of intense early bombardment in the inner Solar System around 3.9 billion years ago . The rate of crater production on Earth has since been considerably lower , but it is appreciable nonetheless ; Earth experiences from one to three impacts large enough to produce a 20-kilometre-diameter ( 12 mi ) crater about once every million years on average . This indicates that there should be far more relatively young craters on the planet than have been discovered so far . The cratering rate in the inner solar system fluctuates as a consequence of collisions in the asteroid belt that create a family of fragments that are often sent cascading into the inner solar system .",
  "/wiki/Diameter": "In geometry , a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle . It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle . Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere . In more modern usage , the length of a diameter is also called the diameter . In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter ( which refers to the line segment itself ) , because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length , this being twice the radius r .",

In the 1780s his cerebral brand of history painting marked a change in taste away from Rococo frivolity toward classical austerity and severity and heightened feeling , harmonizing with the moral climate of the final years of the Ancien R\u00e9gime . David later became an active supporter of the French Revolution and friend of Maximilien Robespierre ( 1758-1794 ) , and was effectively a dictator of the arts under the French Republic . Imprisoned after Robespierre 's fall from power , he aligned himself with yet another political regime upon his release : that of Napoleon , The First Consul of France . At this time he developed his Empire style , notable for its use of warm Venetian colours . After Napoleon 's fall from Imperial power and the Bourbon revival , David exiled himself to Brussels , then in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands , where he remained until his death .

  "/wiki/De_Graft_(crater)": "Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System . Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 days , the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System . It is named after the Roman deity Mercury , the messenger of the gods . Like Venus , Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth 's orbit as an inferior planet , and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28\u00b0 . This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or eastern horizon before sunrise , usually in twilight . At this time , it may appear as a bright star-like object , but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus . The planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases , similar to Venus and the Moon , as it moves in its inner orbit relative to Earth , which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days . Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System . It is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance , meaning that relative to the fixed stars , it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun . [ a ] As seen from the Sun , in a frame of reference that rotates with the orbital motion , it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years . An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian years . Mercury 's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System 's planets ( about \u200b1\u204430 degree ) .",

He is sometimes seen as the first Impressionist composer , although he vigorously rejected the term . He was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Born to a family of modest means and little cultural involvement , Debussy showed enough musical talent to be admitted at the age of ten to France 's leading music college , the Conservatoire de Paris . He originally studied the piano , but found his vocation in innovative composition , despite the disapproval of the Conservatoire 's conservative professors . He took many years to develop his mature style , and was nearly 40 when he achieved international fame in 1902 with the only opera he completed , Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande . Debussy 's orchestral works include Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune ( 1894 ) , Nocturnes ( 1897-1899 ) and Images ( 1905-1912 ) . His music was to a considerable extent a reaction against Wagner and the German musical tradition . He regarded the classical symphony as obsolete and sought an alternative in his symphonic sketches , La mer ( 1903-1905 ) . His piano works include two books of Pr\u00e9ludes and two of \u00c9tudes . Throughout his career he wrote m\u00e9lodies based on a wide variety of poetry , including his own . He was greatly influenced by the Symbolist poetic movement of the later 19th century .",

Degas also produced bronze sculptures , prints , and drawings . Degas is especially identified with the subject of dance ; more than half of his works depict dancers . Although Degas is regarded as one of the founders of Impressionism , he rejected the term , preferring to be called a realist , and did not paint outdoors as many Impressionists did . Degas was a superb draftsman , and particularly masterly in depicting movement , as can be seen in his rendition of dancers and bathing female nudes . In addition to ballet dancers and bathing women , Degas painted race horses and racing jockeys , as well as portraits . His portraits are notable for their psychological complexity and for their portrayal of human isolation . At the beginning of his career , Degas wanted to be a history painter , a calling for which he was well prepared by his rigorous academic training and close study of classical art . In his early thirties , he changed course , and by bringing the traditional methods of a history painter to bear on contemporary subject matter , he became a classical painter of modern life .",

As a painter and muralist , Delacroix 's use of expressive brushstrokes and his study of the optical effects of colour profoundly shaped the work of the Impressionists , while his passion for the exotic inspired the artists of the Symbolist movement . A fine lithographer , Delacroix illustrated various works of William Shakespeare , the Scottish author Walter Scott and the German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe . In contrast to the Neoclassical perfectionism of his chief rival Ingres , Delacroix took for his inspiration the art of Rubens and painters of the Venetian Renaissance , with an attendant emphasis on colour and movement rather than clarity of outline and carefully modelled form . Dramatic and romantic content characterized the central themes of his maturity , and led him not to the classical models of Greek and Roman art , but to travel in North Africa , in search of the exotic . Friend and spiritual heir to Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault , Delacroix was also inspired by Lord Byron , with whom he shared a strong identification with the forces of the sublime , of nature in often violent action . However , Delacroix was given to neither sentimentality nor bombast , and his Romanticism was that of an individualist . In the words of Baudelaire , Delacroix was passionately in love with passion , but coldly determined to express passion as clearly as possible . Together with Ingres , Delacroix is considered one of the last old Masters of painting , and one of the few who was ever photographed .",

His motet Illibata Dei virgo nutrix includes an acrostic of his name , where he spelled it Josquin des Prez . He was the most famous European composer between Guillaume Dufay and Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina , and is usually considered to be the central figure of the Franco-Flemish School . Josquin is widely considered by music scholars to be the first master of the high Renaissance style of polyphonic vocal music that was emerging during his lifetime . During the 16th century , Josquin gradually acquired the reputation as the greatest composer of the age , his mastery of technique and expression universally imitated and admired . Writers as diverse as Baldassare Castiglione and Martin Luther wrote about his reputation and fame , with Luther declaring that he is the master of the notes . They must do as he wills ; as for the other composers , they have to do as the notes will . Theorists such as Heinrich Glarean and Gioseffo Zarlino held his style as that best representing perfection . He was so admired that many anonymous compositions were attributed to him by copyists , probably to increase their sales . More than 370 works are attributed to him ; it was only after the advent of modern analytical scholarship that some of these attributions were challenged , and revealed as mistaken , on the basis of stylistic features and manuscript evidence .

His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime , and by the 20th century , critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius . His novels and short stories are still widely read today . Born in Portsmouth , Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors ' prison . Despite his lack of formal education , he edited a weekly journal for 20 years , wrote 15 novels , five novellas , hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles , lectured and performed readings extensively , was an indefatigable letter writer , and campaigned vigorously for children 's rights , education , and other social reforms .
