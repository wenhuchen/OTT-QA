Historically part of Lancashire , it was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1867 and merged with Dalton-in-Furness Urban District in 1974 to form the Borough of Barrow-in-Furness . At the tip of the Furness peninsula , close to the Lake District , it is bordered by Morecambe Bay , the Duddon Estuary and the Irish Sea . In 2011 , Barrow 's population was 57,000 , making it the second largest urban area in Cumbria after Carlisle , although it is geographically closer to the whole of Lancashire and most of Merseyside . Natives of Barrow , as well as the local dialect , are known as Barrovian . In the Middle Ages , Barrow was a small hamlet within the parish of Dalton-in-Furness with Furness Abbey , now on the outskirts of the modern-day town , controlling the local economy before its dissolution in 1537 . The iron prospector Henry Schneider arrived in Furness in 1839 and , with other investors , opened the Furness Railway in 1846 to transport iron ore and slate from local mines to the coast . Further hematite deposits were discovered , of sufficient size to develop factories for smelting and exporting steel . For a period of the late 19th century , the Barrow Hematite Steel Company-owned steelworks was the world 's largest . Barrow 's location and the availability of steel allowed the town to develop into a significant producer of naval vessels , a shift that was accelerated during World War I and the local yard 's specialisation in submarines . The original iron- and steel-making enterprises closed down after World War II , leaving Vickers shipyard as Barrow 's main industry and employer . Several Royal Navy flagships , the vast majority of its nuclear submarines as well as numerous other naval vessels , ocean liners and oil tankers have been manufactured at the facility .",

  "/wiki/Canterbury": "Canterbury ( /\u02c8k\u00e6nt\u0259rb\u0259ri/ ( listen ) , /-b\u025bri/ ) is a historic English cathedral city and UNESCO World Heritage Site , situated in the heart of the City of Canterbury , a local government district of Kent , England . It lies on the River Stour . The Archbishop of Canterbury is the primate of the Church of England and the worldwide Anglican Communion owing to the importance of St Augustine , who served as the apostle to the pagan Kingdom of Kent around the turn of the 7th century . The city 's cathedral became a major focus of pilgrimage following the 1170 martyrdom of Thomas Becket , although it had already been a well-trodden pilgrim destination since the murder of St Alphege by the men of King Canute in 1012 . A journey of pilgrims to Becket 's shrine served as the frame for Geoffrey Chaucer 's 14th century classic The Canterbury Tales . Canterbury is a popular tourist destination : consistently one of the most-visited cities in the United Kingdom , the city 's economy is heavily reliant upon tourism . The city has been occupied since Paleolithic times and served as the capital of the Celtic Cantiaci and Jute Kingdom of Kent . Many historical structures fill the area , including a city wall founded in Roman times and rebuilt in the 14th century , the ruins of St Augustine 's Abbey and a Norman castle , and the oldest extant school in the world , the King 's School . Modern additions include the Marlowe Theatre and the St Lawrence Ground , home of the Kent County Cricket Club . There is also a substantial student population , brought about by the presence of the University of Kent , Canterbury Christ Church University , the University for the Creative Arts , and the Girne American University Canterbury campus . Canterbury remains , however , a small city in terms of geographical size and population , when compared with other British cities .",

Ten years later , at the 2011 census , the city 's population had risen to 75,306 , with 107,524 in the wider city . The early history of Carlisle is marked by its status as a Roman settlement , established to serve the forts on Hadrian 's Wall . During the Middle Ages , because of its proximity to the Kingdom of Scotland , Carlisle became an important military stronghold ; Carlisle Castle , still relatively intact , was built in 1092 by William Rufus , and once served as a prison for Mary , Queen of Scots . The castle now houses the Duke of Lancaster 's Regiment and the Border Regiment Museum . In the early 12th century , Henry I allowed the foundation of a priory in Carlisle . The town gained the status of a city when its diocese was formed in 1133 , and the priory became Carlisle Cathedral . The introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution began a process of socioeconomic transformation in Carlisle , which developed into a densely populated mill town . This , combined with its strategic position , allowed for the development of Carlisle as an important railway town , with seven railway companies sharing Carlisle railway station .",
