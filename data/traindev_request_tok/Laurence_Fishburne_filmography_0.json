It stars Marlon Brando , Robert Duvall , Martin Sheen , Frederic Forrest , Albert Hall , Sam Bottoms , Laurence Fishburne , Harrison Ford , and Dennis Hopper . The screenplay , co-written by Coppola and John Milius and narration written by Michael Herr , was loosely based on the 1899 novella Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad . The setting was changed from late 19th-century Congo to the Vietnam War . The film follows a river journey from South Vietnam into Cambodia undertaken by Captain Benjamin L. Willard ( a character based on Conrad 's Marlow and played by Sheen ) , who is on a secret mission to assassinate Colonel Kurtz ( Brando , with the character being based on Conrad 's Mr. Kurtz ) , a renegade Army Special Forces officer accused of murder and who is presumed insane . Milius became interested in adapting Heart of Darkness for a Vietnam War setting , and initially began developing the film with Coppola as producer and George Lucas as director . After Lucas became unavailable , Coppola took over directoral control , and was influenced by Werner Herzog 's Aguirre , the Wrath of God ( 1972 ) in his approach to the material . Initially set to be a five-month shoot , the film became noted for the problems encountered while making it for over a year , as chronicled in the documentary Hearts of Darkness : A Filmmaker 's Apocalypse ( 1991 ) . These problems included Brando arriving on the set overweight and completely unprepared , expensive sets being destroyed by severe weather and Sheen having a breakdown and suffering a near-fatal heart attack while on location . Problems continued after production as the release was postponed several times while Coppola edited over a million feet of film . Apocalypse Now was honored with the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival , where it premiered unfinished before it was finally released on August 15 , 1979 , by United Artists . The film performed well at the box office , grossing $ 78 million domestically and going on to gross over $ 150 million worldwide .",
