In 1835 , the surveyor John O'Donovan referred to Rathmullan as the capital of Fanad , and he also refers to Clondavaddog as the most northern parish of Fanaid , suggesting that Fanad included parishes other than Clondavaddog . O'Donovan also noted that The inhabitants of Inishowen state that Fanaid extends from Rathmeltan to Mulroy Lough , but the natives of the Parishes of Killygarvan , Tully and Aughnish , who considered themselves civilised , deny that they themselves are of the men of Fanaid .
