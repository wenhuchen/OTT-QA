The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force ( JMSDF ) was formed circa 1952-1954 after the dissolution of the IJN . The Imperial Japanese Navy was the third largest navy in the world by 1920 , behind the Royal Navy and the United States Navy ( USN ) . It was supported by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service for aircraft and airstrike operation from the fleet . It was the primary opponent of the Western Allies in the Pacific War . The origins of the Imperial Japanese Navy go back to early interactions with nations on the Asian continent , beginning in the early medieval period and reaching a peak of activity during the 16th and 17th centuries at a time of cultural exchange with European powers during the Age of Discovery . After two centuries of stagnation during the country 's ensuing seclusion policy under the sh\u014dgun of the Edo period , Japan 's navy was comparatively backward when the country was forced open to trade by American intervention in 1854 . This eventually led to the Meiji Restoration . Accompanying the re-ascendance of the Emperor came a period of frantic modernization and industrialization . The navy had several successes , sometimes against much more powerful enemies such as in the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War , before being largely destroyed in World War II .",

The Allies gave the G4M the reporting name Betty . Japanese Navy pilots called it Hamaki ( \u8449\u5dfb , cigar , lit . leaf roll ) due to its cylindrical shape . The G4M had very good performance , especially in operational range ; this was achieved by its structural lightness and an almost total lack of protection for the crew , with no armor plating or self-sealing fuel tanks . These omissions proved to be the aircraft 's weakness when confronted with American fighter aircraft during the Pacific War .",
