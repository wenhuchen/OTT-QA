  "/wiki/Pitcher": "In baseball , the pitcher is the player who throws the baseball from the pitcher 's mound toward the catcher to begin each play , with the goal of retiring a batter , who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the pitcher is assigned the number 1 . The pitcher is often considered the most important player on the defensive side of the game , and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum . There are many different types of pitchers , such as the starting pitcher , relief pitcher , middle reliever , lefty specialist , setup man , and the closer . Traditionally , the pitcher also bats . Starting in 1973 with the American League and spreading to further leagues throughout the 1980s and 1990s , the hitting duties of the pitcher have generally been given over to the position of designated hitter , a cause of some controversy . The National League in Major League Baseball and the Japanese Central League are among the remaining leagues that have not adopted the designated hitter position .",
  "/wiki/USC_Trojans_baseball": "The USC Trojans baseball program represents the University of Southern California in college baseball . Established in 1888 , the team is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the Pac-12 Conference . USC home 's field is Dedeaux Field , which is named in honor of former head coach and National College Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Rod Dedeaux . The USC Trojans are one of the most successful programs in the history of college baseball . The Trojans have won more baseball national championships than any other program across all divisions of college baseball . With 12 national championships , USC is far and away the leader in that category ; no other Division I school has more than six . As of June 30 , 2018 , USC also ranked fifth in all-time College World Series ( CWS ) appearances with 21 , trailing only Texas ( 36 ) , Miami ( FL ) ( 25 ) , and Arizona State ( 22 ) , and Florida State ( 22 ) . The Trojans have won more individual CWS games ( 74 ) than any program but Texas ( 85 ) . USC also ranked fourth in all-time NCAA Tournament wins with 173 - trailing only Texas ( 240 ) , Miami ( 192 ) , and Florida State ( 192 ) - and eighth in total NCAA Tournament appearances with 37 . The Trojans have compiled an all-time record of 2,884-1,685-28 ( .630 ) - ranking fifth in all-time wins and 18th in all-time win percentage - and have captured outright or tied for 38 conference championships , as of the end of the 2018 season . USC 's most notable baseball coach was Rod Dedeaux , who coached from 1942 from 1986 and led the school to 11 of its NCAA championships , including five straight from 1970 to 1974 . The first Trojan national championship came in 1948 .",
  "/wiki/Keith_Weber": "Anthony Keith Weber ( April 27 , 1942 - February 18 , 2011 ) was a quarterback and pitcher for the University of Missouri , most notable for holding the NCAA record for career earned run average with a career ERA of 0.56 . As a junior , Weber helped lead Missouri to the 1963 College World Series , where they were eliminated by eventual champion Southern California . In 1964 , Weber earned First-team All-American honors while anchoring a Missouri pitching staff that still holds the NCAA record for lowest single-season team ERA , surrendering just 19 earned runs in 264 innings for an ERA of 0.65 . Weber and Missouri again reached the College World Series , falling to Minnesota in the championship game . In his two trips to the College World Series , Weber pitched 24 1/3 innings while giving up zero earned runs , which remains the most innings pitched by anyone in the College World Series without giving up an earned run . Upon his graduation from Missouri in 1964 , Weber played collegiate summer baseball for the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League , and that October pitched for the United States at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo , Japan . Weber then played a single season of minor league baseball in 1965 with the Williamsport Mets before returning to Missouri to attend law school while working as an assistant football coach under Dan Devine . After a career in real estate , Weber died of kidney cancer on February 18 , 2011 .",

  "/wiki/Catcher": "Catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player . When a batter takes his/her turn to hit , the catcher crouches behind home plate , in front of the ( home ) umpire , and receives the ball from the pitcher . In addition to this primary duty , the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well . The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket , but in cricket , wicketkeepers are increasingly known for their batting abilities . Positioned behind home plate , the catcher can see the whole field , and is therefore in the best position to direct and lead the other players in a defensive play . The catcher typically calls for pitches using hand signals . The calls are based on the pitcher 's mechanics and strengths , as well as the batter 's tendencies and weaknesses . Foul tips , bouncing balls in the dirt , and contact with runners during plays at the plate are all events to be handled by the catcher , necessitating the use of protective equipment . This includes a mask , chest and throat protectors , shin guards , and a heavily padded catcher 's mitt . Because the position requires a comprehensive understanding of the game 's strategies , the pool of former catchers yields a disproportionate number of managers in both Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball , including such prominent examples as Connie Mack , Steve O'Neill , Al L\u00f3pez , Mike Scioscia , and Joe Torre . The physical and mental demands of being involved on every defensive play can wear catchers down over a long season , and can have a negative effect on their offensive output . Because of the strategic defensive importance of catching , if a catcher has exceptional defensive skills , teams are often willing to overlook their relative offensive weaknesses .",

  "/wiki/First_baseman": "First base , or 1B , is the first of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a baserunner to score a run for that player 's team . A first baseman is the player on the team playing defense who fields the area nearest first base , and is responsible for the majority of plays made at that base . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the first baseman is assigned the number 3 . Also called first sacker or cornerman , the first baseman is ideally a tall player who throws left-handed and possesses good flexibility and quick reflexes . Flexibility is needed because the first baseman receives throws from the other infielders , the catcher and the pitcher after they have fielded ground balls . In order for the runner to be called out , the first baseman must be able to stretch towards the throw and catch it before the runner reaches first base . First base is often referred to as the other hot corner - the hot corner being third base - and therefore , like the third baseman , he must have quick reflexes to field the hardest hit balls down the foul line , mainly by left-handed pull hitters and right-handed hitters hitting to the opposite field . They often are power hitters who have a substantial number of home runs and extra base hits while maintaining a .270 plus batting average . [ citation needed ]",

  "/wiki/Second_baseman": "In baseball and softball , second baseman is a fielding position in the infield , between second and first base . The second baseman often possesses quick hands and feet , needs the ability to get rid of the ball quickly , and must be able to make the pivot on a double play . In addition , second basemen are usually right-handed ; only four left-handed throwing players have ever played second base in Major League Baseball since 1950 . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the second baseman is assigned the number 4 . Good second basemen need to have very good range since they have to field balls closer to the first baseman who is often holding runners on , or moving towards the base to cover . On a batted ball to right field , the second baseman goes out towards the ball for the relay . Due to these requirements , second base is sometimes a primarily defensive position in the modern game , but there are hitting stars as well .",

  "/wiki/Third_baseman": "A third baseman , abbreviated 3B , is the player in baseball whose responsibility is to defend the area nearest to third base - the third of four bases a baserunner must touch in succession to score a run . In the scoring system used to record defensive plays , the third baseman is assigned the number ' 5 ' . The third baseman requires good reflexes in reacting to batted balls , as he is often the closest infielder ( roughly 90-120 feet ) to the batter . The third base position requires a strong and accurate arm , as the third baseman often makes long throws to first base . The third baseman sometimes must throw quickly to second base in time to start a double play . The third baseman must also field fly balls in fair and foul territory . Third base is known as the hot corner , because the third baseman is relatively close to the batter and most right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball hard in this direction . A third baseman must possess good hand-eye coordination and quick reactions in order to catch hard line drives sometimes in excess of 125 miles per hour ( 201 km/h ) . Third basemen often must begin in a position even closer to the batter if a bunt is expected , creating a hazard if the ball is instead hit sharply . As with middle infielders , right-handed throwing players are standard at the position because they do not need to turn their body before throwing across the infield to first base . Mike Squires , who played fourteen games at third base in 1982 and 1983 , is a very rare example of a third baseman who threw lefty . Some third basemen have been converted from middle infielders or outfielders because the position does not require them to run as fast .",
  "/wiki/Shortstop": "Shortstop , abbreviated SS , is the baseball or softball fielding position between second and third base , which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions . Historically the position was assigned to defensive specialists who were typically poor at batting and were often placed at the bottom of the batting order . Today shortstops are often able to hit well and many are placed at the top of the lineup . In the numbering system used by scorers to record defensive plays , the shortstop is assigned the number 6 . More hit balls go to the shortstop than to any other position , as there are more right-handed hitters in baseball than left-handed hitters , and most hitters have a tendency to pull the ball slightly . Like a second baseman , a shortstop must be agile , for example when performing a 4-6-3 double play . Also , like a third baseman , the shortstop fields balls hit to the left side of the infield , where a strong arm is needed to throw out a batter-runner before they reach the safety of first base .",

  "/wiki/Outfielder": "An outfielder is a person playing in one of the three defensive positions in baseball or softball , farthest from the batter . These defenders are the left fielder , the center fielder , and the right fielder .

He batted and threw right-handed . Reichardt was a spectacular two-sport star at the University of Wisconsin , twice leading the Big 10 in batting , and starring as a fullback on the 1962 # 2 ranked Badgers Rose Bowl team , which was defeated in the 1963 Rose Bowl by # 1 ranked USC in the comeback that never was where the Badgers scored 23 points in the last 12 minutes , but still lost by 5 points ( 42 to 37 ) . His athletic prowess was highly rated by all Major League Baseball scouts , and when a bidding war ensued for his signing , he received a $ 200,000 ( $ 1,670,217 today ) signing bonus from the Los Angeles Angels , a record for that time . It was the bidding war for Reichardt that ultimately led Major League Baseball to institute a draft , which started in 1965 , with Rick Monday being the first ever # 1 overall selection ( he was drafted by the Kansas City Athletics ) . In 1966 , Reichardt became the first player to hit a home run at Anaheim Stadium . Later that season , after batting .288 with 16 home runs and 44 RBI through just 89 games , he was diagnosed with a kidney ailment that necessitated the removal of the kidney . Although he recovered to hit .265 with 17 home runs in 1967 , and .255 with 21 home runs in 1968 , he was never quite the same after the operation . After hitting only 13 home runs in 1969 , he was traded with Aurelio Rodr\u00edguez to the Washington Senators early in the 1970 season for 3rd baseman Ken McMullen . After a trade to the White Sox in 1971 , he managed to hit .278 with 19 homers . From there , age and injuries took their toll and he never again attained double figures in home runs in a season . He retired after 1 at-bat in the 1974 season .",
