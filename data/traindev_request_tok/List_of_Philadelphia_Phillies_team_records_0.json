  "/wiki/Win\u2013loss_record_(pitching)": "In baseball and softball , a pitcher 's win-loss record ( also referred to simply as their record ) indicates the number of wins ( denoted W ) and losses ( denoted L ) they have been credited with . For example , a 20-10 win-loss record would represent 20 wins and 10 losses . In each game , one pitcher on the winning team is awarded a win ( the winning pitcher ) and one pitcher on the losing team is given a loss ( the losing pitcher ) in their respective statistics . These pitchers are collectively known as the pitchers of record . The designation of win or loss for a pitcher is known as a decision , and only one pitcher for each team receives a decision . A starting pitcher who does not receive credit for a win or loss is said to have no decision . In certain situations , another pitcher on the winning team who pitched in relief of the winning pitcher can be credited with a save , and holds can be awarded to relief pitchers on both sides , but these are never awarded to the same pitcher who is awarded the win . The decisions are awarded by the official scorer of the game in accordance with the league 's rules . The official scorer does not assign a winning or losing pitcher in some games which are forfeited , such as those that are tied at the time of forfeiture . If the game is tied ( a rare event ) , no pitcher is awarded any decision . A pitcher 's winning percentage is calculated by dividing the number of wins by the number of decisions ( wins plus losses ) , and it is commonly expressed with three decimal places .",
  "/wiki/Steve_Carlton": "Steven Norman Carlton ( born December 22 , 1944 ) , is an American former professional baseball player . He played in Major League Baseball as a left-handed pitcher for six different teams from 1965 to 1988 , most notably as a member of the Philadelphia Phillies with whom he won four Cy Young Awards as well as the 1980 World Series . He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994 . Nicknamed Lefty , Carlton has the second-most lifetime strikeouts of any left-handed pitcher ( 4th overall ) , and the second-most lifetime wins of any left-handed pitcher ( 11th overall ) . He was the first pitcher to win four Cy Young Awards in a career . He held the lifetime strikeout record several times between 1982 and 1984 , before his contemporary Nolan Ryan passed him . One of his most remarkable records was accounting for nearly half ( 46% ) of his team 's wins , when he won 27 games for the last-place ( 59-97 ) 1972 Phillies . He is the last National League pitcher to win 25 or more games in one season , as well as the last pitcher from any team to throw more than 300 innings in a season . He also holds the record with the most career balks of any pitcher , with 90 ( double the second on the all-time list , Bob Welch ) .",

  "/wiki/1961_Major_League_Baseball_season": "The 1961 Major League Baseball season was played from April 10 to October 12 , 1961 . That season saw the New York Yankees defeat the Cincinnati Reds in five games in the World Series . The season is best known for Yankee teammates Roger Maris ' and Mickey Mantle 's pursuit of Babe Ruth 's prestigious 34-year-old single-season home run record of 60 . Maris ultimately broke the record when he hit his 61st home run on the final day of the regular season , while Mantle was forced out of the lineup in late-September due to a hip infection and finished with 54 home runs . In response to the proposed Continental League , the American League expanded by two teams in the first MLB expansion since 1901 . The original Washington Senators moved to Minnesota and became the Minnesota Twins . The American League therefore placed a new team in Washington , also called the Senators . Also , the American League placed a team in Los Angeles called the Los Angeles Angels . In order to keep its schedule balanced , the American League season was extended by eight games . Previously , teams had played 154 games ( 22 games per opponent ) , but from 1961 AL teams would play opponents 18 times each for a total of 162 games . The National League played a 154 game schedule for the final time in 1961 before switching to 162 games when they also expanded to ten teams for the following season .",
  "/wiki/Winning_percentage": "In sports , a winning percentage is the fraction of games or matches a team or individual has won . It is defined as wins divided by the total number of matches played ( i.e . wins plus draws plus losses ) . A draw counts as a \u200b1\u20442 win . For example , if a team 's season record is 30 wins and 20 losses , the winning percentage would be 60% or 0.600 . If a team 's season record is 30-15-5 ( i.e . it has won thirty games , lost fifteen and tied five times ) , the five tie games are counted as 2\u200b1\u20442 wins , and so the team has an adjusted record of 32\u200b1\u20442 wins , resulting in a 65% or .650 winning percentage for the fifty total games from",

  "/wiki/Earned_run_average": "In baseball statistics , earned run average ( ERA ) is the average of earned runs given up by a pitcher per nine innings pitched ( i.e . the traditional length of a game ) . It is determined by dividing the number of earned runs allowed by the number of innings pitched and multiplying by nine . Runs resulting from passed balls or defensive errors ( including pitchers ' defensive errors ) are recorded as unearned runs and omitted from ERA calculations .",
  "/wiki/George_McQuillan": "George Watt McQuillan ( May 1 , 1885 - March 30 , 1940 ) , born in Brooklyn , New York , was a pitcher for the Philadelphia Phillies ( 1907-10 and 1915-16 ) , Cincinnati Reds ( 1911 ) , Pittsburgh Pirates ( 1913-15 ) and Cleveland Indians ( 1918 ) . In 1907 he set one of the longest-lived records in major league history when he pitched 25 innings before giving up the first earned run of his career . Although others have pitched more consecutive innings without an earned run , until July 2008 no one had gone longer without prior major league experience . The record stood for 101 years before being broken by Oakland Athletics reliever Brad Ziegler , who extended the record to 39\u200b1\u20443 innings . McQuillan 's extraordinary success as a rookie was no fluke : he posted a 1.69 ERA in his first four seasons , comprising more than 800 innings pitched ; during those years his Adjusted ERA+ ( the ratio of the league 's ERA , adjusted to the pitcher 's ballpark , to that of the pitcher ) was a staggering 164 . In 1910 , he would have led the majors with an Adjusted ERA+ of 195 had he pitched only an additional 1\u200b2\u20443 innings to meet the minimum requirement of 154 innings pitched . McQuillan helped the Phillies win the 1915 National League Pennant . He is still the Philadelphia Phillies Career Leader in ERA ( 1.79 ) , WHIP ( 1.02 ) and Hits Allowed/9IP ( 6.93 ) .

  "/wiki/Save_(baseball)": "In baseball , a save ( abbreviated SV or S ) is credited to a pitcher who finishes a game for the winning team under certain prescribed circumstances . Most commonly a pitcher earns a save by entering in the ninth inning of a game in which his team is winning by three or fewer runs and finishing the game by pitching one inning without losing the lead . The number of saves or percentage of save opportunities successfully converted are oft-cited statistics of relief pitchers , particularly those in the closer role . The save statistic was created by journalist Jerome Holtzman in 1959 to measure the effectiveness of relief pitchers and was adopted as an official MLB statistic in 1969 . The save has been retroactively measured for pitchers before that date . Mariano Rivera is MLB 's all-time leader in regular-season saves with 652 .",

  "/wiki/Strikeout": "In baseball or softball , a strikeout ( or strike-out ) occurs when a batter racks up three strikes during a time at bat . It usually means the batter is out . A strikeout is a statistic recorded for both pitchers and batters , and is denoted by K. A strikeout looking - in which the batter does not swing and the third strike is called by the umpire - is usually denoted by a \ua4d8 . Although a strikeout suggests that the pitcher dominated the batter , the free-swinging style that generates home runs also leaves batters susceptible to striking out . Some of the greatest home run hitters of all time - such as Alex Rodriguez , Reggie Jackson , and Jim Thome - were notorious for striking out .",
  "/wiki/3,000_strikeout_club": "In Major League Baseball ( MLB ) , the 3,000 strikeout club is the group of pitchers who have struck out 3,000 or more batters in their careers . Walter Johnson was the first to reach 3,000 , doing so in 1923 , and was the only pitcher at this milestone for 50 years until Bob Gibson recorded his 3,000th strikeout in 1974 . In total , 18 pitchers have reached 3,000 strikeouts , with Justin Verlander , the most recent club member , joining on September 28 , 2019 . CC Sabathia recently joined Steve Carlton and Randy Johnson as the only left-handed pitchers in this group . Randy Johnson was the quickest pitcher to 3,000 strikeouts , taking fewer games pitched or innings pitched than any other pitcher . C\u00e9sar Ger\u00f3nimo is the only player struck out by two different pitchers for their 3,000th strikeout , first by Gibson in 1974 and then Nolan Ryan in 1980 . The Minnesota Twins were the first of four franchises to see multiple pitchers record their 3,000th strikeout on their roster , first Walter Johnson ( while the franchise was called the Washington Senators ) in 1923 and then Bert Blyleven in 1986 . The Chicago Cubs , New York Yankees , and Houston Astros are the others with Ferguson Jenkins and Greg Maddux for the Cubs , Phil Niekro and Sabathia for the Yankees , and Nolan Ryan and Justin Verlander for the Astros . Ten 3,000 strikeout pitchers are also members of the 300 win club . Seven pitchers from this club were named amongst the one hundred greatest players in MLB history as part of the All-Century Team , four of whom were eventually voted as starters for the team by fan vote . Membership in the 3,000 strikeout club is often described as a guarantee of eventual entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame . Randy Johnson , Pedro Mart\u00ednez , and John Smoltz are the most recently elected individuals , all voted in during 2015 balloting .",
  "/wiki/Shutouts_in_baseball": "In Major League Baseball , a shutout ( denoted statistically as ShO or SHO ) refers to the act by which a single pitcher pitches a complete game and does not allow the opposing team to score a run . If two or more pitchers combine to complete this act , no pitcher is awarded a shutout , although the team itself can be said to have shut out the opposing team . The ultimate single achievement among pitchers is a perfect game , which has been accomplished 23 times in over 135 years , most recently by F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez of the Seattle Mariners on August 15 , 2012 . By definition , a perfect game is counted as a shutout . A no-hitter completed by one pitcher is also a shutout unless the opposing team manages to score through a series of errors , base on balls , catcher 's interferences , dropped third strikes , or hit batsmen . The all-time career leader in shutouts is Walter Johnson , who pitched for the Washington Senators from 1907-1927 . He accumulated 110 shutouts , which is 20 more than the second place leader , Pete Alexander . The most shutouts recorded in one season was 16 , which was a feat accomplished by both Pete Alexander ( 1916 ) and George Bradley ( 1876 ) . These records are considered among the most secure records in baseball , because pitchers today rarely earn more than one or two shutouts per season with a heavy emphasis on pitch count and relief pitching . Complete games themselves have also become rare among starting pitchers . The current leader among active players for career shutouts is Clayton Kershaw , who has thrown 15 .",

  "/wiki/Inning": "An inning in baseball , softball , and similar games is the basic unit of play , consisting of two halves or frames , the top ( first half ) and the bottom ( second half ) . In each half , one team bats until three outs are made , with the other team playing defense . A full baseball game typically is scheduled for nine innings , while softball games consist of seven innings ; although this may be shortened due to weather or extended if the score is tied at the end of the scheduled innings . Inning , in baseball and softball , is always singular , which contrasts with cricket and rounders in which the singular is innings .",
  "/wiki/Games_started": "In baseball statistics , games started ( denoted by GS ) indicates the number of games that a pitcher has started for his team . A pitcher is credited with starting the game if he throws the first pitch to the first opposing batter . If a player is listed in the starting lineup as the team 's pitcher , but is replaced before facing an opposing batter , the player is credited with a game pitched but not a game started ; there have been instances in major league history in which a starting pitcher was removed before his first pitch due to an injury , perhaps suffered while batting or running the bases during the top half of the first inning . The all-time leader for games started is Cy Young with 815 over a 22-year career . The players with the most starts in a single season are Pud Galvin and Will White , each with 75 games started . For position players , games started is also used to denote the number of times their names appear in a team 's starting lineup during the season .",
  "/wiki/Complete_game": "In baseball , a complete game ( denoted by CG ) is the act of a pitcher pitching an entire game without the benefit of a relief pitcher . A pitcher who meets this criterion will be credited with a complete game regardless of the number of innings played - pitchers who throw an entire official game that is shortened by rain will still be credited with a complete game , while starting pitchers who are relieved in extra innings after throwing nine or more innings will not be credited with a complete game . A starting pitcher who is replaced by a pinch hitter in the final half inning of a game will still be credited with a complete game . The frequency of complete games has evolved since the early days of baseball . The complete game was essentially an expectation in the early 20th century and pitchers completed almost all of the games they started . In modern baseball , the feat is much more rare and no pitcher has reached 30 complete games in a season since 1975 ; in the 21st century , a pitcher has thrown 10 or more complete games in a season only twice .",
  "/wiki/Base_on_balls": "A base on balls ( BB ) , also known as a walk , occurs in baseball when a batter receives four pitches that the umpire calls balls , and is in turn awarded first base without the possibility of being called out . The base on balls is defined in Section 2.00 of baseball 's Official Rules , and further detail is given in 6.08 ( a ) . It is , however , considered a faux pas for a professional player to actually walk to first base ; the batter-runner and any advancing runners normally jog on such a play . The term base on balls distinguishes a walk from the other manners in which a batter can be awarded first base without liability to be put out ( e.g. , hit by pitch ( HBP ) , catcher 's interference ) . Though a base on balls , catcher 's interference , or a batter hit by a pitched ball all result in the batter ( and possibly runners on base ) being awarded a base , the term walk usually refers only to a base on balls , and not the other methods of reaching base without the bat touching the ball . An important difference is that for a hit batter or catcher 's interference , the ball is dead and no one may advance unless forced ; the ball is live after a walk ( see below for details ) . A batter who draws a base on balls is commonly said to have been walked by the pitcher . When the batter is walked , runners advance one base without liability to be put out only if forced to vacate their base to allow the batter to take first base . If a batter draws a walk with the bases loaded , all preceding runners are forced to advance , including the runner on third base who is forced to home plate to score a run ; when a run is forced on a walk , the batter is credited with an RBI per rule 10.04 . Receiving a base on balls does not count as a hit or an at bat for a batter but does count as a time on base and a plate appearance . Therefore , a base on balls does not affect a player 's batting average , but it can increase his on-base percentage . A hit by pitch is not counted statistically as a walk , though the effect is mostly the same , with the batter receiving a free pass to first base .",
  "/wiki/Hits_allowed": "In Baseball statistics , hits allowed ( HA ) signifies the total number of hits a pitcher allowed .",
  "/wiki/Wild_pitch": "In baseball , a wild pitch ( WP ) is charged against a pitcher when his pitch is too high , too short , or too wide of home plate for the catcher to control with ordinary effort , thereby allowing a baserunner , perhaps even the batter-runner on an uncaught third strike , to advance . A wild pitch usually passes the catcher behind home plate , often allowing runners on base an easy chance to advance while the catcher chases the ball down . Sometimes the catcher may block a pitch , and the ball may be nearby , but the catcher has trouble finding the ball , allowing runners to advance . A closely related statistic is the passed ball . As with many baseball statistics , whether a pitch that gets away from a catcher is counted as a wild pitch or a passed ball is at the discretion of the official scorer . The benefit of the doubt is usually given to the catcher if there is uncertainty ; therefore , most of these situations are scored as wild pitches . If the pitch was so low as to touch the ground , or so high that the catcher has to jump to get to it , or so wide that the catcher has to lunge for it , it is usually then considered a wild pitch and not a passed ball . Because the pitcher and catcher handle the ball much more than other fielders , certain misplays on pitched balls are defined in Rule 10.13 as wild pitches and passed balls . No error shall be charged when a wild pitch or passed ball is scored .",
  "/wiki/Hit_by_pitch": "In baseball , hit by pitch ( HBP ) is an event in which a batter or his clothing or equipment ( other than his bat ) is struck directly by a pitch from the pitcher ; the batter is called a hit batsman ( HB ) . A hit batsman is awarded first base , provided that ( in the plate umpire 's judgment ) he made an honest effort to avoid the pitch , although failure to do so is rarely called by an umpire . Being hit by a pitch is often caused by a batter standing too close to , or crowding , home plate .",
  "/wiki/Bill_Duggleby": "William James Duggleby ( March 16 , 1874 - August 30 , 1944 ) , nicknamed Frosty Bill , was a pitcher for the Philadelphia Phillies . He played from 1898 to 1907 . He also played two games for the Philadelphia Athletics in 1902 and nine games for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1907 . Duggleby is the first of four major league players to hit a grand slam in his first major league at-bat ; Jeremy Hermida , Kevin Kouzmanoff and Daniel Nava are the other three . As of 2011 [ update ] , he still holds the Phillies team record for hit batsmen for a career ( 82 ) . Duggleby was one of the jumpers who left the Phillies in 1902 for other teams , including ( in Duggleby 's case ) Connie Mack 's new American League team , the Athletics . The Phillies filed suit to prevent the jumpers - in particular , Nap Lajoie , Bill Bernhard , and Chick Fraser - from playing for any other team , a plea which was rejected by a lower court before being upheld by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court . Duggleby was the first of the jumpers to return to the Phillies , on May 8 , 1902 , after playing only two games with the A 's . He was the manager of the Minor League Baseball team , the Albany Babies , in 1912 . Duggleby , a native of Utica , New York , died in Redfield , New York in 1944 .",
