  "/wiki/Gross_domestic_product": "Gross domestic product ( GDP ) is a monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a specific time period . GDP ( nominal ) per capita does not , however , reflect differences in the cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries ; therefore using a basis of GDP per capita at purchasing power parity ( PPP ) is arguably more useful when comparing living standards between nations , while nominal GDP is more useful comparing national economies on the international market . The OECD defines GDP as an aggregate measure of production equal to the sum of the gross values added of all resident and institutional units engaged in production and services ( plus any taxes , and minus any subsidies , on products not included in the value of their outputs ) . An IMF publication states that , GDP measures the monetary value of final goods and services - that are bought by the final user - produced in a country in a given period of time ( say a quarter or a year ) . Total GDP can also be broken down into the contribution of each industry or sector of the economy . The ratio of GDP to the total population of the region is the per capita GDP and the same is called Mean Standard of Living . GDP is considered the world 's most powerful statistical indicator of national development and progress .",

  "/wiki/USD": "The United States dollar ( sign : $ ; code : USD ; also abbreviated US $ and referred to as the dollar , U.S. dollar , or American dollar ) is the official currency of the United States and its territories per the Coinage Act of 1792 . One dollar is divided into 100 cents ( Symbol : \u00a2 ) or 1000 mills ( for accounting purposes and for taxing . Symbol : \u20a5 ) . The Coinage Act of 1792 created a decimal currency by creating the following coins : tenth dollar , one-twentieth dollar , one-hundredth dollar . In addition the act created the dollar , half dollar , and quarter dollar coins . All of these coins are still minted in 2020 . In addition , several forms of paper money were introduced by Congress over the years . The latest of these , the Federal Reserve Note , was authorized by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , while all existing U.S. currency remains legal tender . Issuance of the previous form of the currency ( U.S. notes ) was discontinued in January 1971 . As a result , currently circulating paper money consists primarily of Federal Reserve Notes that are denominated in United States dollars ( 12 U.S.C . \u00a7 418 ) . Since the suspension in 1971 of convertibility of paper U.S. currency into any precious metal , the U.S. dollar is de facto fiat money .",
  "/wiki/Greater_Mexico_City": "Greater Mexico City refers to the conurbation around Mexico City , officially called Mexico City Metropolitan Area ( Zona Metropolitana de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico ) , constituted by Mexico City itself composed of 16 Municipalities - and 41 adjacent municipalities of the states of Mexico and Hidalgo .

As of 2016 [ update ] an estimated 21,157,000 people lived in Greater Mexico City , making it the second largest metropolitan area in North America . It is surrounded by thin strips of highlands which separate it from other adjacent metropolitan areas , of which the biggest are Puebla , Toluca , and Cuernavaca-Cuautla , and together with which it makes up the Mexico City megalopolis . Since the 1940s there have been different proposals to establish the limits of the growing conurbation of Mexico City , and different definitions were used unofficially as the city continued to grow . The Federal Government ( represented by the Department of Social Development ) , the government of Mexico City , and the government of the State of Mexico agreed on the official definitions for both the Mexico City Metropolitan Area and the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico on December 22 , 2005 . Per the agreement , most urban planning projects will be administered by Metropolitan Commissions . On January 29 , 2016 , Mexico City proper was no longer called the Federal District ( Spanish : Distrito Federal or D.F. ) . It is now in transition to become the country 's 32nd federal entity , officially Mexico City ( Spanish : Ciudad de M\u00e9xico , commonly abbreviated as CDMX ) , giving it a level of autonomy comparable to that of a state . Because of a clause in the Mexican Constitution , however , since it is the seat of the powers of the federation , it can never become a state , or the capital of the country has to be relocated . The English name Mexico City remains . Its original 16 Boroughs became municipalities .",

Other metropolises in the country include Guadalajara , Monterrey , Puebla , Toluca , Tijuana , and Le\u00f3n . Pre-Columbian Mexico dates to about 8000 BC and is identified as one of six cradles of civilization and was home to many advanced Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Olmec , Toltec , Teotihuacan , Zapotec , Maya , and Aztec before first contact with Europeans . In 1521 , the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the territory from its politically powerful base in Mexico-Tenochtitlan ( part of Mexico City ) , which was administered as the viceroyalty of New Spain . The Roman Catholic Church played a powerful role in governing the country as millions were converted to the faith , although King Charles III expelled the Jesuits in the 1770s . The territory became a nation state following its recognition in 1821 after the Mexican War of Independence . The post-independence period was tumultuous , characterized by economic inequality and many contrasting political changes .",

Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral , who claimed the area for the Portuguese Empire . Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 , when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro .

Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810-1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city .

At 1.28 million km2 ( 0.5 million mi2 ) , Peru is the 19th largest country in the world , and the third largest in South America . Peruvian territory was home to several ancient cultures . Ranging from the Norte Chico civilization starting in 3500 BC , the oldest civilization in the Americas and one of the five cradles of civilization , to the Inca Empire , the largest state in pre-Columbian America , the territory now including Peru has one of the longest histories of civilization of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 4th millennia BCE .

Throughout the 20th century , Peru endured armed territorial disputes , coups , social unrest , and internal conflicts , as well as periods of stability and economic upswing . Alberto Fujimori was elected to the presidency in 1990 ; his government was credited with economically stabilizing Peru and successfully ending the Shining Path insurgency , though he was widely accused of human rights violations and suppression of political dissent .
