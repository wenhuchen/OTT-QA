  "/wiki/D.W._Griffith": "David Wark Griffith ( January 22 , 1875 - July 23 , 1948 ) was an American film director . Widely considered as the most important filmmaker of his generation , he pioneered the feature-length movie and many enduring cinematic techniques , such as the close-up . His film The Birth of a Nation ( 1915 ) broke box-office records but also attracted much controversy , as it depicted African Americans in a negative light and glorified the Ku Klux Klan . Intolerance ( 1916 ) was made as an answer to his critics . Several of Griffith 's later films were also successful , including Broken Blossoms ( 1919 ) , Way Down East ( 1920 ) , and Orphans of the Storm ( 1921 ) , but the high costs he incurred for production and promotion often led to commercial failure . He had made roughly 500 films by the time of his final feature , The Struggle ( 1931 ) . Together with Charlie Chaplin , Mary Pickford , and Douglas Fairbanks , he founded United Artists , enabling them to control their own interests , rather than depending on commercial studios . Griffith was a founder member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences .",
  "/wiki/Birth_of_a_Nation": "The Birth of a Nation ( originally called The Clansman ) is an American silent epic drama film directed and co-produced by D. W. Griffith and starring Lillian Gish . The screenplay is adapted from the novel and play The Clansman , by Thomas Dixon Jr. Griffith co-wrote the screenplay with Frank E. Woods and co-produced the film with Harry Aitken . It was released on February 8 , 1915 . The Birth of a Nation is a landmark of film history . It was the first 12-reel film ever made and , at three hours , also the longest up to that point . Its plot , part fiction and part history , chronicling the assassination of Abraham Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth and the relationship of two families in the Civil War and Reconstruction eras over the course of several years - the pro-Union ( Northern ) Stonemans and the pro-Confederacy ( Southern ) Camerons - was by far the most complex of any movie made up to that date . It was originally shown in two parts separated by another movie innovation , an intermission , and it was the first to have a musical score for an orchestra . It pioneered close-ups , fade-outs , and a carefully staged battle sequence with hundreds of extras ( another first ) made to look like thousands . It came with a 13-page Souvenir Program . It was the first American motion picture to be screened in the White House , viewed there by President Woodrow Wilson . The film was controversial even before its release and has remained so ever since ; it has been called the most controversial film ever made in the United States . :198 Lincoln , whom Dixon saw as a Southerner , was portrayed positively , unusual in a Lost Cause environment ."
