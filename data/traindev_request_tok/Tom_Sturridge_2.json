One of his best-known works , it tells the story of Josef K. , a man arrested and prosecuted by a remote , inaccessible authority , with the nature of his crime revealed neither to him nor to the reader . Heavily influenced by Dostoyevsky 's Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov , Kafka even went so far as to call Dostoyevsky a blood relative . Like Kafka 's other novels , The Trial was never completed , although it does include a chapter which appears to bring the story to an intentionally abrupt ending . After Kafka 's death in 1924 his friend and literary executor Max Brod edited the text for publication by Verlag Die Schmiede . The original manuscript is held at the Museum of Modern Literature , Marbach am Neckar , Germany . The first English language translation , by Willa and Edwin Muir , was published in 1937 .
