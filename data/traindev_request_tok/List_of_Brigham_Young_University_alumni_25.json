The first recorded use of the term luge dates to 1905 and derives from the Savoy/Swiss dialect of the French word luge , meaning small coasting sled .",

  "/wiki/Beach_volleyball": "Beach volleyball is a team sport played by two teams of two players on a sand court divided by a net . As in indoor volleyball , the objective of the game is to send the ball over the net and to ground it on the opponent 's side of the court , and to prevent the same effort by the opponent . Each team is allowed up to three touches to return the ball across the net , and individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively except after making a block touch ( the block touch counting as one touch , leaving only two more touches before the ball must be hit over ) . The ball is put in play with a serve - a hit by the server from behind the rear court boundary over the net to the opponents . The rally continues until the ball is grounded on the playing court , goes out , or a fault is made in the attempt to return the ball . The team that wins the rally scores a point and serves to start the following rally . The four players serve in the same sequence throughout the match , changing server each time a rally is won by the receiving team . Beach volleyball most likely originated in 1915 on Waikiki Beach in Hawaii , while the modern two-player game originated in Santa Monica , California . It has been an Olympic sport since the 1996 Summer Olympics .

The first documented use of the term mixed martial arts was in a review of UFC 1 by television critic Howard Rosenberg in 1993 . The term gained popularity when newfullcontact.com , then one of the largest websites covering the sport , hosted and republished the article . The question of who actually coined the term is subject to debate . During the early 20th century , various interstylistic contests took place throughout Japan and in the countries of the Four Asian Tigers . In Brazil , there was the sport of Vale Tudo , in which fighters from various styles fought with little to no rules . The Gracie family was known to promote Vale Tudo matches as a way to promote their own Brazilian jiu-jitsu style . An early high-profile mixed martial arts bout was fought in 1951 , between the judoka Masahiko Kimura and Brazilian jiu-jitsu founder H\u00e9lio Gracie in Brazil . In the West , the concept of combining elements of multiple martial arts was popularized by Bruce Lee 's Jeet Kune Do during the late 1960s to early 1970s . A precursor to modern MMA was the 1976 Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki bout , fought between boxer Muhammad Ali and wrestler Antonio Inoki in Japan , where it later inspired the foundation of Pancrase in 1993 and Pride Fighting Championships in 1997 . In 1980 , CV Productions , Inc. created the first regulated MMA league in the United States , called Tough Guy Contest , which was later renamed Battle of the Superfighters .

It is characterized by the use of quick and powerful strikes delivered from all of the body 's natural weapons , powered by rapid stance transitions , called shifting . Beginners are introduced to basic attack responses , which comprise a larger system taught through scripted scenarios , which allow instructors a platform to share concepts and principles Ed Parker emphasized in his teachings . The purpose of training in this manner is to increase physical coordination and continuity with linear and circular motion . Each movement , when correctly executed , leads into the next , keeping an adversary 's dimensional zone in check , while limiting their ability to retaliate . Should the adversary not react as anticipated , the skilled Kenpo practitioner , it is argued , is able to seamlessly transition into an alternative and appropriate action , drawn spontaneously from the trained subconscious . Founded and codified by Ed Parker , American Kenpo is primarily a self-defense combat system . Parker made significant modifications to the original art of Kenpo which he learned throughout his life , by introducing or changing principles , theories , and concepts of motion , as well as terminology . At the time of his passing in December 1990 , Parker had created Short Form 1 , Long Form 1 , Short Form 2 , Long Form 2 , Short Form 3 , Long Form 3 , Long Form 4 , Long Form 5 ( Surprise Attacks ) , Long Form 6 ( Bare Hands vs . Weapons ) , Long Form 7 ( Twin Clubs ) , and Long Form 8 ( Twin Knives ) .
