  "/wiki/Presbyterian": "Presbyterianism is a part of the Reformed tradition within Protestantism , which traces its origins to Britain , particularly Scotland . Presbyterian churches derive their name from the presbyterian form of church government , which is governed by representative assemblies of elders . A great number of Reformed churches are organized this way , but the word Presbyterian , when capitalized , is often applied uniquely to churches that trace their roots to the Church of Scotland , as well as several English dissenter groups that formed during the English Civil War . Presbyterian theology typically emphasizes the sovereignty of God , the authority of the Scriptures , and the necessity of grace through faith in Christ . Presbyterian church government was ensured in Scotland by the Acts of Union in 1707 , which created the Kingdom of Great Britain . In fact , most Presbyterians found in England can trace a Scottish connection , and the Presbyterian denomination was also taken to North America , mostly by Scots and Scots-Irish immigrants . The Presbyterian denominations in Scotland hold to the Reformed theology of John Calvin and his immediate successors , although there is a range of theological views within contemporary Presbyterianism . Local congregations of churches which use presbyterian polity are governed by sessions made up of representatives of the congregation ( elders ) ; a conciliar approach which is found at other levels of decision-making ( presbytery , synod and general assembly ) . The roots of Presbyterianism lie in the Reformation of the 16th century , the example of John Calvin 's Republic of Geneva being particularly influential . Most Reformed churches that trace their history back to Scotland are either presbyterian or congregationalist in government . In the twentieth century , some Presbyterians played an important role in the ecumenical movement , including the World Council of Churches . Many Presbyterian denominations have found ways of working together with other Reformed denominations and Christians of other traditions , especially in the World Communion of Reformed Churches .",
  "/wiki/Second_Great_Awakening": "The Second Great Awakening was a Protestant religious revival during the early 19th century in the United States . The Second Great Awakening , which spread religion through revivals and emotional preaching , sparked a number of reform movements . Revivals were a key part of the movement and attracted hundreds of converts to new Protestant denominations . The Methodist Church used circuit riders to reach people in frontier locations . The Second Great Awakening led to a period of antebellum social reform and an emphasis on salvation by institutions . The outpouring of religious fervour and revival began in Kentucky and Tennessee in the 1790s and early 1800s among the Presbyterians , Methodists and Baptists . During the period , their American population was rapidly growing that the great leap westward characterised its territorial expansion . The awakening brought comfort in the face of uncertainty as a result of the socio-political changes in America . This movement is typically regarded as less emotionally charged than the First Great Awakening . It led to the founding of several colleges , seminaries and mission societies . The Great Awakening notably altered the religious climate in the American colonies . Ordinary people were encouraged to make a personal connection with God , instead of relying on a minister .",
