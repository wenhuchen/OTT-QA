Education in the colony had been for many years in a pitifully primitive state , but in 1890 a forward step was made by the appointment of an Englishman , J. P. Walton , as inspector of schools . He pointed out how far behind the schools were lagging , and brought about many improvements . But the population was increasing very rapidly , numerous new schools were being built , and it was realized that the system would have to be completely re-organized . With Walton as his first assistant , Jackson set to work with vigor . Jackson had great educational knowledge and first rate executive ability , and the foundations on which future developments could be raised were securely laid . In 1899 a beginning was made with technical education , in the following year school fees were abolished , and in 1901 a college was built for the training of teachers . The designs of the schools , the staffing and equipment , were all greatly improved .",

The college is bordered to the north by Keble Road , to the south by Museum Road , and to the west by Blackhall Road . Keble was established in 1870 , having been built as a monument to John Keble , who had been a leading member of the Oxford Movement which sought to stress the Catholic nature of the Church of England . Consequently , the college 's original teaching focus was primarily theological , although the college now offers a broad range of subjects , reflecting the diversity of degrees offered across the wider university . In the period after the Second World War the trends were towards scientific courses ( proximity to the university science area east of the University Museum influenced this ) . As originally constituted , it was for men only and the fellows were mostly bachelors resident in the college . Like many of Oxford 's men 's colleges , Keble admitted its first mixed-sex cohort in 1979 . It remains distinctive for its still-controversial neo-gothic red-brick buildings designed by William Butterfield . The buildings are also notable for breaking from Oxbridge tradition by arranging rooms along corridors rather than around staircases , in order that the scouts could supervise the comings and goings of visitors . ( Girton College , Cambridge , similarly breaks this tradition . ) Keble is one of the larger colleges of the University of Oxford , with 433 undergraduates and 245 graduate students in 2011/12 .",
