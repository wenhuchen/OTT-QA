  "/wiki/Castillo_de_San_Marcos": "The Castillo de San Marcos ( Spanish for St. Mark 's Castle ) is the oldest masonry fort in the continental United States ; it is located on the western shore of Matanzas Bay in the city of St. Augustine , Florida . The Castillo was designed by the Spanish engineer Ignacio Daza , with construction beginning in 1672 , 107 years after the city 's founding by Spanish Admiral and conquistador Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s , when Florida was part of the Spanish Empire . The fort 's construction was ordered by Governor Francisco de la Guerra y de la Vega after a raid by the English privateer Robert Searles in 1668 that destroyed much of St. Augustine and damaged the existing wooden fort . Work proceeded under the administration of Guerra 's successor , Manuel de Cendoya in 1671 , and the first coquina stones were laid in 1672 . The construction of the core of the current fortress was completed in 1695 , though it would undergo many alterations and renovations over the centuries . When Britain gained control of Florida in 1763 pursuant to the Treaty of Paris , St. Augustine became the capital of British East Florida , and the fort was renamed Fort St. Mark until the Peace of Paris ( 1783 ) when Florida was transferred back to Spain and the fort 's original name restored . In 1819 , Spain signed the Adams-On\u00eds Treaty which ceded Florida to the United States in 1821 ; consequently the fort was designated a United States Army base and renamed Fort Marion , in honor of American Revolutionary War hero Francis Marion . The fort was declared a National Monument in 1924 , and after 251 years of continuous military possession , was deactivated in 1933 . The 20.48-acre ( 8.29 ha ) site was subsequently turned over to the United States National Park Service . In 1942 the original name , Castillo de San Marcos , was restored by an Act of Congress . Castillo de San Marcos was attacked several times and twice besieged : first by English colonial forces led by Carolina Colony Governor James Moore in 1702 , and then by English Georgia colonial Governor James Oglethorpe in 1740 , but was never taken by force .
