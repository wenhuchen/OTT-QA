  "/wiki/Baltic_amber": "The Baltic region is home to the largest known deposit of amber , called Baltic amber or succinite . It dates from 44 million years ago ( during the Eocene epoch ) . It has been estimated that these forests created more than 100,000 tons of amber . Today , more than 90% of the world 's amber comes from Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia . It is a major source of income for the region ; the local Kaliningrad Amber Combine extracted 250 tonnes of it in 2014 , 400 tonnes in 2015 . Baltic amber was formerly thought to include amber from the Bitterfeld brown coal mines in Saxony ( Eastern Germany ) . Bitterfeld amber was previously believed to be only 20-22 million years old ( Miocene ) , but a comparison of the animal inclusions in 2003 suggested that it was possibly Baltic amber that was redeposited in a Miocene deposit . Further study of insect taxa in the ambers has shown Bitterfeld amber to be from the same forest as the Baltic amber forest , but separately deposited from a more southerly section , in a similar manner as Rovno amber . Other sources of Baltic amber have been listed as coming from Poland and Russia . Because Baltic amber contains from 3 to 8% succinic acid , it is also termed succinite .",
  "/wiki/Europe": "Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere . It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north , the Atlantic Ocean to the west , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , and Asia to the east . The eastern border comprises a long and mixed line of mountain ranges and waterways that would normally define a subcontinent . However , Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition . It is the 6th largest continent in the world . Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains , the Ural River , the Caspian and Black Seas and the waterways of the Turkish Straits . Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres ( 3,930,000 sq mi ) , or 2% of the Earth 's surface ( 6.8% of land area ) . Politically , Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which Russia is the largest and most populous , spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population . Europe had a total population of about 741 million ( about 11% of the world population ) as of 2018 [ update ] . The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent , even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe . Further from the sea , seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast . Europe , in particular ancient Greece and ancient Rome , was the birthplace of Western civilisation .",

Bolton raised the tribe to subfamily status in 2003 , suggesting that Agroecomyrmecinae might be the sister taxon to Myrmicinae . It has since been discovered to be one of the earliest lineages of ants , a clade from the basal polytomy for all ants . In 2014 , the subfamily was expanded to two tribes . The tribe Ankylomyrmini was moved from the subfamily Myrmicinae to Agroemyrmecinae .",
  "/wiki/Ant": "Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and , along with the related wasps and bees , belong to the order Hymenoptera . Ants appear suddenly across the globe during the earliest part of the Late Cretaceous , but are already considerably diversified by this time , suggesting an earlier origin . Ants evolved from vespoid wasp ancestors in the Cretaceous period , and diversified after the rise of flowering plants . More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified . They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists . Ants form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy large territories and consist of millions of individuals . Larger colonies consist of various castes of sterile , wingless females , most of which are workers ( ergates ) , as well as soldiers ( dinergates ) and other specialised groups . Nearly all ant colonies also have some fertile males called drones ( aner ) and one or more fertile females called queens ( gynes ) . The colonies are described as superorganisms because the ants appear to operate as a unified entity , collectively working together to support the colony .",

  "/wiki/Snake_fly": "Snakeflies are a group of predatory insects comprising the order Raphidioptera with two extant families : Raphidiidae and Inocelliidae , consisting of roughly 260 species . In the past , the group had a much wider distribution than it does now ; snakeflies are found in temperate regions worldwide but are absent from the tropics and the southern hemisphere . They are a relict group and have been considered living fossils , as species from the early Jurassic period ( 140 million years ago ) closely resemble modern-day species . An adult snakefly resembles a lacewing in appearance but has a notably elongated thorax which , together with the mobile head , gives the group their common name . The body is long and slender and the two pairs of long , membranous wings are prominently veined . Females have a large and sturdy ovipositor which is used to deposit eggs in some concealed location . They are holometabolous insects with a four-stage life cycle consisting of eggs , larvae , pupae and adults . In most species , the larvae develop under the bark of trees . They may take several years before they undergo metamorphosis , requiring a period of chilling before pupation takes place . Both adults and larvae are predators of soft-bodied arthropods .",

Only a single specimen , the holotype , is known , which was collected on July 21 , 1906 from fossil bearing rocks near the Horsefly mine in Horsefly , British Columbia . The genus was named from archi referring to the primitive appearance of the wing characters and Inocellia , the type genus for Inocelliidae , the family the genus was placed in originally . The species name is a combination of oligo in reference to Oligocene , the age the location of the fossil was thought to be , and neura . The holotype consists of a superimposed partial pair of wings , one forewing and one hindwing , thus not allowing for gender identification and body description . The bases and several small areas of the apex and pterostigmal region are missing . The preserved length of 7 millimetres ( 0.28 in ) allows the estimation of a total forewing length between 12 millimetres ( 0.47 in ) and 14 millimetres ( 0.55 in ) .

The behaviour of these ants may have been similar to extant Myrmeciinae ants , such as foraging solitarily for arthropod prey and never leaving pheromone trails to food sources . Avitomyrmex has not been assigned to any tribe , instead generally being regarded as incertae sedis within Myrmeciinae . However , its identity as an ant has been challenged , although it is undoubtedly a hymenopteran insect .",
  "/wiki/McAbee_Fossil_Beds": "The McAbee Fossil Beds is a Heritage Site that protects an Eocene Epoch fossil locality east of Cache Creek , British Columbia , Canada , just north of and visible from Provincial Highway 97 / the Trans-Canada Highway ( Highway 1 ) at 50\u00b047.831\u2032N 121\u00b08.469\u2032W / 50.797183\u00b0N 121.141150\u00b0W / 50.797183 ; -121.141150 . The McAbee Fossil Beds , comprising 548.23 hectares ( 1,354.7 acres ) , were officially designated a Provincial Heritage Site under British Columbia 's Heritage Conservation Act on July 19 , 2012 . The site is part of an old lake bed which was deposited about 52 million years ago and is internationally recognised for the diversity of plant , insect , and fish fossils found there . Similar fossil beds in Eocene lake sediments , also known for their well preserved plant , insect and fish fossils , are found at Driftwood Canyon Provincial Park near Smithers in northern British Columbia , on the Horsefly River near Quesnel in central British Columbia , and at Republic in Washington , United States . The Princeton Chert fossil beds in southern British Columbia are also Eocene , but primarily preserve an aquatic plant community . A recent review of the early Eocene fossil sites from the interior of British Columbia discusses the history of paleobotanical research at McAbee , the Princeton Chert , Driftwood Canyon , and related Eocene fossil sites such as at Republic .",
  "/wiki/Bulldog_ant": "Myrmecia is a genus of ants first established by Danish zoologist Johan Christian Fabricius in 1804 . The genus is a member of the subfamily Myrmeciinae of the family Formicidae . Myrmecia is a large genus of ants , comprising at least 93 species that are found throughout Australia and its coastal islands , while a single species is only known from New Caledonia . One species has been introduced out of its natural distribution and was found in New Zealand in 1940 , but the ant was last seen in 1981 . These ants are commonly known as bull ants , bulldog ants or jack jumper ants , and are also associated with many other common names . They are characterized by their extreme aggressiveness , ferocity , and painful stings . Some species are known for the jumping behavior they exhibit when agitated . Species of this genus are also characterized by their elongated mandibles and large compound eyes that provide excellent vision . They vary in colour and size , ranging from 8 to 40 millimetres ( 0.31 to 1.57 in ) . Although workers and queens are hard to distinguish from each other due to their similar appearance , males are identifiable by their perceptibly smaller mandibles . Almost all Myrmecia species are monomorphic , with little variation among workers of a given species . Some queens are ergatoid and have no wings , while others have either stubby or completely developed wings ."
