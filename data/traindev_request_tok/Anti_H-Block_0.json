  "/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army": "The Irish Republican Army ( IRA ; Irish : \u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann ) , also known as the Provisional Irish Republican Army ( Provisional IRA or Provos ) , was an Irish republican paramilitary organisation that sought to end British rule in Northern Ireland , facilitate Irish reunification and bring about an independent republic encompassing all of Ireland . It was the most active republican paramilitary group during the Troubles . It saw itself as the sole legitimate successor to the original IRA from the Irish War of Independence , and accordingly referred to itself simply as the Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) , or \u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann in Irish . It was designated a terrorist organisation in the United Kingdom and an illegal organisation in the Republic of Ireland . The Provisional IRA emerged in December 1969 , following a split within the previous incarnation of the IRA and the broader Irish republican movement . It was the minority faction in the split , while the majority continued as the Official IRA . The term provisional was chosen to mirror the 1916 Provisional Government of the Irish Republic , and also to designate it as temporary pending reorganisation of the movement . Although this reorganisation eventually happened in 1970 , the name stuck . The Troubles had begun shortly before when a largely Catholic , nonviolent civil rights campaign was met with violence from both Ulster loyalists and the Royal Ulster Constabulary ( RUC ) , culminating in the August 1969 riots and deployment of British troops . The IRA initially focused on defence of Catholic areas , but it began an offensive campaign in 1971 ( see timeline ) . The IRA 's primary goal was to force the United Kingdom to negotiate a withdrawal from Northern Ireland . It used guerrilla tactics against the British Army and RUC in both rural and urban areas .",

The original Sinn F\u00e9in organisation was founded in 1905 by Arthur Griffith , but has split substantially on a number of occasions since then - notably giving rise to the two traditionally dominant parties of southern Irish politics - Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael - in the aftermath of the Irish Civil War . The party took its current form in 1970 after another split ( with the other faction eventually becoming the Workers ' Party of Ireland ) . It has historically been associated with the Provisional Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) . Mary Lou McDonald became party president in February 2018 . Sinn F\u00e9in is one of the two largest parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly , winning just one seat less than the Democratic Unionist Party ( DUP ) at the 2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election . In that assembly it is the largest Irish nationalist party , and it holds four ministerial posts in the power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive as of 2020 [ update ] . In the UK House of Commons , Sinn F\u00e9in holds seven of Northern Ireland 's 18 seats , making it the second-largest bloc after the DUP ; there it follows a policy of abstentionism , refusing to sit in parliament or vote on bills . In the Oireachtas ( the parliament of the Republic of Ireland ) , Sinn F\u00e9in won the largest share of first-preference votes at the 2020 Irish general election .",
