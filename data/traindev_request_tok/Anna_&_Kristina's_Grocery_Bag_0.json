  "/wiki/French_cuisine": "French cuisine consists of the cooking traditions and practices from France . French cuisine developed throughout the centuries influenced by the many surrounding cultures of Spain , Italy , Switzerland , Germany and Belgium , in addition to its own food traditions on the long western coastlines of the Atlantic , the Channel and of course inland . In the 14th century , Guillaume Tirel , a court chef known as Taillevent , wrote Le Viandier , one of the earliest recipe collections of medieval France . In the 17th century , chefs Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne and Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame spearheaded movements that shifted French cooking away from its foreign influences and developed France 's own indigenous style . Cheese and wine are a major part of the cuisine . They play different roles regionally and nationally , with many variations and appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e ( AOC ) ( regulated appellation ) laws . [ citation needed ] French cuisine was made important in the 20th century by Auguste Escoffier to become the modern haute cuisine ; Escoffier , however , left out much of the local culinary character to be found in the regions of France and was considered difficult to execute by home cooks . Culinary tourism and the Guide Michelin helped to acquaint people [ who ? ] with the cuisine bourgeoise of the urban elites [ dubious - discuss ] and the peasant cuisine of the French countryside starting in the 20th century . Gascon cuisine has also had great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France . Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated in variations across the country .

  "/wiki/Indian_cuisine": "Indian cuisine consists of a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent . Given the range of diversity in soil type , climate , culture , ethnic groups , and occupations , these cuisines vary substantially from each other and use locally available spices , herbs , vegetables , and fruits . Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion , in particular Hinduism , cultural choices and traditions . The cuisine is also influenced by centuries of Islamic rule , particularly the Mughal rule . Samosas and pilafs can be regarded as examples . Historical events such as foreign invasions , trade relations , and colonialism have played a role in introducing certain foods to this country . The Columbian discovery of the New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruit to India . A number of these such as the potato , tomatoes , chillies , peanuts , and Guava have become staples in many regions of India . Indian cuisine has shaped the history of international relations ; the spice trade between India and Europe was the primary catalyst for Europe 's Age of Discovery .

  "/wiki/Grilling": "Grilling is a form of cooking that involves dry heat applied to the surface of food , commonly from above , below or from the side . Grilling usually involves a significant amount of direct , radiant heat , and tends to be used for cooking meat and vegetables quickly . Food to be grilled is cooked on a grill ( an open wire grid such as a gridiron with a heat source above or below ) , using a cast iron/frying pan , or a grill pan ( similar to a frying pan , but with raised ridges to mimic the wires of an open grill ) . Heat transfer to the food when using a grill is primarily through thermal radiation . Heat transfer when using a grill pan or griddle is by direct conduction . In the United States , when the heat source for grilling comes from above , grilling is called broiling . In this case , the pan that holds the food is called a broiler pan , and heat transfer is through thermal radiation . Direct heat grilling can expose food to temperatures often in excess of 260 \u00b0C ( 500 \u00b0F ) . Grilled meat acquires a distinctive roast aroma and flavor from a chemical process called the Maillard reaction . The Maillard reaction only occurs when foods reach temperatures in excess of 155 \u00b0C ( 310 \u00b0F ) . Studies have shown that cooking beef , pork , poultry , and fish at high temperatures can lead to the formation of heterocyclic amines , benzopyrenes , and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , which are carcinogens . Marination may reduce the formation of these compounds .",

  "/wiki/Mexican_cuisine": "Mexican cuisine began about 9000 years ago , when agricultural communities such as the Maya formed , domesticating maize , creating the standard process of maize nixtamalization , and establishing their foodways . Successive waves of other Mesoamerican groups brought with them their own cooking methods . These included the Olmec , Teotihuacanos , Toltec , Huastec , Zapotec , Mixtec , Otomi , Pur\u00e9pecha , Totonac , Mazatec , and Mazahua . The Mexica establishment of the Aztec Empire created a multi-ethnic society where many different foodways became infused . The staples are native foods , such as corn ( maize ) , beans , squash , amaranth , chia , avocados , tomatoes , tomatillos , cacao , vanilla , agave , turkey , spirulina , sweet potato , cactus , and chili pepper . After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire in the 16th century and the subsequent conquest of the Maya area , Europeans introduced a number of other foods , the most important of which were meats from domesticated animals ( beef , pork , chicken , goat , and sheep ) , dairy products ( especially cheese and milk ) , and rice . While the Spanish initially tried to impose their own diet on the country , this was not possible . Asian and African influences were also introduced into the indigenous cuisine during this era as a result of African slavery in New Spain and the Manila-Acapulco Galleons . Over the centuries , this resulted in regional cuisines based on local conditions , such as those in Oaxaca , Veracruz and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula . Mexican cuisine is an important aspect of the culture , social structure and popular traditions of Mexico . The most important example of this connection is the use of mole for special occasions and holidays , particularly in the South and Central regions of the country . For this reason and others , traditional Mexican cuisine was inscribed in 2010 on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO .",

  "/wiki/Fat": "Fats are one of the three main macronutrients , along with carbohydrates and proteins . Fat molecules consist of primarily carbon and hydrogen atoms and are therefore hydrophobic and are soluble in organic solvents and insoluble in water . Examples include cholesterol , phospholipids , and triglycerides . The terms lipid , oil , and fat are often confused . Lipid is the general term , though a lipid is not necessarily a triglyceride . Oil normally refers to a lipid with short or unsaturated fatty acid chains that is liquid at room temperature , while fat ( in the strict sense ) specifically refers to lipids that are solids at room temperature - however , fat ( in the broad sense ) may be used in food science as a synonym for lipid . Fat is an important foodstuff for many forms of life , and fats serve both structural and metabolic functions . They are a necessary part of the diet of most heterotrophs ( including humans ) and are the most energy dense , thus the most efficient form of energy storage . Some fatty acids that are set free by the digestion of fats are called essential because they can not be synthesized in the body from simpler constituents . There are two essential fatty acids ( EFAs ) in human nutrition : alpha-linolenic acid ( an omega-3 fatty acid ) and linoleic acid ( an omega-6 fatty acid ) . Other lipids needed by the body can be synthesized from these and other fats . Fats and other lipids are broken down in the body by enzymes called lipases produced in the pancreas .",
  "/wiki/Rose_Levy_Beranbaum": "Rose Levy Beranbaum is an American baker , cookbook author and blogger . She pioneered the reverse creaming technique of cake-making . In this process , the fat and flour are mixed first before adding the remaining ingredients . By coating the flour in fat , gluten development is inhibited , helping to prevent toughness . This is in contrast to the usual creaming technique , which first mixes fat and sugar . Beranbaum has noted that she was heavily influenced by Julia Child and James Beard .",
  "/wiki/Baking": "Baking is a method of preparing food that uses dry heat , normally in an oven , but can also be done in hot ashes , or on hot stones . The most common baked item is bread but many other types of foods are baked . Heat is gradually transferred from the surface of cakes , cookies , and breads to their center . As heat travels through , it transforms batters and doughs into baked goods and more with a firm dry crust and a softer centre . Baking can be combined with grilling to produce a hybrid barbecue variant by using both methods simultaneously , or one after the other . Baking is related to barbecuing because the concept of the masonry oven is similar to that of a smoke pit . Because of historical social and familial roles , baking has traditionally been performed at home by women for day-to-day meals and by men in bakeries and restaurants for local consumption . When production was industrialized , baking was automated by machines in large factories . The art of baking remains a fundamental skill and is important for nutrition , as baked goods , especially breads , are a common and important food , both from an economic and cultural point of view . A person who prepares baked goods as a profession is called a baker .",

The most commonly used cake ingredients include flour , sugar , eggs , butter or oil or margarine , a liquid , and leavening agents , such as baking soda or baking powder . Common additional ingredients and flavourings include dried , candied , or fresh fruit , nuts , cocoa , and extracts such as vanilla , with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients . Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves , nuts or dessert sauces ( like pastry cream ) , iced with buttercream or other icings , and decorated with marzipan , piped borders , or candied fruit . Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions , such as weddings , anniversaries , and birthdays . There are countless cake recipes ; some are bread-like , some are rich and elaborate , and many are centuries old .

Tidewater , Appalachian , Creole , Lowcountry , and Floribbean are examples of types of Southern cuisine . In recent history , elements of Southern cuisine have spread north , having an effect on the development of other types of American cuisine . Many elements of Southern cooking - squash , corn ( and its derivatives , including grits ) , and deep-pit barbecuing - are borrowings from southeast American Indian tribes such as the Caddo , Choctaw , and Seminole . Sugar , flour , milk , and eggs come from Europe ; the Southern fondness for fried foods is Scottish , and the old-fashioned Virginian use of ragouts [ dubious - discuss ] comes from the West Country of England . Black-eyed peas , okra , rice , eggplant , sesame , sorghum , and melons , as well as most spices used in the South , are originally African ; a preponderance of slaves imported to Virginia in early years were Igbo from the Bight of Biafra , and down to the present day Southern and Nigerian cuisines have many flavors and elements in common . The South 's fondness for a full breakfast derives from the British full breakfast or fry-up . Many Southern foodways , especially in Appalachia , are Scottish or Border meals adapted to the new subtropical climate ; pork , once considered informally taboo in Scotland , takes the place of lamb and mutton , and instead of chopped oats , Southerners eat grits , although oatmeal is much more common now than it once was . Parts of the South have other cuisines , though .
