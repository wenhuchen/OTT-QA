  "/wiki/Amusement_park": "An amusement park is a park that features various attractions , such as rides and games , as well as other events for entertainment purposes . A theme park is a type of amusement park that bases its structures and attractions around a central theme , often featuring multiple areas with different themes . Unlike temporary and mobile funfairs and carnivals , amusement parks are stationary and built for long-lasting operation . They are more elaborate than city parks and playgrounds , usually providing attractions that cater to a variety of age groups . While amusement parks often contain themed areas , theme parks place a heavier focus with more intricately-designed themes that revolve around a particular subject or group of subjects . Amusement parks evolved from European fairs , pleasure gardens and large picnic areas , which were created for people 's recreation . World 's fairs and other types of international expositions also influenced the emergence of the amusement park industry . Lake Compounce opened in 1846 and is considered the oldest , continuously-operating amusement park in North America . The first theme parks emerged in the mid-twentieth century with the opening of Santa Claus Land in 1946 , Santa 's Workshop in 1949 , and Disneyland in 1955 .",

  "/wiki/Automobile": "A car ( or automobile ) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation . Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads , seat one to eight people , have four tires , and mainly transport people rather than goods . Cars came into global use during the 20th century , and developed economies depend on them . The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen . Cars became widely available in the early 20th century . One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T , an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company . Cars were rapidly adopted in the US , where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts , but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world . [ citation needed ] Cars have controls for driving , parking , passenger comfort , and a variety of lights . Over the decades , additional features and controls have been added to vehicles , making them progressively more complex , but also more reliable and easier to operate . [ citation needed ] These include rear reversing cameras , air conditioning , navigation systems , and in-car entertainment . Most cars in use in the 2010s are propelled by an internal combustion engine , fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels . Electric cars , which were invented early in the history of the car , became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025 .",

  "/wiki/Formula_One": "Formula One ( also known as Formula 1 or F1 ) is the highest class of single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile ( FIA ) and owned by the Formula One Group . The World Drivers ' Championship , which became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981 , has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950 . The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants ' cars must conform . A Formula One season consists of a series of races , known as Grands Prix ( French for 'grand prizes ' or 'great prizes ' ) , which take place worldwide on purpose-built circuits and on public roads . The results of each race are evaluated using a points system to determine two annual World Championships : one for drivers , the other for constructors . Drivers must hold valid Super Licences , the highest class of racing licence issued by the FIA . The races must run on tracks graded 1 ( formerly A ) , the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA . Most events occur in rural locations on purpose-built tracks , but several events take place on city streets . Formula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world , owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce . The cars underwent major changes in 2017 , allowing wider front and rear wings , and wider tyres , resulting in peak cornering forces near 6.5 lateral g and top speeds of up to approximately 350 km/h ( 215 mph ) . As of 2019 [ update ] the hybrid engines are limited in performance to a maximum of 15,000 rpm , the cars are very dependent on electronics and aerodynamics , suspension and tyres . Traction control and other driving aids have been banned since 2008 .",

  "/wiki/Planetarium": "A planetarium ( plural planetaria or planetariums ) is a theatre built primarily for presenting educational and entertaining shows about astronomy and the night sky , or for training in celestial navigation . A dominant feature of most planetaria is the large dome-shaped projection screen onto which scenes of stars , planets , and other celestial objects can be made to appear and move realistically to simulate the complex 'motions of the heavens ' . The celestial scenes can be created using a wide variety of technologies , for example precision-engineered 'star balls ' that combine optical and electro-mechanical technology , slide projector , video and fulldome projector systems , and lasers . Whatever technologies are used , the objective is normally to link them together to simulate an accurate relative motion of the sky . Typical systems can be set to simulate the sky at any point in time , past or present , and often to depict the night sky as it would appear from any point of latitude on Earth . Planetariums range in size from the 37 meter dome in St. Petersburg , Russia ( called Planetarium No 1 ) to three-meter inflatable portable domes where attendees sit on the floor . The largest planetarium in the Western Hemisphere is the Jennifer Chalsty Planetarium at Liberty Science Center in New Jersey ( 27 meters in diameter ) . The Birla Planetarium in Kolkata , India is the largest by seating capacity ( 630 seats ) . Thereafter , the China Science and Technology Museum Planetarium in Beijing , China has the largest seating capacity ( 442 seats ) . In North America , the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City has the greatest number of seats ( 423 ) . The term planetarium is sometimes used generically to describe other devices which illustrate the solar system , such as a computer simulation or an orrery . Planetarium software refers to a software application that renders a three-dimensional image of the sky onto a two-dimensional computer screen ."
