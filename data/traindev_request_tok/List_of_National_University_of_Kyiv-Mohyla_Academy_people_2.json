In elections to the Verkhovna Rada , a mixed voting system is used . 50% of seats are distributed under party lists with a 5% election threshold and 50% through first-past-the-post in single-member constituencies .

Count Zavadovsky was named official secretary to Catherine in 1775 and became her lover on 2 January 1776 . He is described as serious and cultivated and he is regarded to have been genuinely in love with Catherine . Their relationship was tense because of the jealousy he felt toward Potemkin , who still had a relationship with Catherine , although Zavadovsky had replaced him in a sexual sense , and Potemkin was also said to have had difficulties accepting the situation . The relationship was ended because of the continuing pressure . In 1778 , Catherine contemplated recalling him , but was then introduced to Korsakov . In 1780 he was appointed a privy councillor ; in 1781 , he became the director of the state bank . He later became a senator and , at the end of his life , the minister of education under Czar Alexander I ."
