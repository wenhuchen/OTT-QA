South Africa entered first-class and international cricket at the same time when they hosted an England cricket team in the 1888-89 season . At first , the team was no match for Australia or England but , having gained in experience and expertise , they were able to field a competitive team in the first decade of the 20th century . The team regularly played against Australia , England and New Zealand through to the 1960s , by which time there was considerable opposition to the country 's apartheid policy and an international ban was imposed by the ICC , commensurate with actions taken by other global sporting bodies . When the ban was imposed , South Africa had developed to a point where its team including Eddie Barlow , Graeme Pollock and Mike Procter was arguably the best in the world and had just outplayed Australia . The ban remained in place until 1991 and South Africa could then play against India , Pakistan , Sri Lanka and the West Indies for the first time . The team since reinstatement has mostly been strong and has at times held number one positions in international rankings ( had best ranking of No.1 in all three formats ) but has lacked success in ICC organised tournaments . Outstanding players since reinstatement have included Allan Donald , Makhaya Ntini , Shaun Pollock , Jacques Kallis , Graeme Smith , Kagiso Rabada , AB de Villiers , Dale Steyn , Herschelle Gibbs , Faf du Plessis , Morne Morkel , Imran Tahir and Hashim Amla .",
