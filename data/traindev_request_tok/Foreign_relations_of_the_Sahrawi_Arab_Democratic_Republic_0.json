It is the seventh-largest country in Africa , bordered by Namibia to the south , the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north , Zambia to the east , and the Atlantic Ocean to the west . Angola has an exclave province , the province of Cabinda that borders the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The capital and largest city of Angola is Luanda . The territory of Angola has been inhabited since the Paleolithic Era , hosting a wide variety of ethnic groups , tribes and kingdoms . The nation state of Angola originated from Portuguese colonisation , which initially began with coastal settlements and trading posts founded in the 16th century . In the 19th century , European settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior . The Portuguese colony that became Angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century because of resistance by groups such as the Cuamato , the Kwanyama and the Mbunda . After a protracted anti-colonial struggle , independence was achieved in 1975 as the Marxist-Leninist People 's Republic of Angola , a one-party state supported by the Soviet Union and Cuba . The civil war between the ruling People 's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ( MPLA ) and the insurgent anti-communist National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) , supported by the United States and apartheid South Africa , lasted until 2002 . The sovereign state has since become a relatively stable unitary , presidential constitutional republic . Angola has vast mineral and petroleum reserves , and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world , especially since the end of the civil war ; however , the standard of living remains low for most of the population , and life expectancy in Angola is among the lowest in the world , while infant mortality is among the highest .",

Luanda 's population increased greatly from refugees fleeing the war , but its infrastructure was inadequate to handle the increase .
