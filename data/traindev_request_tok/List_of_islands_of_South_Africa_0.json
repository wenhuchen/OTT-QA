In return for this Turner was to select a suitable site for a harbour and undertake the necessary construction work . The site chosen for this new venture was at the mouth of the Mkweni River , close to the site of the Grosvenor wreck . Turner named it Port Grosvenor . As port captain and harbourmaster , Turner collected customs dues and managed the harbour and pilotage .
