  "/wiki/Mickey_Mouse_universe": "The Mickey Mouse universe is a fictional shared universe which is the setting for stories involving Disney cartoon characters Mickey and Minnie Mouse , Pluto , Goofy and many other characters . The universe originated from the Mickey Mouse animated short films produced by Disney starting in 1928 , but its first consistent version was created by Floyd Gottfredson in the Mickey Mouse newspaper comic strip . Real-world versions also exist in Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland , called Mickey 's Toontown . Since 1990 , the city in which Mickey lives is typically called Mouseton in American comics . In modern continuity , Mouseton is often depicted as being located in the fictional U.S. state of Calisota , analogous to Northern California . This fictional state was invented by comics writer Carl Barks in 1952 as the location for Donald Duck 's home city , Duckburg . The most consistent aspect of the Mickey Mouse universe is the characters . The most well-known include Mickey 's girlfriend Minnie , pet dog Pluto , friends Goofy , Horace Horsecollar , Clarabelle Cow , and nemesis Pete . Some Disney productions incorporate characters from Disney 's animated feature films , such as Bath Day ( 1946 ; in which Figaro from Pinocchio appears as Minnie 's cat ) , Mickey 's Christmas Carol ( 1983 ) , and - most extensively - Disney 's House of Mouse ( 2001-2003 ) . The term Mickey Mouse universe is not officially used by the Walt Disney Company , but it has been used by Disney comics author and animation historian David Gerstein . The Walt Disney Company typically uses terms such as Mickey & Friends or Mickey & the Gang to refer to the character franchise .",
