  "/wiki/Corkscrew_(Valleyfair)": "Corkscrew is the name of a roller coaster at Valleyfair in Shakopee , Minnesota featuring one vertical loop and two corkscrews . Built in 1980 , Corkscrew was planned to reflect the design of its sister roller coaster Corkscrew at Cedar Point . It is notably one of the first roller coasters to feature a double corkscrew , as well as a vertical loop . The main differences that the Valleyfair model has is the addition of a finale helix and the omission of the camelback before the loop . Until the hypercoaster Wild Thing ( the fifth highest and fastest roller coaster in the world at the time it opened in 1996 ) , Corkscrew was the only outdoor all-steel roller coaster in Minnesota . Corkscrew is currently the only roller coaster at Valleyfair with inversions . The coaster 's track was painted blue when it open in 1980 but was repainted orange and yellow in 2011 .",
  "/wiki/Arrow_Dynamics": "Arrow Dynamics was an American manufacturing and engineering company that specialized in designing and building amusement park rides , especially roller coasters . Based in Clearfield , Utah , the company was the successor to Arrow Development ( 1946-1981 ) and Arrow Huss ( 1981-1986 ) , which were responsible for several influential advancements in the amusement and theme park industries . Among the most significant was tubular steel track , which provided a smoother ride than the railroad style rails commonly used prior to the 1960s on wooden roller coasters . The Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland , built in 1959 , was Arrow 's first roller coaster project . In 1975 , Arrow Development introduced the first corkscrew style track Corkscrew , at Knott 's Berry Farm that sent riders through a series of corkscrews . Arrow created several other firsts over the years , introducing the first suspended roller coaster in almost a century , The Bat , in 1981 , and the world 's first hypercoaster , Magnum XL-200 , which opened in 1989 . They built the first 4th Dimension roller coaster , X2 , which was designed by Alan Schilke in 2002 . Arrow Development 's ownership changed three times between the 1950s and 1980s . Arrow Dynamics would eventually survive two bankruptcies and spin off a sister company , Fabriweld , primarily to build track , by 1988 . Arrow Dynamics eventually closed on December 3 , 2001 . S & S Worldwide purchased part of Arrow 's remaining assets on October 28 , 2002 , and the remainder of the company was dissolved . In 2012 , Sansei Yusoki Co. of Osaka , Japan , acquired a 77.3% interest in S & S - Arrow .",
  "/wiki/Steel_roller_coaster": "A steel roller coaster is a roller coaster that is defined by having a track made of steel . Steel coasters have earned immense popularity in the past 50 years throughout the world . Incorporating tubular steel track and polyurethane-coated wheels , the steel roller coasters can provide a taller , smoother , and faster ride with more inversions than a traditional wooden roller coaster . Arrow Dynamics first introduced the steel roller coaster to feature tubular track to the thrill industry with their creations of the Matterhorn Bobsleds ( Disneyland ) in 1959 and the Runaway Mine Train ( Six Flags Over Texas ) in 1966 . As of 2006 , the oldest operating steel roller coaster in North America is Little Dipper at Memphis Kiddie Park in Brooklyn , Ohio and has been operating since April 1952 . The oldest operating steel rollercoaster in the world is Monta\u00f1a Suiza at Parque de Atracciones Monte Igueldo ( Spain ) . It has been operating since 1928 .",

  "/wiki/Excalibur_(roller_coaster)": "Excalibur is a steel roller coaster with a wooden structure located at Valleyfair in Shakopee , Minnesota . It was built in 1989 by Arrow Dynamics , for the cost of $ 3,000,000 . The ride is 105 feet ( 32 m ) tall with a top speed of 54.5 mph ( 87.7 km/h ) and has a minimum height requirement of 48 inches . It follows a customized figure-eight track layout and is rather short for a major roller coaster , with a total ride duration of two minutes and thirteen seconds . Most likely due to its location at the very western edge of the park and the more recently built roller coasters such as Wild Thing , Steel Venom and Renegade , Excalibur typically has a very short wait time . A few years after the ride was built , trim brakes were added at the top of the first hill . The bottom and first half of the turn were re-profiled in an attempt to reduce roughness . The photo spot and the Excalibur Photos booth were also removed . The photo booth was replaced with a Refreshment stand , which has also been removed .",
  "/wiki/Wooden_roller_coaster": "A wooden roller coaster is most often classified as a roller coaster with running rails made of flattened steel strips mounted on laminated wooden track . Occasionally , the support structure may be made out of a steel lattice or truss , but the ride remains classified as a wooden roller coaster due to the track design . The type of wood typically used in the construction of wooden coasters is Southern Yellow Pine , usually grown in the US and the rest of North America . Because of the limits of wood , wooden roller coasters , in general , do not have inversions ( when the coaster goes upside down ) , steep drops , or extremely banked turns ( overbanked turns ) . However , there are exceptions , such as the original loop on Son of Beast at Kings Island ; a corkscrew and 90-degree banked turn at Hades 360 at Mount Olympus Water and Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells , Wisconsin ; a steel structure at The Voyage at Holiday World ; and banked turns at Ravine Flyer II at Waldameer Park and Outlaw Run at Silver Dollar City .",

  "/wiki/Wild_mouse_roller_coaster": "A Wild Mouse roller coaster ( also Mad Mouse or Crazy Mouse ) is a type of roller coaster characterized by small cars that seat four people or fewer and ride on top of the track , taking tight , flat turns ( without banking ) at modest speeds , yet producing high lateral G-forces . The track work is characterized by many turns and bunny hops , the latter producing abrupt negative vertical G forces . When approaching a turn from a straight section , the intended impression is that one will simply continue straight , and thus plunge off of the device , this since there are no transition sections as are in a conventional high speed roller coaster track and the turn itself is obscured upon close approach . Almost all Wild Mice feature switchback sections , consisting of several of these unbanked turns , separated by straight sections . Usually the turns on the switchback section are 180\u00b0 , but some coasters feature 90\u00b0 turns as well as more rarely steep runs with loops ( for example Crazy Mouse at Tobu Zoo in Japan , which is no longer operating ) . Some riders , usually among taller people , report sustaining whiplash after being subjected to these turns . [ citation needed ] The feeling of a Wild Mouse coaster is amplified by using cars that are wider than the track itself , giving the impression that the riders are hanging off the side or that they might fly out , thus giving it the name wild . Some may include trick-track - a straight piece of track banked slightly side to side designed to throw the rider left to right . Some wild mouse coasters , such as Primeval Whirl , also have spinning cars . The modern Wild Mouse was invented by German designer Franz Mack . In the original wooden Wild Mouse coasters of the 1960s and 1970s , the cars were so small that they could only fit two adults in close contact . While the low capacity of these rides led to long lines , the cars were small by design .",

The train then falls backwards , is powered again through the station , and heads up a back tower . The train then falls forwards , and continues in this fashion for a total of 2\u00bd cycles per ride ( three forward launches , two backwards ) . On the final forward launch , with a slightly reduced speed , the train is sent up the front tower , and brakes then deploy on the launch track . The train then slows down and heads back into the station .",
