  "/wiki/Hipparcos": "Hipparcos was a scientific satellite of the European Space Agency ( ESA ) , launched in 1989 and operated until 1993 . It was the first space experiment devoted to precision astrometry , the accurate measurement of the positions of celestial objects on the sky . This permitted the first high-precision measurements of the intrinsic brightnesses ( compared to the less precise apparent brightness ) , proper motions and parallaxes of stars , enabling better calculations of their distance and tangential velocity . When combined with radial velocity measurements from spectroscopy , astrophysicists were able to finally measure all six quantities needed to determine the motion of stars . The resulting Hipparcos Catalogue , a high-precision catalogue of more than 118,200 stars , was published in 1997 . The lower-precision Tycho Catalogue of more than a million stars was published at the same time , while the enhanced Tycho-2 Catalogue of 2.5 million stars was published in 2000 . Hipparcos ' follow-up mission , Gaia , was launched in 2013 . The word Hipparcos is an acronym for HIgh Precision PARallax COllecting Satellite and also a reference to the ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus of Nicaea , who is noted for applications of trigonometry to astronomy and his discovery of the precession of the equinoxes .",

  "/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope": "The Hubble Space Telescope ( often referred to as HST or Hubble ) is a space telescope that was launched into low Earth orbit in 1990 and remains in operation . It was not the first space telescope but it is one of the largest and most versatile , well known both as a vital research tool and as a public relations boon for astronomy . The Hubble telescope is named after astronomer Edwin Hubble and is one of NASA 's Great Observatories , along with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory , the Chandra X-ray Observatory , and the Spitzer Space Telescope . Hubble features a 2.4-meter ( 7.9 ft ) mirror , and its four main instruments observe in the ultraviolet , visible , and near infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum . Hubble 's orbit outside the distortion of Earth 's atmosphere allows it to capture extremely high-resolution images with substantially lower background light than ground-based telescopes . It has recorded some of the most detailed visible light images , allowing a deep view into space . Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in astrophysics , such as determining the rate of expansion of the universe . The Hubble telescope was built by the United States space agency NASA with contributions from the European Space Agency . The Space Telescope Science Institute ( STScI ) selects Hubble 's targets and processes the resulting data , while the Goddard Space Flight Center controls the spacecraft . Space telescopes were proposed as early as 1923 . Hubble was funded in the 1970s with a proposed launch in 1983 , but the project was beset by technical delays , budget problems , and the 1986 Challenger disaster . It was finally launched by Space Shuttle Discovery in 1990 , but its main mirror had been ground incorrectly , resulting in spherical aberration that compromised the telescope 's capabilities .",

The mission 's two objectives were to search for extrasolar planets with short orbital periods , particularly those of large terrestrial size , and to perform asteroseismology by measuring solar-like oscillations in stars . The mission was led by the French Space Agency ( CNES ) in conjunction with the European Space Agency ( ESA ) and other international partners . Among the notable discoveries was COROT-7b , discovered in 2009 which became the first exoplanet shown to have a rock or metal-dominated composition . CoRoT was launched at 14:28:00 UTC on 27 December 2006 , atop a Soyuz 2.1b rocket , reporting first light on 18 January 2007 . Subsequently , the probe started to collect science data on 2 February 2007 . CoRoT was the first spacecraft dedicated to the detection of transiting extrasolar planets , opening the way for more advanced probes such as Kepler and TESS . It detected its first extrasolar planet , COROT-1b , in May 2007 , just 3 months after the start of the observations . Mission flight operations were originally scheduled to end 2.5 years from launch but operations were extended to 2013 . On 2 November 2012 , CoRoT suffered a computer failure that made it impossible to retrieve any data from its telescope . Repair attempts were unsuccessful , so on 24 June 2013 it was announced that CoRoT has been retired and would be decommissioned ; lowered in orbit to allow it to burn up in the atmosphere .",

  "/wiki/Gaia_(spacecraft)": "Gaia is a space observatory of the European Space Agency ( ESA ) , launched in 2013 and expected to operate until c. 2022 . The spacecraft is designed for astrometry : measuring the positions , distances and motions of stars with unprecedented precision . The mission aims to construct by far the largest and most precise 3D space catalog ever made , totalling approximately 1 billion astronomical objects , mainly stars , but also planets , comets , asteroids and quasars among others . The spacecraft will monitor each of its target objects about 70 times over the first five years of the mission to study the precise position and motion of each target , and will keep doing so . The spacecraft has enough micro-propulsion fuel to operate until about November 2024 . As its detectors are not degrading as fast as initially expected , the mission could therefore be extended . The Gaia targets objects brighter than magnitude 20 in a broad photometric band that covers most of the visual range ; such objects represent approximately 1% of the Milky Way population . Additionally , Gaia is expected to detect thousands to tens of thousands of Jupiter-sized exoplanets beyond the Solar System , 500,000 quasars outside our galaxy and tens of thousands of new asteroids and comets within the Solar System . The Gaia mission will create a precise three-dimensional map of astronomical objects throughout the Milky Way and map their motions , which encode the origin and subsequent evolution of the Milky Way . The spectrophotometric measurements will provide the detailed physical properties of all stars observed , characterizing their luminosity , effective temperature , gravity and elemental composition . This massive stellar census will provide the basic observational data to analyze a wide range of important questions related to the origin , structure , and evolutionary history of our galaxy .

  "/wiki/Sun": "The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System . It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma , with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process . It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth . Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers ( 864,000 miles ) , or 109 times that of Earth , and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth . It accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System . Roughly three quarters of the Sun 's mass consists of hydrogen ( ~73% ) ; the rest is mostly helium ( ~25% ) , with much smaller quantities of heavier elements , including oxygen , carbon , neon , and iron . The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star ( G2V ) based on its spectral class . As such , it is informally and not completely accurately referred to as a yellow dwarf ( its light is closer to white than yellow ) . It formed approximately 4.6 billion [ a ] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud . Most of this matter gathered in the center , whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System . The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core . It is thought that almost all stars form by this process .",
  "/wiki/Earth": "Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life .

Earth 's gravity interacts with other objects in space , especially the Sun and the Moon , which is Earth 's only natural satellite . Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.256 days , a period known as an Earth sidereal year . During this time , Earth rotates about its axis about 366.256 times . [ n 6 ] Earth 's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane , producing seasons on Earth . The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides , stabilizes Earth 's orientation on its axis , and gradually slows its rotation . Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets . Earth 's outer layer ( lithosphere ) is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years . About 71% of Earth 's surface is covered with water , mostly by oceans . The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together contain many lakes , rivers and other fresh water , which , together with the oceans , constitute the hydrosphere .

  "/wiki/Lagrangian_point": "In celestial mechanics , the Lagrangian points ( /l\u0259\u02c8\u0261r\u0251\u02d0nd\u0292i\u0259n/ also Lagrange points , L-points , or libration points ) are the points near two large bodies in orbit where a smaller object will maintain its position relative to the large orbiting bodies . At other locations , a small object would go into its own orbit around one of the large bodies , but at the Lagrangian points the gravitational forces of the two large bodies , the centripetal force of orbital motion , and ( for certain points ) the Coriolis acceleration all match up in a way that cause the small object to maintain a stable or nearly stable position relative to the large bodies . There are five such points , labeled L1 to L5 , all in the orbital plane of the two large bodies , for each given combination of two orbital bodies . For instance , there are five Lagrangian points L1 to L5 for the Sun-Earth system , and in a similar way there are five different Lagrangian points for the Earth-Moon system . L1 , L2 , and L3 are on the line through the centers of the two large bodies . L4 and L5 each form an equilateral triangle with the centers of the large bodies . L4 and L5 are stable , which implies that objects can orbit around them in a rotating coordinate system tied to the two large bodies . Several planets have trojan satellites near their L4 and L5 points with respect to the Sun . Jupiter has more than a million of these trojans . Artificial satellites have been placed at L1 and L2 with respect to the Sun and Earth , and with respect to the Earth and the Moon . The Lagrangian points have been proposed for uses in space exploration .",

Its vision is to harness space technology for national development while pursuing space science research & planetary exploration . The Indian National Committee for Space Research ( INCOSPAR ) was established in the tenure of Jawaharlal Nehru under the Department of Atomic Energy ( DAE ) in 1962 , with the urging of scientist Vikram Sarabhai recognizing the need in space research . INCOSPAR grew and became ISRO in 1969 , also under the DAE . In 1972 , Government of India had setup a Space Commission and the Department of Space ( DOS ) , bringing ISRO under the DOS . The establishment of ISRO thus institutionalized space research activities in India . It is managed by the DOS , which reports to the prime minister of India . ISRO built India 's first satellite , Aryabhata , which was launched by the Soviet Union on 19 April 1975 . It was named after the mathematician Aryabhata . In 1980 , Rohini became the first satellite to be placed in orbit by an Indian-made launch vehicle , SLV-3 .

It was launched on April 18 , 2018 atop a Falcon 9 rocket and be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth . During its two-year primary mission , it was expected to find more than 20,000 transiting exoplanets , compared to about 3,800 exoplanets known when it launched . As of February 2020 , with less than 3 months to go before the originally planned end of mission , TESS has identified about 1660 candidate exoplanets , of which 38 have been confirmed so far . The first light image from TESS was taken on August 7 , 2018 , and released publicly on September 17 , 2018 . The primary mission objective for TESS is to survey the brightest stars near the Earth for transiting exoplanets over a two-year period . The TESS satellite uses an array of wide-field cameras to perform a survey of 85% of the sky . With TESS , it is possible to study the mass , size , density and orbit of a large cohort of small planets , including a sample of rocky planets in the habitable zones of their host stars . TESS will provide prime targets for further characterization by the James Webb Space Telescope , as well as other large ground-based and space-based telescopes of the future . While previous sky surveys with ground-based telescopes have mainly detected giant exoplanets and the Kepler space telescope has mostly found planets around distant stars that are too faint for characterisation , TESS will find many small planets around the nearest stars in the sky . TESS records the nearest and brightest main sequence stars hosting transiting exoplanets , which are the most favorable targets for detailed investigations . TESS uses a novel highly-elliptical orbit around the Earth with an apogee approximately at the distance of the Moon and a perigee of 108,000 km ."
