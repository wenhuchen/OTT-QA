  "/wiki/New_York,_New_Haven_and_Hartford": "The New York , New Haven and Hartford Railroad ( reporting mark NH ) , commonly known as the New Haven , was a railroad that operated in the New England region of the United States from 1872 to 1968 , dominating the region 's rail traffic for the first half of the 20th century . Beginning in the 1890s and accelerating in 1903 , New York banker J. P. Morgan sought to monopolize New England transportation by arranging the NH 's acquisition of 50 companies , including other railroads and steamship lines , and building a network of electrified trolley lines that provided interurban transportation for all of southern New England . By 1912 , the New Haven operated more than 2,000 miles ( 3,200 km ) of track , with 120,000 employees , and practically monopolized traffic in a wide swath from Boston to New York City . This quest for monopoly angered Progressive Era reformers , alienated public opinion , resulted in high prices for acquisitions , and increased construction costs . Debt soared from $ 14 million in 1903 to $ 242 million in 1913 , while the advent of automobiles , trucks and buses reduced railroad profits . Also in 1913 , the federal government filed an antitrust lawsuit that forced the NH to divest its trolley systems . The line became bankrupt in 1935 , was reorganized and reduced in scope , went bankrupt again in 1961 , and in 1969 was merged with the Penn Central system , formed a year earlier by the merger of the New York Central Railroad and Pennsylvania Railroad ; Already a poorly conceived merger , Penn Central proceeded to go bankrupt in 1970 , becoming the largest bankruptcy in the U.S. until the Enron Corporation superseded it in 2001 . The remnants of the system now comprise Metro-North Railroad 's New Haven Line , ( parts of ) Amtrak 's Northeast Corridor , Shore Line East , parts of the MBTA , and numerous freight operators such as CSX and the Providence and Worcester Railroad . The majority of the system is now owned publicly by the states of Connecticut , Rhode Island , and Massachusetts .",

Chicago is the principal city of the Chicago metropolitan area , often referred to as Chicagoland . At nearly 10 million people , the metropolitan area is the third most populous in the United States . Located on the shores of freshwater Lake Michigan , Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837 near a portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed and grew rapidly in the mid-19th century . After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 , which destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless , the city made a concerted effort to rebuild . The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades , and by 1900 , less than 30 years after the great fire , Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world . Chicago made noted contributions to urban planning and zoning standards , including new construction styles ( including the Chicago School of architecture ) , the development of the City Beautiful Movement , and the steel-framed skyscraper . Chicago is an international hub for finance , culture , commerce , industry , education , technology , telecommunications , and transportation .

The historic heart of the city is the French Quarter , known for its French and Spanish Creole architecture and vibrant nightlife along Bourbon Street . The city has been described as the most unique in the United States , owing in large part to its cross-cultural and multilingual heritage . Founded in 1718 by French colonists , New Orleans was once the territorial capital of French Louisiana before being traded to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 . New Orleans in 1840 was the third-most populous city in the United States , and it was the largest city in the American South from the Antebellum era until after World War II . The city has historically been very vulnerable to flooding , due to such factors as high rainfall , low lying elevation , poor natural drainage and location next to multiple bodies of water . State and federal authorities have installed a complex system of levees and drainage pumps in an effort to protect the city . New Orleans was severely affected by Hurricane Katrina on August 29 , 2005 , which resulted in flooding more than 80% of the city , thousands of deaths , and so much displacement because of damaged communities and lost housing as to cause a population decline of over 50% . Since Katrina , major redevelopment efforts have led to a rebound in the city 's population .",

  "/wiki/Atchison,_Topeka_and_Santa_Fe_Railway": "The Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway ( reporting mark ATSF ) , often referred to as the Santa Fe or AT & SF , was one of the larger railroads in the United States , named after the cities and towns of Atchison , Topeka , and Santa Fe . Chartered in February 1859 , the railroad reached the Kansas-Colorado border in 1873 and Pueblo , Colorado , in 1876 . To create a demand for its services , the railroad set up real estate offices and sold farmland from the land grants that it was awarded by Congress . Despite the namesake , its mainline did not directly serve Santa Fe , due to the mountainous terrain , the metropolitan city of Albuquerque instead served New Mexico and the Santa Fe area . The Santa Fe was a pioneer in intermodal freight transport , an enterprise that ( at one time or another ) included a tugboat fleet and an airline , the short-lived Santa Fe Skyway . Its bus line extended passenger transportation to areas not accessible by rail , and ferryboats on the San Francisco Bay allowed travelers to complete their westward journeys to the Pacific Ocean . The AT & SF was the subject of a popular song , Harry Warren and Johnny Mercer 's On the Atchison , Topeka and the Santa Fe , written for the film , The Harvey Girls ( 1946 ) . The railroad officially ceased operations on December 31 , 1996 , when it merged with the Burlington Northern Railroad to form the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway .",

For part of the 20th century , Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment ; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita . Deindustrialization in the 1970s and 80s laid off area blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined , and thousands of downtown white-collar workers also lost jobs when several Pittsburgh-based companies moved out . The population dropped from a peak of 675,000 in 1950 to 370,000 in 1990 . However , this rich industrial history left the area with renowned museums , medical centers , parks , research centers , and a diverse cultural district . After the deindustrialization of the mid-20th century , Pittsburgh has transformed into a hub for the health care , education , and technology industries ."
