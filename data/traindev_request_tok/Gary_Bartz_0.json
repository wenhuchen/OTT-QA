Hailed as one of the most unjustly under loved jazz greats of the 1950s and the most accomplished modern jazz harpist , Ashby established the harp as an improvising jazz instrument , beyond earlier use as a novelty or background orchestral instrument , proving the harp could play bebop as adeptly as the instruments commonly associated with jazz , such as the saxophone or piano . Ashby had to overcome many obstacles during the pursuit of her career . As an African American female musician in a male dominated industry , she was at a disadvantage . In a 1983 interview with W. Royal Stokes for his book Living the Jazz Life , she remarked of her career , It 's been maybe a triple burden in that not a lot of women are becoming known as jazz players . There is also the connection with black women . The audiences I was trying to reach were not interested in the harp , period - classical or otherwise - and they were certainly not interested in seeing a black woman playing the harp . Ashby successfully navigated these disadvantages , and subsequently aided in the expansion of who was listening to harp music and what the harp was deemed capable of producing as an instrument . Ashby 's albums were of the jazz genre , but often moved into R & B , world music , and other styles , especially her 1970 album The Rubaiyat of Dorothy Ashby , where she demonstrates her talents on another instrument , the Japanese koto , successfully integrating it into jazz .",
