  "/wiki/David_Thai": "David Thai , born Th\u00e1i Th\u1ecd Ho\u00e0ng , is a Vietnamese-born American gangster who was the founder and leader of the notorious Born to Kill gang during the late 1980s and early 1990s . He was also responsible for running a massive illegal counterfeit watch operation and at his peak controlled the market and distribution of counterfeit watches in New York by means of blackmail and extortion . He was the official leader of Born to Kill from 1988 until his arrest in 1991 , which was the combination of months of investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) in conjunction with the aid of a former gang member who defected from the gang and became an undercover informant , helping secure the convictions of David Thai and several of his high-ranking officers . Described as a sly , shrewd and lethal gangster , David Thai fashioned himself as a big brother and the protector to the Vietnamese community in Chinatown . Thai was described by T.J English and many others as being well dressed , usually wearing a tailored sports coat , silk shirt and loft leather loafers alongside a pair of sunglasses , and was said to have resembled more a businessman than a gangster . During his interview with Peg Tyre after his arrest on murder charges in 1991 and other interviews that went on in the course of his trial , Thai often stated that he was trying to protect and help the Vietnamese community in Chinatown , often by giving the newly arrived refugees money and a place to live . In his interview with Tyre , Thai went on to describe that he sacrificed his first marriage due to his love for his Vietnamese brothers . On October 23 , 1992 , a United States federal judge in Brooklyn sentenced Thai to life in prison for murder , attempted murder , conspiracy , robbery , extortion , and related offenses . Federal prosecutors claimed that David Thai 's life sentence significantly impaired Asian gang activity in New York .",

  "/wiki/Murder": "Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse , especially the unlawful killing of another human with malice aforethought . This state of mind may , depending upon the jurisdiction , distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide , such as manslaughter . Manslaughter is a killing committed in the absence of malice , brought about by reasonable provocation , or diminished capacity . Involuntary manslaughter , where it is recognized , is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent , recklessness . Most societies consider murder to be an extremely serious crime , and thus that a person convicted of murder should receive harsh punishments for the purposes of retribution , deterrence , rehabilitation , or incapacitation . In most countries , a person convicted of murder generally faces a long-term prison sentence , possibly a life sentence ; and in a few , the death penalty may be imposed .",
  "/wiki/Extortion": "Extortion ( also called shakedown , and , in a legal sense incorrectly , exaction ) is obtaining benefit through coercion . In most jurisdictions it is likely to constitute a criminal offense ; the bulk of this article deals with such cases . Extortion is sometimes called the protection racket since the racketeers often phrase their demands as payment for protection from ( real or hypothetical ) threats from unspecified other parties ; though often , and almost always , such protection is simply abstinence of harm from the same party , and such is implied in the protection offer . Extortion is commonly practiced by organized crime . In some jurisdictions , actually obtaining the benefit is not required to commit the offense , and making a threat of violence which refers to a requirement of a payment of money or property to halt future violence is sufficient to commit the offense . Exaction refers not only to extortion or the demanding and obtaining of something through force , but additionally , in its formal definition , means the infliction of something such as pain and suffering or making somebody endure something unpleasant . The term extortion is often used metaphorically to refer to usury or to price-gouging , though neither is legally considered extortion . It is also often used loosely to refer to everyday situations where one person feels indebted against their will , to another , in order to receive an essential service or avoid legal consequences . Neither extortion nor blackmail requires a threat of a criminal act , such as violence , merely a threat used to elicit actions , money , or property from the object of the extortion . Such threats include the filing of reports ( true or not ) of criminal behavior to the police , revelation of damaging facts ( such as pictures of the object of the extortion in a compromising position ) , etc . In law extortion can refer to political corruption , such as selling one 's office or influence peddling , [ citation needed ] but in general vocabulary the word usually first brings to mind blackmail or protection rackets . The logical connection between the corruption sense of the word and the other senses is that to demand bribes in one 's official capacity is blackmail or racketeering in essence ( that is , you need access to this resource , the government restricts access to it through my office , and I will charge you unfairly and unlawfully for such access ) .",
  "/wiki/Racketeering": "A racket , according to the current common and most general definition , is an organized criminal act in which the criminal act is some form of substantial business , or a way to earn illegal money either regularly , or briefly but repeatedly . A racket is therefore generally a repeated or continuous organized criminal operation . However , according to the more specific definition , racketeering constitutes extortion or criminal coercion . Originally and often still specifically , a racket referred to a criminal act in which the perpetrator or perpetrators fraudulently offer a service that will not be put into effect , a service to solve a nonexistent problem , or to solve a problem that would not exist without the racket . Conducting a racket is racketeering . Particularly , the potential problem may be caused by the same party that offers to solve it , but that fact may be concealed , with the specific intent to engender continual patronage for this party . The most common example of a racket is the protection racket , which promises to protect the target business or person from dangerous individuals in the neighborhood and then either collects the money or causes damage to the business until the owner pays . The racket exists as both the problem and its solution , and it is used as a method of extortion . However , the term racket has expanded in definition and may now be used less strictly to refer to any continuous or repeated illegal organized crime operation , including those that do not necessarily involve fraudulent practices . For example , racket may be used to refer to the numbers racket or the drug racket , neither of which generally involve fraud or deception with regard to the intended clientele . Racketeering is most often associated with organized crime , and the term was coined by the Employers ' Association of Chicago in June 1927 in a statement about the influence of organized crime in the Teamsters union .",

Federal prosecutors indicted him for nineteen murders based on the grand jury testimony from Kevin Weeks and other former associates . Bulger was the brother of William Bulger , former President of the Massachusetts Senate . However adamantly denied by Bulger , the FBI admitted that he served as an informant for several years starting in 1975 . He provided information about the inner workings of the Patriarca crime family of Providence , the Italian-American crime group who were his rivals . In return , his corrupt and high-powered FBI handler ensured that his own crime group effectively went ignored . Beginning in 1997 , the news media exposed various criminal misconduct by officials tied to Bulger from federal , state , and local law enforcement . This caused great embarrassment to each of these agencies , but none more so than the FBI . On December 23 , 1994 , Bulger fled the Boston area and went into hiding after his former FBI handler , John Connolly , tipped him off about a pending RICO indictment against him . Bulger remained at large for 16 years . Bulger was finally apprehended along with his longtime girlfriend Catherine Greig outside an apartment complex in Santa Monica , California on June 22 , 2011 . By then he was 81 years old .",
  "/wiki/FBI_Ten_Most_Wanted_Fugitive": "The FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives is a most wanted list maintained by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) . The list arose from a conversation held in late 1949 between J. Edgar Hoover , Director of the FBI , and William Kinsey Hutchinson , International News Service ( the predecessor of the United Press International ) editor-in-chief , who were discussing ways to promote capture of the FBI 's toughest guys . This discussion turned into a published article , which received so much positive publicity that on March 14 , 1950 , the FBI officially announced the list to increase law enforcement 's ability to capture dangerous fugitives . Individuals are generally only removed from the list if the fugitive is captured , dies , or if the charges against them are dropped ; they are then replaced by a new entry selected by the FBI . In ten cases , the FBI removed individuals from the list after deciding that they were no longer a particularly dangerous menace to society . Machetero member V\u00edctor Manuel Gerena , added to the list in 1984 , was on the list for 32 years , which was longer than anyone else . Billie Austin Bryant spent the shortest amount of time on the list , being listed for two hours in 1969 . The oldest person to be added to the list was Eugene Palmer on May 29 , 2019 , at 80 years old . On rare occasions , the FBI will add a Number Eleven if that individual is extremely dangerous but the Bureau does not feel any of the current ten should be removed . Despite occasional references in the media , the FBI does not rank their list ; no suspect is considered # 1 on the FBI 's Most Wanted List or The Most Wanted . The list is commonly posted in public places such as post offices . In many cases , fugitives on the list have turned themselves in on becoming aware of their listing .",

Gotti and his brothers grew up in poverty and turned to a life of crime at an early age . Gotti quickly became one of the crime family 's biggest earners and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Gambino family underboss Aniello Dellacroce , operating out of the Ozone Park neighborhood of Queens . Early in his criminal career and following the FBI 's indictment of members of Gotti 's crew for selling narcotics , Gotti began to fear that he and his brother would be killed by Gambino boss Paul Castellano for selling drugs . As this fear continued to grow , and amidst growing dissent over the leadership of the crime family , Gotti organized the murder of Castellano in December 1985 and took over the family shortly thereafter , leaving Gotti as the boss of what has been described as America 's most powerful crime syndicate , and one that made hundreds of millions of dollars a year from racketeering , hijacking , loan sharking , drug trafficking , bookmaking , prostitution , extortion , pornography , illegal gambling and other criminal activities . At his peak , Gotti was one of the most powerful and dangerous crime bosses in the United States . During his era he became widely known for his outspoken personality and flamboyant style , which gained him favor with some of the general public . While his peers avoided attracting attention , especially from the media , Gotti became known as The Dapper Don , for his expensive clothes and personality in front of news cameras . He was later given the nickname The Teflon Don after three high-profile trials in the 1980s resulted in his acquittal , though it was later revealed that the trials had been tainted by jury tampering , juror misconduct , and witness intimidation . Law enforcement authorities continued gathering evidence against Gotti that helped lead to his downfall . According to Sammy Gravano , Gotti earned between $ 5-20 million per year during his tenure as Gambino boss . Gotti 's underboss Salvatore Sammy the Bull Gravano aided the FBI in finally convicting Gotti .",
  "/wiki/Gambino_Crime_Family": "The Gambino crime family ( pronounced [ \u0261am\u02c8bi\u02d0no ] ) is one of the Five Families that dominate organized crime activities in New York City , United States , within the nationwide criminal phenomenon known as the American Mafia . The group , which went through five bosses between 1910 and 1957 , is named after Carlo Gambino , boss of the family at the time of the McClellan hearings in 1963 , when the structure of organized crime first gained public attention . The group 's operations extend from New York and the eastern seaboard to California . Its illicit activities include labor and construction racketeering , gambling , loansharking , extortion , money laundering , prostitution , fraud , hijacking , and fencing . The family was one of the five families that were founded in New York after the Castellammarese War of 1931 . For most of the next quarter-century , it was a minor player in organized crime . Its most prominent member during this time was its underboss Albert Anastasia , who rose to infamy as the operating head of the underworld 's enforcement arm , Murder , Inc . He remained in power even after Murder , Inc. was smashed in the late 1940s , and took over his family in 1951 - by all accounts , after murdering the family 's founder Vincent Mangano . The rise of what was the most powerful crime family in America for a time began in 1957 , when Anastasia was assassinated while sitting in a barber chair at the Park Sheraton Hotel in Manhattan . Experts believe that Anastasia 's underboss Carlo Gambino helped orchestrate the hit to take over the family . Gambino partnered with Meyer Lansky to control gambling interests in Cuba . The family 's fortunes grew through 1976 , when Gambino appointed his brother-in-law Paul Castellano as boss upon his death .",
  "/wiki/Conspiracy_(crime)": "In criminal law , a conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime at some time in the future . Criminal law in some countries or for some conspiracies may require that at least one overt act be undertaken in furtherance of that agreement , to constitute an offense . There is no limit on the number participating in the conspiracy and , in most countries , no requirement that any steps have been taken to put the plan into effect ( compare attempts which require proximity to the full offense ) . For the purposes of concurrence , the actus reus is a continuing one and parties may join the plot later and incur joint liability and conspiracy can be charged where the co-conspirators have been acquitted or can not be traced . Finally , repentance by one or more parties does not affect liability ( unless , in some cases , it occurs before the parties have committed overt acts ) but may reduce their sentence . An unindicted co-conspirator , or unindicted conspirator , is a person or entity that is alleged in an indictment to have engaged in conspiracy , but who is not charged in the same indictment . Prosecutors choose to name persons as unindicted co-conspirators for a variety of reasons including grants of immunity , pragmatic considerations , and evidentiary concerns .",
  "/wiki/Loansharking": "A loan shark is a person who offers loans at extremely high interest rates , has strict terms of collection upon failure , and operates outside of the street ( outside of local authority ) . Loan sharking is usually illegal , but may be predatory lending with extremely high interest rates such as payday or title loans . [ page needed ] [ page needed ] An unintended consequence of poverty alleviation initiatives can be that loan sharks borrow from formal microfinance lenders and lend on to poor borrowers . Loan sharks sometimes enforce repayment by blackmail or threats of violence . Historically , many moneylenders skirted between legal and criminal activity .

  "/wiki/Illegal_gambling": "Gaming law is the set of rules and regulations that apply to the gaming or gambling industry . Gaming law is not a branch of law in the traditional sense but rather is a collection of several areas of law that include criminal law , regulatory law , constitutional law , administrative law , company law , contract law , and in some jurisdictions , competition law . At common law , gambling requires consideration , chance and prize , legal terms that must be analyzed by gaming lawyers within the context of any gaming operation .

  "/wiki/Obstruction_of_justice": "Obstruction of justice , in United States jurisdictions , is a crime consisting of obstructing prosecutors , investigators , or other government officials . Common law jurisdictions other than the United States tend to use the wider offense of perverting the course of justice . Obstruction is a broad crime that may include acts such as perjury , making false statements to officials , witness tampering , jury tampering , destruction of evidence , and many others . Obstruction also applies to overt coercion of court or government officials via the means of threats or actual physical harm , and also applying to deliberate sedition against a court official to undermine the appearance of legitimate authority .",
  "/wiki/Bribery": "Bribery is defined by Black 's Law Dictionary as the offering , giving , receiving , or soliciting of any item of value to influence the actions of an official , or other person , in charge of a public or legal duty . With regard to governmental operations , essentially , bribery is Corrupt solicitation , acceptance , or transfer of value in exchange for official action . Gifts of money or other items of value which are otherwise available to everyone on an equivalent basis , and not for dishonest purposes , is not bribery . Offering a discount or a refund to all purchasers is a legal rebate and is not bribery . For example , it is legal for an employee of a Public Utilities Commission involved in electric rate regulation to accept a rebate on electric service that reduces their cost for electricity , when the rebate is available to other residential electric customers . However , giving a discount specifically to that employee to influence them to look favorably on the electric utility 's rate increase applications would be considered bribery . A bribe is an illegal or unethical gift bestowed to influence the recipient 's conduct . It may be money , goods , rights in action , property , preferment , privilege , emolument , objects of value , advantage , or merely a promise to induce or influence the action , vote , or influence of a person in an official or public capacity .",
  "/wiki/Tax_evasion": "Tax evasion is the illegal evasion of taxes by individuals , corporations , and trusts . Tax evasion often entails taxpayers deliberately misrepresenting the true state of their affairs to the tax authorities to reduce their tax liability and includes dishonest tax reporting , such as declaring less income , profits or gains than the amounts actually earned , or overstating deductions . Tax evasion is an activity commonly associated with the informal economy . One measure of the extent of tax evasion ( the tax gap ) is the amount of unreported income , which is the difference between the amount of income that should be reported to the tax authorities and the actual amount reported . In contrast , tax avoidance is the legal use of tax laws to reduce one 's tax burden . Both tax evasion and avoidance can be viewed as forms of tax noncompliance , as they describe a range of activities that intend to subvert a state 's tax system , although such classification of tax avoidance is not indisputable , given that avoidance is lawful , within self-creating systems .",

Caporegime is an Italian word , which is used to signify the head of a family in Sicily , but has now come to mean a ranking member , similar to captain or senior sergeant in a military unit . In general , the term indicates the head of a branch of an organized crime syndicate who commands a crew of soldiers and reports directly to the Don ( Boss ) or an Underboss or Streetboss .

  "/wiki/Underboss": "Underboss ( Italian : sottocapo ) is a position within the leadership structure of certain organized crime groups , particularly in Sicilian , Greek , and Italian-American Mafia crime families . The underboss is second in command to the boss . The underboss is sometimes a family member , such as a son , who will take over the family if the boss is sick , killed , or imprisoned . However the position of street boss has somewhat challenged the rank of underboss in the modern era . The position was installed within the Genovese crime family since at least the mid 1960s . It has also been used in the Detroit crime family and the Chicago Outfit . The power of an underboss greatly varies ; some are marginal figures , while others are the most powerful individuals in the family . Traditionally they run day-to-day affairs of the family . In some crime families , the appointment is for life . If a new boss takes over a family with an existing underboss , that boss may marginalize or even murder the underboss appointed by his predecessor . On the other hand , if a boss is incarcerated , the underboss may become acting boss . As bosses often serve large periods of time in prison , an acting boss will often become the crime family 's effective boss .",

  "/wiki/Goodfellas": "Goodfellas ( stylized GoodFellas ) is a 1990 American crime film directed by Martin Scorsese , produced by Irwin Winkler and distributed by Warner Bros . It is an adaptation of the 1985 non-fiction book Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi , who co-wrote the screenplay with Scorsese . The film narrates the rise and fall of mob associate Henry Hill and his friends and family from 1955 to 1980 . Scorsese initially titled the film Wise Guy and postponed making it ; later , he and Pileggi changed the title to Goodfellas . To prepare for their roles in the film , Robert De Niro , Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta often spoke with Pileggi , who shared research material left over from writing the book . According to Pesci , improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals wherein Scorsese gave the actors freedom to do whatever they wanted . The director made transcripts of these sessions , took the lines he liked most and put them into a revised script , which the cast worked from during principal photography . Goodfellas premiered at the 47th Venice International Film Festival on September 9 , 1990 , and was released in the United States on September 19 , 1990 . The film was made on a budget of $ 25 million , and grossed $ 46.8 million . The critical consensus on Rotten Tomatoes calls it arguably the high point of Martin Scorsese 's career .

  "/wiki/Labor_union": "A trade union ( or a labor union in the U.S. ) is an association of workers forming a legal unit or legal personhood , usually called a bargaining unit , which acts as bargaining agent and legal representative for a unit of employees in all matters of law or right arising from or in the administration of a collective agreement . Labour unions typically fund the formal organization , head office , and legal team functions of the labour union through regular fees or union dues . The delegate staff of the labour union representation in the workforce are made up of workplace volunteers who are appointed by members in democratic elections . Today , unions are usually formed for the purpose of securing improvement in pay , benefits , working conditions , or social and political status through collective bargaining by the increased bargaining power wielded by the banding of the workers . The trade union , through an elected leadership and bargaining committee , bargains with the employer on behalf of union members ( rank and file members ) and negotiates labour contracts ( collective bargaining ) with employers . The most common purpose of these associations or unions is maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment . This may include the negotiation of wages , work rules , occupational health and safety standards , complaint procedures , rules governing status of employees including promotions , just cause conditions for termination , and employment benefits . Unions may organize a particular section of skilled workers ( craft unionism ) , a cross-section of workers from various trades ( general unionism ) , or attempt to organize all workers within a particular industry ( industrial unionism ) . The agreements negotiated by a union are binding on the rank and file members and the employer and in some cases on other non-member workers . Trade unions traditionally have a constitution which details the governance of their bargaining unit and also have governance at various levels of government depending on the industry that binds them legally to their negotiations and functioning . Originating in Great Britain , trade unions became popular in many countries during the Industrial Revolution . Trade unions may be composed of individual workers , professionals , past workers , students , apprentices or the unemployed .",

The five subjects are , in chronological order : the illegal drug trade , the seaport system , the city government and bureaucracy , education and schools , and the print news medium . The large cast consists mainly of actors who are little known for their other roles , as well as numerous real-life Baltimore and Maryland figures in guest and recurring roles . Simon has said that despite its framing as a crime drama , the show is really about the American city , and about how we live together . It 's about how institutions have an effect on individuals . Whether one is a cop , a longshoreman , a drug dealer , a politician , a judge or a lawyer , all are ultimately compromised and must contend with whatever institution to which they are committed .

  "/wiki/Money_laundering": "Money laundering is the illegal process of concealing the origins of money obtained illegally by passing it through a complex sequence of banking transfers or commercial transactions . The overall scheme of this process returns the money to the launderer in an obscure and indirect way . One problem of criminal activities is accounting for the proceeds without raising the suspicion of law enforcement agencies . Considerable time and effort may be put into strategies which enable the safe use of those proceeds without raising unwanted suspicion . Implementing such strategies is generally called money laundering . After money has been laundered , it can be used for legitimate purposes . Law enforcement agencies of many jurisdictions have set up sophisticated systems in an effort to detect suspicious transactions or activities , and many have set up international cooperative arrangements to assist each other in these endeavors . The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) estimates that The estimated amount of money laundered globally in one year is 2-5% of global GDP , or $ 800 billion - $ 2 trillion in current US dollars . In a number of legal and regulatory systems , the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial and business crime , and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system ( involving things such as securities , digital currencies , credit cards , and traditional currency ) , including terrorism financing and evasion of international sanctions . Most anti-money laundering laws openly conflate money laundering ( which is concerned with source of funds ) with terrorism financing ( which is concerned with destination of funds ) when regulating the financial system . Some countries treat obfuscation of sources of money as also constituting money laundering , whether it is intentional or by merely using financial systems or services that do not identify or track sources or destinations . Other countries define money laundering in such a way as to include money from activity that would have been a crime in that country , even if the activity was legal where the actual conduct occurred ."
