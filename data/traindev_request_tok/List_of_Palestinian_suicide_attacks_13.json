The Karni Crossing was also used by the residents of Netzarim since the Karni road was the only route to that isolated Israeli settlement on which Jewish travel was allowed after the 1994 implementation of the Oslo Accords . The Karni Crossing is managed by the Israel Airports Authority , unlike the Erez Crossing , which is managed by the Israel Defense Forces . When Hamas took over the Gaza Strip in June 2007 , Israel closed the terminal . The crossing has been affected by the Israeli Blockade of the Gaza Strip . At the end of March 2011 Israel permanently shut the Karni Crossing . According to the management , the crossing is named after Joseph Karni , an Israeli who had set up a modern packing warehouse in the Gaza Strip near the present-day cargo terminal shortly after Israel captured the strip in 1967 .

Israel , the United States and the European Union classify , either in whole or in part , Hamas as a terrorist organization . This classification is one among various and diverse international positions on the nature of Hamas . Russia , China , and Turkey are some countries who view Hamas in a positive light . Hamas was founded in 1987 , soon after the First Intifada broke out , as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood , which in its Gaza branch had been non-confrontational towards Israel , refrained from resistance , and was hostile to the PLO . Co-founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin stated in 1987 , and the Hamas Charter affirmed in 1988 , that Hamas was founded to liberate Palestine , including modern-day Israel , from Israeli occupation and to establish an Islamic state in the area that is now Israel , the West Bank and the Gaza Strip . The group has stated that it may accept a 10-year truce if Israel withdraws to the 1967 borders and allows Palestinian refugees from 1948 , including their descendants , to return to what is now Israel , although clarifying that this does not mean recognition of Israel or the end of the conflict .
