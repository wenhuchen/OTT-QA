  "/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox": "The Boston Red Sox are an American professional baseball team based in Boston , Massachusetts . They compete in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) as a member club of the American League ( AL ) East division . The team have won nine World Series championships , tied for the third-most of any MLB team , and they have played in 13 . Their most recent World Series appearance and win was in 2018 . In addition , they won the 1904 American League pennant , but were not able to defend their 1903 World Series championship when the New York Giants refused to participate in the 1904 World Series . Founded in 1901 as one of the American League 's eight charter franchises , the Red Sox ' home ballpark has been Fenway Park since 1912 . The Red Sox name was chosen by the team owner , John I. Taylor , circa 1908 , following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the Boston Red Stockings , including the forerunner of the Atlanta Braves . The Red Sox were a dominant team in the new league , defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World Series in 1903 and winning four more championships by 1918 . However , they then went into one of the longest championship droughts in baseball history , dubbed the Curse of the Bambino after its alleged inception due to the Red Sox ' sale of Babe Ruth to the rival New York Yankees two years after their world championship in 1918 , an 86-year wait before the team 's sixth World Championship in 2004 . The team 's history during that period was punctuated with some of the most memorable moments in World Series history , including Enos Slaughter 's mad dash in 1946 , the Impossible Dream of 1967 , Carlton Fisk 's home run in 1975 , and Bill Buckner 's error in 1986 . Following their victory in the 2018 World Series , they became the first team to win four World Series trophies in the 21st century , with championships in 2004 , 2007 , 2013 and 2018 . The team 's history has also been marked by the team 's intense rivalry with the New York Yankees , arguably the fiercest and most historic in North American professional sports .",

The name Royals pays homage to the American Royal , a livestock show , horse show , rodeo , and championship barbeque competition held annually in Kansas City since 1899 as well as the identical names of two former negro league baseball teams that played in the first half of the 20th century ( one a semi-pro team based in Kansas City in the 1910s and 1920s that toured the Midwest and a California Winter League team based in Los Angeles in the 1940s that was managed by Chet Brewer and included Satchel Paige and Jackie Robinson on its roster ) . The Los Angeles team had personnel connections to the Monarchs but could not use the Monarchs name . The name also fits into something of a theme for other professional sports franchises in the city , including the Kansas City Chiefs of the NFL , the former Kansas City Kings of the NBA , and the former Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro National League . In 1968 , the team held a name-the-team contest that received more than 17,000 entries . Sanford Porte , a bridge engineer from the suburb of Overland Park , Kansas was named the winner for his Royals entry . His reason had nothing to do with royalty . Kansas Citys new baseball team should be called the Royals because of Missouris billion-dollar livestock income , Kansas Citys position as the nations leading stocker and feeder market and the nationally known American Royal parade and pageant , Porte wrote . The team 's board voted 6-1 on the name , with the only opposition coming from team owner Ewing Kauffman , who eventually changed his vote and said the name had grown on him . Entering the American League in 1969 along with the Seattle Pilots , the club was founded by Kansas City businessman Ewing Kauffman .",

  "/wiki/Montreal_Expos": "The Montreal Expos ( French : Les Expos de Montr\u00e9al ) were a Canadian professional baseball team based in Montreal , Quebec . The Expos were the first Major League Baseball ( MLB ) franchise located outside the United States . They played in the National League ( NL ) East division from 1969 until 2004 . Following the 2004 season , the franchise relocated to Washington , D.C. , and became the Washington Nationals . Immediately after the minor league Triple-A Montreal Royals folded in 1960 , political leaders in Montreal sought an MLB franchise , and when the National League evaluated expansion candidates for the 1969 season , it awarded a team to Montreal . Named after the Expo 67 World 's Fair , the Expos originally played at Jarry Park Stadium before moving to Olympic Stadium in 1977 . The Expos failed to post a winning record in any of their first ten seasons . The team won its only division title in the strike-shortened 1981 season , but lost the 1981 National League Championship Series ( NLCS ) to the Los Angeles Dodgers . The team was sold in 1991 by its majority , founding owner , Charles Bronfman , to a consortium headed by Claude Brochu . Felipe Alou was promoted to the team 's field manager in 1992 , becoming MLB 's first Dominican-born manager . He led the team to four winning seasons , including 1994 , where the Expos had the best record in baseball before a players ' strike ended the season . Alou became the Expos leader in games managed ( 1,409 ) ."
