With about 10 million inhabitants , Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union . The official language is Hungarian , which is the most widely spoken Uralic language in the world , and among the few non-Indo-European languages to be widely spoken in Europe . Hungary 's capital and largest city is Budapest ; other major urban areas include Debrecen , Szeged , Miskolc , P\u00e9cs and Gy\u0151r . The territory of modern Hungary was for centuries inhabited by a succession of peoples , including Celts , Romans , Germanic tribes , Huns , West Slavs and the Avars . The foundations of the Hungarian state were established in the late ninth century CE by the Hungarian grand prince \u00c1rp\u00e1d following the conquest of the Carpathian Basin . His great-grandson Stephen I ascended the throne in 1000 , converting his realm to a Christian kingdom . By the 12th century , Hungary became a regional power , reaching its cultural and political height in the 15th century . Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 , Hungary was partially occupied by the Ottoman Empire ( 1541-1699 ) . It came under Habsburg rule at the turn of the 18th century , and later joined Austria to form the Austro-Hungarian Empire , a major European power . The Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed after World War I , and the subsequent Treaty of Trianon established Hungary 's current borders , resulting in the loss of 71% of its territory , 58% of its population , and 32% of ethnic Hungarians .",

Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture .

He is regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers in the history of cinema . Kurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936 , following a brief stint as a painter . After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter , he made his debut as a director during World War II with the popular action film Sanshiro Sugata ( a.k.a . Judo Saga ) . After the war , the critically acclaimed Drunken Angel ( 1948 ) , in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role , cemented the director 's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan . The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films . Rashomon , which premiered in Tokyo , became the surprise winner of the Golden Lion at the 1951 Venice Film Festival . The commercial and critical success of that film opened up Western film markets for the first time to the products of the Japanese film industry , which in turn led to international recognition for other Japanese filmmakers . Kurosawa directed approximately one film per year throughout the 1950s and early 1960s , including a number of highly regarded ( and often adapted ) films , such as Ikiru ( 1952 ) , Seven Samurai ( 1954 ) and Yojimbo ( 1961 ) .
