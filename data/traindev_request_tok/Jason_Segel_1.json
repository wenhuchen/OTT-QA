  "/wiki/Television_pilot": "A television pilot ( also known as a pilot or a pilot episode and sometimes marketed as a tele-movie ) is a standalone episode of a television series that is used to sell the show to a television network . At the time of its creation , the pilot is meant to be the testing ground to gauge whether a series will be successful . It is , therefore , a test episode for the intended television series , an early step in the series development , much like pilot studies serve as precursors to the start of larger activity . In the case of a successful television series , the pilot is commonly the very first episode that is aired of the particular series under its own name ; the episode that gets the series off the ground . A backdoor pilot is an episode of an existing successful series , featuring future tie-in characters of an up-and-coming television series or film . Its purpose is to introduce the characters to an audience before the creators decide on whether or not they intend to pursue a spin-off series with those characters . Television networks use pilots to determine whether an entertaining concept can be successfully realized and whether the expense of additional episodes is justified . A pilot is best thought of as a prototype of the show that is to follow , because elements often change from pilot to series . Variety estimates that only a little over a quarter of all pilots made for American television proceed to the series stage . Most pilots are never publicly screened if they fail to sell a series .",
