At the time of its initial release , The General , an action-adventure-comedy made toward the end of the silent era , was not well received by critics and audiences , resulting in mediocre box office returns ( about half a million dollars domestically , and approximately one million worldwide ) . Because of its then-huge budget ( $ 750,000 supplied by Metro chief Joseph Schenck ) and failure to turn a significant profit , Keaton lost his independence as a filmmaker and was forced into a restrictive deal with MGM . In 1954 the film entered the public domain in the United States because its claimant did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication .
