A character actor may play characters who are very different from the actor 's off-screen real-life personality , while in another sense a character actor may be one who specializes in minor roles . In either case , character actor roles are more substantial than bit parts or non-speaking extras . The term is used primarily to describe television and film actors . An early use of the term was in the 1883 edition of The Stage , which defined a character actor as one who portrays individualities and eccentricities .
