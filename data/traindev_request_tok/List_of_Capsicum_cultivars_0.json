Also known as the Halaby pepper , it starts as pods , which ripen to a burgundy color , and then are semi-dried , de-seeded , then crushed or coarsely ground . The pepper flakes are known in Turkey as pul biber , and in Armenia as Haleb biber . The pepper is named after Aleppo , a long-inhabited city along the Silk Road in northern Syria , and is grown in Syria and Turkey . Although a common condiment , its use in the United States outside Armenian , Syrian and Turkish immigrant communities was rare until the 20th century , with one source ( Los Angeles magazine ) dating its rise in use among the broader U.S. population according to the 1994 publication of The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean no-repeat ; background-position : right .1em center } .",
  "/wiki/Scoville_scale": "The Scoville scale is a measurement of the pungency ( spiciness or heat ) of chili peppers and other spicy foods , as recorded in Scoville Heat Units ( SHU ) based on the concentration of capsaicinoids , among which capsaicin is the predominant component . The scale is named after its creator , American pharmacist Wilbur Scoville , whose 1912 method is known as the Scoville organoleptic test . The Scoville organoleptic test is the most practical method for estimating SHU and is a subjective assessment derived from the capsaicinoid sensitivity by people experienced with eating hot chilis . An alternative method , using high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) can be used to analytically quantify the capsaicinoid content as an indicator of pungency . As of 2011 , the subjective organoleptic test has been largely superseded by analytical methods such as chromatography .",
