  "/wiki/Jihad_vs._McWorld": "Jihad vs. McWorld : How Globalism and Tribalism Are Reshaping the World is a 1995 book by American political scientist Benjamin Barber , in which he puts forth a theory that describes the struggle between McWorld ( globalization and the corporate control of the political process ) and Jihad ( Arabic term for struggle , here modified to mean tradition and traditional values , in the form of extreme nationalism or religious orthodoxy and theocracy ) . Benjamin Barber similarly questions the impact of economic globalization as well as its problems for democracy . The book was based on a March 1992 article by Barber first published in The Atlantic Monthly . The book employs the basic critique of neoliberalism seen in Barber 's earlier , seminal work Strong Democracy . As neoliberal economic theory - not to be confused with social liberalism - is the force behind globalization , this critique is relevant on a much larger scale . Unregulated market forces encounter parochial ( which he calls tribal ) forces . These tribal forces come in many varieties : religious , cultural , ethnic , regional , local , etc . As globalization imposes a culture of its own on a population , the tribal forces feel threatened and react . More than just economic , the crises that arise from these confrontations often take on a sacred quality to the tribal elements ; thus Barber 's use of the term Jihad ( although in the second edition , he expresses regret at having used that term ) . [ why ? ] Barber 's prognosis in Jihad vs McWorld is generally negative - he concludes that neither global corporations nor traditional cultures are supportive of democracy . He further posits that McWorld could ultimately win the struggle . He also proposes a model for small , local democratic institutions and civic engagement as the hope for an alternative to these two forces .",
