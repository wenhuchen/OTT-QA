Born Valentina Miloslavova in Babruysk ( which is now part of Belarus ) , she fled to Sverdlovsk - taken by her mother - in 1941 because of World War II . In Sverdlovsk , she took up speed skating , training at VSS Trud , and met and married fellow skater Boris Stenin . In 1959 , Stenina participated in her first World Allround Championships , held in her home town of Sverdlovsk , and she won silver . The next year , 1960 , was a very good year for Stenina : her husband Boris became Soviet Allround Champion , then Boris won silver at the European Allround Championships , then she herself became World Allround Champion , then Boris became World Allround Champion , and then at the 1960 Winter Olympics of Squaw Valley , she won silver on the 3,000 m behind Lidia Skoblikova , while Boris won bronze on the 1,500 m. In addition , Boris received the Oscar Mathisen Award that year . Valentina was not even considered for that award since women were not eligible to win it until 1987 . The following year ( 1961 ) , Stenina successfully defended her World Champion title in a grand way with victories in three distances and a second place in the fourth . Later that month , she won the Soviet National Championships - a title she would win a total number of four times in her career ( in 1961 , 1965 , 1966 , and 1967 ) . Stenina did not compete in 1962 but returned in 1963 , winning bronze at the World Championships . At the 1964 Winter Olympics of Innsbruck , she won another silver medal on the 3,000 m , again behind Skoblikova . Another silver medal at the World Championships would follow in 1965 and she became World Champion for the third and final time in 1966 , this time not winning any of the four distances . For her accomplishments , Stenina was awarded the title of Honorable Citizen of Sverdlovsk in 1967 - the year she won her third consecutive ( and fourth total ) Soviet National Championships title .",
