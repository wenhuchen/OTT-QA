The Thunnini comprise 15 species across five genera , the sizes of which vary greatly , ranging from the bullet tuna ( max . length : 50 cm ( 1.6 ft ) , weight : 1.8 kg ( 4 lb ) ) up to the Atlantic bluefin tuna ( max . length : 4.6 m ( 15 ft ) , weight : 684 kg ( 1,508 lb ) ) . The bluefin averages 2 m ( 6.6 ft ) , and is believed to live up to 50 years . Tuna , opah , and mackerel sharks are the only species of fish that can maintain a body temperature higher than that of the surrounding water . An active and agile predator , the tuna has a sleek , streamlined body , and is among the fastest-swimming pelagic fish - the yellowfin tuna , for example , is capable of speeds of up to 75 km/h ( 47 mph ) . Found in warm seas , it is extensively fished commercially , and is popular as a game fish . As a result of overfishing , some tuna species , such as the southern bluefin tuna , are threatened with extinction .",
  "/wiki/Ceviche": "Ceviche , also cebiche , seviche , or sebiche , ( Spanish pronunciation : [ se\u02c8\u03b2it\u0283e ] ) is a seafood dish that originated in Peru , typically made from fresh raw fish cured in citrus juices , such as lemon or lime , and spiced with aj\u00ed , chili peppers or other seasonings including chopped onions , salt , and coriander . Because the dish is not cooked with heat , it must be prepared and consumed fresh to minimize the risk of food poisoning . Ceviche is usually accompanied by side dishes that complement its flavours , such as sweet potato , lettuce , corn , avocado , or cooking banana . The dish is popular in the Pacific coastal regions of Latin America . Though the origin of ceviche is hotly debated , in Peru it is considered a national dish . Though archeological records suggest that something resembling ceviche may have been consumed in Peru nearly two thousand years ago , the dominant position Lima held through four centuries as the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru allowed for popular dishes such as ceviche to be brought to other Spanish colonies in the region , and in time they became a part of local cuisine by incorporating regional flavors and styles . Ceviche is now a popular international dish prepared in a variety of ways throughout the Americas , reaching the United States in the 1980s . The greatest variety of ceviches are found in Ecuador , Colombia , Chile , and Peru , but other distinctly unique styles can also be found in coastal Honduras , El Salvador , Belize , Guatemala , the United States , Mexico , Panama , and several other nations .",

The Norwegian Antarctic territories are often not considered a part of the Nordic countries due to their geographical location . Several regions in Europe such as the Northern Isles of Scotland share cultural or ethnic ties with Nordic nations , but are not considered to be Nordic countries . Scandinavians , who comprise over three quarters of the region 's population , are the largest group , followed by Finns , who comprise the majority in Finland ; other ethnic groups are the Greenlandic Inuit , the Sami people , and recent immigrants and their descendants . The native languages Swedish , Danish , Norwegian , Icelandic , and Faroese are all North Germanic languages rooted in Old Norse . Native non-Germanic languages are Finnish , Greenlandic and several Sami languages . The main religion is Lutheran Christianity . The Nordic countries have much in common in their way of life , history , religion and social structure . The Nordic countries have a long history of political unions and other close relations , but do not form a singular entity today . The Scandinavist movement sought to unite Denmark , Norway and Sweden into one country in the 19th century .

  "/wiki/Salmon": "Salmon /\u02c8s\u00e6m\u0259n/ is the common name for several species of ray-finned fish in the family Salmonidae . Other fish in the same family include trout , char , grayling and whitefish . Salmon are native to tributaries of the North Atlantic ( genus Salmo ) and Pacific Ocean ( genus Oncorhynchus ) . Many species of salmon have been introduced into non-native environments such as the Great Lakes of North America and Patagonia in South America . Salmon are intensively farmed in many parts of the world . Typically , salmon are anadromous : they hatch in fresh water , migrate to the ocean , then return to fresh water to reproduce . However , populations of several species are restricted to fresh water through their lives . Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact spot where they hatched to spawn . Tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true . A portion of a returning salmon run may stray and spawn in different freshwater systems ; the percent of straying depends on the species of salmon . Homing behavior has been shown to depend on olfactory memory . Salmon date back to the Neogene .",

  "/wiki/Middle_Ages": "In the history of Europe , the Middle Ages ( or medieval period ) lasted from the 5th to the 15th century . It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery . The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history : classical antiquity , the medieval period , and the modern period . The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early , High , and Late Middle Ages . Population decline , counterurbanisation , collapse of centralized authority , invasions , and mass migrations of tribes , which had begun in Late Antiquity , continued in the Early Middle Ages . The large-scale movements of the Migration Period , including various Germanic peoples , formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire . In the 7th century , North Africa and the Middle East - once part of the Byzantine Empire - came under the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate , an Islamic empire , after conquest by Muhammad 's successors . Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures , the break with classical antiquity was not complete . The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire , Rome 's direct continuation , survived in the Eastern Mediterranean and remained a major power . The empire 's law code , the Corpus Juris Civilis or Code of Justinian , was rediscovered in Northern Italy in 1070 and became widely admired later in the Middle Ages . In the West , most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions . Monasteries were founded as campaigns to Christianise pagan Europe continued .",
  "/wiki/Osmosis": "Osmosis ( /\u0252z\u02c8mo\u028a.s\u026as/ ) is the spontaneous net movement of solvent molecules through a selectively permeable membrane into a region of higher solute concentration , in the direction that tends to equalize the solute concentrations on the two sides . It may also be used to describe a physical process in which any solvent moves across a selectively permeable membrane ( permeable to the solvent , but not the solute ) separating two solutions of different concentrations . Osmosis can be made to do work . Osmotic pressure is defined as the external pressure required to be applied so that there is no net movement of solvent across the membrane . Osmotic pressure is a colligative property , meaning that the osmotic pressure depends on the molar concentration of the solute but not on its identity . Osmosis is a vital process in biological systems , as biological membranes are semipermeable . In general , these membranes are impermeable to large and polar molecules , such as ions , proteins , and polysaccharides , while being permeable to non-polar or hydrophobic molecules like lipids as well as to small molecules like oxygen , carbon dioxide , nitrogen , and nitric oxide . Permeability depends on solubility , charge , or chemistry , as well as solute size . Water molecules travel through the plasma membrane , tonoplast membrane ( vacuole ) or protoplast by diffusing across the phospholipid bilayer via aquaporins ( small transmembrane proteins similar to those responsible for facilitated diffusion and ion channels ) . Osmosis provides the primary means by which water is transported into and out of cells . The turgor pressure of a cell is largely maintained by osmosis across the cell membrane between the cell interior and its relatively hypotonic environment .",
  "/wiki/Brine": "Brine is a high-concentration solution of salt in water . In different contexts , brine may refer to salt solutions ranging from about 3.5% ( a typical concentration of seawater , on the lower end of solutions used for brining foods ) up to about 26% ( a typical saturated solution , depending on temperature ) . Lower levels of concentration are called by different names : fresh water , brackish water , and saline water . Brine naturally occurs on the Earth 's surface ( salt lakes ) , crust , and within brine pools on ocean bottom . High-concentration brine lakes typically emerge due to evaporation of ground saline water on high ambient temperatures . Brine is used for food processing and cooking ( pickling and brining ) , for de-icing of roads and other structures , and in a number of technological processes . It is also a by-product of many industrial processes , such as desalination , and may pose an environmental risk due to its corrosive and toxic effects , so it requires wastewater treatment for proper disposal or further utilization ( fresh water recovery ) .",

They lie south-southeast of Japan , west-southwest of Hawaii , north of New Guinea and east of the Philippines , demarcating the Philippine Sea 's eastern limit . They are found in the northern part of the western Oceanic sub-region of Micronesia , and are politically divided into two jurisdictions of the United States : the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and , at the southern end of the chain , the territory of Guam . The islands were named after the influential Spanish queen Mariana of Austria following their colonization in the 17th century . Spanish navigators , beginning with Magellan in the early 16th century , were the first Europeans to arrive ; eventually Spain annexed and colonized the archipelago , establishing their capital on the largest island , Guam . The Marianas were the first islands Magellan encountered after traversing the Pacific from the southern tip of South America , and the fruits found there helped save the survivors from scurvy , which had already killed dozens of crewmembers . The indigenous inhabitants are the Chamorro people . Archaeologists in 2013 reported findings which indicated that the people who first settled the Marianas arrived there after making what may have been at the time the longest uninterrupted ocean voyage in human history . They further reported findings which suggested that Tinian is likely to have been the first island in Oceania to have been settled by humans .",

It been said that no matter where they are in the world , sticky rice will always be the glue that holds the Lao communities together , connecting them to their culture and to Laos . Often the Lao will refer to themselves as luk khao niaow , which can be translated as children or descendants of sticky rice . The most famous Lao dish is larb ( Lao : \u0ea5\u0eb2\u0e9a ; sometimes also spelled laab or laap ) , a spicy mixture of marinated meat or fish that is sometimes raw ( prepared like ceviche ) with a variable combination of herbs , greens , and spices . Another Lao invention is a spicy green papaya salad dish known as tam mak hoong ( Lao : \u0e95\u0ecd\u0eb2\u0edd\u0eb2\u0e81\u0eab\u0eb8\u0ec8\u0e87 ) , more famously known to the West as som tam . Lao cuisine has many regional variations , corresponding in part to the fresh foods local to each region . A French legacy is still evident in the capital city , Vientiane , where baguettes are sold on the street and French restaurants are common and popular , which were first introduced when Laos was a part of French Indochina .",
