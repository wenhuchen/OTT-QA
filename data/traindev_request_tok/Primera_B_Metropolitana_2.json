The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores ; both are now neighborhoods of the city .

Founded in 1908 by Dr. Jos\u00e9 Soldati as Villa Lugano , the area originally included what today is the Villa Lugano neighborhood . The first lots were sold in 1911 , but the area 's topography led to frequent flooding , and much of the area was left undeveloped . The neighborhood was bolstered by the establishment of the large La Vascongada dairy in 1930 , but the opening of a landfill in 1936 dampened hopes for the area 's future growth . Villa Soldati was formally demarcated as such in 1972 . On the morning of June 11 , 1962 , a train struck a bus on a level crossing in Villa Soldati , killing 43 people , mostly children The area saw dramatic changes during the tenure of military-appointed Mayor Osvaldo Cacciatore , when he attempted to revitalize the ward ( the city 's poorest ) with the construction of the Parque de la Ciudad , an amusement park . Built after 1977 over the former landfill , the bankruptcy of the developer ( Interama ) in 1980 led to controversy when Cacciatore had the city absorb the group 's debts of over US $ 100 million ; in the end , the amusement park 's planned 15 million yearly visitors never came ( attendance has never topped 1 million ) .
