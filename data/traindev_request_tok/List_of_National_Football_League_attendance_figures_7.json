The surface of the field for most of its existence was natural bluegrass , but for nine seasons , from 1970 to 1978 , the stadium had artificial turf . A sliding pit configuration , with dirt cut-outs only around the bases , was installed in 1971 , primarily to keep the dust down in the breezy conditions .",
