  "/wiki/Common_marmoset": "The common marmoset ( Callithrix jacchus ) is a New World monkey . It originally lived on the northeastern coast of Brazil , in the states of Piaui , Paraiba , Cear\u00e1 , Rio Grande do Norte , Pernambuco , Alagoas and Bahia . Through release ( both intentional and unintentional ) of captive individuals , it has expanded its range since the 1920s to Southeast Brazil ( its first sighting in the wild for Rio de Janeiro was in 1929 ) , where it became an invasive species , raising concerns about genetic pollution of similar species , such as the buffy-tufted marmoset ( Callithrix aurita ) , and predation upon bird nestlings and eggs . The whole-genome sequence of a female common marmoset was published on 20 July 2014 . It became the first New World Monkey to have its genome sequenced .",

He is known as the father of modern taxonomy . Many of his writings were in Latin , and his name is rendered in Latin as Carolus Linn\u00e6us ( after 1761 Carolus a Linn\u00e9 ) . Linnaeus was born in the countryside of Sm\u00e5land in southern Sweden . He received most of his higher education at Uppsala University and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730 . He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738 , where he studied and also published the first edition of his Systema Naturae in the Netherlands . He then returned to Sweden where he became professor of medicine and botany at Uppsala . In the 1740s , he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals . In the 1750s and 1760s , he continued to collect and classify animals , plants , and minerals , while publishing several volumes . He was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe at the time of his death . Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau sent him the message : Tell him I know no greater man on earth . Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote : With the exception of Shakespeare and Spinoza , I know no one among the no longer living who has influenced me more strongly .",

It ranges from Bahia to Paran\u00e1 , and as far inland as Goi\u00e1s , between 14 and 25 degrees south of the equator , and can commonly be seen in the City of Rio de Janeiro where it was introduced . This marmoset typically resides in rainforests , living an arboreal life high in the trees , but below the canopy . They are only rarely spotted near the ground .",

He was a colleague of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and expanded and defended Lamarck 's evolutionary theories . Geoffroy 's scientific views had a transcendental flavor ( unlike Lamarck 's materialistic views ) and were similar to those of German morphologists like Lorenz Oken . He believed in the underlying unity of organismal design , and the possibility of the transmutation of species in time , amassing evidence for his claims through research in comparative anatomy , paleontology , and embryology .",

Of all the marmosets , it has the southernmost range . The buffy-tufted marmoset resembles the common marmoset but is somewhat larger . It has grey-black skin , and the most obvious differences from the common marmoset are its whitish face ( skulllike facial mask ) , brown crown and shorter ear tufts . The buffy-tufted marmoset lives in coastal forests from sea-level up to 500 m. It is diurnal and arboreal , living almost all its life in the trees . It lives in small groups of two to eight animals . Unlike most other marmosets , the buffy-tufted marmoset almost exclusively eats insects . It does not eat tree sap , which is why it has a very small snout . Aside from the insects the buffy-tufted marmoset consumes , this monkey also consumes varying types of flowering plants , such as Combretaceae and legumes , as well as gum , soursops and cacti . Little is known about the buffy-tufted marmoset reproductive patterns . Gestation is approximately 170 days and births are typically of twin offspring .",

They reach a size of 18 to 28 cm ( 7.1 to 11.0 in ) and weigh from 300 to 400 g ( 11 to 14 oz ) . Silvery marmosets are diurnal and arboreal , using their claws to climb trees . Originally rain forest inhabitants , plantations have caused them to expand their range . They spend the night in tree hollows or in very close vegetation . They live together in small groups and mark their territory with scent glands , driving out intruders by shouting or by facial expressions ( lowered brows and guarded lips ) . The diet of the silvery marmosets predominantly consists of tree sap . To a lesser extent , they also eat bird eggs , fruit , insects , and small vertebrates . After a 145-day gestation period , the female bears two ( or rarely three ) offspring . As is the case for many callitrichids , the father and the other group members take part with the raising of the offspring .",

  "/wiki/Roosmalens'_dwarf_marmoset": "The Roosmalens ' dwarf marmoset ( Callibella humilis ) , also known as the black-crowned dwarf marmoset , is a small New World monkey native to the Amazon Rainforest , on the east bank of the lower Madeira River , and the west bank of the Aripuan\u00e3 River , in Brazil . It has the smallest distribution of any primate in Amazonia . This marmoset has several unique attributes , which results in it usually being placed in the monotypic genus Callibella . Some authors , however , argue that the species is better placed in the genus Mico . It was first described in 1998 , after it was discovered ca . 400 km ( 250 mi ) south of the city of Manaus . In 1996 , Marc van Roosmalen , the discoverer , was given a milk can by a river trader with one of these monkeys inside . He suspected it was a new species , a relative of the pygmy marmoset , but at that point was unaware of its exact origin . Following a lengthy expedition , it was discovered near the town of Nova Olinda in southeastern Amazonas . The species has been subsequently recorded further south , along the west banks of Rio Roosevelt . Adult Roosmalens ' dwarf marmosets have a total length of 38-39 cm ( 15-15\u00bd in ) , incl . a tail of 22-24 cm ( 8\u00bd-9\u00bd in ) , and weigh 150-185 g ( 5\u00bd-6\u00bd oz ) .",

  "/wiki/Pygmy_marmoset": "The pygmy marmoset ( Cebuella pygmaea ) is a small species of New World monkey native to rainforests of the western Amazon Basin in South America . The species is notable for being the smallest monkey and one of the smallest primates in the world , at just over 100 grams ( 3.5 oz ) ( Madame Berthe 's mouse lemur is smaller ) . It is generally found in evergreen and river-edge forests and is a gum-feeding specialist , or a gummivore . About 83% of the pygmy marmoset population lives in stable troops of two to nine individuals , including a dominant male , a breeding female , and up to four successive litters of offspring . The modal size of a standard stable troop would be six individuals . Although most groups consist of family members , some may also include one or two additional adult members . Members of the group communicate using a complex system including vocal , chemical , and visual signals . Three main calling signals depend on the distance the call needs to travel . These monkeys may also make visual displays when threatened or to show dominance . Chemical signaling using secretions from glands on the chest and genital area allow the female to indicate to the male when she is able to reproduce . The female gives birth to twins twice a year and the parental care is shared between the group . The pygmy marmoset has been viewed as somewhat different from typical marmosets , most of which are classified in the genera Callithrix and Mico , and thus is accorded its own genus , Cebuella , within the family Callitrichidae .",
