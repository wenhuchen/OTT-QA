  "/wiki/Treasury_of_Atreus": "The Treasury of Atreus or Tomb of Agamemnon is a large tholos or beehive tomb on Panagitsa Hill at Mycenae , Greece , constructed during the Bronze Age around 1250 BC . The stone lintel above the doorway weighs 120 tons , with approximate dimensions 8.3 x 5.2 x 1.2m , the largest in the world . The tomb was used for an unknown period . Mentioned by the Roman geographer Pausanias in the 2nd century AD , it was still visible in 1879 when the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann discovered the shaft graves under the agora in the Acropolis at Mycenae . The tomb perhaps held the remains of the sovereign who completed the reconstruction of the fortress or one of his successors . The grave is in the style of the other tholoi of Mycenaean Greece , of which there are nine in total around the citadel of Mycenae and many more in the Argolid . However , in its monumental shape and grandeur it is one of the most impressive monuments surviving from the Mycenaean period . The tomb has probably no relationship with either Atreus or Agamemnon - legendary rulers of Mycenae or Argos in the works of Homer , in the Epic Cycle , and the Oresteia - as archaeologists believe that the Mycenaean sovereign buried there ruled at an earlier date than king ; it was named thus by Heinrich Schliemann and the name has been used ever since . [ citation needed ] The historicity of the Trojan War , to which Schliemann sought to connect both Mycenae and Hisarlik , is a matter of long-standing and ongoing debate .",
  "/wiki/Mycenae": "Mycenae ( Ancient Greek : \u039c\u03c5\u03ba\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 or \u039c\u03c5\u03ba\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7 , Myc\u0113n\u0113 ) is an archaeological site near Mykines in Argolis , north-eastern Peloponnese , Greece . It is located about 120 kilometres ( 75 miles ) south-west of Athens ; 11 kilometres ( 7 miles ) north of Argos ; and 48 kilometres ( 30 miles ) south of Corinth . The site is 19 kilometres ( 12 miles ) inland from the Saronic Gulf and built upon a hill rising 900 feet above sea level . In the second millennium BC , Mycenae was one of the major centres of Greek civilization , a military stronghold which dominated much of southern Greece , Crete , the Cyclades and parts of southwest Anatolia . The period of Greek history from about 1600 BC to about 1100 BC is called Mycenaean in reference to Mycenae . At its peak in 1350 BC , the citadel and lower town had a population of 30,000 and an area of 32 hectares . The first correct identification of Mycenae in modern literature was during a survey conducted by Francesco Grimani , commissioned by the Provveditore Generale of the Kingdom of the Morea in 1700 , who used Pausanias 's description of the Lion Gate to identify the ruins of Mycenae .",

As a polity it included large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe , North Africa and West Asia ruled by emperors . From the accession of Caesar Augustus to the military anarchy of the third century , it was a principate with Italy as metropole of the provinces and its city of Rome as sole capital ( 27 BC - 286 AD ) . Although fragmented briefly during the military crisis , the empire was forcibly reassembled , then ruled by multiple emperors who shared rule over the Western Roman Empire ( based in Milan and later in Ravenna ) and over the Eastern Roman Empire ( based in Nicomedia and later in Constantinople ) . Rome remained the nominal capital of both parts until 476 AD , when it sent the imperial insignia to Constantinople ( Byzantium - Ancient Greek : \u0392\u03c5\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd , Byz\u00e1ntion ) following the capture of Ravenna by the barbarians of Odoacer and the subsequent deposition of Romulus Augustus . The fall of the Western Roman Empire to Germanic kings , along with the hellenization of the Eastern Roman Empire into the Byzantine Empire , conventionally marks the end of Ancient Rome and the beginning of the Middle Ages . The predecessor state of the Roman Empire , the Roman Republic ( which had replaced Rome 's monarchy in the 6th century BC ) became severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflicts . In the mid-1st century BC Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC . Civil wars and proscriptions continued , culminating in the victory of Octavian , Caesar 's adopted son , over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC . The following year Octavian conquered Ptolemaic Egypt , ending the Hellenistic period that had begun with the conquests of Alexander the Great of Macedon in the 4th century BC . Octavian 's power then became unassailable , and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title Augustus , effectively making him the first Roman emperor . The first two centuries of the Empire saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana ( Roman Peace ) .",

Thermae usually refers to the large imperial bath complexes , while balneae were smaller-scale facilities , public or private , that existed in great numbers throughout Rome . Most Roman cities had at least one - if not many - such buildings , which were centres not only for bathing , but socializing and reading as well . Bath-houses were also provided for wealthy private villas , town houses , and for forts . They were supplied with water from an adjacent river or stream , or within cities by aqueduct . The water would be heated by fire then channelled into the caldarium ( hot bathing room ) . The design of baths is discussed by Vitruvius in De architectura ( V.10 ) .",

The architect of the complex is said to be Apollodorus of Damascus . The baths were being utilized mainly as a recreational and social center by Roman citizens , both men and women , as late as the early 5th century . The complex seems to have been deserted soon afterwards as a cemetery dated to the 5th century ( which remained in use until the 7th century ) has been found in front of the northeastern exedra . The baths were thus no longer in use at the time of the siege of Rome by the Ostrogoths in 537 ; with the destruction of the Roman aqueducts , all thermae were abandoned , as was the whole of the now-waterless Mons Oppius .

It was completed by the emperor Hadrian and probably dedicated about 126 AD . Its date of construction is uncertain , because Hadrian chose not to inscribe the new temple but rather to retain the inscription of Agrippa 's older temple , which had burned down . The building is cylindrical with a portico of large granite Corinthian columns ( eight in the first rank and two groups of four behind ) under a pediment . A rectangular vestibule links the porch to the rotunda , which is under a coffered concrete dome , with a central opening ( oculus ) to the sky . Almost two thousand years after it was built , the Pantheon 's dome is still the world 's largest unreinforced concrete dome . The height to the oculus and the diameter of the interior circle are the same , 43 metres ( 142 ft ) . It is one of the best-preserved of all Ancient Roman buildings , in large part because it has been in continuous use throughout its history and , since the 7th century , the Pantheon has been in use as a church dedicated to St. Mary and the Martyrs ( Latin : Sancta Maria ad Martyres ) but informally known as Santa Maria Rotonda . The square in front of the Pantheon is called Piazza della Rotonda . The Pantheon is a state property , managed by Italy 's Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism through the Polo Museale del Lazio ; in 2013 it was visited by over 6 million people . The Pantheon 's large circular domed cella , with a conventional temple portico front , was unique in Roman architecture . Nevertheless , it became a standard exemplar when classical styles were revived , and has been copied many times by later architects .",

Florence was a centre of medieval European trade and finance and one of the wealthiest cities of that era . It is considered by many academics the birthplace of the Renaissance , and has been called the Athens of the Middle Ages . Its turbulent political history includes periods of rule by the powerful Medici family and numerous religious and republican revolutions . From 1865 to 1871 the city served as the capital of the Kingdom of Italy ( established in 1861 ) . The Florentine dialect forms the base of Standard Italian and it became the language of culture throughout Italy due to the prestige of the masterpieces by Dante Alighieri , Petrarch , Giovanni Boccaccio , Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli and Francesco Guicciardini .

In addition to the standard periodization , proponents of a long Renaissance put its beginning in the 14th century and its end in the 17th century . The traditional view focuses more on the early modern aspects of the Renaissance and argues that it was a break from the past , but many historians today focus more on its medieval aspects and argue that it was an extension of the Middle Ages . The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was its version of humanism , derived from the concept of Roman Humanitas and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy , such as that of Protagoras , who said that Man is the measure of all things . This new thinking became manifest in art , architecture , politics , science and literature . Early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the recycled knowledge of how to make concrete . Although the invention of metal movable type sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century , the changes of the Renaissance were not uniformly experienced across Europe : the very first traces appear in Italy as early as the late 13th century , in particular with the writings of Dante and the paintings of Giotto . As a cultural movement , the Renaissance encompassed innovative flowering of Latin and vernacular literatures , beginning with the 14th-century resurgence of learning based on classical sources , which contemporaries credited to Petrarch ; the development of linear perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality in painting ; and gradual but widespread educational reform . In politics , the Renaissance contributed to the development of the customs and conventions of diplomacy , and in science to an increased reliance on observation and inductive reasoning . Although the Renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual pursuits , as well as social and political upheaval , it is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo , who inspired the term Renaissance man . The Renaissance began in the 14th century in Florence , Italy . Various theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics , focusing on a variety of factors including the social and civic peculiarities of Florence at the time : its political structure , the patronage of its dominant family , the Medici , and the migration of Greek scholars and their texts to Italy following the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks .",

Its capital is Dresden , and its largest city is Leipzig . Saxony is the tenth largest of Germany 's sixteen states , with an area of 18,413 square kilometres ( 7,109 sq mi ) , and the sixth most populous , with 4 million people . The history of the state of Saxony spans more than a millennium . It has been a medieval duchy , an electorate of the Holy Roman Empire , a kingdom , and twice a republic . The area of the modern state of Saxony should not be confused with Old Saxony , the area inhabited by Saxons . Old Saxony corresponds roughly to the modern German states of Lower Saxony , Saxony-Anhalt , and the Westphalian part of North Rhine-Westphalia .",
  "/wiki/Franz_Dischinger": "Franz Dischinger ( 8 October 1887 - 9 January 1953 ) was a pioneering German civil and structural engineer , responsible for the development of the modern cable-stayed bridge . He was also a pioneer of the use of prestressed concrete , patenting the technique of external prestressing ( where the prestressing bars or tendons are not encased in the concrete ) in 1934 . After completing Gymnasium in Karlsruhe , Germany , Dischinger went to the Technical University in Karlsruhe where he studied and received a degree in building engineering . After getting his degree in 1913 , he then started working for Dyckerhoff & Widmann A.G. , an engineering firm in Germany . In 1928 Dischinger went back to school to receive his doctorate at the Technical School in Dresden , Germany . In 1922 , he designed the Zeiss Planetarium in Jena with Walther Bauersfeld , using a thin-shell concrete roof in the shape of a hemisphere . Their system was subsequently patented , and Dischinger published a paper on the relevant mathematics in 1928 . Since the previous stay and cable bridges in Dischinger 's opinion were both flawed technically and disturbing looking , he decided to publish his own cable stayed bridge . This design has been used ever since , more than 100 of these cable stayed bridges have been built . For the 1938 design of a rail suspension bridge ( not built ) , he had studied historical bridges incorporating inclined stay elements , such as those by Ferdinand Arnodin and John Roebling . He went on to design the 183 m span Str\u00f6msund Bridge in Sweden , completed in 1955 and generally considered the first of the modern tradition of cable-stayed bridges , although there had been many isolated examples of the bridge form before then . This employed a steel deck and cables , with large spacings between the stays typical of the early designs .",

'White City ' , pronounced [ be\u01d2\u0261rad ] ( listen ) ; names in other languages ) is the capital and largest city of Serbia . It is located at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers and the crossroads of the Pannonian Plain and the Balkan Peninsula . The urban area of Belgrade has a population of 1.23 million , while nearly 1.7 million people live within the administrative limits of the City of Belgrade ( which encompasses almost all of its metropolitan area ) , a quarter of the total population of Serbia . One of the most important prehistoric cultures of Europe , the Vin\u010da culture , evolved within the Belgrade area in the 6th millennium BC . In antiquity , Thraco-Dacians inhabited the region and , after 279 BC , Celts settled the city , naming it Singid\u016bn . It was conquered by the Romans under the reign of Augustus and awarded Roman city rights in the mid-2nd century . It was settled by the Slavs in the 520s , and changed hands several times between the Byzantine Empire , the Frankish Empire , the Bulgarian Empire , and the Kingdom of Hungary before it became the seat of the Serbian king Stefan Dragutin in 1284 . In 1521 , Belgrade was conquered by the Ottoman Empire and became the seat of the Sanjak of Smederevo . It frequently passed from Ottoman to Habsburg rule , which saw the destruction of most of the city during the Austro-Ottoman wars . Belgrade was again named the capital of Serbia in 1841 . Northern Belgrade remained the southernmost Habsburg post until 1918 , when it was attached to the city , due to former Austro-Hungarian territories becoming the part of the new Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes after World War I .",

It borders Hungary to the north , Romania to the northeast , Bulgaria to the southeast , North Macedonia to the south , Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to the west , and Montenegro to the southwest . The country claims a border with Albania through the disputed territory of Kosovo . [ a ] Serbia 's population numbers approximately seven million . Its capital , Belgrade , ranks among the largest citi\u0435s in southeastern Europe . Inhabited since the Paleolithic Age , the territory of modern-day Serbia faced Slavic migrations to Southeastern Europe in the 6th century , establishing several regional states in the early Middle Ages at times recognised as tributaries to the Byzantine , Frankish and Hungarian kingdoms . The Serbian Kingdom obtained recognition by the Holy See and Constantinople in 1217 , reaching its territorial apex in 1346 as the relatively short-lived Serbian Empire . By the mid-16th century , the Ottomans annexed the entirety of modern-day Serbia ; their rule was at times interrupted by the Habsburg Empire , which began expanding towards Central Serbia from the end of the 17th century while maintaining a foothold in Vojvodina . In the early 19th century , the Serbian Revolution established the nation-state as the region 's first constitutional monarchy , which subsequently expanded its territory . Following disastrous casualties in World War I , and the subsequent unification of the former Habsburg crownland of Vojvodina ( and other lands ) with Serbia , the country co-founded Yugoslavia with other South Slavic peoples , which would exist in various political formations until the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s . During the breakup of Yugoslavia , Serbia formed a union with Montenegro , which was peacefully dissolved in 2006 and restoring Serbia 's independence as a sovereign state for the first time since the late 1910s . In 2008 , the parliament of the province of Kosovo unilaterally declared independence , with mixed responses from the international community .",

  "/wiki/Prestressed_concrete": "Prestressed concrete is a form of concrete used in construction . It is substantially prestressed ( compressed ) during its fabrication , in a manner that strengthens it against tensile forces which will exist when in service . :3-5 This compression is produced by the tensioning of high-strength tendons located within or adjacent to the concrete and is done to improve the performance of the concrete in service . Tendons may consist of single wires , multi-wire strands or threaded bars that are most commonly made from high-tensile steels , carbon fiber or aramid fiber . :52-59 The essence of prestressed concrete is that once the initial compression has been applied , the resulting material has the characteristics of high-strength concrete when subject to any subsequent compression forces and of ductile high-strength steel when subject to tension forces . This can result in improved structural capacity and/or serviceability compared with conventionally reinforced concrete in many situations . :6 In a prestressed concrete member , the internal stresses are introduced in a planned manner so that the stresses resulting from the superimposed loads are counteracted to the desired degree . Prestressed concrete is used in a wide range of building and civil structures where its improved performance can allow for longer spans , reduced structural thicknesses , and material savings compared with simple reinforced concrete . Typical applications include high-rise buildings , residential slabs , foundation systems , bridge and dam structures , silos and tanks , industrial pavements and nuclear containment structures . First used in the late-nineteenth century , prestressed concrete has developed beyond pre-tensioning to include post-tensioning , which occurs after the concrete is cast . Tensioning systems may be classed as either monostrand , where each tendon 's strand or wire is stressed individually , or multi-strand , where all strands or wires in a tendon are stressed simultaneously . Tendons may be located either within the concrete volume ( internal prestressing ) or wholly outside of it ( external prestressing ) ."
