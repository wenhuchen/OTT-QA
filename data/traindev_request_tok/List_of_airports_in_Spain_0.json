  "/wiki/Autonomous_communities_of_Spain": "In Spain , an autonomous community ( Spanish : comunidad aut\u00f3noma ) is a first-level political and administrative division , created in accordance with the Spanish constitution of 1978 , with the aim of guaranteeing limited autonomy of the nationalities and regions that make up Spain . Spain is not a federation , but a decentralized unitary state . While sovereignty is vested in the nation as a whole , represented in the central institutions of government , the nation has , in variable degrees , devolved power to the communities , which , in turn , exercise their right to self-government within the limits set forth in the constitution and their autonomous statutes . Each community has its own set of devolved powers ; typically those communities with a stronger local nationalism have more powers ; this type of devolution has been called asymmetrical . Some scholars have referred to the resulting system as a federal system in all but name , or a federation without federalism . There are 17 autonomous communities and two autonomous cities that are collectively known as autonomies . [ i ] The two autonomous cities have the right to become autonomous communities , but neither has yet exercised it . This unique framework of territorial administration is known as the State of Autonomies . [ ii ] The autonomous communities are governed according to the constitution and their own organic laws known as Statutes of Autonomy , [ iii ] which define the competences that they assume . Since devolution was intended to be asymmetrical in nature , the scope of competences vary for each community , but all have the same parliamentary structure .",

Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC , and was made a Roman province in the 3rd century AD . In 410 , the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga ( Portugal ) ; this kingdom was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585 . In 711 , the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate invaded the Iberian Peninsula conquering the Visigoth kingdom of Hispania by 718 , but soon Galicia was incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias by 740 . During the Middle Ages , the kingdom of Galicia was occasionally ruled by its own kings , but most of the time it was leagued to the kingdom of Leon and later to that of Castile , while maintaining its own legal and customary practices and culture . From the 13th century on , the kings of Castile , as kings of Galicia , appointed an Adiantado-m\u00f3r , whose attributions passed to the Governor and Captain General of the Kingdom of Galiza from the last years of the 15th century .
