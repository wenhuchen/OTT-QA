  "/wiki/Nintendo_DS": "The Nintendo DS , [ b ] or simply DS , is a dual-screen handheld game console developed and released by Nintendo . The device released globally across 2004 and 2005 . The DS , an acronym for Developers ' System or Dual Screen , introduced distinctive new features to handheld gaming : two LCD screens working in tandem ( the bottom one being a touchscreen ) , a built-in microphone , and support for wireless connectivity . Both screens are encompassed within a clamshell design similar to the Game Boy Advance SP . The Nintendo DS also features the ability for multiple DS consoles to directly interact with each other over Wi-Fi within a short range without the need to connect to an existing wireless network . Alternatively , they could interact online using the now-defunct Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service . Its main competitor was Sony 's PlayStation Portable during the seventh generation of video game consoles . Prior to its release , the Nintendo DS was marketed as an experimental , third pillar in Nintendo 's console lineup , meant to complement the Game Boy Advance and GameCube . However , backward compatibility with Game Boy Advance titles and strong sales ultimately established it as the successor to the Game Boy series . On March 2 , 2006 , Nintendo launched the Nintendo DS Lite , a slimmer and lighter redesign of the original Nintendo DS with brighter screens . On November 1 , 2008 , Nintendo released the Nintendo DSi , another redesign with several hardware improvements and new features , although it lost backwards compatibility for Game Boy Advance titles . All Nintendo DS models combined have sold 154.02 million units , making it the best selling handheld game console to date , and the second best selling video game console of all time behind Sony 's PlayStation 2 .",

Consumer demand convinced Nintendo to produce a slimmer handheld with larger screens than the DS Lite . Consequently , Nintendo removed the Game Boy Advance ( GBA ) cartridge slot to improve portability without sacrificing durability . While the DSi 's design is similar to that of the DS Lite , it features two digital cameras , supports internal and external content storage , and connects to an online store called the Nintendo DSi Shop . Nintendo stated that families often share DS and DS Lite consoles . Its new functionality was intended to facilitate personalization , so as to encourage each member of a household to purchase a DSi .

  "/wiki/999:_Nine_Hours,_Nine_Persons,_Nine_Doors": "Nine Hours , Nine Persons , Nine Doors [ a ] is an adventure video game developed by Chunsoft . It is the first installment in the Zero Escape series , and was released in Japan in 2009 and in North America in 2010 for the Nintendo DS . The story follows Junpei , a college student who is abducted along with eight other people and forced to play the Nonary Game , which puts its participants in a life-or-death situation , to escape from a sinking cruise liner . The gameplay alternates between two types of sections : Escape sections , where the player completes puzzles in escape-the-room scenarios ; and Novel sections , where the player reads the game 's narrative and makes decisions that influence the story toward one of six different endings . Development of the game began after Uchikoshi joined Chunsoft to write a visual novel for them that could reach a wider audience ; Uchikoshi suggested adding puzzle elements that are integrated with the game 's story . The inspiration for the story was the question of where inspiration comes from ; while researching it , Uchikoshi came across Rupert Sheldrake 's morphic resonance hypothesis , which became the main focus of the game 's science fiction elements . The music was composed by Shinji Hosoe , while the characters were designed by Kinu Nishimura . The localization was handled by Aksys Games ; they worked by the philosophy of keeping true to the spirit of the original Japanese version , aiming for natural-sounding English rather than following the original 's exact wording . Nine Hours , Nine Persons , Nine Doors was positively received , with reviewers praising the story , writing and puzzles , but criticizing the game 's tone and how the player is required to re-do the puzzles every time they play through the game ( which is necessary in order to obtain the true ending ) . While the Japanese release was a commercial failure , the game sold better than expected for the genre in the United States . Although Nine Hours , Nine Persons , Nine Doors was developed as a stand-alone title , its unexpected critical success in North America prompted the continuation of the series . The sequel , Zero Escape : Virtue 's Last Reward , was released in 2012 , which was followed by Zero Time Dilemma , released in 2016 .",
