  "/wiki/Sports_commentator": "In sports broadcasting , a sports commentator ( also known as sports announcer , sportscaster or play-by-play announcer ) gives a running commentary of a game or event in real time , usually during a live broadcast , traditionally delivered in the historical present tense . Radio was the first medium for sports broadcasts , and radio commentators must describe all aspects of the action to listeners who can not see it for themselves . In the case of televised sports coverage , commentators are usually presented as a voiceover , with images of the contest shown on viewers ' screens and sounds of the action and spectators heard in the background . Television commentators are rarely shown on screen during an event , though some networks choose to feature their announcers on camera either before or after the contest or briefly during breaks in the action .",
  "/wiki/Color_commentator": "A color commentator or expert commentator is a sports commentator who assists the play-by-play commentator , typically by filling in when play is not in progress . The phrase color commentator is primarily used in American English ; the person may be referred to as a summariser ( outside North America ) or analyst ( a term used throughout the English-speaking world ) . The color analyst and main commentator will often exchange comments freely throughout the broadcast , when the main commentator is not describing the action . The color commentator provides expert analysis and background information , such as statistics , strategy , and injury reports on the teams and athletes , and occasionally anecdotes or light humor . Color commentators are often former athletes or coaches of the sport being broadcast . The term color refers to levity and insight provided by a secondary announcer . A sports color commentator customarily works alongside the play-by-play broadcaster .",
