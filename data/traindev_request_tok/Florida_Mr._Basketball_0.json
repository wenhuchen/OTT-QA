The Celtics compete in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) as a member of the league 's Eastern Conference Atlantic Division . Founded in 1946 as one of the league 's original eight teams , the Celtics play their home games at TD Garden , which they share with the National Hockey League ( NHL ) 's Boston Bruins . The Celtics are regarded as the most successful basketball team in NBA history ; the franchise has won the most championships in the NBA with 17 ( accounting for 23.9 percent of all NBA championships since the league 's founding ) , and currently hold the record for the most recorded wins of any NBA team . The Celtics have a notable rivalry with the Los Angeles Lakers , who have won 16 NBA championships , second behind the Celtics . The rivalry was heavily highlighted throughout the 1960s and 1980s . The franchise has played the Lakers a record 12 times in the NBA Finals ( including their most recent appearances in 2008 and 2010 ) , of which the Celtics have won nine . Four Celtics players ( Bob Cousy , Bill Russell , Dave Cowens and Larry Bird ) have won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award for an NBA record total of 10 MVP awards . Both the nickname Celtics and their mascot Lucky the Leprechaun are a nod to Boston 's historically large Irish population . The Celtics ' rise to dominance began in the late 1950s , after acquiring center Bill Russell in a draft day trade in 1956 , who would become the cornerstone of the Celtics dynasty . Led by Russell and superstar point guard Bob Cousy , the Celtics won their first NBA championship in 1957 . Russell , along with a talented supporting cast of future Hall of Famers including John Havlicek , Tom Heinsohn , K. C. Jones , Sam Jones , Satch Sanders , and Bill Sharman , would usher the Celtics into the greatest period in franchise history , winning eight consecutive NBA championships throughout the 1960s ."
