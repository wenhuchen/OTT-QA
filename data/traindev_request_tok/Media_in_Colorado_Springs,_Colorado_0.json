  "/wiki/Callsign": "In broadcasting and radio communications , a call sign ( also known as a call name or call letters - and historically as a call signal - or abbreviated as a call ) is a unique designation for a transmitter station . In the United States of America , they are used for all FCC-licensed transmitters . A call sign can be formally assigned by a government agency , informally adopted by individuals or organizations , or even cryptographically encoded to disguise a station 's identity . The use of call signs as unique identifiers dates to the landline railroad telegraph system . Because there was only one telegraph line linking all railroad stations , there needed to be a way to address each one when sending a telegram . In order to save time , two-letter identifiers were adopted for this purpose . This pattern continued in radiotelegraph operation ; radio companies initially assigned two-letter identifiers to coastal stations and stations aboard ships at sea . These were not globally unique , so a one-letter company identifier ( for instance , 'M ' and two letters as a Marconi station ) was later added . By 1912 , the need to quickly identify stations operated by multiple companies in multiple nations required an international standard ; an ITU prefix would be used to identify a country , and the rest of the call sign an individual station in that country .",
  "/wiki/City_of_License": "In American , Canadian and Philippine broadcasting , a city of license or community of license is the community that a radio station or television station is officially licensed to serve by that country 's broadcast regulator . In North American broadcast law , the concept of community of license dates to the early days of AM radio broadcasting . The requirement that a broadcasting station operate a main studio within a prescribed distance of the community which the station is licensed to serve appears in U.S. law as early as 1939 . Various specific obligations have been applied to broadcasters by governments to fulfill public policy objectives of broadcast localism , both in radio and later also in television , based on the legislative presumption that a broadcaster fills a similar role to that held by community newspaper publishers .",

These stations are properly labeled as news/talk stations . Also , some National Public Radio stations identify themselves as News and Information stations , which means that in addition to running the NPR news magazines such as Morning Edition and All Things Considered , they run other information and public affairs programs .",
  "/wiki/Talk_radio": "Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues and consisting entirely or almost entirely of original spoken word content rather than outside music . Most shows are regularly hosted by a single individual , and often feature interviews with a number of different guests . Talk radio typically includes an element of listener participation , usually by broadcasting live conversations between the host and listeners who call in ( usually via telephone ) to the show . Listener contributions are usually screened by a show 's producers in order to maximize audience interest and , in the case of commercial talk radio , to attract advertisers . Generally , the shows are organized into segments , each separated by a pause for advertisements ; however , in public or non-commercial radio , music is sometimes played in place of commercials to separate the program segments . Variations of talk radio include conservative talk , hot talk , liberal talk ( increasingly known as progressive talk ) and sports talk . While talk radio has historically been associated with broadcast radio , starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of live Internet website streaming and podcasts . Now , it is possible for an individual to use a variety of services to host an Internet-based talk-radio show without carriage by a traditional radio station . In addition , TV programming from talk and news outlets such as BBC , CNN , Bloomberg and Fox is now often available expanding the world of talk radio further . Talk radio listening is enjoyed not only on radios , but a wide variety of other devices and services including PCs using iTunes , station directories such as TuneIn , show directory smartphones with apps such as Stitcher and time-shifting services like DAR.fm .",

  "/wiki/HD_Radio": "HD Radio ( HDR ) is a trademarked term for the in-band on-channel ( IBOC ) digital radio technology used by AM and FM radio stations mostly in the United States , Canada and Mexico ( with a few implementations outside North America ) to transmit audio and data by using a digital signal embedded on-frequency immediately above and below a station 's standard analog signal , providing the means to listen to the same program in either HD ( digital radio with less noise ) or as a standard broadcast ( analog radio with standard sound quality ) . The HD format also provides the means for a single radio station to simultaneously broadcast one or more different programs in addition to the program being transmitted on the radio station 's analog channel . iBiquity developed HD Radio , which was acquired by DTS in September 2015 bringing the HD Radio technology under the same banner as DTS ' eponymous theater surround sound systems . The HD Radio technology and trademarks were subsequently acquired by Xperi in 2016 . It was selected by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) in 2002 as a digital audio broadcasting method for the United States , and is the only digital system approved by the FCC for digital AM/FM broadcasts in the United States . It is officially known as NRSC-5 , with the latest version being NRSC-5-D. Other digital radio systems include FMeXtra , Digital Audio Broadcasting ( DAB ) ( Eureka 147 ) , Digital Radio Mondiale ( DRM30 and DRM+ configurations ) , and Compatible AM-Digital ( CAM-D ) . While HD Radio does allow for an all-digital mode , this system currently is used by some AM and FM radio stations to simulcast both digital and analog audio on the same frequency ( a hybridized digital-analog signal ) as well as to add new FM channels and text information . Although HD Radio broadcasting 's content is currently free-to-air , listeners must purchase new receivers in order to receive the digital portion of the signal . By May 2018 , HD Radio technology was claimed to be used by more than 3500 individual services , mostly in the United States . This compares with more than 2200 services operating with the DAB system . HD Radio increases the bandwidth required in the FM band to 400 kHz for the analog/digital hybrid version . This makes adoption outside the United States problematic .",

  "/wiki/Country_music": "Country music , also known as country and western ( or simply country ) , and hillbilly music , is a genre of popular music that takes its roots from genres such as American folk music ( especially Appalachian and Western music ) and blues . Its popularized roots originate in the Southern United States of the early 1920s . Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms , folk lyrics , and harmonies mostly accompanied by string instruments such as banjos , electric and acoustic guitars , steel guitars ( such as pedal steels and dobros ) , and fiddles as well as harmonicas . Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history . According to Lindsey Starnes , the term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music ; it came to encompass Western music , which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots , in the mid-20th century . In 2009 in the United States , country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute , and second most popular in the morning commute . The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres . The origins of country music are found in the folk music of working class Americans and/or blue-collar American life , who blended popular songs , Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes , traditional English ballads , cowboy songs , and the musical traditions of various groups of European immigrants .",
