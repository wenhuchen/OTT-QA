As with previous Lassie TV versions and several movies dating back to the original Lassie Come Home movie of 1943 , the star was Lassie , a trained Rough Collie . Not to be confused with a previous , syndicated follow-up series entitled The New Lassie which aired 1989-1991 , this Canadian-produced Lassie series starred Corey Sevier as 13-year-old Timmy Cabot in the fictional town of Hudson Falls , Vermont . The show was filmed in Quebec by Cinar Inc . In this series ' story line , Timmy and his recently widowed mother , Dr. Karen Cabot , move to Hudson Falls , where Karen takes over a veterinary practice . In the first ( 1997 ) season , Lassie was played by Howard , an eighth generation collie descended from Pal , the dog in the original 1943 movie Lassie Come Home . As with all previous Lassie movies and television series beginning with Pal , Howard was owned and trained by Weatherwax Trained Dogs , founded by brothers Frank and Rudd Weatherwax . Midway through production , Cinar replaced Howard with a non-Pal descended dog . Following Lassie fan protests , Hey Hey , son of Howard and a ninth-generation direct descendant of Pal , was brought in to assume the role of Lassie for the final thirteen episodes of the show . Although young Corey Sevier impressed critics , others complained that the series relegated Lassie to a bystander role by focusing more on the Cabot family 's dealings with various townspeople , at the expense of featuring Lassie 's action stunts and feats as had been traditional in the famous canine 's previous movie and TV incarnations .
