  "/wiki/Scotland": "Scotland ( Scots : Scotland , Scottish Gaelic : Alba [ \u02c8al\u032a\u02e0ap\u0259 ] ( listen ) ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain , with a border with England to the southeast , and is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west , the North Sea to the northeast , the Irish Sea to the south , and more than 790 islands , including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides . The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England . In 1997 , a Scottish Parliament was re-established , in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members , having authority over many areas of domestic policy . The head of the Scottish Government is the first minister of Scotland , who is supported by the deputy first minister of Scotland .",

In 2011 , its population was 1,810,863 , constituting about 30% of the island 's total population and about 3% of the UK 's population . Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement , the Northern Ireland Assembly ( colloquially referred to as Stormont after its location ) holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters , while other areas are reserved for the British government . Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in several areas , and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to put forward views and proposals with determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments . On 11 January 2020 , legislators in Northern Ireland formed a government for the first time since the Executive of the 5th Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed in January 2017 , following the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal . Northern Ireland was created in 1921 , when Ireland was partitioned between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 . Unlike Southern Ireland , which would become the Irish Free State in 1922 , the majority of Northern Ireland 's population were unionists , who wanted to remain within the United Kingdom . Most of these were the Protestant descendants of colonists from Great Britain . However , a significant minority , mostly Catholics , were nationalists who wanted a united Ireland independent of British rule . Today , the former generally see themselves as British and the latter generally see themselves as Irish , while a distinct Northern Irish or Ulster identity is claimed both by a large minority of Catholics and Protestants and by many of those who are non-aligned . For most of the 20th century , when it came into existence , Northern Ireland was marked by discrimination and hostility between these two sides in what First Minister of Northern Ireland , David Trimble , called a cold house for Catholics .",

The country includes the islands of Mauritius , Rodrigues , Agal\u00e9ga and St. Brandon . The islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues form part of the Mascarene Islands , along with nearby R\u00e9union , a French overseas department . The capital and largest city Port Louis is located on the main island of Mauritius . The area of the country is 2,040 square kilometres ( 790 sq mi ) , the nation 's Exclusive Economic Zone covers an area of 2.3 million square kilometres . In 1598 , the Dutch took possession of Mauritius . They abandoned Mauritius in 1710 and the French took control of the island in 1715 , renaming it Isle de France . France officially ceded Mauritius including all its dependencies to the United Kingdom ( UK ) through the Treaty of Paris , signed on 30 May 1814 and in which R\u00e9union was returned to France . The British colony of Mauritius consisted of the main island of Mauritius along with Rodrigues , Agalega , St Brandon , Tromelin and the Chagos Archipelago , while the Seychelles became a separate colony in 1906 . The sovereignty of Tromelin is disputed between Mauritius and France as some of the islands such as St. Brandon , Chagos , Agalega and Tromelin were not specifically mentioned in the Treaty of Paris . In 1965 , three years prior to the independence of Mauritius , the UK split the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritian territory , and the islands of Aldabra , Farquhar and Desroches from the Seychelles , to form the British Indian Ocean Territory ( BIOT ) . The UK forcibly expelled the archipelago 's local population and leased its largest island , Diego Garcia , to the United States .",

Pablo Aimar , as an attacking midfielder , distributed play and Javier Saviola created space between lines for \u00d3scar Cardozo , Aimar and Di Mar\u00eda . This fast-paced , attractive football proved to be successful and in his first year Jesus led Benfica to the first division title after a five-year wait ( only two league defeats , 78 goals scored ) , also reaching the quarterfinals in the Europa League , losing to Liverpool on a 3-5 aggregate score ( this would be the last match Benfica would lose in a run that lasted 27 games ) .
