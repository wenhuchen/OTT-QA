It is bordered by Romania to the north , Serbia and North Macedonia to the west , Greece and Turkey to the south , and the Black Sea to the east . The capital and largest city is Sofia ; other major cities are Plovdiv , Varna and Burgas . With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres ( 42,855 sq mi ) , Bulgaria is Europe 's 16th-largest country . One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture , which dates back to 6,500 BC . In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for Thracians , Persians , Celts and ancient Macedonians ; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45 . The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries . The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State .",

The mountain is roughly part of a series of mountains , extending from north-northeast to south-southwest between the valleys of Shkumbin in the north and Devoll in the south . It is one of the highest peaks in the European continent , in terms of topographic prominence . There is a rich evidence of previous glaciation in the highest parts of the mountains as glaciers covered the mountains and created its cirque-shaped lakes and depressions . There are at least eight glacial lakes across the mountain range . The eastern edge of the mountain gives rise to several rivers amongst them the third longest river of the country , the Shkumbin . The western and southern edges of the mountain are drained by Devoll , which has formed a deep gorge between the mountains . Near the main ridge of Valamara there are very few trees while Valamara 's lower slopes are forested . To the south there are many glacial lakes which are tourist attractions . Brown bear has been observed in the mountain region .",

The Pelister peak ( 2601 metres , or 8533 feet ) overlooks the city of Bitola . Baba is the third highest mountain in North Macedonia . Other peaks besides Pelister are Dva Groba ( 2514 metres ) , Veternica ( 2420 metres ) , Musa ( 2350 metres ) , R\u017eana ( 2334 meters ) , \u0160iroka ( 2218 metres ) , Kozji Kamen ( 2199 metres ) , Griva ( 2198 metres ) and Golema \u010cuka ( 2188 metres ) in North Macedonia , and Belavoda ( 2.179 meters ) , Kirko . The Baba massif splits up the rivers in the region , so that they either flow towards the Adriatic . Pelister National Park 's flora include the five-needle pine molika ( Pinus peuce ) - a unique species of tertiary age being present on only a few mountains in the Balkan Peninsula . Fauna in the area include : bears , roe deer , wolves , chamois , deer , wild boars , rabbits , several species of eagles , partridges , redbilled jackdaws , and the endemic Macedonian Pelagonia trout . In a comprehensive article published in 2002 , Melovski and Godes reported that there are three large carnivores in North Macedonia which can be found in Baba and surrounds , the brown bear , the wolf and the lynx . Actual numbers at that time were difficult to estimate given that most reports came from non-scientific sources ( surveys , hunters and anecdotal reports ) , however in 2002 , it was estimated there were approximately 30 bears in N.P . Pelister and Gali\u010dica N.P hosting only 3-4 . A larger number could apparently be found in the N.P Mavrovo . The numbers however may be significantly larger in today 's climate given the protected status of bears in North Macedonia ."
