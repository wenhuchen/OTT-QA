  "/wiki/Bibliome": "The bibliome is the totality of biological text corpus . This term was coined around 2000 in EBI ( European Bioinformatics Institute ) to denote the importance of biological text information . Similar terms that have been less frequently used are literaturome and textome . [ citation needed ] By approximate analogy to widely used terms like genome , metabolome , proteome , and transcriptome , this -ome would properly refer to the literature of a specified or contextually implied field , hence : biological bibliome , political bibliome , etc . [ citation needed ] However the term has not ( yet ) been applied outside the biological and medical sciences so it currently by default applies just to the biomedical fields . It would make little sense to apply it to a particular body of texts such as MEDLINE , despite a natural analogy that might seem to suggest this : the terms genome , proteome , channelome , metabolome , and transcriptome all usually assume a specific organism or cell set and ( except for genome ) a specific time point . The reason following this analogy would make little sense is that there is already an established term for this purpose , corpus . From the bibliome , biologists and computer scientists datamine to discover new gene targets and drugs . Bibliomics is the bioinformatics study of bibliome . Bibliome is not a pseudoome because it is a useful concept that is used by bioinformatists .",
  "/wiki/Medicine": "Medicine is the science and practice of establishing the diagnosis , prognosis , treatment , and prevention of disease . Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness . Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences , biomedical research , genetics , and medical technology to diagnose , treat , and prevent injury and disease , typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery , but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy , external splints and traction , medical devices , biologics , and ionizing radiation , amongst others . Medicine has been around for thousands of years , during most of which it was an art ( an area of skill and knowledge ) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture . For example , a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing , or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism . In recent centuries , since the advent of modern science , most medicine has become a combination of art and science ( both basic and applied , under the umbrella of medical science ) . While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice , the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science . Prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine , though they do not fall within the modern definition of medicine which is based in medical science . Traditional medicine and folk medicine remain commonly used with , or instead of , scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine",
  "/wiki/Clinical_trial": "Clinical trials are experiments or observations done in clinical research . Such prospective biomedical or behavioral research studies on human participants are designed to answer specific questions about biomedical or behavioral interventions , including new treatments ( such as novel vaccines , drugs , dietary choices , dietary supplements , and medical devices ) and known interventions that warrant further study and comparison . Clinical trials generate data on safety and efficacy . They are conducted only after they have received health authority/ethics committee approval in the country where approval of the therapy is sought . These authorities are responsible for vetting the risk/benefit ratio of the trial - their approval does not mean that the therapy is 'safe ' or effective , only that the trial may be conducted . Depending on product type and development stage , investigators initially enroll volunteers or patients into small pilot studies , and subsequently conduct progressively larger scale comparative studies . Clinical trials can vary in size and cost , and they can involve a single research center or multiple centers , in one country or in multiple countries . Clinical study design aims to ensure the scientific validity and reproducibility of the results . Costs for clinical trials can range into the billions of dollars per approved drug . The sponsor may be a governmental organization or a pharmaceutical , biotechnology or medical device company . Certain functions necessary to the trial , such as monitoring and lab work , may be managed by an outsourced partner , such as a contract research organization or a central laboratory . Only 10 percent of all drugs started in human clinical trials become approved drugs .",
  "/wiki/Clinical_trial_registry": "Clinical trial registration is the practice of documenting clinical trials before they are performed in a clinical trials registry so as to combat publication bias and selective reporting . Registration of clinical trials is required in some countries and is increasingly being standardized . Some top medical journals will only publish the results of trials that have been pre-registered . A clinical trials registry is a platform which catalogs registered clinical trials . ClinicalTrials.gov , run by the United States National Library of Medicine ( NLM ) was the first online registry for clinical trials , and remains the largest and most widely used . In addition to combating bias , clinical trial registries serve to increase transparency and access to clinical trials for the public . Clinical trials registries are often searchable ( e.g . by disease/indication , drug , location , etc. ) . Trials are registered by the pharmaceutical , biotech or medical device company ( Sponsor ) or by the hospital or foundation which is sponsoring the study , or by another organization , such as a contract research organization ( CRO ) which is running the study . There has been a push from governments and international organizations , especially since 2005 , to make clinical trial information more widely available and to standardize registries and processes of registering . The World Health Organization is working toward achieving consensus on both the minimal and the optimal operating standards for trial registration .",

  "/wiki/Connectomics": "Connectomics is the production and study of connectomes : comprehensive maps of connections within an organism 's nervous system , typically its brain or eye . Because these structures are extremely complex , methods within this field use a high-throughput application of neural imaging and histological techniques in order to increase the speed , efficiency , and resolution of maps of the multitude of neural connections in a nervous system . While the principal focus of such a project is the brain , any neural connections could theoretically be mapped by connectomics , including , for example , neuromuscular junctions . This study is sometimes referred to by its previous name of hodology .",
  "/wiki/Brain": "A brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals . It is located in the head , usually close to the sensory organs for senses such as vision . It is the most complex organ in a vertebrate 's body . In a human , the cerebral cortex contains approximately 14-16 billion neurons , and the estimated number of neurons in the cerebellum is 55-70 billion . Each neuron is connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons . These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons , which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells . Physiologically , brains exert centralized control over a body 's other organs . They act on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones . This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment . Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia , but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain . The operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions is yet to be solved . Recent models in modern neuroscience treat the brain as a biological computer , very different in mechanism from an electronic computer , but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world , stores it , and processes it in a variety of ways .",

  "/wiki/Cell_(biology)": "The cell ( from Latin cella , meaning small room ) is the basic structural , functional , and biological unit of all known organisms . A cell is the smallest unit of life . Cells are often called the building blocks of life . The study of cells is called cell biology , cellular biology , or cytology . Cells consist of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane , which contains many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids . Most plant and animal cells are only visible under a microscope , with dimensions between 1 and 100 micrometres . Organisms can be classified as unicellular ( consisting of a single cell such as bacteria ) or multicellular ( including plants and animals ) . Most unicellular organisms are classed as microorganisms . The number of cells in plants and animals varies from species to species , it has been estimated that humans contain somewhere around 40 trillion ( 4\u00d71013 ) cells . [ a ] The human brain accounts for around 80 billion of these cells . Cells were discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665 , who named them for their resemblance to cells inhabited by Christian monks in a monastery . Cell theory , first developed in 1839 by Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann , states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells , that cells are the fundamental unit of structure and function in all living organisms , and that all cells come from pre-existing cells .",
  "/wiki/Organism": "In biology , an organism ( from Greek : \u1f40\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 , organismos ) is any individual entity that embodies the properties of life . It is a synonym for life form . Organisms are classified by taxonomy into groups such as multicellular animals , plants , and fungi ; or unicellular microorganisms such as protists , bacteria , and archaea . All types of organisms are capable of reproduction , growth and development , maintenance , and some degree of response to stimuli . Humans , squids , mushrooms , and vascular plants are examples of multicellular organisms that differentiate specialized tissues and organs during development . An organism may be either a prokaryote or a eukaryote . Prokaryotes are represented by two separate domains - bacteria and archaea . Eukaryotic organisms are characterized by the presence of a membrane-bound cell nucleus and contain additional membrane-bound compartments called organelles ( such as mitochondria in animals and plants and plastids in plants and algae , all generally considered to be derived from endosymbiotic bacteria ) . Fungi , animals and plants are examples of kingdoms of organisms within the eukaryotes . Estimates on the number of Earth 's current species range from 2 million to 1 trillion , of which over 1.7 million have been documented . More than 99% of all species , amounting to over five billion species , that ever lived are estimated to be extinct . In 2016 , a set of 355 genes from the last universal common ancestor ( LUCA ) of all organisms was identified .",

Cell biology encompasses both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and can be divided into many sub-topics which may include the study of cell metabolism , cell communication , cell cycle , and cell composition . The study of cells is performed using several techniques such as cell culture , various types of microscopy , and cell fractionation . These have allowed for and are currently being used for discoveries and research pertaining to how cells function , ultimately giving insight into understanding larger organisms . Knowing the components of cells and how cells work is fundamental to all biological sciences while also being essential for research in biomedical fields such as cancer , and other diseases .

  "/wiki/RNA_editing": "RNA editing is a molecular process through which some cells can make discrete changes to specific nucleotide sequences within an RNA molecule after it has been generated by RNA polymerase . RNA editing may include the insertion , deletion , and base substitution of nucleotides within the RNA molecule . RNA editing is relatively rare , with common forms of RNA processing ( e.g . splicing , 5'-capping , and 3'-polyadenylation ) not usually considered as editing . RNA editing has been observed in some tRNA , rRNA , mRNA , or miRNA molecules of eukaryotes and their viruses , archaea , and prokaryotes . RNA editing occurs in the cell nucleus and cytosol , as well as within mitochondria and plastids . In vertebrates , editing is rare and usually consists of a small number of changes to the sequence of the affected molecules . In other organisms , extensive editing ( pan-editing ) can occur ; in some cases the majority of nucleotides in an mRNA sequence may result from editing . RNA-editing processes show great molecular diversity , and some appear to be evolutionarily recent acquisitions that arose independently . The diversity of RNA editing phenomena includes nucleobase modifications such as cytidine ( C ) to uridine ( U ) and adenosine ( A ) to inosine ( I ) deaminations , as well as non-template nucleotide additions and insertions . RNA editing in mRNAs effectively alters the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein so that it differs from that predicted by the genomic DNA sequence .",

  "/wiki/Epigenomics": "Epigenomics is the study of the complete set of epigenetic modifications on the genetic material of a cell , known as the epigenome . The field is analogous to genomics and proteomics , which are the study of the genome and proteome of a cell . Epigenetic modifications are reversible modifications on a cell 's DNA or histones that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence . Epigenomic maintenance is a continuous process and plays an important role in stability of eukaryotic genomes by taking part in crucial biological mechanisms like DNA repair . Plant flavones are said to be inhibiting epigenomic marks that cause cancers . Two of the most characterized epigenetic modifications are DNA methylation and histone modification . Epigenetic modifications play an important role in gene expression and regulation , and are involved in numerous cellular processes such as in differentiation/development and tumorigenesis . The study of epigenetics on a global level has been made possible only recently through the adaptation of genomic high-throughput assays .",
  "/wiki/Epigenetics": "In biology , epigenetics is the study of heritable phenotype changes that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence . The Greek prefix epi- ( \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9- over , outside of , around ) in epigenetics implies features that are on top of or in addition to the traditional genetic basis for inheritance . Epigenetics most often involves changes that affect gene activity and expression , but the term can also be used to describe any heritable phenotypic change . Such effects on cellular and physiological phenotypic traits may result from external or environmental factors , or be part of normal development . The standard definition of epigenetics requires these alterations to be heritable in the progeny of either cells or organisms . The term also refers to the changes themselves : functionally relevant changes to the genome that do not involve a change in the nucleotide sequence . Examples of mechanisms that produce such changes are DNA methylation and histone modification , each of which alters how genes are expressed without altering the underlying DNA sequence . Gene expression can be controlled through the action of repressor proteins that attach to silencer regions of the DNA . These epigenetic changes may last through cell divisions for the duration of the cell 's life , and may also last for multiple generations , even though they do not involve changes in the underlying DNA sequence of the organism ; instead , non-genetic factors cause the organism 's genes to behave ( or express themselves ) differently . One example of an epigenetic change in eukaryotic biology is the process of cellular differentiation . During morphogenesis , totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo , which in turn become fully differentiated cells . In other words , as a single fertilized egg cell - the zygote - continues to divide , the resulting daughter cells change into all the different cell types in an organism , including neurons , muscle cells , epithelium , endothelium of blood vessels , etc. , by activating some genes while inhibiting the expression of others .",

In human pregnancy , prenatal development is also called antenatal development . The development of the human embryo follows fertilization , and continues as fetal development . By the end of the tenth week of gestational age the embryo has acquired its basic form and is referred to as a fetus . The next period is that of fetal development where many organs become fully developed . This fetal period is described both topically ( by organ ) and chronologically ( by time ) with major occurrences being listed by gestational age .

  "/wiki/Food": "Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism . Food is usually of plant or animal origin , and contains essential nutrients , such as carbohydrates , fats , proteins , vitamins , or minerals . The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism 's cells to provide energy , maintain life , or stimulate growth . Historically , humans secured food through two methods : hunting and gathering and agriculture , which gave modern humans a mainly omnivorous diet . Worldwide , humanity has created numerous cuisines and culinary arts , including a wide array of ingredients , herbs , spices , techniques , and dishes . Today , the majority of the food energy required by the ever-increasing population of the world is supplied by the food industry . Food safety and food security are monitored by agencies like the International Association for Food Protection , World Resources Institute , World Food Programme , Food and Agriculture Organization , and International Food Information Council . They address issues such as sustainability , biological diversity , climate change , nutritional economics , population growth , water supply , and access to food .

  "/wiki/Nutrition": "Nutrition is the science that interprets the nutrients and other substances in food in relation to maintenance , growth , reproduction , health and disease of an organism . It includes food intake , absorption , assimilation , biosynthesis , catabolism and excretion . The diet of an organism is what it eats , which is largely determined by the availability and palatability of foods . For humans , a healthy diet includes preparation of food and storage methods that preserve nutrients from oxidation , heat or leaching , and that reduces risk of foodborne illnesses . The seven major classes of human nutrients are carbohydrates , fats , fiber , minerals , proteins , vitamins , and water . Nutrients can be grouped as either macronutrients or micronutrients ( needed in small quantities ) . In humans , an unhealthy diet can cause deficiency-related diseases such as blindness , anemia , scurvy , preterm birth , stillbirth and cretinism , or nutrient excess health-threatening conditions such as obesity and metabolic syndrome ; and such common chronic systemic diseases as cardiovascular disease , diabetes , and osteoporosis .

In contrast to genetics , which refers to the study of individual genes and their roles in inheritance , genomics aims at the collective characterization and quantification of all of an organism 's genes , their interrelations and influence on the organism . Genes may direct the production of proteins with the assistance of enzymes and messenger molecules . In turn , proteins make up body structures such as organs and tissues as well as control chemical reactions and carry signals between cells . Genomics also involves the sequencing and analysis of genomes through uses of high throughput DNA sequencing and bioinformatics to assemble and analyze the function and structure of entire genomes . Advances in genomics have triggered a revolution in discovery-based research and systems biology to facilitate understanding of even the most complex biological systems such as the brain . The field also includes studies of intragenomic ( within the genome ) phenomena such as epistasis ( effect of one gene on another ) , pleiotropy ( one gene affecting more than one trait ) , heterosis ( hybrid vigour ) , and other interactions between loci and alleles within the genome .",
  "/wiki/Classical_genetics": "Classical genetics is the branch of genetics based solely on visible results of reproductive acts . It is the oldest discipline in the field of genetics , going back to the experiments on Mendelian inheritance by Gregor Mendel who made it possible to identify the basic mechanisms of heredity . Subsequently , these mechanisms have been studied and explained at the molecular level . Classical genetics consists of the techniques and methodologies of genetics that were in use before the advent of molecular biology . A key discovery of classical genetics in eukaryotes was genetic linkage . The observation that some genes do not segregate independently at meiosis broke the laws of Mendelian inheritance , and provided science with a way to map characteristics to a location on the chromosomes . Linkage maps are still used today , especially in breeding for plant improvement . After the discovery of the genetic code and such tools of cloning as restriction enzymes , the avenues of investigation open to geneticists were greatly broadened . Some classical genetic ideas have been supplanted with the mechanistic understanding brought by molecular discoveries , but many remain intact and in use . Classical genetics is often contrasted with reverse genetics , and aspects of molecular biology are sometimes referred to as molecular genetics .",
  "/wiki/Gene": "In biology , a gene is a sequence of nucleotides in DNA or RNA that encodes the synthesis of a gene product , either RNA or protein . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic trait . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene-environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or the number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life . Genes can acquire mutations in their sequence , leading to different variants , known as alleles , in the population . These alleles encode slightly different versions of a protein , which cause different phenotypical traits . Usage of the term having a gene ( e.g. , good genes , hair colour gene ) typically refers to containing a different allele of the same , shared gene . Genes evolve due to natural selection / survival of the fittest and genetic drift of the alleles .",

This three-dimensional genome structure plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation . Chromosomes are normally visible under a light microscope only when the cell is undergoing the metaphase of cell division ( where all chromosomes are aligned in the center of the cell in their condensed form ) . Before this happens , every chromosome is copied once ( S phase ) , and the copy is joined to the original by a centromere , resulting either in an X-shaped structure ( pictured here ) if the centromere is located in the middle of the chromosome or a two-arm structure if the centromere is located near one of the ends . The original chromosome and the copy are now called sister chromatids . During metaphase the X-shape structure is called a metaphase chromosome . In this highly condensed form chromosomes are easiest to distinguish and study . In animal cells , chromosomes reach their highest compaction level in anaphase during chromosome segregation . Chromosomal recombination during meiosis and subsequent sexual reproduction play a significant role in genetic diversity . If these structures are manipulated incorrectly , through processes known as chromosomal instability and translocation , the cell may undergo mitotic catastrophe . Usually , this will make the cell initiate apoptosis leading to its own death , but sometimes mutations in the cell hamper this process and thus cause progression of cancer .",
  "/wiki/Genetics": "Genetics is a branch of biology concerned with the study of genes , genetic variation , and heredity in organisms . Though heredity had been observed for millennia , Gregor Mendel , a scientist and Augustinian friar working in the 19th century , was the first to study genetics scientifically . Mendel studied trait inheritance , patterns in the way traits are handed down from parents to offspring . He observed that organisms ( pea plants ) inherit traits by way of discrete units of inheritance . This term , still used today , is a somewhat ambiguous definition of what is referred to as a gene . Trait inheritance and molecular inheritance mechanisms of genes are still primary principles of genetics in the 21st century , but modern genetics has expanded beyond inheritance to studying the function and behavior of genes . Gene structure and function , variation , and distribution are studied within the context of the cell , the organism ( e.g . dominance ) , and within the context of a population . Genetics has given rise to a number of subfields , including molecular genetics , epigenetics and population genetics . Organisms studied within the broad field span the domains of life ( archaea , bacteria , and eukarya ) . Genetic processes work in combination with an organism 's environment and experiences to influence development and behavior , often referred to as nature versus nurture . The intracellular or extracellular environment of a living cell or organism may switch gene transcription on or off .",
  "/wiki/Glycome": "The glycome is the entire complement of sugars , whether free or present in more complex molecules , of an organism . An alternative definition is the entirety of carbohydrates in a cell . The glycome may in fact be one of the most complex entities in nature . Glycomics , analogous to genomics and proteomics , is the systematic study of all glycan structures of a given cell type or organism and is a subset of glycobiology . Carbohydrate , glycan , saccharide , and sugar are generic terms used interchangeably in this context and includes monosaccharides , oligosaccharides , polysaccharides , and derivatives of these compounds . Carbohydrates consist of hydrated carbon , i.e . [ CH2O ] n. Monosaccharides are a carbohydrate that can not be hydrolyzed into a simpler carbohydrate and are the building blocks of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides . Oligosaccharides are linear or branched chains of monosaccharides attached to one another via glycosidic linkages . The number of monosaccharide units can vary . Polysaccharides are glycans composed of repeating monosaccharides , generally greater than ten monosaccharide units in length . The glycome exceeds the complexity of the proteome as a result of the even greater diversity of the glycome 's constituent carbohydrates and is further complicated by the sheer multiplicity of possibilities in the combination and interaction of the carbohydrates with each other and with proteins . The spectrum of all glycan structures - the glycome - is immense .",
  "/wiki/Glycomics": "Glycomics is the comprehensive study of glycomes ( the entire complement of sugars , whether free or present in more complex molecules of an organism ) , including genetic , physiologic , pathologic , and other aspects . Glycomics is the systematic study of all glycan structures of a given cell type or organism and is a subset of glycobiology . The term glycomics is derived from the chemical prefix for sweetness or a sugar , glyco- , and was formed to follow the omics naming convention established by genomics ( which deals with genes ) and proteomics ( which deals with proteins ) .",
  "/wiki/Glycan": "The terms glycan and polysaccharide are defined by IUPAC as synonyms meaning compounds consisting of a large number of monosaccharides linked glycosidically . However , in practice the term glycan may also be used to refer to the carbohydrate portion of a glycoconjugate , such as a glycoprotein , glycolipid , or a proteoglycan , even if the carbohydrate is only an oligosaccharide . Glycans usually consist solely of O-glycosidic linkages of monosaccharides . For example , cellulose is a glycan ( or , to be more specific , a glucan ) composed of \u03b2-1,4-linked D-glucose , and chitin is a glycan composed of \u03b2-1,4-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine . Glycans can be homo- or heteropolymers of monosaccharide residues , and can be linear or branched .",
  "/wiki/Glycobiology": "Defined in the narrowest sense , glycobiology is the study of the structure , biosynthesis , and biology of saccharides ( sugar chains or glycans ) that are widely distributed in nature . Sugars or saccharides are essential components of all living things and aspects of the various roles they play in biology are researched in various medical , biochemical and biotechnological fields .",
  "/wiki/Hologenome_theory_of_evolution": "The hologenome theory of evolution recasts the individual animal or plant ( and other multicellular organisms ) as a community or a holobiont - the host plus all of its symbiotic microbes . Consequently , the collective genomes of the holobiont form a hologenome . Holobionts and hologenomes are structural entities that replace misnomers in the context of host-microbiota symbioses such as superorganism ( i.e. , an integrated social unit composed of conspecifics ) , organ , and metagenome . Variation in the hologenome may encode phenotypic plasticity of the holobiont and can be subject to evolutionary changes caused by selection and drift , if portions of the hologenome are transmitted between generations with reasonable fidelity . One of the important outcomes of recasting the individual as a holobiont subject to evolutionary forces is that genetic variation in the hologenome can be brought about by changes in the host genome and also by changes in the microbiome , including new acquisitions of microbes , horizontal gene transfers , and changes in microbial abundance within hosts . Although there is a rich literature on binary host-microbe symbioses , the hologenome concept distinguishes itself by including the vast symbiotic complexity inherent in many multicellular hosts . For recent literature on holobionts and hologenomes published in an open access platform , see the following reference .",

The components of a holobiont are individual species or bionts , while the combined genome of all bionts is the hologenome . The concept of the holobiont was defined by Dr. Lynn Margulis in her 1991 book Symbiosis as a Source of Evolutionary Innovation . Holobionts include the host , virome , microbiome , and other members , all of which contribute in some way to the function of the whole . Well-studied holobionts include reef-building corals and humans .",
  "/wiki/Metagenomics": "Metagenomics is the study of genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples . The broad field may also be referred to as environmental genomics , ecogenomics or community genomics . While traditional microbiology and microbial genome sequencing and genomics rely upon cultivated clonal cultures , early environmental gene sequencing cloned specific genes ( often the 16S rRNA gene ) to produce a profile of diversity in a natural sample . Such work revealed that the vast majority of microbial biodiversity had been missed by cultivation-based methods . Because of its ability to reveal the previously hidden diversity of microscopic life , metagenomics offers a powerful lens for viewing the microbial world that has the potential to revolutionize understanding of the entire living world . As the price of DNA sequencing continues to fall , metagenomics now allows microbial ecology to be investigated at a much greater scale and detail than before . Recent studies use either shotgun or PCR directed sequencing to get largely unbiased samples of all genes from all the members of the sampled communities .",
  "/wiki/Interferome": "Interferome is an online bioinformatics database of interferon-regulated genes ( IRGs ) . These Interferon Regulated Genes are also known as Interferon Stimulated Genes ( ISGs ) . The database contains information on type I ( IFN alpha , beta ) , type II ( IFN gamma ) and type III ( IFN lambda ) regulated genes and is regularly updated . It is used by the interferon and cytokine research community both as an analysis tool and an information resource . Interferons were identified as antiviral proteins more than 50 years ago . However , their involvement in immunomodulation , cell proliferation , inflammation and other homeostatic processes has been since identified . These cytokines are used as therapeutics in many diseases such as chronic viral infections , cancer and multiple sclerosis . These interferons regulate the transcription of approximately 2000 genes in an interferon subtype , dose , cell type and stimulus dependent manner . This database of interferon regulated genes is an attempt at integrating information from high-throughput experiments and molecular biology databases to gain a detailed understanding of interferon biology .",

  "/wiki/Interferon": "Interferons ( IFNs , /\u02cc\u026ant\u0259r\u02c8f\u026a\u0259r\u0252n/ ) are a group of signaling proteins made and released by host cells in response to the presence of several viruses . In a typical scenario , a virus-infected cell will release interferons causing nearby cells to heighten their anti-viral defenses . IFNs belong to the large class of proteins known as cytokines , molecules used for communication between cells to trigger the protective defenses of the immune system that help eradicate pathogens . Interferons are named for their ability to interfere with viral replication by protecting cells from virus infections . IFNs also have various other functions : they activate immune cells , such as natural killer cells and macrophages ; they increase host defenses by up-regulating antigen presentation by virtue of increasing the expression of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) antigens . Certain symptoms of infections , such as fever , muscle pain and flu-like symptoms , are also caused by the production of IFNs and other cytokines . More than twenty distinct IFN genes and proteins have been identified in animals , including humans . They are typically divided among three classes : Type I IFN , Type II IFN , and Type III IFN . IFNs belonging to all three classes are important for fighting viral infections and for the regulation of the immune system .",
  "/wiki/Immunology": "Immunology is a branch of biology that covers the study of immune systems in all organisms . Immunology charts , measures , and contextualizes the physiological functioning of the immune system in states of both health and diseases ; malfunctions of the immune system in immunological disorders ( such as autoimmune diseases , hypersensitivities , immune deficiency , and transplant rejection ) ; and the physical , chemical , and physiological characteristics of the components of the immune system in vitro , in situ , and in vivo . Immunology has applications in numerous disciplines of medicine , particularly in the fields of organ transplantation , oncology , rheumatology , virology , bacteriology , parasitology , psychiatry , and dermatology . The term was coined by Russian biologist Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov , who advanced studies on immunology and received the Nobel Prize for his work in 1908 . He pinned small thorns into starfish larvae and noticed unusual cells surrounding the thorns . This was the active response of the body trying to maintain its integrity . It was Mechnikov who first observed the phenomenon of phagocytosis , in which the body defends itself against a foreign body . Prior to the designation of immunity , from the etymological root immunis , which is Latin for exempt , early physicians characterized organs that would later be proven as essential components of the immune system . The important lymphoid organs of the immune system are the thymus , bone marrow , and chief lymphatic tissues such as spleen , tonsils , lymph vessels , lymph nodes , adenoids , and liver . When health conditions worsen to emergency status , portions of immune system organs , including the thymus , spleen , bone marrow , lymph nodes , and other lymphatic tissues , can be surgically excised for examination while patients are still alive . Many components of the immune system are typically cellular in nature and not associated with any specific organ , but rather are embedded or circulating in various tissues located throughout the body .",

  "/wiki/Ionomics": "Ionomics is the measurement of the total elemental composition of an organism to address biological problems . Questions within physiology , ecology , evolution , and many other fields can be investigated using ionomics , often coupled with bioinformatics and other genetic tools . Observing an organism 's ionome is a powerful approach to the functional analysis of its genes and the gene networks . Information about the physiological state of an organism can also be revealed indirectly through its ionome , for example iron deficiency in a plant can be identified by looking at a number of other elements , rather than iron itself . A more typical example is in a blood test , where a number of conditions involving nutrition or disease may be inferred from testing this single tissue for sodium , potassium , iron , chlorine , zinc , magnesium , calcium and copper . In practice , the total elemental composition of an organism is rarely determined . The number and type of elements measured are limited by the available instrumentation , the assumed value of the element in question , and the added cost of measuring each additional element . Also , a single tissue may be measured instead of the entire organism , as in the example given above of a blood test , or in the case of plants , the sampling of just the leaves or seeds . These are simply issues of practicality . Various techniques may be fruitfully used to measure elemental composition . Among the best are Inductively-Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy ( ICP-OES ) , Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry ( ICP-MS ) , X-Ray Fluorescence ( XRF ) , synchrotron-based microXRF , and Neutron activation analysis ( NAA ) . This latter technique has been applied to perform ionomics in the study of breast cancer , colorectal cancer and brain cancer .",

  "/wiki/Kinome": "In molecular biology , biochemistry and cell signaling the kinome of an organism is the complete set of protein kinases encoded in its genome . Kinases are usually enzymes that catalyze phosphorylation reactions ( of amino acids ) and fall into several groups and families , e.g. , those that phosphorylate the amino acids serine and threonine , those that phosphorylate tyrosine and some that can phosphorylate both , such as the MAP2K and GSK families . The term was first used in 2002 by Gerard Manning and colleagues in twin papers analyzing the 518 human protein kinases , and refers to both protein kinases and protein pseudokinases and their evolution of protein kinases throughout the eukaryotes . Other kinomes have been determined for rice , several fungi , nematodes , and insects , sea urchins , Dictyostelium discoideum , and the process of infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Although the primary sequence of protein kinases shows substantial divergence between unrelated eukaryotes , and amino acid differences in catalytic motifs have permitted their separation of kinomes into canonical and pseudokinase subtypes , the variation found in the amino acid motifs adjacent to the site of actual phosphorylation of substrates by eukaryotic kinases is much smaller . As kinases are a major drug target and a major control point in cell behavior , the kinome has also been the target of large scale functional genomics with RNAi screens and of drug discovery efforts , especially in cancer therapeutics . In animals , the kinome includes kinases that phosphorylate only tyrosine ( tyrosine kinases ) , those that act on serine or threonine , and a few classes , such as GSK3 and MAP2K that can act on both . [ citation needed ] Research has shown that there are specialized protein domains that bind to phosphorylated serine and threonine residues , such as BRCA and FHA domains . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/Kinase": "In biochemistry , a kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of phosphate groups from high-energy , phosphate-donating molecules to specific substrates . This process is known as phosphorylation , where the substrate gains a phosphate group and the high-energy ATP molecule donates a phosphate group . This transesterification produces a phosphorylated substrate and ADP . Conversely , it is referred to as dephosphorylation when the phosphorylated substrate donates a phosphate group and ADP gains a phosphate group ( producing a dephosphorylated substrate and the high energy molecule of ATP ) . These two processes , phosphorylation and dephosphorylation , occur four times during glycolysis . Kinases are part of the larger family of phosphotransferases . Kinases should not be confused with phosphorylases , which catalyze the addition of inorganic phosphate groups to an acceptor , nor with phosphatases , which remove phosphate groups ( dephosphorylation ) . The phosphorylation state of a molecule , whether it be a protein , lipid or carbohydrate , can affect its activity , reactivity and its ability to bind other molecules . Therefore , kinases are critical in metabolism , cell signalling , protein regulation , cellular transport , secretory processes and many other cellular pathways , which makes them very important to human physiology ."
