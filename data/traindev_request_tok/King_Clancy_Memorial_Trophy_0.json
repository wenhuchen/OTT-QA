The Stanley Cup winners were the Detroit Red Wings , who swept the Philadelphia Flyers in four games and won the Stanley Cup for the first time in 42 years . The regular season saw a decline in scoring and rise in the number of shutouts to an all-time record of 127 . This trend continued into the playoffs , during which an all-time record of 18 shutouts were recorded . Only two players , Mario Lemieux and Teemu Selanne , reached the 100-point plateau during the regular season ( compared with 12 who reached the plateau in 1995-96 ) . Many factors , including fewer power plays , more calls of the skate-in-the-crease rule , fewer shots on goal and more injuries to star players than the season before , contributed to the reduction in scoring and skyrocketing in shutouts . Paradoxically , teams averaged more even-strength goals scored ( 174 ) than in 1995-96 ( 172 ) . This was the first time in 30 years - and in the entire expansion era - that the Boston Bruins had a losing record and missed the playoffs , ending a still-unsurpassed North American professional sports streak of 29-straight seasons in the playoffs .",
