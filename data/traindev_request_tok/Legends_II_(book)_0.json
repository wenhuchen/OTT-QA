The fifth and most recent volume of the series , A Dance with Dragons , was published in 2011 and took Martin six years to write . He is currently writing the sixth novel , The Winds of Winter . A Song of Ice and Fire takes place on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos . The point of view of each chapter in the story is a limited perspective of a range of characters growing from nine in the first novel , to 31 characters by the fifth novel . Three main stories interweave : a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros , the rising threat of the supernatural Others in northernmost Westeros , and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen , the deposed king 's exiled daughter , to assume the Iron Throne . Martin 's inspirations included the Wars of the Roses and the French historical novels The Accursed Kings by Maurice Druon . A Song of Ice and Fire received praise for its diverse portrayal of women and religion , as well as its realism . An assortment of disparate and subjective points of view confronts the reader , and the success or survival of point-of-view characters is never assured . Within the often morally ambiguous world of A Song of Ice and Fire , questions concerning loyalty , pride , human sexuality , piety , and the morality of violence frequently arise .",
