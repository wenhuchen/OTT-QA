He was a colleague of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and expanded and defended Lamarck 's evolutionary theories . Geoffroy 's scientific views had a transcendental flavor ( unlike Lamarck 's materialistic views ) and were similar to those of German morphologists like Lorenz Oken . He believed in the underlying unity of organismal design , and the possibility of the transmutation of species in time , amassing evidence for his claims through research in comparative anatomy , paleontology , and embryology .",

Endangered ( EN ) , as categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) Red List , is the second most severe conservation status for wild populations in the IUCN 's schema after Critically Endangered ( CR ) . In 2012 , the IUCN Red List featured 3,079 animal and 2,655 plant species as endangered ( EN ) worldwide . The figures for 1998 were 1,102 and 1,197 respectively .

In 2005 , satellite imagery estimates showed approximately 700 km2 ( 270 sq mi ) of total remaining habitat within its geographic range . It is highly threatened by hunting and habitat loss , and was considered to be among the 25 most endangered primates in 2006-2008 . It is currently listed as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) due to a highly restricted range , and has been named one of The World 's 25 Most Endangered Primates .

From a very wealthy family , at the age of 20 , he and his brother , Ernest Grandidier ( 1833-1912 ) , undertook a voyage around the world . At first they were led by the astronomer and physicist Pierre Jules C\u00e9sar Janssen ( 1824-1907 ) , but when Janssen fell sick and had to return to France after about six months , the brothers continued the journey . They visited South America in 1858 and 1859 and in particular the Andes , Peru , Chile , Bolivia , Argentina and Brazil . During this voyage they gathered a significant collection of specimens which were analyzed , in 1860 , by Ernest . The two brothers parted ways after this . Ernest Grandidier went to China and collected a vast number of specimens which are now in the Louvre and the Guimet museum . Alfred travelled to India , reaching it in 1863 . He had intended to explore the high plateau of Tibet , but was prevented by a severe attack of fever . Grandidier travelled to Zanzibar to recuperate , remaining some time and making important collections and publishing an account of his findings . He then visited the island of R\u00e9union and in 1865 made his first visit to Madagascar . He became devoted to the study of the island , revisiting in 1866 and 1868 .",

  "/wiki/Blue-eyed_black_lemur": "The blue-eyed black lemur ( Eulemur flavifrons ) , also known as the Sclater 's lemur , is a species of true lemur . It can attain a body length of 39-45 cm , a tail length of 51-65 cm- a total length of 90-100 cm , and a weight of 1.8-1.9 kg . Being a primate , it has strong hands with palms like a human , which have a rubbery texture to give it a firm grip on branches . Its tail is longer than its body and is non-prehensile . Like many of the species in the genus Eulemur , the blue-eyed black lemur is sexually dichromatic . Males are solid black in color , with the hairs sometimes tinged brown at the roots . Females are reddish-brown in color with their underside and outline of their face a lighter tan . They have a dark brown or gray muzzle and the back of their hands and feet are a similar dark color . Both sexes have blue eyes , hence the common name , and are one of the only primates other than humans to consistently have blue eyes . The eyes can range in color from a shocking electric blue , a light sky-blue , or a softer gray-blue . Although the blue-eyed black lemur and the black lemur look similar , they can be differentiated by the blue eyes and lack of prominent ear tufts of this species , while the black lemur has orange-red eyes and long , spiky cheek hairs . In the Manongarivo Special reserve , where the range of the two species overlap , there is a report of hybridization between the two species , but the resulting offspring always have orange eyes .",

The rationale used for near-threatened taxa usually includes the criteria of vulnerable which are plausible or nearly met , such as reduction in numbers or range . Near-threatened species evaluated from 2001 onwards may also be ones which are dependent on conservation efforts to prevent their becoming threatened , whereas prior to this conservation-dependent species were given a separate category ( Conservation Dependent ) .

He is known as the father of modern taxonomy . Many of his writings were in Latin , and his name is rendered in Latin as Carolus Linn\u00e6us ( after 1761 Carolus a Linn\u00e9 ) . Linnaeus was born in the countryside of Sm\u00e5land in southern Sweden . He received most of his higher education at Uppsala University and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730 . He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738 , where he studied and also published the first edition of his Systema Naturae in the Netherlands . He then returned to Sweden where he became professor of medicine and botany at Uppsala . In the 1740s , he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals . In the 1750s and 1760s , he continued to collect and classify animals , plants , and minerals , while publishing several volumes . He was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe at the time of his death . Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau sent him the message : Tell him I know no greater man on earth .

Known locally in Malagasy as maky ( [ mak\u02b2 ] ( listen ) , spelled maki in French ) or hira , it inhabits gallery forests to spiny scrub in the southern regions of the island . It is omnivorous and the most terrestrial of extant lemurs . The animal is diurnal , being active exclusively in daylight hours . The ring-tailed lemur is highly social , living in groups of up to 30 individuals . It is also female dominant , a trait common among lemurs . To keep warm and reaffirm social bonds , groups will huddle together . The ring-tailed lemur will also sunbathe , sitting upright facing its underside , with its thinner white fur towards the sun . Like other lemurs , this species relies strongly on its sense of smell and marks its territory with scent glands . The males perform a unique scent marking behavior called spur marking and will participate in stink fights by impregnating their tail with their scent and wafting it at opponents ."
