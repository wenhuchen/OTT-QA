  "/wiki/Blyth_and_Tyne_Railway": "The Blyth and Tyne Railway was a railway company in Northumberland , England . It was incorporated in 1853 to unify several private railways and waggonways that were concerned with bringing coal from the Northumberland coalfield to Blyth and to the River Tyne . Over the years it expanded its network to include Ashington , Morpeth and Tynemouth . As coal output increased the company became very prosperous in hauling the mineral to quays for export , and in addition a residential passenger service based on Newcastle built up . It was absorbed by the much larger North Eastern Railway in 1874 , and some integration of service and facilities took place , but the Blyth and Tyne section retained its individual identity . In 1904 electric traction was introduced for suburban passenger trains on north Tyneside and part of the Blyth and Tyne system was electrified ; the new trains proved a considerable success . Speculative branch lines built in the twentieth century were less successful . In the period from 1975 coal extraction declined , and parts of the Blyth and Tyne system that were dependent on the mineral traffic suffered accordingly , and the passenger business too declined . At the end of the 1970s the decision was taken to establish a light rapid transit system , the Tyne and Wear Metro , based on the North Tyneside network at first , and this started operating in 1980 , using part of the Blyth and Tyne routes . Most of the remainder of the former system has no railway activity now .",

The station building was constructed of corrugated iron on steel framing and stood on a short brick wall .

Notable for its three-spired medieval cathedral , Lichfield was the birthplace of Samuel Johnson , the writer of the first authoritative Dictionary of the English Language . The city 's recorded history began when Chad of Mercia arrived to establish his Bishopric in 669 AD and the settlement grew as the ecclesiastical centre of Mercia . In 2009 , the Staffordshire Hoard , the largest hoard of Anglo-Saxon gold and silver metalwork , was found 5.9 km ( 3.7 mi ) south-west of Lichfield . The development of the city was consolidated in the 12th century under Roger de Clinton , who fortified the Cathedral Close and also laid out the town with the ladder-shaped street pattern that survives to this day . Lichfield 's heyday was in the 18th century , when it developed into a thriving coaching city . This was a period of great intellectual activity , the city being the home of many famous people including Samuel Johnson , David Garrick , Erasmus Darwin and Anna Seward , and prompted Johnson 's remark that Lichfield was a city of philosophers .
