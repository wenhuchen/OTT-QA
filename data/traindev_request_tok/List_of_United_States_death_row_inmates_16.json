  "/wiki/Serial_killer": "A serial killer is typically a person who murders three or more people , usually in service of abnormal psychological gratification , with the murders taking place over more than a month and including a significant period of time between them . Different authorities apply different criteria when designating serial killers . For example , while most authorities set a threshold of three murders , others extend it to four or lessen it to two . The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) defines serial killing as a series of two or more murders , committed as separate events , usually , but not always , by one offender acting alone . Although psychological gratification is the usual motive for serial killing , and most serial killings involve sexual contact with the victim , the FBI states that the motives of serial killers can include anger , thrill-seeking , financial gain , and attention seeking . The murders may be attempted or completed in a similar fashion . The victims may have something in common , for example , demographic profile , appearance , gender or race . A serial killer is neither a mass murderer , nor a spree killer , although there may be conceptual overlaps between serial killers and spree killers .",

Worley , was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder , in addition to over twenty years in prison for the kidnapping , assault and other related charges .

Worley had been previously convicted and imprisoned for the assault and attempted kidnapping of another woman under markedly similar circumstances , but was released after three years , and was not listed in any state or federal offender database at the time of Joughin 's murder .

The statute was signed into law in December 2018 ."
