  "/wiki/Callsign": "In broadcasting and radio communications , a call sign ( also known as a call name or call letters - and historically as a call signal - or abbreviated as a call ) is a unique designation for a transmitter station . In the United States of America , they are used for all FCC-licensed transmitters . A call sign can be formally assigned by a government agency , informally adopted by individuals or organizations , or even cryptographically encoded to disguise a station 's identity . The use of call signs as unique identifiers dates to the landline railroad telegraph system . Because there was only one telegraph line linking all railroad stations , there needed to be a way to address each one when sending a telegram . In order to save time , two-letter identifiers were adopted for this purpose . This pattern continued in radiotelegraph operation ; radio companies initially assigned two-letter identifiers to coastal stations and stations aboard ships at sea . These were not globally unique , so a one-letter company identifier ( for instance , 'M ' and two letters as a Marconi station ) was later added . By 1912 , the need to quickly identify stations operated by multiple companies in multiple nations required an international standard ; an ITU prefix would be used to identify a country , and the rest of the call sign an individual station in that country .",
  "/wiki/City_of_License": "In American , Canadian and Philippine broadcasting , a city of license or community of license is the community that a radio station or television station is officially licensed to serve by that country 's broadcast regulator . In North American broadcast law , the concept of community of license dates to the early days of AM radio broadcasting . The requirement that a broadcasting station operate a main studio within a prescribed distance of the community which the station is licensed to serve appears in U.S. law as early as 1939 . Various specific obligations have been applied to broadcasters by governments to fulfill public policy objectives of broadcast localism , both in radio and later also in television , based on the legislative presumption that a broadcaster fills a similar role to that held by community newspaper publishers .",

  "/wiki/HD_Radio": "HD Radio ( HDR ) is a trademarked term for the in-band on-channel ( IBOC ) digital radio technology used by AM and FM radio stations mostly in the United States , Canada and Mexico ( with a few implementations outside North America ) to transmit audio and data by using a digital signal embedded on-frequency immediately above and below a station 's standard analog signal , providing the means to listen to the same program in either HD ( digital radio with less noise ) or as a standard broadcast ( analog radio with standard sound quality ) . The HD format also provides the means for a single radio station to simultaneously broadcast one or more different programs in addition to the program being transmitted on the radio station 's analog channel . iBiquity developed HD Radio , which was acquired by DTS in September 2015 bringing the HD Radio technology under the same banner as DTS ' eponymous theater surround sound systems . The HD Radio technology and trademarks were subsequently acquired by Xperi in 2016 . It was selected by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) in 2002 as a digital audio broadcasting method for the United States , and is the only digital system approved by the FCC for digital AM/FM broadcasts in the United States . It is officially known as NRSC-5 , with the latest version being NRSC-5-D. Other digital radio systems include FMeXtra , Digital Audio Broadcasting ( DAB ) ( Eureka 147 ) , Digital Radio Mondiale ( DRM30 and DRM+ configurations ) , and Compatible AM-Digital ( CAM-D ) . While HD Radio does allow for an all-digital mode , this system currently is used by some AM and FM radio stations to simulcast both digital and analog audio on the same frequency ( a hybridized digital-analog signal ) as well as to add new FM channels and text information . Although HD Radio broadcasting 's content is currently free-to-air , listeners must purchase new receivers in order to receive the digital portion of the signal . By May 2018 , HD Radio technology was claimed to be used by more than 3500 individual services , mostly in the United States . This compares with more than 2200 services operating with the DAB system . HD Radio increases the bandwidth required in the FM band to 400 kHz for the analog/digital hybrid version .

  "/wiki/Alternative_rock": "Alternative rock ( also called alternative music , alt-rock , alt-pop or simply alternative ) is a term used to categorize rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1970s and became widely popular in the 1980s . In this instance , the word alternative refers to the genre 's distinction from mainstream , or commercial rock or pop music . The term 's original meaning was broader , referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent , DIY ethos of punk rock , which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music . In September of 1988 , Billboard magazine introduced Alternative Songs into their charting system rather than continue incorporating these artists into the existing rock and pop charts . By then alternative had become a catch-all description for both successful artists ( e.g . U2 and R.E.M . ) , as well as music from underground , independent , or non-commercial rock artists that received some level of mainstream recognition . Although the genre evolved in the late 1970s and 1980s , music anticipating the sound of the genre can be found as early as the 1960s , with bands such as the Velvet Underground and artists such as Syd Barrett . Since the early 1990s the term has often been misused to market an artist 's image or music toward consumers seeking to distinguish their tastes from mainstream pop or rock music . Traditionally , alternative rock broadly consisted of music that differed greatly in terms of its sound , social context and regional roots . Throughout the 1980s , magazines and zines , college radio airplay , and word of mouth had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock , helping to define a number of distinct styles ( and music scenes ) such as noise pop , indie rock , grunge , and shoegaze . Most of these subgenres had achieved minor mainstream notice and a few bands , such as H\u00fcsker D\u00fc and R.E.M. , were signed to major labels .",

Campus radio stations are generally licensed and regulated by national governments , and have very different characteristics from one country to the next . One commonality between many radio stations regardless of their physical location is a willingness - or , in some countries , even a licensing requirement - to broadcast musical selections that are not categorized as commercial hits . Because of this , campus radio has come to be associated with emerging musical trends , including genres such as punk and new wave , alternative rock , indie rock and hip hop , long before those genres become part of the musical mainstream . Campus radio stations also often provide airplay and promotional exposure to new and emerging local artists . Campus radio supported U2 and REM Many campus radio stations carry a variety of programming including news ( often local ) , sports ( often relating to the campus ) , and spoken word programming as well as general music . Often the radio format is best described as a freeform , with a lot of creativity and individualism among the disc jockeys and show hosts . A number of these radio stations have gained critical acclaim for their programming and are considered by the community in which they are embedded to be an essential media outlet . Although the term campus radio implies full-power AM or FM transmission over the air , many radio stations experiment with low-power broadcasting , closed circuit or carrier current systems , often to on-campus listeners only .

  "/wiki/Adult_Contemporary": "In North American music , adult contemporary music ( AC ) is a form of radio-played popular music , ranging from 1960s vocal and 1970s soft rock music to predominantly ballad-heavy music of the present day , with varying degrees of easy listening , pop , soul , rhythm and blues , quiet storm , and rock influence . Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music . Adult contemporary tends to have lush , soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated . It is usually melodic enough to get a listener 's attention , and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music . Like most of pop music , its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse-chorus structure . The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments ( though bass guitar is usually used ) such as acoustic guitars , pianos , saxophones , and sometimes an orchestral set . The electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched . However , recent adult contemporary music may feature synthesizers ( and other electronics , such as drum machines ) . An AC radio station may play mainstream music , but it excludes hip hop , dance tracks , hard rock , and some forms of teen pop , as these are less popular among adults , the target demographic . AC radio often targets the 25-44 age group , the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s .

  "/wiki/Classic_rock": "Classic rock is a radio format which developed from the album-oriented rock ( AOR ) format in the early 1980s . In the United States , the classic rock format features rock music ranging generally from the mid-1960s to the 1980s , primarily focusing on commercially successful blues rock and hard rock popularized in the 1970s AOR format . The radio format became increasingly popular with the baby boomer demographic by the end of the 1990s . Although classic rock has mostly appealed to adult listeners , music associated with this format received more exposure with younger generations of listeners with the presence of the Internet and digital downloading . Some classic rock stations also play a limited number of current releases which are stylistically consistent with the station 's sound , or by heritage acts that are still active and producing new music . Conceptually , classic rock has been analyzed by academics as an effort by critics , media , and music establishments to canonize rock music and commodify 1960s Western culture for audiences living in a post-baby boomer economy . The music predominantly selected for the format has been identified as commercially successful songs by white male acts from the Anglosphere , expressing values of Romanticism , self-aggrandizement , and politically undemanding ideologies .",

  "/wiki/Contemporary_Hit_Radio": "Contemporary hit radio ( also known as CHR , contemporary hits , hit list , current hits , hit music , top 40 , or pop radio ) is a radio format that is common in the United States , Brazil , United Kingdom , Ireland , Canada , New Zealand , Australia , the Philippines , Indonesia , Malaysia , Singapore , China , Hong Kong , Taiwan , Japan , South Korea , Trinidad and Tobago , and South Africa , that focuses on playing current and recurrent popular music as determined by the top 40 music charts . There are several subcategories , dominantly focusing on rock , pop , or urban music . Used alone , CHR most often refers to the CHR-pop format . The term contemporary hit radio was coined in the early 1980s by Radio & Records magazine to designate top 40 stations which continued to play hits from all musical genres as pop music splintered into adult contemporary , urban contemporary and other formats . The term top 40 is also used to refer to the actual list of hit songs , and , by extension , to refer to pop music in general . The term has also been modified to describe top 50 ; top 30 ; top 20 ; top 10 ; hot 100 ( each with its number of songs ) and hot hits radio formats , but carrying more or less the same meaning and having the same creative point of origin with Todd Storz as further refined by Gordon McLendon as well as Bill Drake .
