  "/wiki/Piper_J-3_Cub": "The Piper J-3 Cub is an American light aircraft that was built between 1938 and 1947 by Piper Aircraft . The aircraft has a simple , lightweight design which gives it good low-speed handling properties and short-field performance . The Cub is Piper Aircraft 's most-produced model , with nearly 20,000 built in the United States . Its simplicity , affordability and popularity invokes comparisons to the Ford Model T automobile . The aircraft is a high-wing , strut-braced monoplane with a large-area rectangular wing . It is most often powered by an air-cooled , flat-4 piston engine driving a fixed-pitch propeller . Its fuselage is a welded steel frame covered in fabric , seating two people in tandem . The Cub was originally intended as a trainer and had great popularity in this role and as a general aviation aircraft . Due to its performance , it was well suited for a variety of military uses such as reconnaissance , liaison and ground control . It was produced in large numbers during World War II as the L-4 Grasshopper . Many Cubs are still flying today . Notably , Cubs are highly prized as bush aircraft .",

A member of the family Cryptobranchidae , the hellbender is the only extant member of the genus Cryptobranchus . Other closely related salamanders in the same family are in the genus Andrias , which contains the Japanese and Chinese giant salamanders . The hellbender , which is much larger than all other salamanders in its geographic range , employs an unusual means of respiration ( which involves cutaneous gas exchange through capillaries found in its dorsoventral skin folds ) , and fills a particular niche - both as a predator and prey - in its ecosystem , which either it or its ancestors have occupied for around 65 million years . The species is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species .",

  "/wiki/White-tailed_deer": "The white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) , also known as the whitetail or Virginia deer , is a medium-sized deer native to North America , Central America , Ecuador , and South America as far south as Peru and Bolivia . It has also been introduced to New Zealand , Cuba , Jamaica , Hispaniola , the Bahamas , the Lesser Antilles , and some countries in Europe , such as the Czech Republic , Finland , Romania , Serbia , Germany , and France . In the Americas , it is the most widely distributed wild ungulate . In North America , the species is widely distributed east of the Rocky Mountains as well as in southwestern Arizona and most of Mexico , aside from Lower California . It is mostly replaced by the black-tailed or mule deer ( Odocoileus hemionus ) from that point west except for in mixed deciduous riparian corridors , river valley bottomlands , and lower foothills of the northern Rocky Mountain region from South Dakota west to eastern Washington and eastern Oregon and north to northeastern British Columbia and southern Yukon , including in the Montana Valley and Foothill grasslands . Texas is home to the most white-tailed deer of any U.S. state or Canadian province , with an estimated population of over four million . Notably high populations of white-tailed deer occur in the Edwards Plateau of Central Texas . Michigan , Minnesota , Iowa , Mississippi , Missouri , New Jersey , Illinois , Wisconsin , Maryland , New York , North Dakota , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Indiana also boast high deer densities . The conversion of land adjacent to the Canadian Rockies into agriculture use and partial clear-cutting of coniferous trees ( resulting in widespread deciduous vegetation ) has been favorable to the white-tailed deer and has pushed its distribution to as far north as Yukon . Populations of deer around the Great Lakes have also expanded their range northwards , due to conversion of land to agricultural uses favoring more deciduous vegetation , and local caribou and moose populations . The westernmost population of the species , known as the Columbian white-tailed deer , once was widespread in the mixed forests along the Willamette and Cowlitz River valleys of western Oregon and southwestern Washington , but today its numbers have been considerably reduced , and it is classified as near-threatened . This population is separated from other white-tailed deer populations .",

  "/wiki/Milk": "Milk is a nutrient-rich , white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals . It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals ( including humans who are breastfed ) before they are able to digest other types of food . Early-lactation milk contains colostrum , which carries the mother 's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases . It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose . Interspecies consumption of milk is not uncommon , particularly among humans , many of whom consume the milk of other mammals . As an agricultural product , milk , also called dairy milk , is extracted from farm animals during or soon after pregnancy . Dairy farms produced about 730 million tonnes of milk in 2011 , from 260 million dairy cows . India is the world 's largest producer of milk , and is the leading exporter of skimmed milk powder , yet it exports few other milk products . The ever-increasing rise in domestic demand for dairy products and a large demand-supply gap could lead to India being a net importer of dairy products in the future . New Zealand , Germany and the Netherlands are the largest exporters of milk products . China and Russia were the world 's largest importers of milk and milk products until 2016 when both countries became self-sufficient , contributing to a worldwide glut of milk .

  "/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_dogs": "Thirteen states of the United States have designated an official state dog breed . Maryland was the first state to name a dog breed as a state symbol , naming the Chesapeake Bay Retriever in 1964 . Pennsylvania followed the year after , naming the Great Dane as its official breed . Dog breeds are mostly affiliated with the states that they originated in . North Carolina chose the Plott Hound as it was the only dog breed indigenous to the state . Other official state dogs also are indigenous to their state , including the Boston Terrier ( Massachusetts ) and the Alaskan Malamute ( Alaska ) . Pennsylvania selected the Great Dane not because of its origin , but because it was introduced by early settlers in the state to be used as a hunting and working dog ; it was chosen over the Beagle , which was also proposed around the same time . Two of the more recent successful campaigns to name a state dog have been started by schoolchildren . In 2007 , Alaskan kindergarten student Paige Hill 's idea created the campaign for the Alaskan Malamute which would convince Representative Berta Gardner to support the bill in 2009 , with it becoming law in 2010 . Elementary school students from Bedford , New Hampshire won their campaign for the Chinook to be accepted as a symbol of their state in 2010 . There have been a variety of campaigns in other states to select a state dog . Georgia was undecided about choosing a state dog in 1991 , with an attempt to make the Golden Retriever the official dog failing after a vote in the Georgia State Senate ; an opposing campaign promoted the Bulldog , the mascot of the University of Georgia .",

  "/wiki/Long_rifle": "The long rifle , also known as longrifle , Kentucky rifle , Pennsylvania rifle , or American longrifle , was one of the first commonly used rifles for hunting and warfare . It is characterized by an unusually long barrel , a development in American rifles that was uncommon in European rifles of the same period . The long rifle is an early example of a firearm using rifling ( spiral grooves in the bore ) , which caused the projectile ( commonly a round lead ball ) to spin around the axis of its motion . This increased the stability of its trajectory and dramatically improved accuracy over contemporary smooth bore muskets , which were cheaper and more common . Rifled firearms saw their first major combat use in the American colonies during the French and Indian War , and later the American Revolution in the eighteenth century . Until the development of the Mini\u00e9 ball in the middle of the 19th century , the main disadvantages of a rifle compared to a musket were a slower reload time due to the use of a tighter fitting lead ball and greater susceptibility to the fouling of the bore after prolonged use - such fouling would eventually prevent loading altogether , rendering the weapon useless until thoroughly cleaned . The adoption of the Mini\u00e9 ball essentially nullified these disadvantages and allowed the rifle to completely replace the musket . The long rifle was made popular by German gunsmiths who immigrated to America , bringing with them the technology of rifling from where it originated . The accuracy achieved by the long rifle made it an ideal tool for hunting wildlife for food in colonial America .",

Niagara was constructed from 1812 to 1813 to protect the vulnerable American coastline on Lake Erie from the British and played a pivotal role in the battle for the lake . Along with most warships that served in the war , Niagara was sunk for preservation on Presque Isle in 1820 . Raised in 1913 , it was rebuilt for the centennial of the Battle of Lake Erie . After deteriorating , the restoration of Niagara was started again in the 1930s , but was hampered by the lack of funds caused by the Great Depression and remained uncompleted until 1963 .
