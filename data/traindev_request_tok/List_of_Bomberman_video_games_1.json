  "/wiki/Action-adventure_video_game": "Action-adventure is a video game genre that combines core elements from both the action game and adventure game genres . With the decline of the adventure game genre from mainstream popularity in the early 2000s , the use of the term ( and the hybrid term action-adventure ) has been more liberal . It is not uncommon for gamers to apply the term adventure or action to describe the genre of fiction to which a game belongs , and not the gameplay itself . Action-adventure is a hybrid genre , and thus the definition is very inclusive , leading it to be perhaps the broadest genre of video games , and can include many games which might better be categorized under narrow genres . Typically , pure adventure games have situational problems for the player to solve , with very little or no action . If there is action , it is generally confined to isolated minigames . Pure action games have gameplay based on real-time interactions that challenge the reflexes . Therefore , action-adventure games engage both reflexes and problem-solving , in both violent and non-violent situations .",
