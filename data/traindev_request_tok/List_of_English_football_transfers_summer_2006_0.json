Originally a cricket club , Preston have been based at Deepdale since 1875 .

Deepdale is now football 's oldest ground in terms of continuous use by a major league club . Preston North End was a founder member of the Football League in 1888 . In the 1888-89 season , the team won both the inaugural league championship and the FA Cup , the latter without conceding a goal .
