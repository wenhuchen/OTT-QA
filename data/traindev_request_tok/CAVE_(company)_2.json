  "/wiki/Android_(operating_system)": "Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software , designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets . Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance , with the main contributor and commercial marketer being Google . Initially developed by Android Inc. , which Google bought in 2005 , Android was unveiled in 2007 , with the first commercial Android device launched in September 2008 . The current stable version is Android 10 , released on September 3 , 2019 . The core Android source code is known as Android Open Source Project ( AOSP ) , which is primarily licensed under the Apache License . This has allowed variants of Android to be developed on a range of other electronics , such as game consoles , digital cameras , PCs and others , each with a specialized user interface . Some well known derivatives include Android TV for televisions and Wear OS for wearables , both developed by Google . Android 's source code has been used as the basis of different ecosystems , most notably that of Google which is associated with a suite of proprietary software called Google Mobile Services ( GMS ) , that frequently comes pre-installed on said devices . This includes core apps such as Gmail , the digital distribution platform Google Play and associated Google Play Services development platform , and usually apps such as the Google Chrome web browser . These apps are licensed by manufacturers of Android devices certified under standards imposed by Google . Other competing Android ecosystems include Amazon.com 's Fire OS , or LineageOS . Software distribution is generally offered through proprietary application stores like Google Play Store or Samsung Galaxy Store , or open source platforms like Aptoide or F-Droid , which use software packages in the APK format .",
