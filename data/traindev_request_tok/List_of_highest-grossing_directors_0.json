  "/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_I_\u2013_The_Phantom_Menace": "Star Wars : Episode I - The Phantom Menace is a 1999 American epic space-opera film written and directed by George Lucas , produced by Lucasfilm , distributed by 20th Century Fox and stars Liam Neeson , Ewan McGregor , Natalie Portman , Jake Lloyd , Ian McDiarmid , Anthony Daniels , Kenny Baker , Pernilla August , and Frank Oz . It is the first installment in the Star Wars prequel trilogy and begins the Skywalker saga , though it was the fourth film to be produced chronologically . Lucas began production of this film after he determined that computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) had advanced to the level he wanted for the prequel trilogy 's visual effects . Filming started on June 26 , 1997 , at locations including Leavesden Film Studios and the Tunisian desert . The film was Lucas ' first directorial effort after a 22-year hiatus following Star Wars in 1977 . [ b ] The Phantom Menace is set 32 years before the original film and follows Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi as they protect Queen Amidala in hopes of securing a peaceful end to an interplanetary trade dispute . Joined by Anakin Skywalker - a young slave with unusually strong natural powers of the Force - they simultaneously contend with the mysterious return of the Sith . The Phantom Menace was released in theaters on May 19 , 1999 , almost 16 years after the premiere of the previous Star Wars film , Return of the Jedi . The film 's premiere was extensively covered by media and was greatly anticipated because of the large cultural following the Star Wars saga had cultivated . Despite the anticipation , it received mixed reviews ; critics praised the visuals , action sequences , John Williams ' musical score , and some of the performances ( notably Neeson and McGregor ) , but criticized the screenplay , characterization , and the respective performances of Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks and Lloyd as Anakin . It grossed more than $ 924.3 million ( equivalent to $ 1.42 billion in 2019 ) worldwide during its initial theatrical run , becoming the highest-grossing film of 1999 , the second-highest-grossing film worldwide and in North America ( behind Titanic ) , and the highest-grossing Star Wars film at the time . A 3D reissue , which earned an additional $ 102.7 million at the box office and brought the film 's overall worldwide takings to over $ 1 billion , was released in February 2012 ."
