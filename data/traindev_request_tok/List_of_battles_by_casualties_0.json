  "/wiki/Battle_of_Thymbra": "The Battle of Thymbra was the decisive battle in the war between Croesus of the Lydian Kingdom and Cyrus the Great of the Achaemenid Empire . Cyrus , having pursued Croesus into Lydia following the drawn Battle of Pteria , met the remains of Croesus ' partly disbanded army in battle on the plain north of Sardis in December , 547 BC . Even though Croesus ' army was reinforced with many new men , Cyrus utterly defeated it , despite being outnumbered more or less 2:1 . This proved decisive , and after the 14-day Siege of Sardis , the city and possibly its king fell , and Lydia was conquered by the Persians .",
  "/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great": "Cyrus II of Persia , commonly known as Cyrus the Great , and also called Cyrus the Elder by the Greeks , was the founder of the Achaemenid Empire , the first Persian Empire . Under his rule , the empire embraced all the previous civilized states of the ancient Near East , expanded vastly and eventually conquered most of Western Asia and much of Central Asia . From the Mediterranean Sea and Hellespont in the west to the Indus River in the east , Cyrus the Great created the largest empire the world had yet seen . Under his successors , the empire eventually stretched at its maximum extent from parts of the Balkans ( Bulgaria-Paeonia and Thrace-Macedonia ) and Eastern Europe proper in the west , to the Indus Valley in the east . His regal titles in full were The Great King , King of Persia , King of Anshan , King of Media , King of Babylon , King of Sumer and Akkad , and King of the Four Corners of the World . The Nabonidus Chronicle notes the change in his title from simply King of Anshan , a city , to King of Persia . Assyriologist Fran\u00e7ois Vallat wrote that When Astyages marched against Cyrus , Cyrus is called 'King of Anshan , but when Cyrus crosses the Tigris on his way to Lydia , he is 'King of Persia . ' The coup therefore took place between these two events . The reign of Cyrus the Great lasted c. 30 years . Cyrus built his empire by first conquering the Median Empire , then the Lydian Empire , and eventually the Neo-Babylonian Empire . He led an expedition into Central Asia , which resulted in major campaigns that were described as having brought into subjection every nation without exception . Cyrus did not venture into Egypt , and was alleged to have died in battle , fighting the Massagetae along the Syr Darya in December 530 BC .",

It was fought between the citizens of Athens , aided by Plataea , and a Persian force commanded by Datis and Artaphernes . The battle was the culmination of the first attempt by Persia , under King Darius I , to subjugate Greece . The Greek army decisively defeated the more numerous Persians , marking a turning point in the Greco-Persian Wars . The first Persian invasion was a response to Athenian involvement in the Ionian Revolt , when Athens and Eretria had sent a force to support the cities of Ionia in their attempt to overthrow Persian rule . The Athenians and Eretrians had succeeded in capturing and burning Sardis , but they were then forced to retreat with heavy losses . In response to this raid , Darius swore to burn down Athens and Eretria . According to Herodotus , Darius had his bow brought to him and then shot an arrow upwards towards heaven , saying as he did so : Zeus , that it may be granted me to take vengeance upon the Athenians ! Herodotus further writes that Darius charged one of his servants to say Master , remember the Athenians three times before dinner each day . At the time of the battle , Sparta and Athens were the two largest city-states in Greece . Once the Ionian revolt was finally crushed by the Persian victory at the Battle of Lade in 494 BC , Darius began plans to subjugate Greece . In 490 BC , he sent a naval task force under Datis and Artaphernes across the Aegean , to subjugate the Cyclades , and then to make punitive attacks on Athens and Eretria .",

Struggling to control the independent-minded cities of Ionia , the Persians appointed tyrants to rule each of them . This would prove to be the source of much trouble for the Greeks and Persians alike .

It took place simultaneously with the naval battle at Artemisium , in August or September 480 BC , at the narrow coastal pass of Thermopylae ( The Hot Gates ) . The Persian invasion was a delayed response to the defeat of the first Persian invasion of Greece , which had been ended by the Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC . By 480 BC Xerxes had amassed a massive army and navy , and set out to conquer all of Greece . The Athenian politician and general Themistocles had proposed that the allied Greeks block the advance of the Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae , and simultaneously block the Persian navy at the Straits of Artemisium . A Greek force of approximately 7,000 men marched north to block the pass in the middle of 480 BC . The Persian army , alleged by the ancient sources to have numbered over one million , but today considered to have been much smaller ( various figures are given by scholars , ranging between about 100,000 and 150,000 ) arrived at the pass in late August or early September . The vastly outnumbered Greeks held off the Persians for seven days ( including three of battle ) before the rear-guard was annihilated in one of history 's most famous last stands . During two full days of battle , the small force led by Leonidas blocked the only road by which the massive Persian army could pass . After the second day , a local resident named Ephialtes betrayed the Greeks by revealing a small path used by shepherds . It led the Persians behind the Greek lines . Leonidas , aware that his force was being outflanked , dismissed the bulk of the Greek army and remained to guard their retreat with 300 Spartans and 700 Thespians , fighting to the death .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Plataea": "The Battle of Plataea was the final land battle during the second Persian invasion of Greece . It took place in 479 BC near the city of Plataea in Boeotia , and was fought between an alliance of the Greek city-states ( including Sparta , Athens , Corinth and Megara ) , and the Persian Empire of Xerxes I ( allied with Boeotians , Thessalians , and Macedonians ) . The previous year the Persian invasion force , led by the Persian king in person , had scored victories at the battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium and conquered Thessaly , Phocis , Boeotia , Euboea and Attica . However , at the ensuing Battle of Salamis , the Allied Greek navy had won an unlikely but decisive victory , preventing the conquest of the Peloponnesus . Xerxes then retreated with much of his army , leaving his general Mardonius to finish off the Greeks the following year . In the summer of 479 BC the Greeks assembled a huge ( by ancient standards ) army and marched out of the Peloponnesus . The Persians retreated to Boeotia and built a fortified camp near Plataea . The Greeks , however , refused to be drawn into the prime cavalry terrain around the Persian camp , resulting in a stalemate that lasted 11 days . While attempting a retreat after their supply lines were disrupted , the Greek battle line fragmented . Thinking the Greeks in full retreat , Mardonius ordered his forces to pursue them , but the Greeks ( particularly the Spartans , Tegeans and Athenians ) halted and gave battle , routing the lightly armed Persian infantry and killing Mardonius . A large portion of the Persian army was trapped in its camp and slaughtered . The destruction of this army , and the remnants of the Persian navy allegedly on the same day at the Battle of Mycale , decisively ended the invasion .",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Chaeronea_(338_BC)": "The Battle of Chaeronea was fought in 338 BC , near the city of Chaeronea in Boeotia , between the Macedonians led by Philip II of Macedon and an alliance of some of the Greek city-states led by Athens and Thebes . The battle was the culmination of Philip 's final campaigns in 339-338 BC and resulted in a decisive victory for the Macedonians . Philip had brought peace to a war-torn Greece in 346 BC , by ending the Third Sacred War , and concluding his ten-year conflict with Athens for supremacy in the north Aegean , by making a separate peace . Philip 's much expanded kingdom , powerful army and plentiful resources now made him the de facto leader of Greece . To many of the fiercely independent city-states , Philip 's power after 346 BC was perceived as a threat , especially in Athens , where the politician Demosthenes led efforts to break away from Philip 's influence . In 340 BC Demosthenes convinced the Athenian assembly to sanction action against Philip 's territories and to ally with the Achaemenids in Byzantium , which Philip was besieging . These actions were against the terms of their treaty oaths and amounted to a declaration of war . In summer 339 BC , Philip therefore led his army towards South Greece , prompting the formation of an alliance of a few southern Greek states opposed to him , led by Athens and Thebes . After several months of stalemate , Philip finally advanced into Boeotia in an attempt to march on Thebes and Athens . Opposing him , and blocking the road near Chaeronea , was the allied army , similar in size and occupying a strong position . Details of the ensuing battle are scarce , but after a long fight the Macedonians crushed both flanks of the allied line , which then dissolved into a rout . The battle has been described as one of the most decisive of the ancient world .",
  "/wiki/Rise_of_Macedon": "Under the reign of Philip II ( 359-336 BC ) , the kingdom of Macedonia , initially at the periphery of classical Greek affairs , came to dominate Ancient Greece in the span of just 25 years , largely thanks to the personality and policies of its king . In addition to utilising effective diplomacy and marriage alliances to achieve his political aims , Philip II was also responsible for reforming the ancient Macedonian army into an effective fighting force . The Macedonian phalanx became the hallmark of the Macedonian army during his reign and the subsequent Hellenistic period . His army and engineers also made extensive use of siege engines . Macedonia during the reign of Philip II was at first preoccupied by wars with marauding Illyrians and Thracians . Chief among Philip 's Thracian enemies was the ruler Kersebleptes , who may have coordinated a temporary alliance with Athens . In a series of campaigns stretching from 356 to 340 BC , Philip II managed to ultimately subjugate Kersebleptes as a tributary vassal , conquering much of Thrace in the process and founding new cities there such as Philippi ( modern Filippoi , Greece ) and Philippopolis ( modern Plovdiv , Bulgaria ) . Philip II also fought against the Illyrian king Bardylis , who threatened Macedonia proper , and against Grabos and Pleuratus in Illyria ( centred in modern-day Albania ) . Philip II eventually campaigned against the city-state of Athens and her allies in the Aegean region , as well as Thebes after the decline of its hegemony in mainland Greece . In the defence of the Amphictyonic League of Delphi and in conjunction with the Thessalian League , Macedonia became a key player in the Third Sacred War ( 356-346 BC ) , defeating the Phocians , commanded by Onomarchus , at the Battle of Crocus Field in 352 BC . While poised to launch a direct assault on Athens in 346 BC , the Macedonian king was met with an Athenian embassy that arranged a peace treaty known as the Peace of Philocrates . As a result , Macedonia and Athens became allies , yet Athens was forced to relinquish its claims to the city of Amphipolis ( in modern-day Central Macedonia ) .",

  "/wiki/Wars_of_Alexander_the_Great": "The wars of Alexander the Great were fought by King Alexander III of Macedon ( The Great ) , first against the Achaemenid Persian Empire under Darius III , and then against local chieftains and warlords as far east as Punjab , India . By the time of his death , he had conquered most of the world known to the ancient Greeks . However , he failed to conquer South Asia . Although being successful as a military commander , he failed to provide any stable alternative to the Achaemenid Empire - his untimely death threw the vast territories he conquered into civil war . Alexander assumed the kingship of Macedonia following the death of his father Philip II , who had unified most of the city-states of mainland Greece under Macedonian hegemony in a federation called the Hellenic League . After reconfirming Macedonian rule by quashing a rebellion of southern Greek city-states and staging a short but bloody excursion against Macedon 's northern neighbors , Alexander set out east against the Achaemenid Persian Empire , under its King of Kings ( the title all Achaemenid kings went by ) , Darius III , which he defeated and overthrew . His conquests included Anatolia , Syria , Phoenicia , Judea , Gaza , Egypt , Mesopotamia , Persia and Bactria , and he extended the boundaries of his own empire as far as Taxila , India . Alexander had already made more plans prior to his death for military and mercantile expansions into the Arabian Peninsula , after which he was to turn his armies to the west ( Carthage , Rome , and the Iberian Peninsula ) . However , Alexander 's diadochi quietly abandoned these grandiose plans after his death . Instead , within a few years of Alexander 's death , the diadochi began fighting with each other , dividing up the Empire between themselves , and triggering 40 years of warfare .",

The battle resulted in a Greek victory and the surrender of Porus .

Alexander 's decision to cross the monsoon-swollen river despite close Indian surveillance , in order to catch Porus 's army in the flank , has been referred to as one of his masterpieces . Although victorious , it was also the most costly battle fought by the Macedonians . The resistance put up by King Porus and his men won the respect of Alexander , who asked Porus to become one of his satraps .

The first of these wars was the result of Rome 's intervening to rescue the Campanian city of Capua from a Samnite attack . The second one was the result of Rome 's intervention in the politics of the city of Naples and developed into a contest over the control of much of central and southern Italy . The third war also involved a struggle over the control of this part of Italy . The wars extended over half a century and the peoples to the east , north and west of Samnium ( land of the Samnites ) as well as the peoples of central Italy north of Rome ( the Etruscans , Umbrians and Picenti ) and the Senone Gauls got involved to various degrees and at various points in time .

Pyrrhus was asked by the people of the Greek city of Tarentum in southern Italy to help them in their war with the Roman Republic . A skilled commander , with a strong army fortified by war elephants ( which the Romans were not experienced in facing ) , Pyrrhus enjoyed initial success against the Roman legions , but suffered heavy losses even in these victories . Plutarch wrote that Pyrrhus said after the second battle of the war , If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans , we shall be utterly ruined . He could not call up more men from home and his allies in Italy were becoming indifferent . The Romans , by contrast , had a very large pool of military manpower and could replenish their legions even if their forces were depleted in many battles . This has led to the expression Pyrrhic victory , a term for a victory that inflicts losses the victor can not afford in the long term . Worn down by the battles against Rome , Pyrrhus moved his army to Sicily to war against the Carthaginians instead . After several years of campaigning there ( 278-275 BC ) , he returned to Italy in 275 BC , where the last battle of the war was fought , ending in Roman victory . Following this , Pyrrhus returned to Epirus , ending the war . Three years later , in 272 BC , the Romans captured Tarentum .

  "/wiki/Maurya_Empire": "The Maurya Empire was a geographically extensive Iron Age historical power based in Magadha and founded by Chandragupta Maurya which dominated the Indian subcontinent between 322 and 185 BCE . Comprising the majority of South Asia , the Maurya Empire was centralized by the conquest of the Indo-Gangetic Plain , and its capital city was located at Pataliputra ( modern Patna ) . The empire was the largest political entity that has ever existed in the Indian subcontinent , extending over 5 million square kilometres ( 1.9 million square miles ) at its zenith under Ashoka . Chandragupta Maurya raised an army , with the assistance of Chanakya ( also known as Kau\u1e6dilya ) , and overthrew the Nanda Empire in c. 322 BCE . Chandragupta rapidly expanded his power westwards across central and western India by conquering the satraps left by Alexander the Great , and by 317 BCE the empire had fully occupied northwestern India . The Mauryan Empire then defeated Seleucus I , a diadochus and founder of the Seleucid Empire during the Seleucid-Mauryan war , thus acquiring territory west of the Indus River . At its greatest extent , the empire stretched along the natural boundary of the Himalayas , to the east into Assam , to the west into what is present-day Balochistan , Pakistan and the Hindu Kush mountains of what is now eastern Afghanistan . The dynasty expanded into India 's southern regions by the reign of the emperor Bindusara , but it excluded Kalinga ( modern Odisha ) , until it was conquered by Ashoka . It declined for about 50 years after Ashoka 's rule , and dissolved in 185 BCE with the foundation of the Shunga dynasty in Magadha . Under Chandragupta Maurya and his successors , internal and external trade , agriculture , and economic activities all thrived and expanded across South Asia due to the creation of a single and efficient system of finance , administration , and security .

It was a resounding Roman defeat with heavy losses , with only about 10,000 out of 40,000 Romans surviving and retreating to Placentia ( Piacenza ) . In this battle , Hannibal got the better of the Romans by exercising the careful and innovative planning for which he was famous . The impetuous and short-sighted opposing general , the consul Tiberius Sempronius Longus , allowed himself to be provoked into a frontal assault under physically difficult circumstances and failed to see that he was being led into a trap . The battle took place in the flat country of the Province of Piacenza on the left bank of the Trebbia River , a shallow , braided stream , not far south from its confluence ( from the south ) with the Po river .

Hannibal surprised the Romans by marching his army overland from Iberia to cross the Alps and invade Roman Italy , followed by his reinforcement by Gallic allies and crushing victories over Roman armies at the Battle of the Trebia in 218 and the Battle of Lake Trasimene in 217 . Moving to southern Italy in 216 , at the Battle of Cannae Hannibal annihilated the largest army the Romans had ever assembled . After the death or imprisonment of 130,000 Roman troops in two years , 40% of Rome 's Italian allies defected to Carthage , giving it control over most of southern Italy . Macedonia and the Kingdom of Syracuse joined the Carthaginian side after Cannae ( see First Macedonian War ) and the conflict spread to Greece and Sicily . From 215-210 the Carthaginian army and navy launched repeated amphibious assaults to capture Roman Sicily and Sardinia ( see Battle of Decimomannu ) but were ultimately repulsed . Against Hannibal 's skill on the battlefield , the Romans adopted the Fabian strategy - the avoidance of battle against Hannibal and defeating his allies and the other Carthaginian generals instead . Roman armies recaptured all of the great cities that had joined Carthage and defeated a Carthaginian attempt to reinforce Hannibal at Metaurus in 207 .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Lake_Trasimene": "The Battle of Lake Trasimene ( 21 June 217 BC ) was a major battle in the Second Punic War . The Carthaginians under Hannibal defeated the Romans under the consul Gaius Flaminius . Hannibal 's victory over the Roman army at Lake Trasimene remains , in terms of the number of men involved , the largest ambush in military history . In the prelude to the battle , Hannibal also achieved the earliest known example of a strategic turning movement .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Cannae": "The Battle of Cannae ( /\u02c8k\u00e6ni , -e\u026a , -a\u026a/ ) [ b ] was a major battle of the Second Punic War that took place on 2 August 216 BC in Apulia , in southeast Italy . The army of Carthage , under Hannibal , surrounded and decisively defeated a larger army of the Roman Republic under the consuls Lucius Aemilius Paullus and Gaius Terentius Varro . It is regarded both as one of the greatest tactical feats in military history and as one of the worst defeats in Roman history . Having recovered from their losses at Trebia ( 218 BC ) and Lake Trasimene ( 217 BC ) , the Romans decided to engage Hannibal at Cannae , with approximately 86,000 Roman and allied troops . They massed their heavy infantry in a deeper formation than usual , while Hannibal used the double envelopment tactic and surrounded his enemy , trapping the majority of the Roman army , who were then slaughtered . The loss of life on the Roman side was one of the most lethal single day 's fighting in history ; Adrian Goldsworthy equates the death toll at Cannae to the massed slaughter of the British Army on the first day of the Somme offensive in 1916 . Only about 15,000 Romans , most of whom were from the garrisons of the camps and had not taken part in the battle , escaped death . Following the defeat , Capua and several other Italian city-states defected from the Roman Republic to Carthage . As news of this defeat reached Rome , the city was gripped in panic . Authorities resorted to extraordinary measures , which included consulting the Sibylline Oracles , dispatching a delegation led by Quintus Fabius Pictor to consult the Delphic oracle in Greece , and burying four people alive as a sacrifice to their gods . To raise two new legions , the authorities lowered the draft age and enlisted criminals , debtors and even slaves . Despite the extreme loss of men and equipment , and a second massive defeat later that same year at Silva Litana , the Romans refused to surrender to Hannibal .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_the_Metaurus": "The Battle of the Metaurus was a pivotal battle in the Second Punic War between Rome and Carthage , fought in 207 BC near the Metauro River in Italy . The Carthaginians were led by Hasdrubal Barca , brother of Hannibal , who was to have brought siege equipment and reinforcements for Hannibal . The Roman armies were led by the consuls Marcus Livius , who was later nicknamed the Salinator , and Gaius Claudius Nero . Claudius Nero had just fought Hannibal in Grumentum , some hundreds of kilometres south of the Metaurus river , and reached Marcus Livius by a forced march that went unnoticed by both Hannibal and Hasdrubal , so that the Carthaginians suddenly found themselves outnumbered . In the battle , the Romans used their numerical superiority to outflank the Carthaginian army and rout them , the Carthaginians losing 15,400 men killed or captured , including Hasdrubal . The battle confirmed Roman supremacy over Italy . Without Hasdrubal 's army to support him , Hannibal was compelled to evacuate pro-Carthaginian towns in much of southern Italy in the face of Roman pressure and withdraw to Bruttium , where he would remain for the next four years .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Zama": "The Battle of Zama - fought in 202 BC near Zama ( Tunisia ) - marked the end of the Second Punic War . A Roman army led by Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus , with crucial support from Numidian leader Masinissa , defeated the Carthaginian army led by Hannibal Barca . After defeating Carthaginian and Numidian armies at the battles of Utica and the Great Plains , Scipio imposed peace terms on the Carthaginians , who had no choice but to accept them . At the same time they recalled their general Hannibal 's army from Italy . Confident in Hannibal 's forces , the Carthaginians broke the armistice with Rome . Scipio and Hannibal confronted each other near Zama Regia . Hannibal had 36,000 infantry to Scipio 's 29,000 . One-third of Hannibal 's army were citizen levies and the Romans had 6,100 cavalry to Carthage 's 4,000 , as most of the Numidian cavalry that Hannibal had employed with great success in Italy had defected to the Romans . Hannibal also employed 80 war elephants . The elephants opened the battle by charging the main Roman army . Scipio 's soldiers avoided the elephants by opening their ranks and drove them off with missiles . The Roman and Numidian cavalry subsequently defeated the Carthaginian cavalry and chased them from the battlefield .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Magnesia": "The Battle of Magnesia was the concluding battle of the Roman-Seleucid War , fought in 190 BC near Magnesia ad Sipylum on the plains of Lydia between Romans , led by the consul Lucius Cornelius Scipio and the Roman ally Eumenes II of Pergamum , and the army of Antiochus III the Great of the Seleucid Empire . A decisive Roman victory resulted in Roman domination over the internal affairs of a large part of the territory once controlled by the Seleucid Empire . The main historical sources for this battle are Livy and Appian .",
  "/wiki/Roman\u2013Seleucid_War": "The Seleucid War ( 192-188 BC ) , also known as the War of Antiochos or the Syrian War , was a military conflict between two coalitions led by the Roman Republic and the Seleucid Empire . The fighting took place in Greece , the Aegean Sea and Asia Minor . The war was the consequence of a cold war between both powers , which had started in 196 BC . In this period Romans and Seleucids had tried to settle spheres of influence by making alliances with the Greek minor powers . The fighting ended with a clear Roman victory . In the Treaty of Apamea the Seleucids were forced to give up Asia Minor , which fell to Roman allies . As a main result of the war the Roman Republic gained hegemony over Greece and Asia Minor , and became the only remaining major power around the Mediterranean Sea .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Pydna": "The Battle of Pydna took place in 168 BC between Rome and Macedon during the Third Macedonian War . The battle saw the further ascendancy of Rome in the Hellenistic world and the end of the Antigonid line of kings , whose power traced back to Alexander the Great . The battle is also considered to be a victory of the Roman legion 's manipular system 's flexibility over the Macedonian phalanx 's rigidity .",
  "/wiki/Third_Macedonian_War": "The Third Macedonian War ( 171-168 BC ) was a war fought between the Roman Republic and King Perseus of Macedon . In 179 BC King Philip V of Macedon died and was succeeded by his ambitious son Perseus . He was anti-Roman and stirred anti-Roman feelings around Macedonia . Tensions escalated and Rome declared war on Macedon . Most of the war was fought in Macedon as well as neighbouring Thessaly , where the Roman troops were stationed . After an inconclusive battle at Callinicus in 171 BC , and several more years of campaigning , Rome decisively defeated the Macedonian forces at the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC , bringing the war to a close . Rome 's victory ended the Antigonid dynasty and brought an effective end to the independence of the Hellenistic kingdom of Macedon , although formal annexation was still some years away . The kingdom was divided into four client republics , each subservient to Rome . Roman prestige and authority in Greece was greatly increased as a result ."
