  "/wiki/Rick_Reichardt": "Frederic Carl Reichardt ( born March 16 , 1943 ) is a Major League outfielder for the Los Angeles Angels/California Angels ( 1964-70 ) , Washington Senators ( 1970 ) , Chicago White Sox ( 1971-73 ) and Kansas City Royals ( 1973-74 ) . He batted and threw right-handed . Reichardt was a spectacular two-sport star at the University of Wisconsin , twice leading the Big 10 in batting , and starring as a fullback on the 1962 # 2 ranked Badgers Rose Bowl team , which was defeated in the 1963 Rose Bowl by # 1 ranked USC in the comeback that never was where the Badgers scored 23 points in the last 12 minutes , but still lost by 5 points ( 42 to 37 ) . His athletic prowess was highly rated by all Major League Baseball scouts , and when a bidding war ensued for his signing , he received a $ 200,000 ( $ 1,670,217 today ) signing bonus from the Los Angeles Angels , a record for that time . It was the bidding war for Reichardt that ultimately led Major League Baseball to institute a draft , which started in 1965 , with Rick Monday being the first ever # 1 overall selection ( he was drafted by the Kansas City Athletics ) . In 1966 , Reichardt became the first player to hit a home run at Anaheim Stadium . Later that season , after batting .288 with 16 home runs and 44 RBI through just 89 games , he was diagnosed with a kidney ailment that necessitated the removal of the kidney . Although he recovered to hit .265 with 17 home runs in 1967 , and .255 with 21 home runs in 1968 , he was never quite the same after the operation . After hitting only 13 home runs in 1969 , he was traded with Aurelio Rodr\u00edguez to the Washington Senators early in the 1970 season for 3rd baseman Ken McMullen . After a trade to the White Sox in 1971 , he managed to hit .278 with 19 homers . From there , age and injuries took their toll and he never again attained double figures in home runs in a season . He retired after 1 at-bat in the 1974 season .",

Founded in 1901 as one of the American League 's eight charter franchises , the Red Sox ' home ballpark has been Fenway Park since 1912 . The Red Sox name was chosen by the team owner , John I. Taylor , circa 1908 , following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the Boston Red Stockings , including the forerunner of the Atlanta Braves . The Red Sox were a dominant team in the new league , defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World Series in 1903 and winning four more championships by 1918 . However , they then went into one of the longest championship droughts in baseball history , dubbed the Curse of the Bambino after its alleged inception due to the Red Sox ' sale of Babe Ruth to the rival New York Yankees two years after their world championship in 1918 , an 86-year wait before the team 's sixth World Championship in 2004 . The team 's history during that period was punctuated with some of the most memorable moments in World Series history , including Enos Slaughter 's mad dash in 1946 , the Impossible Dream of 1967 , Carlton Fisk 's home run in 1975 , and Bill Buckner 's error in 1986 . Following their victory in the 2018 World Series , they became the first team to win four World Series trophies in the 21st century , with championships in 2004 , 2007 , 2013 and 2018 . The team 's history has also been marked by the team 's intense rivalry with the New York Yankees , arguably the fiercest and most historic in North American professional sports .",
