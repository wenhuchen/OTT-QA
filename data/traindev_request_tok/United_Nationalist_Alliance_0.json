[ citation needed ] The Philippines has a multi-party system with numerous political parties , in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone , and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments for political expediency and convenience .

There are three types of parties in the Philippines . These are : ( a ) major parties , which typically correspond to traditional political parties ; ( b ) minor parties or party-list organizations , which rely on the party-list system to win Congressional seats ; and ( c ) regional or provincial parties , which correspond to region-wide or province-wide organizations , respectively .",
