  "/wiki/Video_game_developer": "A video game developer is a software developer that specializes in video game development - the process and related disciplines of creating video games . A game developer can range from one person who undertakes all tasks to a large business with employee responsibilities split between individual disciplines , such as programming , design , art , testing , etc . Most game development companies have video game publisher financial and usually marketing support . Self-funded developers are known as independent or indie developers and usually make indie games . A developer may specialize in a certain video game console ( such as Nintendo 's Nintendo Switch , Microsoft 's Xbox One , Sony 's PlayStation 4 ) , or may develop for a number of systems ( including personal computers and mobile devices ) . [ citation needed ] Video game developers specialize in certain types of games ( such as role-playing video games or first-person shooters ) . Some focus on porting games from one system to another , or translating games from one language to another . Less commonly , some do software development work in addition to games . Most video game publishers maintain development studios ( such as Electronic Arts 's EA Canada , Square Enix 's studios , Activision 's Radical Entertainment , Nintendo EAD and Sony 's Polyphony Digital and Naughty Dog ) . However , since publishing is still their primary activity they are generally described as publishers rather than developers . Developers may be private as well ( such as how Bungie was , the company which developed the Halo series exclusive to Microsoft 's Xbox ) .",
  "/wiki/Video_game_publisher": "A video game publisher is a company that publishes video games that have been developed either internally by the publisher or externally by a video game developer . They often finance the development , sometimes by paying a video game developer ( the publisher calls this external development ) and sometimes by paying an internal staff of developers called a studio . The large video game publishers also distribute the games they publish , while some smaller publishers instead hire distribution companies ( or larger video game publishers ) to distribute the games they publish . Other functions usually performed by the publisher include deciding on and paying for any licenses used by the game ; paying for localization ; layout , printing , and possibly the writing of the user manual ; and the creation of graphic design elements such as the box design . Some large publishers with vertical structure also own publishing subsidiaries ( labels ) . Large publishers may also attempt to boost efficiency across all internal and external development teams by providing services such as sound design and code packages for commonly needed functionality . Because the publisher often finances development , it usually tries to manage development risk with a staff of producers or project managers to monitor the progress of the developer , critique ongoing development , and assist as necessary . Most video games created by an external video game developer are paid for with periodic advances on royalties . These advances are paid when the developer reaches certain stages of development , called milestones .",

  "/wiki/First_person_shooter": "First-person shooter ( FPS ) is a video game genre centered on gun and other weapon-based combat in a first-person perspective ; that is , the player experiences the action through the eyes of the protagonist . The genre shares common traits with other shooter games , which in turn makes it fall under the heading action game . Since the genre 's inception , advanced 3D and pseudo-3D graphics have challenged hardware development , and multiplayer gaming has been integral . The first-person shooter genre has been traced as far back as Maze War , development of which began in 1973 , and 1974 's Spasim . Later , and after more playful titles like MIDI Maze in 1987 , the genre coalesced into a more violent form with 1992 's Wolfenstein 3D , which has been credited with creating the genre 's basic archetype upon which subsequent titles were based . One such title , and the progenitor of the genre 's wider mainstream acceptance and popularity , was Doom , one of the most influential games in this genre ; for some years , the term Doom clone was used to designate this genre due to Doom 's influence . Corridor shooter was another common name for the genre in its early years , since processing limitations of the era 's hardware meant that most of the action in the games had to take place in enclosed areas , such as in cramped spaces like corridors and tunnels . 1998 's Half-Life - along with its 2004 sequel Half-Life 2 - enhanced the narrative and puzzle elements . In 1999 , the Half-Life mod Counter-Strike was released and , together with Doom , is perhaps one of the most influential first-person shooters . GoldenEye 007 , released in 1997 , was a landmark first-person shooter for home consoles , while the Halo series heightened the console 's commercial and critical appeal as a platform for first-person shooter titles . In the 21st century , the first-person shooter is the most commercially viable video game genre , and in 2016 , shooters accounted for over 27% of all video game sales . Several first-person shooters have been popular games for esports and competitive gaming competitions as well .",

  "/wiki/4X": "4X is a genre of strategy-based video and board games in which players control an empire and eXplore , eXpand , eXploit , and eXterminate . The term was coined by Alan Emrich in his September 1993 preview of Master of Orion for Computer Gaming World . Since then , others have adopted the term to describe games of similar scope and design . 4X computer games are noted for their deep , complex gameplay . Emphasis is placed upon economic and technological development , as well as a range of non-military routes to supremacy . Games can take a long time to complete since the amount of micromanagement needed to sustain an empire increases as the empire grows . 4X games are sometimes criticized for becoming tedious for these reasons , and several games have attempted to address these concerns by limiting micromanagement , with varying degrees of success . The earliest 4X games borrowed ideas from board games and 1970s text-based computer games . The first 4X computer games were turn-based , but real-time 4X games are not uncommon . Many 4X computer games were published in the mid-1990s , but were later outsold by other types of strategy games . Sid Meier 's Civilization is an important example from this formative era , and popularized the level of detail that later became a staple of the genre . In the new millennium , several 4X releases have become critically and commercially successful .",

The 1983 video game crash , in part created by too many new companies trying to follow in Activision 's footsteps without the expertise of Activision 's founders , hurt Activision 's position in console games , forcing them to diversify into games for home computers , including the acquisition of Infocom . After a management shift , with CEO Jim Levy replaced by Bruce Davis , the company renamed itself as Mediagenic and branched out into business software applications . Mediagenic quickly fell into debt , and the company was bought for around US $ 500,000 by Bobby Kotick and a small group of investors around 1991 . Kotick instituted a full rework of the company to cover its debts : dismissing most of its staff , moving the company to Los Angeles , and reverting to the Activision name . Building on existing assets , the Kotick-led Activision pursued more publishing opportunities and , after recovering from the former debt , started acquiring numerous studios and intellectual properties over the 1990s and 2000s , among these being the Call of Duty and Guitar Hero series . A holding company was formed as Activision 's parent company to manage the internal and acquired studios . In 2008 , this holding merged with Vivendi Games ( the parent company of Blizzard Entertainment ) and formed Activision Blizzard , with Kotick as its CEO .",

  "/wiki/Resident_Evil_(1996_video_game)": "Resident Evil [ b ] is a survival horror video game developed and released by Capcom originally for the PlayStation in 1996 , and is the first game in the Resident Evil series . The game 's plot follows Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine , members of an elite task force known as S.T.A.R.S. , as they investigate the outskirts of Raccoon City following the disappearance of their team members . They soon become trapped in a mansion infested with zombies and other monsters . The player , having selected to play as Chris or Jill at the start of the game , must explore the mansion to uncover its secrets . Conceived by producer Tokuro Fujiwara as a remake of his earlier horror game Sweet Home ( 1989 ) , the development of Resident Evil was led by Shinji Mikami . It went through several redesigns , initially conceived as a Super NES game in 1993 , then as a fully 3D first-person PlayStation game in 1994 , and then finally a third-person game with pre-rendered backdrops . Gameplay consists largely of third-person action with added emphasis on inventory management , exploration , and puzzle solving . Resident Evil establishes many conventions seen later in the series , including the control scheme , inventory system , save system , and use of 3D models superimposed over pre-rendered backgrounds . Resident Evil was very well received critically and commercially , and is often credited for defining the survival horror genre . Beyond video games , Resident Evil has been credited with re-popularising zombies in mainstream popular culture from the late 1990s onwards ( along with The House of the Dead ) , leading to a renewed interest in zombie films during the 2000s . Resident Evil has since been hailed as one of the greatest video games of all time . Its success has spawned a multimedia franchise including video games , films , comics , novels , and other merchandise .",
  "/wiki/Survival_horror": "Survival horror is a subgenre of video games inspired by horror fiction that focuses on survival of the character as the game tries to frighten players with either horror graphics or scary ambience . Although combat can be part of the gameplay , the player is made to feel less in control than in typical action games through limited ammunition , health , speed and vision , or through various obstructions of the player 's interaction with the game mechanics . The player is also challenged to find items that unlock the path to new areas and solve puzzles to proceed in the game . Games make use of strong horror themes , like dark mazelike environments and unexpected attacks from enemies . The term survival horror was first used for the original Japanese release of Resident Evil in 1996 , which was influenced by earlier games with a horror theme such as 1989 's Sweet Home and 1992 's Alone in the Dark . The name has been used since then for games with similar gameplay , and has been retroactively applied to earlier titles . Starting with the release of Resident Evil 4 in 2005 , the genre began to incorporate more features from action games and more traditional first person and third-person shooter games . This has led game journalists to question whether long-standing survival horror franchises and more recent franchises have abandoned the genre and moved into a distinct genre often referred to as action horror .",

Most of the Dragon Ball Z games from the 16-bit and 32-bit eras were also localized and released in European countries like France , Spain and Portugal because of the strong following the series already had in those countries . Up until 1997 's Dragon Ball GT : Final Bout , none of the Dragon Ball games were localized for the North American market , with the exception of Dragon Power which was graphically altered due to the lack of a license for the franchise .
