  "/wiki/IBM_XIV_Storage_System": "The IBM XIV Storage System is a disk storage server . The system is a collection of modules , each of which is an independent computer with its own memory , interconnections , disk drives , and other subcomponents , laid out in a grid and connected together in parallel using either InfiniBand ( third generation systems ) or Ethernet ( second generation systems ) connections . Each module has an x86 CPU and runs a software platform consisting largely of a modified Linux kernel and other open source software . [ citation needed ] Traditional storage systems distribute a volume across a subset of disk drives in a clustered fashion . The XIV storage system distributes volumes across all modules in 1 MiB chunks ( partitions ) so that all of the modules ' resources are used evenly . For robustness , each logical partition is stored in at least two copies on separate modules , so that if a part of a disk drive , an entire disk drive , or an entire module fails , the data is still available . One can increase the system storage capacity by adding additional modules . When one adds a module , the system automatically redistributes previously stored data to make optimal use of its I/O capacity . Depending on the model and disk type chosen when the machine is ordered , one system can be configured for storage capacity from 27 TB to 324 TB . The XIV software features include remote mirroring , thin provisioning , quality of service controls , LDAP authentication support , VMware support , differential , writable snapshots , online volume migration between two XIV systems and encryption protecting data at rest . The IBM XIV management GUI is a software package that can be installed on operating systems including Microsoft Windows , Linux and Mac OS .

HP Indigo develops , manufactures and markets digital printing solutions , including printing presses , proprietary consumables/supplies and workflow solutions . HP Indigo has offices around the world , with headquarters in Ness Ziona , Israel . Indigo is known as a pioneer of digital printing technology . Digital printing refers to the ability print to without plates or other tooling processes , and has three major benefits : it makes short runs and personalized print cost-effective , it enables the use of variable data ( such as text or images ) , and it makes just-in-time printing possible . As a result , digital presses have changed the economic models for printing in a wide variety of market segments , including labeling , packaging , marketing , as well as educational textbooks , journals and periodicals . These aspects are particularly important given the consolidation and diminishing profitability of traditional print segments , such as the decline of newspapers and magazines . Additionally , digital printing significantly reduces the waste of materials associated with pre-press , obsolescence and warehousing . Because a digital press is capable of printing a different image for each individual impression in its output stream , digital printing enables marketing campaigns to reach consumers in more creative and engaging ways . Examples include highly targeted advertisements , seasonal and limited editions of consumables , new product introductions , and individually personalized products .
