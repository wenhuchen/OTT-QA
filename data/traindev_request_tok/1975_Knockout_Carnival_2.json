The Cats play most of their home games at Kardinia Park ( known for sponsorship reasons as GMHBA Stadium ) and play the remainder at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . Geelong 's traditional guernsey colours are navy blue and white hoops . The club 's nickname , The Cats , was first used in 1923 after a run of losses prompted a local cartoonist to suggest that the club needed a black cat to bring it good luck ."
