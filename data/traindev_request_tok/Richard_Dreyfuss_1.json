In the preface to the novel , he is described as a receiver of stolen goods . He is the leader of a group of children ( the Artful Dodger and Charley Bates among them ) who he teaches to make their livings by pickpocketing and other criminal activities , in exchange for shelter . A distinguishing trait is his constant - and insincere - use of the phrase my dear when addressing others . At the time of the novel , he is said by another character , Monks , to have already made criminals out of scores of children . Nancy , who is the lover of Bill Sikes ( the novel 's lead villain ) , is confirmed to be Fagin 's former pupil . Fagin is a confessed miser who , despite the wealth he has acquired , does very little to improve the squalid lives of the children he guards , or his own . In the second chapter of his appearance , he is shown ( when talking to himself ) that he cares less for their welfare , than that they do not peach ( inform ) on him and the other children . Still darker sides to the character 's nature are shown when he beats the Artful Dodger for not bringing Oliver back ; in his attempted beating of Oliver for trying to escape ; and in his own involvement with various plots and schemes throughout the story . He indirectly but intentionally causes the death of Nancy by falsely informing Sikes that she had betrayed him , when in reality she had shielded Sikes from the law , whereupon Sikes kills her . Near the end of the book , Fagin is captured and sentenced to be hanged , in a chapter that portrays him as pitiable in his anguish . In popular culture , Fagin ( or at least his name ) is used in comparison with adults who use children for illegal activities .",

Despite nearly fifty years as a member-participant in organized crime , Lansky was never found guilty of anything more serious than illegal gambling . He has a legacy of being one of the most financially successful gangsters in American history .
