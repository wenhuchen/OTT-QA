  "/wiki/Jimmy_Savile_sexual_abuse_scandal": "Jimmy Savile ( 1926-2011 ) was an English media personality who was well known in the United Kingdom for his eccentricities and , at the time of his death , was generally respected for his charitable work . He was knighted in 1990 . In late 2012 , almost a year after his death , reports surfaced indicating that Savile had committed sexual abuse against hundreds of individuals throughout his 50-year career , his alleged victims ranging from prepubescent girls and boys to adults . By 11 October 2012 , allegations had been made to thirteen British police forces , which led to the setting-up of inquiries into practices at the BBC and within the National Health Service . On 19 October , London 's Metropolitan Police launched a formal criminal investigation , Operation Yewtree , into historic allegations of child sexual abuse by Savile and other individuals , some still living , over four decades . The Metropolitan Police stated that it was pursuing over 400 lines of inquiry , based on the claims of 200 witnesses , via fourteen police forces across the UK . It described the alleged abuse as being on an unprecedented scale , and the number of potential victims as staggering . By 19 December , eight people had been questioned as part of the investigation . The Met stated that the total number of alleged victims was 589 , of whom 450 alleged abuse by Savile . The report of the investigations undertaken jointly by the police and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children ( NSPCC ) , Giving Victims a Voice , was published on 11 January 2013 . It reported allegations covering a period of 50 years , including 214 alleged acts by Savile which , though uncorroborated , have been formally recorded as crimes , some involving children as young as eight . The report states within the recorded crimes there are 126 indecent acts and 34 rape/penetration offences .",
  "/wiki/Jimmy_Savile": "Sir James Wilson Vincent Savile OBE KCSG ( /\u02c8s\u00e6v\u026al/ ; 31 October 1926 - 29 October 2011 ) was an English DJ , television and radio personality who hosted BBC shows including Top of the Pops and Jim 'll Fix It . He raised an estimated \u00a340 million for charities and , during his lifetime , was widely praised for his personal qualities and as a fund-raiser . After his death , hundreds of allegations of sexual abuse were made against him , leading the police to conclude that Savile had been a predatory sex offender - possibly one of Britain 's most prolific . There had been allegations during his lifetime , but they were dismissed and accusers ignored or disbelieved ; Savile took legal action against some accusers . Savile worked in coal mines as a teenager , reportedly sustaining spinal injuries at the age of 14 , and was a Bevin Boy during the Second World War . He began a career playing records in , and later managing , dance halls , and was said to have been the first disc jockey to use twin turntables to keep music in constant play . His media career started as a disc jockey at Radio Luxembourg in 1958 and on Tyne Tees Television in 1960 , and he developed a reputation for eccentricity and flamboyance . At the BBC , he presented the first edition of Top of the Pops in 1964 and broadcast on Radio 1 from 1968 . From 1975 until 1994 , he presented Jim 'll Fix It , an early Saturday evening television programme in which he arranged for the wishes of viewers , mainly children , to come true . During his lifetime , he was known for fund-raising and supporting charities and hospitals , in particular Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury , Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor Hospital in Berkshire . In 2009 , he was described by The Guardian as a prodigious philanthropist and was honoured for his charity work . He was awarded the OBE in 1971 and was knighted in 1990 .",
  "/wiki/Puberty": "Puberty is the process of physical changes through which a child 's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction . It is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads : the ovaries in a girl , the testes in a boy . In response to the signals , the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth , function , and transformation of the brain , bones , muscle , blood , skin , hair , breasts , and sex organs . Physical growth - height and weight - accelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when an adult body has been developed . Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities , the pre-pubertal physical differences between boys and girls are the external sex organs . On average , girls begin puberty around ages 10-11 and end puberty around 15-17 ; boys begin around ages 11-12 and end around 16-17 . The major landmark of puberty for females is menarche , the onset of menstruation , which occurs on average between ages 12 and 13 . For males , first ejaculation occurs on average at age 13 . In the 21st century , the average age at which children , especially girls , reach puberty is lower compared to the 19th century , when it was 15 for girls and 16 for boys . This can be due to any number of factors , including improved nutrition resulting in rapid body growth , increased weight and fat deposition , or exposure to endocrine disruptors such as xenoestrogens , which can at times be due to food consumption or other environmental factors . Puberty which starts earlier than usual is known as precocious puberty , and puberty which starts later than usual is known as delayed puberty . Notable among the morphologic changes in size , shape , composition , and functioning of the pubertal body , is the development of secondary sex characteristics , the filling in of the child 's body ; from girl to woman , from boy to man .",
  "/wiki/National_Health_Service_(England)": "The National Health Service ( NHS ) is the publicly funded healthcare system in England , and one of the four National Health Service systems in the United Kingdom . It is the largest single-payer healthcare system in the world . Primarily funded by the government from general taxation ( plus a small amount from National Insurance contributions ) , and overseen by the Department of Health and Social Care , the NHS provides healthcare to all legal English residents , with most services free at the point of use . Some services , such as emergency treatment and treatment of infectious diseases , are free for everyone , including visitors . Free healthcare at the point of use comes from the core principles at the founding of the National Health Service . The 1942 Beveridge cross party report established the principles of the NHS which was implemented by the Labour government in 1948 . In practice , free at the point of use normally means that anyone legitimately and fully registered with the system ( i.e. , in possession of an NHS number ) , available to legal UK residents regardless of nationality ( but not non-resident British citizens ) , can access the full breadth of critical and non-critical medical care , without payment except for some specific NHS services , for example eye tests , dental care , prescriptions and aspects of long-term care . These charges are usually lower than equivalent services provided by a private provider and many are free to vulnerable or low-income patients . The NHS provides the majority of healthcare in England , including primary care , in-patient care , long-term healthcare , ophthalmology and dentistry . The National Health Service Act 1946 came into effect on 5 July 1948 . Private health care has continued parallel to the NHS , paid for largely by private insurance : it is used by about 8% of the population , generally as an add-on to NHS services . The NHS is largely funded from general taxation , with a small amount being contributed by National Insurance payments and from fees levied in accordance with recent changes in the Immigration Act 2014 .",
  "/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_Service": "The Metropolitan Police Service ( MPS ) , formerly and still commonly known as the Metropolitan Police and informally as the Met , Scotland Yard , or the Yard , is the territorial police force responsible for law enforcement in the Metropolitan Police District , which currently consists of the 32 London boroughs . The MPD does not include the square mile of the City of London , which is policed by the much smaller City of London Police . The Met also has significant national responsibilities , such as co-ordinating and leading on UK-wide national counter-terrorism matters and protecting the Royal Family , certain members of Her Majesty 's Government and others as deemed appropriate . As the police force for the capital , the Met has significant unique responsibilities and challenges within its police area , such as protecting 164 foreign embassies and High Commissions , policing Heathrow Airport ( the busiest airport in Europe ) , policing and protecting the Palace of Westminster , and dealing with significantly more protests and events than any other force in the country ( 3,500 such events in 2016 ) . As of March 2018 , the Met had 40,327 full-time personnel . This included 30,390 police officers , 8,027 police staff , 1,315 police community support officers and 595 designated officers . This number excludes the 1,731 special constables , who work voluntarily part-time ( a minimum of 16 hours a month ) and who have the same powers and uniform as their regular colleagues . This makes the Metropolitan Police , in terms of officer numbers , the largest police force in the United Kingdom by a significant margin , and one of the biggest in the world . In terms of its police area ( primary geographic area of responsibility ) , leaving its national responsibilities aside , the Met has the eighth-smallest police area of the territorial police forces in the United Kingdom . The overall operational leader of the force is the Commissioner , whose formal title is Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis . The Commissioner is answerable , responsible and accountable to the Queen , the Home Office and the Mayor of London , through the Mayor 's Office for Policing and Crime . The post of Commissioner was first held jointly by Sir Charles Rowan and Sir Richard Mayne .",

The investigation , led by the Metropolitan Police Service , started in October 2012 . After a period of assessment it became a full criminal investigation , involving inquiries into living people , notably other celebrities , as well as Savile . The report of the investigations into the activities of Savile himself was published , as Giving Victims a Voice , in January 2013 . Operation Yewtree continued as an investigation into others , some but not all linked with Savile . By October 2015 , 19 people had been arrested by Operation Yewtree ; seven of these arrests led to convictions . The Yewtree effect has been credited for an increase in the number of reported sex crimes , while the operation also sparked a debate on police procedure and rights of those accused of sex crimes .",
  "/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse": "Child sexual abuse , also called child molestation , is a form of child abuse in which an adult or older adolescent uses a child for sexual stimulation . Forms of child sexual abuse include engaging in sexual activities with a child ( whether by asking or pressuring , or by other means ) , indecent exposure ( of the genitals , female nipples , etc . ) , child grooming , child sexual exploitation or using a child to produce child pornography . Child sexual abuse can occur in a variety of settings , including home , school , or work ( in places where child labor is common ) . Child marriage is one of the main forms of child sexual abuse ; UNICEF has stated that child marriage represents perhaps the most prevalent form of sexual abuse and exploitation of girls . The effects of child sexual abuse can include depression , post-traumatic stress disorder , anxiety , complex post-traumatic stress disorder , propensity to further victimization in adulthood , and physical injury to the child , among other problems . Sexual abuse by a family member is a form of incest and can result in more serious and long-term psychological trauma , especially in the case of parental incest . The global prevalence of child sexual abuse has been estimated at 19.7% for females and 7.9% for males . Most sexual abuse offenders are acquainted with their victims ; approximately 30% are relatives of the child , most often brothers , fathers , uncles , or cousins ; around 60% are other acquaintances , such as friends of the family , babysitters , or neighbors ; strangers are the offenders in approximately 10% of child sexual abuse cases . Most child sexual abuse is committed by men ; studies on female child molesters show that women commit 14% to 40% of offenses reported against boys and 6% of offenses reported against girls . The word pedophile is commonly applied indiscriminately to anyone who sexually abuses a child , but child sexual offenders are not pedophiles unless they have a strong sexual interest in prepubescent children . Under the law , child sexual abuse is often used as an umbrella term describing criminal and civil offenses in which an adult engages in sexual activity with a minor or exploits a minor for the purpose of sexual gratification .",

  "/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal": "The Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal consisted of the organised child sexual abuse that occurred in the northern English town of Rotherham , South Yorkshire , from the late 1980s until the 2010s and the failure of local authorities to act on reports of the abuse throughout most of that period . Researcher Angie Heal , who was hired by local officials and warned them about child exploitation occurring between 2002 and 2007 , has since described it as the biggest child protection scandal in UK history . Evidence of the abuse was first noted in the early 1990s , when care home managers investigated reports that children in their care were being picked up by taxi drivers . From at least 2001 , multiple reports passed names of alleged perpetrators , several from one family , to the police and Rotherham Council . The first group conviction took place in 2010 , when five British-Pakistani men were convicted of sexual offences against girls aged 12-16 . From January 2011 Andrew Norfolk of The Times pressed the issue , reporting in 2012 that the abuse in the town was widespread , and that the police and council had known about it for over ten years . [ a ] The Times articles , along with the 2012 trial of the Rochdale child sex abuse ring , prompted the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee to conduct hearings . Following this and further articles from Norfolk , Rotherham Council commissioned an independent inquiry led by Professor Alexis Jay . In August 2014 the Jay report concluded that an estimated 1,400 children , most of them white British girls , had been sexually abused in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013 by predominantly British-Pakistani men ( Kurdish and Kosovar men were also involved ) . British Asian girls in Rotherham also suffered abuse , but a fear of shame and dishonour made them reluctant to report the abuse to authorities . A common thread was that taxi drivers had been picking the children up for sex from care homes and schools .

  "/wiki/Age_of_consent": "The age of consent is the age at which a person is considered to be legally competent to consent to sexual acts . Consequently , an adult who engages in sexual activity with a person younger than the age of consent can not claim that the sexual activity was consensual , and such sexual activity may be considered child sexual abuse or statutory rape . The person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim and their sex partner is regarded as the offender , unless both are underage . The purpose of setting an age of consent is to protect an underage person from sexual advances . The term age of consent rarely appears in legal statutes . [ page needed ] Generally , a law will instead establish the age below which it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with that person . It has sometimes been used with other meanings , such as the age at which a person becomes competent to consent to marriage , but the meaning given above is the one now generally understood . It should not be confused with other laws regarding age minimums including , but not limited to , the age of majority , age of criminal responsibility , voting age , drinking age , and driving age . Age of consent laws vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction , though most jurisdictions set the age of consent in the range 14 to 18 . The laws may also vary by the type of sexual act , the gender of the participants or other considerations , such as involving a position of trust ; some jurisdictions may also make allowances for minors engaged in sexual acts with each other , rather than a single age . Charges and penalties resulting from a breach of these laws may range from a misdemeanor , such as corruption of a minor , to what is popularly called statutory rape . There are many grey areas in this area of law , some regarding unspecific and untried legislation , others brought about by debates regarding changing societal attitudes , and others due to conflicts between federal and state laws .",

The practice is most widespread in South America and Asia , but prostitution of children exists globally , in undeveloped countries as well as developed . Most of the children involved with prostitution are girls , despite an increase in the number of young boys in the trade .

In August 2014 the Jay report concluded that an estimated 1,400 children , most of them white British girls , had been sexually abused in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013 by predominantly British-Pakistani men ( Kurdish and Kosovar men were also involved ) . British Asian girls in Rotherham also suffered abuse , but a fear of shame and dishonour made them reluctant to report the abuse to authorities . A common thread was that taxi drivers had been picking the children up for sex from care homes and schools . [ b ] The abuse included gang rape , forcing children to watch rape , dousing them with petrol and threatening to set them on fire , threatening to rape their mothers and younger sisters , and trafficking them to other towns .",

  "/wiki/White_people": "White people is a racial classification specifier , used mostly and often exclusively for people of European descent ; depending on context , nationality , and point of view . The term has at times been expanded to encompass persons of Middle Eastern and North African descent ( for example , in the US Census definition ) , persons who are often considered non-white in other contexts . The usage of white people or a white race for a large group of mainly or exclusively European populations , defined by their light skin , among other physical characteristics , and contrasting with black people , Amerindians , and other colored people or persons of color , originated in the 17th century . It was only during the 19th century that this vague category was transformed in a quasi-scientific system of race and skin color relations . The concept of a unified white race did not achieve universal acceptance in Europe when it first came into use in the 17th century , or in the centuries afterward . Nazi Germany regarded some European peoples such as Slavs as racially distinct from themselves . Prior to the modern age , no European peoples regarded themselves as white , but rather defined their race , ancestry , or ethnicity in terms of their nationality . Moreover , there is no accepted standard for determining the geographic barrier between white and non-white people . Contemporary anthropologists and other scientists , while recognizing the reality of biological variation between different human populations , regard the concept of a unified , distinguishable white race as socially constructed . As a group with several different potential boundaries , it is an example of a fuzzy concept . The concept of whiteness has particular resonance in racially diverse countries with large majority or minority populations of more or less mixed European ancestry : e.g. , in the United States ( White Americans ) , Canada ( white Canadians ) , Australia ( white Australians ) , New Zealand ( white New Zealanders ) , the United Kingdom ( white British ) , and South Africa ( white South Africans ) . In much of the rest of Europe , the distinction between race and nationality is more blurred ; when people are asked to describe their race or ancestry , they often describe it in terms of their nationality .",

The ancient parish of Rochdale was a division of the hundred of Salford and one of the largest ecclesiastical parishes in England , comprising several townships . By 1251 , Rochdale had become important enough to have been granted a Royal charter . Rochdale flourished into a centre of northern England 's woollen trade , and by the early 18th century was described as being remarkable for many wealthy merchants . Rochdale rose to prominence in the 19th century as a mill town and centre for textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution . It was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution , and amongst the first industrialised towns . The Rochdale Canal - one of the major navigable broad canals of the United Kingdom - was a highway of commerce during this time used for the haulage of cotton , wool and coal to and from the area .

Worldwide , rape is primarily committed by males against females . Rape by strangers is usually less common than rape by people the victim knows , and male-on-male and female-on-female prison rapes are common and may be the least reported forms of rape . Widespread and systematic rape ( e.g. , war rape ) and sexual slavery can occur during international conflict . These practices are crimes against humanity and war crimes . Rape is also recognized as an element of the crime of genocide when committed with the intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a targeted ethnic group .
