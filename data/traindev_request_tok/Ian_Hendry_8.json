  "/wiki/This_Happy_Breed": "This Happy Breed is a play by No\u00ebl Coward . It was written in 1939 but , because of the outbreak of World War II , it was not staged until 1942 , when it was performed on alternating nights with another Coward play , Present Laughter . The two plays later alternated with Coward 's Blithe Spirit . The title , a reference to the English people , is a phrase from John of Gaunt 's monologue in Act II , Scene 1 of William Shakespeare 's Richard II . The story of the play concerns the working class Gibbons family between the end of World War I and the outbreak of World War II . It anticipates the non-violent ways in which social justice issues might be incorporated into post-war national reconstruction , examines the personal trauma caused by the sudden death of sons and daughters and anticipates the forthcoming return of English men from the war . It is also an intimate portrait of the economy and politics of Great Britain in the 1920s and 1930s ( such as the General Strike of 1926 ) , as well as showing the advances in technology - the arrival of primitive crystal radio sets and telephones , home gas lights being replaced by electricity and mass broadcast radio . This Happy Breed is one of a very few Coward plays to deal entirely with domestic events outside an upper class or upper middle class setting . A number of scenes are reminiscent of previous Coward works , such as Cavalcade ( 1931 ) or the short play Fumed Oak from Tonight at 8.30 ( 1936 ) .",

He is commonly referred to in popular culture by the epithet King of the Wild Frontier . He represented Tennessee in the U.S. House of Representatives and served in the Texas Revolution . Crockett grew up in East Tennessee , where he gained a reputation for hunting and storytelling . He was made a colonel in the militia of Lawrence County , Tennessee and was elected to the Tennessee state legislature in 1821 . In 1827 , he was elected to the U.S. Congress where he vehemently opposed many of the policies of President Andrew Jackson , especially the Indian Removal Act . Crockett 's opposition to Jackson 's policies led to his defeat in the 1831 elections . He was re-elected in 1833 , then narrowly lost in 1835 , prompting his angry departure to Texas ( then the Mexican state of Tejas ) shortly thereafter . In early 1836 , he took part in the Texas Revolution and was likely executed at the Battle of the Alamo after being captured by ( and possibly surrendering to ) the Mexican Army . Crockett became famous during his lifetime for larger-than-life exploits popularized by stage plays and almanacs . After his death , he continued to be credited with acts of mythical proportion . These led in the 20th century to television and movie portrayals , and he became one of the best-known American folk heroes .",

It is a comic account of a woman 's extraordinary mission to end the Peloponnesian War between Greek city states by denying all the men of the land any sex , which was the only thing they truly and deeply desired . Lysistrata persuades the women of the warring cities to withhold sexual privileges from their husbands and lovers as a means of forcing the men to negotiate peace - a strategy , however , that inflames the battle between the sexes . The play is notable for being an early expos\u00e9 of sexual relations in a male-dominated society . Additionally , its dramatic structure represents a shift from the conventions of Old Comedy , a trend typical of the author 's career . It was produced in the same year as the Thesmophoriazusae , another play with a focus on gender-based issues , just two years after Athens ' catastrophic defeat in the Sicilian Expedition . At this time , Greek theatre was a profound form of entertainment , which was extremely popular for all audiences as it addressed political issues relevant to that time .",

Eleven of his forty plays survive virtually complete . These provide the most valuable examples of a genre of comic drama known as Old Comedy and are used to define it , along with fragments from dozens of lost plays by Aristophanes and his contemporaries . Also known as The Father of Comedy and the Prince of Ancient Comedy , Aristophanes has been said to recreate the life of ancient Athens more convincingly than any other author . His powers of ridicule were feared and acknowledged by influential contemporaries ; Plato singled out Aristophanes ' play The Clouds as slander that contributed to the trial and subsequent condemning to death of Socrates , although other satirical playwrights had also caricatured the philosopher . Aristophanes ' second play , The Babylonians ( now lost ) , was denounced by Cleon as a slander against the Athenian polis . It is possible that the case was argued in court , but details of the trial are not recorded and Aristophanes caricatured Cleon mercilessly in his subsequent plays , especially The Knights , the first of many plays that he directed himself . In my opinion , he says through that play 's Chorus , the author-director of comedies has the hardest job of all .",

The role is traditionally believed to have been introduced by Zan Ganassa in the late 16th century , was definitively popularized by the Italian actor Tristano Martinelli in Paris in 1584-1585 , and became a stock character after Martinelli 's death in 1630 . The Harlequin is characterized by his chequered costume . His role is that of a light-hearted , nimble , and astute servant , often acting to thwart the plans of his master , and pursuing his own love interest , Columbina , with wit and resourcefulness , often competing with the sterner and melancholic Pierrot . He later develops into a prototype of the romantic hero . Harlequin inherits his physical agility and his trickster qualities , as well as his name , from a mischievous devil character in medieval passion plays . The Harlequin character first appeared in England early in the 17th century and took centre stage in the derived genre of the Harlequinade , developed in the early 18th century by John Rich . As the Harlequinade portion of English dramatic genre pantomime developed , Harlequin was routinely paired with the character Clown . As developed by Joseph Grimaldi around 1800 , Clown became the mischievous and brutish foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin , who became more of a romantic character . The most influential such in Victorian England were William Payne and his sons the Payne Brothers , the latter active during the 1860s and 1870s .",
