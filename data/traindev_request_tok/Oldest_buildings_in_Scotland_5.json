  "/wiki/Monastery": "A monastery is a building or complex of buildings comprising the domestic quarters and workplaces of monastics , monks or nuns , whether living in communities or alone ( hermits ) . A monastery generally includes a place reserved for prayer which may be a chapel , church , or temple , and may also serve as an oratory , or in the case of communities anything from a single building housing only one senior and two or three junior monks or nuns , to vast complexes and estates housing tens or hundreds . A monastery complex typically comprises a number of buildings which include a church , dormitory , cloister , refectory , library , balneary and infirmary . Depending on the location , the monastic order and the occupation of its inhabitants , the complex may also include a wide range of buildings that facilitate self-sufficiency and service to the community . These may include a hospice , a school , and a range of agricultural and manufacturing buildings such as a barn , a forge , or a brewery . In English usage , the term monastery is generally used to denote the buildings of a community of monks . In modern usage , convent tends to be applied only to institutions of female monastics ( nuns ) , particularly communities of teaching or nursing religious sisters . Historically , a convent denoted a house of friars ( reflecting the Latin ) , now more commonly called a friary . Various religions may apply these terms in more specific ways .",

  "/wiki/Inchmahome_Priory": "Inchmahome Priory is situated on Inchmahome ( Inch meaning an island ) , the largest of three islands in the centre of Lake of Menteith , close to Aberfoyle , Scotland . The name Inchmahome comes from the Gaelic Innis MoCholmaig , meaning Island of St Colmaig . The priory was founded in 1238 by the Earl of Menteith , Walter Comyn , for a small community of the Augustinian order ( the Black Canons ) . The Comyn family were one of the most powerful in Scotland at the time , and had an imposing country house on Inch Talla , one of the other islands on the Lake of Menteith . There is some evidence that there was a church on the island before the priory was established . The priory has a long history of receiving many notable guests . King Robert the Bruce visited three times : in 1306 , 1308 and 1310 . His visits were likely politically motivated , as the first prior had sworn allegiance to Edward I , the English king . In 1358 the future King Robert II also stayed at the priory . In 1547 the priory served as a refuge for Queen Mary , aged four , hidden here for a few weeks following the disastrous defeat of the Scots army at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh during the Rough Wooing . The decline of the monastic orders in the 16th century was hastened by the fact that the heads of abbeys and priories became appointees of the local landowner , who often did not share the religious goals of the monks or ordained priests . In 1547 , the office passed to John , Lord Erskine , who later became head of Cambuskenneth and Dryburgh abbeys .",

It occupies ground overlooking the confluence of the Tweed and Teviot waters , the site of what was once the Royal Burgh of Roxburgh and the intended southern centre for the developing Scottish kingdom at that time . Kelso thus became the seat of a pre-eminently powerful abbacy in the heart of the Scottish Borders . In the 14th century , Roxburgh became a focus for periodic attack and occupation by English forces and Kelso 's monastic community survived a number of fluctuations in control over the area , restoring the abbey infrastructure after episodes of destruction and ultimately retaining Scottish identity . From 1460 onwards , life for the abbey probably grew more settled , but came once again under attack in the early sixteenth century . By the mid-century , through a combination of turbulent events , the abbey effectively ceased to function and the building fell into ruin . Although the site of Kelso Abbey has not been fully excavated in modern times , evidence suggests that it was a major building with two crossings . The only remains standing today are the west tower crossing and part of the infirmary .

  "/wiki/Cistercian": "The Cistercians ( /s\u026a\u02c8st\u025c\u02d0r\u0283\u0259nz/ ) officially the Order of Cistercians ( Latin : ( Sacer ) Ordo Cisterciensis , abbreviated as OCist or SOCist ) , are a Catholic religious order of monks and nuns that branched off from the Benedictines and follow the Rule of Saint Benedict . They are also known as Bernardines , after the highly influential Bernard of Clairvaux ( though that term is also used of one of the Franciscan Orders in Poland and Lithuania ) ; or as White Monks , in reference to the colour of the cuccula or white choir robe worn by the Cistercians over their habits , as opposed to the black cuccula worn by Benedictine monks . The term Cistercian ( French Cistercien ) , derives from Cistercium , the Latin name for the village of C\u00eeteaux , near Dijon in eastern France . It was in this village that a group of Benedictine monks from the monastery of Molesme founded C\u00eeteaux Abbey in 1098 , with the goal of following more closely the Rule of Saint Benedict . The best known of them were Robert of Molesme , Alberic of C\u00eeteaux and the English monk Stephen Harding , who were the first three abbots . Bernard of Clairvaux entered the monastery in the early 1110s with 30 companions and helped the rapid proliferation of the order . By the end of the 12th century , the order had spread throughout France and into England , Wales , Scotland , Ireland , Spain , Portugal , Italy , Scandinavia and Eastern Europe . The keynote of Cistercian life was a return to literal observance of the Rule of St Benedict . Rejecting the developments the Benedictines had undergone , the monks tried to replicate monastic life as it had been in Saint Benedict 's time ; indeed in various points they went beyond it in austerity . The most striking feature in the reform was the return to manual labour , especially agricultural work in the fields , a special characteristic of Cistercian life . The Cistercians also made major contributions to culture and technology in medieval Europe : Cistercian architecture is considered one of the most beautiful styles of medieval architecture ; and the Cistercians were the main force of technological diffusion in fields such as agriculture , hydraulic engineering , and metallurgy . The original emphasis of Cistercian life was on manual labour and self-sufficiency , and many abbeys have traditionally supported themselves through activities such as agriculture and brewing ales .",
