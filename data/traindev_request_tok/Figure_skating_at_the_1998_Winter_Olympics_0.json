Canada 's biggest story at these games was the failure of the men 's ice hockey team to win a medal . For the first time , Canada 's best players ( professional players from the National Hockey League ) were able to compete at the Olympics , so Canadians had high expectations . The team lost its semi-final game to the Czech Republic when goaltender Dominik Ha\u0161ek stopped all five shots he faced in the tie-breaking shootout . Canada then lost the bronze medal game to Finland . The women 's ice hockey team , on the other hand , captured a silver medal in the first Games to feature the women 's event . For the first time , curling was included as an official event , having been showcased as a demonstration sport at Lillehammer in 1994 , and both Canadian teams reached the podium . Also making the news was Ross Rebagliati 's disqualification for marijuana being found in his system and having his gold medal stripped . The IOC reinstated the medal days later .",
