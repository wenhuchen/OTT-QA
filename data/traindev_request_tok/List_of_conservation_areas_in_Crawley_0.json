  "/wiki/Southgate,_West_Sussex": "Southgate is one of the 13 residential neighbourhoods in Crawley , a town and borough in West Sussex , England . Crawley was planned and laid out as a New Town after the Second World War , based on the principle of self-contained neighbourhoods surrounding a town centre of civic and commercial buildings . Southgate was one of the four in the inner ring closest to the town centre , and was intended to be the largest of the nine designed in the original master plan . It was built in two stages between the 1950s and the 1970s , but retains some older buildings from before the New Town era and has significant areas of pre-New Town character . The area was settled by pre-Roman people , and industrial and other artefacts from that era were found during construction of the neighbourhood . In the 19th century , after Crawley was connected to the national railway network , housing developed south of the line around the Brighton Road , which divides the modern neighbourhood in two . New Town-era expansion produced a large residential area with a high proportion of terraced houses and a range of schools , places of worship and community facilities ; but some historic buildings and areas of open space remain , including an award-winning park . The population at the time of the United Kingdom Census 2011 was 8,533 .",
  "/wiki/Level_crossing": "A level crossing is an intersection where a railway line crosses a road or path , or in rare situations an airport runway , at the same level , as opposed to the railway line crossing over or under using an overpass or tunnel .

Other names include railway level crossing , grade crossing , road through railroad , railroad crossing , train crossing , and RXR ( abbreviated ) .",
  "/wiki/Arun_Valley_Line": "The Arun Valley line , also known as the Mid Sussex line , is part of the Southern- and Thameslink-operated railway services . For the initial part of the route trains follow the Brighton main line , and at a junction south of Three Bridges the route turns westwards . It then runs via Crawley , Horsham ( where there is a junction with the Mole Valley line ) and Arundel , before meeting the West Coastway line at Arundel Junction . Trains on the Arun Valley line then proceed to Portsmouth & Southampton . Many stations on this line retain the short platforms which were originally built , not being extended by the Southern Railway when the line was modernised in the 1930s . This causes operational difficulties to this day , which require frequent platform and on-train announcements , telling passengers they must travel in the correct part of the train .",
  "/wiki/Classical_architecture": "Classical architecture usually denotes architecture which is more or less consciously derived from the principles of Greek and Roman architecture of classical antiquity , or sometimes even more specifically , from the works of the Roman architect Vitruvius . Different styles of classical architecture have arguably existed since the Carolingian Renaissance , and prominently since the Italian Renaissance . Although classical styles of architecture can vary greatly , they can in general all be said to draw on a common vocabulary of decorative and constructive elements . In much of the Western world , different classical architectural styles have dominated the history of architecture from the Renaissance until the second world war , though it continues to inform many architects to this day . The term classical architecture also applies to any mode of architecture that has evolved to a highly refined state , such as classical Chinese architecture , or classical Mayan architecture . It can also refer to any architecture that employs classical aesthetic philosophy . The term might be used differently from traditional or vernacular architecture , although it can share underlying axioms with it . For contemporary buildings following authentic classical principles , the term New Classical architecture is sometimes used .",

  "/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_movement": "The Arts and Crafts movement was an international trend in the decorative and fine arts that began in Britain and flourished in Europe and North America between about 1880 and 1920 , emerging in Japan in the 1920s as the Mingei movement . It stood for traditional craftsmanship using simple forms , and often used medieval , romantic , or folk styles of decoration . It advocated economic and social reform and was essentially anti-industrial . It had a strong influence on the arts in Europe until it was displaced by Modernism in the 1930s , and its influence continued among craft makers , designers , and town planners long afterwards . The term was first used by T. J. Cobden-Sanderson at a meeting of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1887 , although the principles and style on which it was based had been developing in England for at least 20 years . It was inspired by the ideas of architect Augustus Pugin , writer John Ruskin , and designer William Morris . The movement developed earliest and most fully in the British Isles and spread across the British Empire and to the rest of Europe and America . It was largely a reaction against the perceived impoverishment of the decorative arts at the time and the conditions in which they were produced .",

Liverymen retain voting rights for the senior civic offices , such as the Lord Mayor , Sheriffs and City of London Corporation , its ancient municipal authority with extensive local government powers . The term livery originated in the specific form of dress worn by retainers of a nobleman and then by extension to special dress to denote status of belonging to a trade . Livery companies evolved from London 's medieval guilds , becoming corporations under Royal Charter responsible for training in their respective trades , as well as for the regulation of aspects such as wage control , labour conditions and industry standards . Early guilds often grew out of parish fraternal organizations , where large groups of members of the same trade lived in close proximity and gathered at the same church . Like most organisations during the Middle Ages , these livery companies had close ties with the Catholic Church ( before the Protestant Reformation ) , endowing religious establishments such as chantry chapels and churches , observing religious festivals with hosting ceremonies and well-known mystery plays . Most livery companies retain their historical religious associations , although nowadays members are free to follow any faith or none . Companies often established a guild or meeting hall , and though they faced destruction in the Great London Fire of 1666 and during World War II , thirty-nine companies maintain their sometimes elaborate and historic halls . Most livery companies still maintain contacts with their original trade , craft or professional roles . Some still exercise powers of regulation , inspection and enforcement , while others are awarding bodies for professional qualifications .",

  "/wiki/Housing_association": "In Ireland and the United Kingdom , housing associations are private , non-profit making organisations that provide low-cost social housing for people in need of a home . Any budget surplus is used to maintain existing housing and to help finance new homes and it can not be used for personal benefit of directors or shareholders . Although independent , they are regulated by the state and commonly receive public funding . They are now the United Kingdom 's major providers of new housing for rent , while many also run shared ownership schemes to help those who can not afford to buy a home outright . Housing associations provide a wide range of housing , some managing large estates of housing for families , while the smallest may perhaps manage a single scheme of housing for older people . Much of the supported accommodation in the UK is also provided by housing associations , with specialist projects for people with mental health issues or learning disabilities , with substance misuse problems ( alcohol or illegal drugs ) , the formerly homeless , young people , ex-offenders , asylum seekers , and people fleeing domestic violence . In Australia , the term housing association refers to larger , growth oriented 'not-for-dividend ' community housing providers . Smaller community housing providers may include trusts , cooperatives etc . State and Territory owned public housing represents about 80% of social housing in Australia . Over the years these public housing entities have had different names including 'housing commissions ' , 'housing trusts ' etc .",

It is 28 miles ( 45 km ) south of London , 18 miles ( 29 km ) north of Brighton and Hove , and 32 miles ( 51 km ) north-east of the county town of Chichester . Crawley covers an area of 17.36 square miles ( 44.96 km2 ) and had a population of 106,597 at the time of the 2011 Census . The area has been inhabited since the Stone Age , and was a centre of ironworking in Roman times . Crawley developed slowly as a market town from the 13th century , serving the surrounding villages in the Weald . Its location on the main road from London to Brighton brought passing trade , which encouraged the development of coaching inns . A rail link to London opened in 1841 . Gatwick Airport , nowadays one of Britain 's busiest international airports , opened on the edge of the town in the 1940s , encouraging commercial and industrial growth . After the Second World War , the British Government planned to move large numbers of people and jobs out of London and into new towns around South East England . The New Towns Act 1946 designated Crawley as the site of one of these . A master plan was developed for the establishment of new residential , commercial , industrial and civic areas , and rapid development greatly increased the size and population of the town over a few decades . The town contains 14 residential neighbourhoods radiating out from the core of the old market town , and separated by main roads and railway lines .",

  "/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England": "The Norman conquest of England ( in Britain , often called the Norman Conquest or the Conquest ) was the 11th-century invasion and occupation of England by an army of Norman , Breton , Flemish , and French soldiers led by the Duke of Normandy , later styled William the Conqueror . William 's claim to the English throne derived from his familial relationship with the childless Anglo-Saxon king Edward the Confessor , who may have encouraged William 's hopes for the throne . Edward died in January 1066 and was succeeded by his brother-in-law Harold Godwinson . The Norwegian king Harald Hardrada invaded northern England in September 1066 and was victorious at the Battle of Fulford , but Godwinson 's army defeated and killed Hardrada at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September . Within days , William landed in southern England . Harold marched south to oppose him , leaving a significant portion of his army in the north . Harold 's army confronted William 's invaders on 14 October at the Battle of Hastings ; William 's force defeated Harold , who was killed in the engagement . Although William 's main rivals were gone , he still faced rebellions over the following years and was not secure on his throne until after 1072 . The lands of the resisting English elite were confiscated ; some of the elite fled into exile . To control his new kingdom , William granted lands to his followers and built castles commanding military strongpoints throughout the land with the Domesday Book , a manuscript record of the Great Survey of much of England and parts of Wales being completed by 1086 . Other effects of the conquest included the court and government , the introduction of the Norman language as the language of the elites , and changes in the composition of the upper classes , as William enfeoffed lands to be held directly from the king . More gradual changes affected the agricultural classes and village life : the main change appears to have been the formal elimination of slavery , which may or may not have been linked to the invasion .",

The term dead end is understood in all varieties of English , but the official terminology and traffic signs include many different alternatives . Some of these are used only regionally . In the United States and other countries , cul-de-sac is often not an exact synonym for dead end and refers to dead ends with a circular end , allowing for easy turning at the end of the road . In Australia and Canada , they are usually referred to as a court when they have a bulbous end . Dead ends are created in urban planning to limit through-traffic in residential areas . While some dead ends provide no possible passage except in and out of their road entry , others allow cyclists , pedestrians or other non-automotive traffic to pass through connecting easements or paths , an example of filtered permeability . The International Federation of Pedestrians proposed to call such streets living end streets and to provide signage at the entry of the streets that make this permeability for pedestrians and cyclists clear . Its application retains the dead end 's primary function as a non-through road , but establishes complete pedestrian and bicycle network connectivity .",

  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",

These imply strength , permanence , and expense , all reinforcing the onlooker 's sense of a structure 's presence . Stone quoins are used on stone or brick buildings . Brick quoins may appear on brick buildings , extending from the facing brickwork in such a way as to give the appearance of generally uniformly cut ashlar blocks of stone larger than the bricks .

  "/wiki/Bargeboard": "Bargeboard ( probably from Medieval Latin bargus , or barcus , a scaffold , and not from the now obsolete synonym vergeboard ) is a board fastened to the projecting gables of a roof to give them strength , protection , and to conceal the otherwise exposed end of the horizontal timbers or purlins of the roof to which they were attached . Bargeboards are sometimes moulded only or carved , but as a rule the lower edges were cusped and had tracery in the spandrels besides being otherwise elaborated . An example in Britain was one at Ockwells in Berkshire ( built 1446-1465 ) , which was moulded and carved as if it were intended for internal work . In New Orleans , bargeboard is the wood from which many of the creole cottages were constructed in the early to mid-1800s . Barges were constructed up-river to carry goods to New Orleans , and upon arrival dismantled and used for construction of houses . The planks are generally 2 inches ( 5.1 cm ) thick and of varying lengths and widths , although 10 inches ( 25 cm ) width is common . It is hard , solid wood that has lasted between 150 and 200 years in a wet , humid climate . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/Modernism": "Modernism is both a philosophical movement and an art movement that , along with cultural trends and changes , arose from wide-scale and far-reaching transformations in Western society during the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Among the factors that shaped modernism were the development of modern industrial societies and the rapid growth of cities , followed then by reactions to the horrors of World War I. Modernism also rejected the certainty of Enlightenment thinking , although many modernists also rejected religious belief . Modernism , in general , includes the activities and creations of those who felt the traditional forms of art , architecture , literature , religious faith , philosophy , social organization , activities of daily life , and sciences were becoming ill-fitted to their tasks and outdated in the new economic , social , and political environment of an emerging fully industrialized world . The poet Ezra Pound 's 1934 injunction to Make it new ! was the touchstone of the movement 's approach towards what it saw as the now obsolete culture of the past . In this spirit , its innovations , like the stream-of-consciousness novel , atonal ( or pantonal ) and twelve-tone music , divisionist painting and abstract art , all had precursors in the 19th century . A notable characteristic of modernism is self-consciousness and irony concerning literary and social traditions , which often led to experiments with form , along with the use of techniques that drew attention to the processes and materials used in creating a painting , poem , building and other works of art . Modernism explicitly rejected the ideology of realism [ full citation needed ] and made use of the works of the past by the employment of reprise , incorporation , rewriting , recapitulation , revision and parody . While some scholars see modernism continuing into the 21st century , others see it evolving into late modernism or high modernism . Postmodernism is a departure from modernism and refutes its basic assumptions .",

  "/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_architecture": "Anglo-Saxon architecture was a period in the history of architecture in England , and parts of Wales , from the mid-5th century until the Norman Conquest of 1066 . Anglo-Saxon secular buildings in Britain were generally simple , constructed mainly using timber with thatch for roofing . No universally accepted example survives above ground . There are , however , many remains of Anglo-Saxon church architecture . At least fifty churches are of Anglo-Saxon origin with major Anglo-Saxon architectural features , with many more claiming to be , although in some cases the Anglo-Saxon part is small and much-altered . It is often impossible to reliably distinguish between pre- and post-Conquest 11th century work in buildings where most parts are later additions or alterations . The round-tower church and tower-nave church are distinctive Anglo-Saxon types . All surviving churches , except one timber church , are built of stone or brick , and in some cases show evidence of re-used Roman work . The architectural character of Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical buildings range from Celtic influenced architecture in the early period ; Early Christian basilica influenced architecture ; and in the later Anglo-Saxon period , an architecture characterised by pilaster-strips , blank arcading , baluster shafts and triangular headed openings . In the last decades of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom a more general Romanesque style was introduced from the Continent , as in the now built-over additions to Westminster Abbey made from 1050 onwards , already influenced by Norman style . In recent decades architectural historians have become less confident that all undocumented minor Romanesque features post-date the Norman Conquest . Although once common , it has been incorrect for several decades to use the plain term Saxon for anything Anglo-Saxon that is later than the initial period of settlement in Britain .",

  "/wiki/Tree_preservation_order": "A tree preservation order ( TPO ) is a part of town and country planning in the United Kingdom . A TPO is made by a local planning authority ( usually a local council ) to protect specific trees or a particular area , group or woodland from deliberate damage and destruction if those trees are important for the amenity of the area . In Scotland TPOs can also be used to protect trees of historic or cultural significance . TPOs make the felling , lopping , topping , uprooting or otherwise willful damaging of trees without the permission of the local planning authority a legal offence , although different TPOs have different degrees of protection . They can be made very quickly and in practice it is normal for a council to make an emergency TPO in less than a day in cases of immediate danger to trees .",
