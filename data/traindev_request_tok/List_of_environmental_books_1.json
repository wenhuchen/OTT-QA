For example , an e-book , a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book will each have a different ISBN . The ISBN is ten digits long if assigned before 2007 , and thirteen digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007 . The method of assigning an ISBN is nation-specific and varies between countries , often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country . The initial ISBN identification format was devised in 1967 , based upon the 9-digit Standard Book Numbering ( SBN ) created in 1966 . The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108 ( the 9-digit SBN code can be converted to a 10-digit ISBN by prefixing it with a zero digit ' 0 ' ) .

The organisms , each termed a symbiont , may be of the same or of different species . In 1879 , Heinrich Anton de Bary defined it as the living together of unlike organisms . The term was subject to a century-long debate about whether it should specifically denote mutualism , as in lichens ; biologists have now abandoned that restriction . Symbiosis can be obligatory , which means that one or both of the symbionts entirely depend on each other for survival , or facultative ( optional ) when they can generally live independently . Symbiosis is also classified by physical attachment ; symbiosis in which the organisms have bodily union is called conjunctive symbiosis , and symbiosis in which they are not in union is called disjunctive symbiosis . When one organism lives on the surface of another , such as head lice on humans , it is called ectosymbiosis ; when one partner lives inside the tissues of another , such as Symbiodinium within coral , it is termed endosymbiosis .",
