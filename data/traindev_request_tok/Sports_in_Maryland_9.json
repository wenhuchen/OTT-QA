' , which was another minor league in pro football that formed in 1936 , ( not to be confused with another American Association , an early famous major league baseball group from 1881-1892 ) , its popularity ( and attendance ) rivaled that of another earlier established major league grouping , the National Football League of 1922 ( originally the American Professional Football Conference formed in 1920 , later quickly renamed American Professional Football Association ) . Unlike most professional football minor leagues , the Dixie League had a relative stability in membership during the Great Depression in the years prior to World War II , maintaining a five or six-team lineup membership of franchises ( and adding a team in North Carolina upon the demise of their Washington team franchise in 1941 ) . Like the competitor 'AA ' and the third American Football League , the Dixie League suspended operations after the Pearl Harbor attack by Japan , on the Day of Infamy - Sunday , December 7 , 1941 ; unlike the AFL , the football minor league reorganized after the end of the War and resumed competition in the first post-war season year of 1946 . The following year , the 'D.L .

  "/wiki/Arena_Football_League": "The Arena Football League ( AFL ) was a professional indoor American football league in the United States . It was founded in 1987 by Jim Foster , making it the third longest-running professional football league in North America , after the Canadian Football League ( CFL ) and the National Football League ( NFL ) . The AFL played a proprietary code known as arena football , a form of indoor American football played on a 66-by-28 yard field ( about a quarter of the surface area of an NFL field ) , with rules encouraging offensive performance , resulting in a faster-paced and higher-scoring game . The sport was invented in the early 1980s and patented by Foster , a former executive of the United States Football League ( USFL ) and the NFL . From 2000 to 2009 , the AFL had its own developmental league , the af2 . The AFL played 22 seasons from 1987 to 2008 ; internal issues caused the league to cancel its 2009 season , though the af2 did play . Later that year both the AFL and af2 were dissolved and reorganized as a new corporation comprising teams from both leagues , and the AFL returned in 2010 . The league 's average game attendance after returning in 2010 was approximately 9,500 . The league historically had a nationwide footprint , and was recognized as the most prominent professional indoor football league in North America , offering higher payment , more widespread media exposure , and a longer history than competing leagues . From a high of 19 teams in 2007 , the league contracted to a low of four teams in 2018 , all in the northeastern United States . There were six teams playing in 2019 , the league 's final season . On October 29 , 2019 , league commissioner Randall Boe confirmed reports that the league had discontinued operating teams in local markets for the 2020 season .",
  "/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Football_League": "The Atlantic Coast Football League ( ACFL ) was a minor football league that operated from 1962 to 1973 . Until 1969 , many of its franchises had working agreements with NFL and AFL teams to serve as farm clubs . The league paid a base salary of $ 100 per game and had 36 players on each active roster . For the first few years , Joe Rosentover served as league president . He had served in the same capacity for the American Football League ( formerly the American Association ) from 1947 to 1950 ; a relative , John Rosentover , had run the league from 1936 to 1947 . In fact , several of the teams from the AA were revived in the ACFL , including the Providence Steam Roller , Newark Bears and a team in Paterson , New Jersey . By 1968 , Rosentover had left the organization and been superseded by commissioner Cosmo Iacavazzi . In 1965 , three of the franchises ( the Hartford Charter Oaks , Newark Bears and Springfield Acorns ) joined with five teams from the United Football League to create the Continental Football League . The league picked up four franchises from that league when it folded in 1969 ( Norfolk Neptunes , Orlando Panthers , Jersey Jays and Indianapolis Capitols ) ; the Neptunes and Panthers were exactly the same teams as the Acorns and Bears respectively , having relocated during their time in the CoFL . In 1970 , the Orlando Panthers signed a husband and wife duo , Steven and Patricia Palinkas , as a kicker and holder respectively . Steven did not make the team , but Patricia did , making her the first female professional football player . Other notable ACFL players included Pro Bowl fullback Marvin Hubbard , league leading running back Mel Meeks , kicker Booth Lusteg , three-time championship winning quarterback Jim The King Corcoran , eventual 11-year NFL veteran Bob Tucker , and offensive lineman Paul Dr. Z Zimmermann , who shortly after his retirement began an over 40-year career as a sportswriter , much of that time with Sports Illustrated .",

They were one of the least successful teams in the AAFC and NFL both on and off the field , winning only 11 games in their history . In 1953 , Baltimore was granted an expansion team that revived the Colts name ; since 1984 , this team is now the Indianapolis Colts . The Colts ' origin is with the Miami Seahawks , one of the charter franchises of the AAFC . After playing a single disastrous season the Seahawks were confiscated by the league , and were purchased and reorganized by a group of businessmen as the Baltimore Colts . The new team struggled through the next three seasons , but managed to grow a sizable fan base in Baltimore . In 1949 , the Colts were one of three AAFC teams , along with the San Francisco 49ers and the Cleveland Browns , to be brought into the NFL following the AAFC-NFL merger .

However , the AAFC was ultimately unable to sustain itself in competition with the NFL . After its folding , three of its teams were admitted to the NFL : the San Francisco 49ers , the Cleveland Browns and the original Baltimore Colts ( not to be confused with the later Baltimore Colts team , now the Indianapolis Colts ) . The AAFC was the second American professional football league ( the first being the third American Football League of 1940-1941 ) to have its teams play in a double round robin format in the regular season : each team had a home game and an away game with each of the other AAFC teams . The Cleveland Browns were the AAFC 's most successful club , winning every annual championship in the league 's four years of operation .",
  "/wiki/National_Football_League": "The National Football League ( NFL ) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams , divided equally between the National Football Conference ( NFC ) and the American Football Conference ( AFC ) . The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America and the highest professional level of American football in the world . The NFL 's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December , with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week . Following the conclusion of the regular season , six teams from each conference ( four division winners and two wild card teams ) advance to the playoffs , a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl , which is usually held on the first Sunday in February and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC . The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season . After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings , a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966 . Following an agreement to merge the NFL with the American Football League ( AFL ) , the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 to determine a champion between the best teams from the two leagues and has remained as the final game of each NFL season since the merger was completed in 1970 . Today , the NFL has the highest average attendance ( 67,591 ) of any professional sports league in the world and is the most popular sports league in the United States . The Super Bowl is also among the biggest club sporting events in the world , with the individual games accounting for many of the most watched television programs in American history and all occupying the Nielsen 's Top 5 tally of the all-time most watched U.S. television broadcasts by 2015 . The Green Bay Packers hold the most combined NFL championships with 13 , winning nine titles before the Super Bowl era and four Super Bowls afterwards .

They were the most successful American team in the CFL 's generally ill-fated southern expansion effort into the United States , and by at least one account , the winningest expansion team in North American professional sports history at the time . They had winning records in each season , won a division championship , and , in 1995 , became the only American franchise to win the Grey Cup . Only a month after the Stallions ' Grey Cup triumph , the state 's Maryland Stadium Authority and the City of Baltimore announced that they had reached an agreement with Art Modell , the long-time owner of the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League , ( NFL ) to move his franchise to Baltimore for the 1996 season . Knowing they could not begin to compete with an overwhelmingly more popular brand in their home country , the Stallions ' ownership group re-located their football organization to Montreal , reviving the dormant franchise based there as the third and current iteration of the Montreal Alouettes .

After their collapse in 1982 , they were immediately reconstituted under new ownership as the Montreal Concordes . After playing for four years as the Concordes , they revived the Alouettes name for the 1986 season . A second folding in 1987 led to a nine-year hiatus of CFL football in the city .

The Stallions were disbanded at the same time as the Alouettes ' re-establishment after having been the most successful of the CFL 's American expansion franchises , culminating in a Grey Cup championship in 1995 .

The league played a spring/summer schedule in each of its active seasons . The 1986 season was scheduled to be played in the autumn/winter , directly competing against the long-established National Football League ( NFL ) . However , the USFL ceased operations before that season was scheduled to begin . The ideas behind the USFL were conceived in 1965 by New Orleans businessman David Dixon , who saw a market for a professional football league that would play in the summer , when the National Football League and college football were in their off-season . Dixon had been a key player in the construction of the Louisiana Superdome and the expansion of the NFL into New Orleans in 1967 . He developed The Dixon Plan - a blueprint for the USFL based upon securing NFL-caliber stadiums in top TV markets , securing a national TV broadcast contract , and controlling spending - and found investors willing to buy in . Though the original franchise owners and founders of the USFL had promised to abide by the general guidelines set out by Dixon 's plan , problems arose before the teams took the field , with some franchises facing financial problems and instability from the beginning . Due to pressure from the NFL , some franchises had difficulty securing leases in stadiums that were also used by NFL teams , forcing them to scramble to find alternate venues in their chosen city or hurriedly move to a new market . The USFL had no hard salary cap , and because of this , some teams quickly escalated player payrolls to unsustainable levels despite pledges to keep costs under control . While a handful of USFL franchises abided by the Dixon Plan and were relatively stable , others suffered repeated financial crises , and there were many franchise relocations , mergers , and ownership changes during the league 's short existence ; however , none of its teams actually folded during any given season . These problems were worsened as some owners began engaging in bidding wars for star players against NFL teams and each other , forcing other owners to do the same or face a competitive disadvantage .",

It was formed by Jeff Spitaleri , his brother Eric , and a third member , Cory Trapp , all from the Canton , Ohio , area . The league was originally called the Ohio-Penn Indoor Football League , but then executives decided to increase the league 's appeal to the entire Great Lakes region . Initially , the league was relatively successful , having a cumulative attendance over 75,000 in the inaugural regular season . However , the league , like other indoor football associations , was plagued by folding franchises and unenforceable policies throughout its existence . For example , the 2006 champion Port Huron Pirates were found to have been paying some of their players over the league salary cap . In 2007 , several teams folded during the season , and during the 2008 season , the league 's most successful team , the Rochester Raiders , moved to another league due to frustration over the failure of the league to provide notice of an opponent 's forfeiture , resulting in lost ticket and advertising revenue . The league also failed to return the Raiders ' owners ' emergency fund deposit , which was collected specifically to protect against such occurrences . The CIFL is among several indoor football leagues that maintained a mostly regional operation , with most of its teams clustered in the Midwestern United States . Teams went back and forth between the CIFL and the other regional leagues , as well as the Indoor Football League ( a national league of similar caliber ) , over the course of the league 's history .
