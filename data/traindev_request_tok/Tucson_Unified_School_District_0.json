  "/wiki/Orange_(colour)": "Orange is the colour between yellow and red on the spectrum of visible light . Human eyes perceive orange when observing light with a dominant wavelength between roughly 585 and 620 nanometres . In painting and traditional colour theory , it is a secondary colour of pigments , created by mixing yellow and red . It is named after the fruit of the same name . The orange colour of carrots , pumpkins , sweet potatoes , oranges , and many other fruits and vegetables comes from carotenes , a type of photosynthetic pigment . These pigments convert the light energy that the plants absorb from the sun into chemical energy for the plants ' growth . Similarly the hues of autumn leaves are from the same pigment after chlorophyll is removed . In Europe and America , surveys show that orange is the colour most associated with amusement , the unconventional , extroverts , warmth , fire , energy , activity , danger , taste and aroma , the autumn and Allhallowtide seasons , as well as having long been the national colour of the Netherlands and the House of Orange .

  "/wiki/Saber-toothed_cat": "A saber-toothed cat ( alternatively spelled sabre-toothed cat ) is any member of various living and extinct groups of predatory mammals that are characterized by long , curved saber-shaped canine teeth which protruded from the mouth even when closed . The saber-toothed cats , both living and extinct , have been found almost worldwide from the Eocene epoch to the end of the Pleistocene epoch 42 million years ago ( mya ) - 11,000 years ago ( kya ) . The first saber-toothed cat fossil in Canada was found in Medicine Hat , Alberta . One of the best-known genera is Smilodon , species of which , especially S. fatalis , are popularly , but incorrectly , referred as a saber-toothed tiger . However , usage of the word cat is in some cases a misnomer , as many species referred to as saber-toothed cats are not closely related to modern cats ( Felidae ) . Instead , many are members are classified into different families of Feliformia , such as Barbourofelidae and Nimravidae ; the oxyaenid creodont genera Machaeroides and Apataelurus ; and two extinct lineages of metatherian mammals , the thylacosmilids of Sparassodonta , and deltatheroideans , which are more closely related to marsupials . In this regard , saber-toothed cats can be viewed as examples of convergent evolution . This convergence is remarkable due not only to the development of elongated canines , but also a suite of other characteristics , such as a wide gape and bulky forelimbs , which is so consistent that it has been termed the saber-tooth suite . Of the feliform lineages , the family Nimravidae is the oldest , entering the landscape around 42 mya and becoming extinct by 7.2 mya . Barbourofelidae entered around 16.9 mya and were extinct by 9 mya . These two would have shared some habitats .",

  "/wiki/Cougars": "The cougar ( Puma concolor ) is a large felid of the subfamily Felinae . It is native to the Americas . Its range spans from the Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes in South America , and is the widest of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere . It is an adaptable , generalist species , occurring in most American habitat types . Due to its wide range , it has many names including puma , mountain lion , red tiger , and catamount . It is the second-heaviest cat in the New World after the jaguar . Secretive and largely solitary by nature , the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and crepuscular , although daytime sightings do occur . The cougar is more closely related to smaller felines , including the domestic cat , than to any species of subfamily Pantherinae , of which only the jaguar is extant in the Americas . The cougar is an ambush predator that pursues a wide variety of prey . Primary food sources are ungulates , particularly deer . It also hunts species as small as insects and rodents . This cat prefers habitats with dense underbrush and rocky areas for stalking , but can also live in open areas .",
  "/wiki/Red": "Red is the color at the end of the visible spectrum of light , next to orange and opposite violet . It has a dominant wavelength of approximately 625-740 nanometres . It is a primary color in the RGB color model and the CMYK color model , and is the complementary color of cyan . Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson , and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy . The red sky at sunset results from Rayleigh scattering , while the red color of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite or red ochre , both forms of iron oxide . Iron oxide also gives the red color to the planet Mars . The red color of blood comes from the protein hemoglobin , while ripe strawberries , red apples and reddish autumn leaves are colored by anthocyanins . Red pigment made from ochre was one of the first colors used in prehistoric art . The Ancient Egyptians and Mayans colored their faces red in ceremonies ; Roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate victories . It was also an important color in China , where it was used to color early pottery and later the gates and walls of palaces . :60-61 In the Renaissance , the brilliant red costumes for the nobility and wealthy were dyed with kermes and cochineal . The 19th century brought the introduction of the first synthetic red dyes , which replaced the traditional dyes .",
  "/wiki/Blue": "Blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments in painting and traditional colour theory , as well as in the RGB colour model . It lies between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light . The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres . Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colours ; azure contains some green , while ultramarine contains some violet . The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering . An optical effect called Tyndall scattering explains blue eyes . Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called aerial perspective . Blue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times . The semi-precious stone lapis lazuli was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery and ornament and later , in the Renaissance , to make the pigment ultramarine , the most expensive of all pigments . In the eighth century Chinese artists used cobalt blue to colour fine blue and white porcelain . In the Middle Ages , European artists used it in the windows of cathedrals . Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye woad until it was replaced by the finer indigo from America .",

By far the largest contributor to green in nature is chlorophyll , the chemical by which plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into chemical energy . Many creatures have adapted to their green environments by taking on a green hue themselves as camouflage . Several minerals have a green color , including the emerald , which is colored green by its chromium content . During post-classical and early modern Europe , green was the color commonly associated with wealth , merchants , bankers and the gentry , while red was reserved for the nobility . For this reason , the costume of the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci and the benches in the British House of Commons are green while those in the House of Lords are red . It also has a long historical tradition as the color of Ireland and of Gaelic culture . It is the historic color of Islam , representing the lush vegetation of Paradise .

  "/wiki/Badger": "Badgers are short-legged omnivores in the families Mustelidae ( which also includes the otters , polecats , weasels , and ferrets ) , and Mephitidae ( which also includes the skunks ) . Badgers are a polyphyletic grouping , and are not a natural taxonomic grouping : badgers are united by possession of a squat body adapted for fossorial activity . All belong to the caniform suborder of carnivoran mammals . The 11 species of mustelid badgers are grouped in four subfamilies : Melinae ( 4 species , including the European badger ) , Helictidinae ( 5 species of ferret-badger ) , Mellivorinae ( the honey badger or ratel ) , and Taxideinae ( the American badger ) ; the respective genera are Arctonyx , Meles , Melogale , Mellivora and Taxidea . Badgers include the most basal mustelids ; the American badger is the most basal of all , followed successively by the ratel and Melinae ; the estimated split dates are about 17.8 , 15.5 and 14.8 million years ago , respectively . The two species of Asiatic stink badgers of the genus Mydaus were formerly included within Melinae ( and thus Mustelidae ) , but more recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually members of the skunk family . Badger mandibular condyles connect to long cavities in their skulls , which gives resistance to jaw dislocation and increases their bite grip strength . This in turn limits jaw movement to hinging open and shut , or sliding from side to side , but it does not hamper the twisting movement possible for the jaws of most mammals . Badgers have rather short , wide bodies , with short legs for digging . They have elongated , weasel-like heads with small ears . Their tails vary in length depending on species ; the stink badger has a very short tail , while the ferret badger 's tail can be 46-51 cm ( 18-20 in ) long , depending on age . They have black faces with distinctive white markings , grey bodies with a light-coloured stripe from head to tail , and dark legs with light-coloured underbellies ."
