  "/wiki/Zamorin": "The Zamorin of Calicut ( Malayalam : Samoothiri , Portuguese : Samorim , Dutch : Samorijn , Chinese : Shamitihsi ) was the hereditary monarch of the kingdom of Kozhikode ( Calicut ) on the Malabar Coast of India . Kozhikode was one of the important trading ports on the south-western coast of India . At the peak of their reign , the Samoothiri 's ruled over a region from Kollam ( Quilon ) to Panthalayini Kollam ( Koyilandy ) . It was after the dissolution of the kingdom of Cheras of Cranganore ( Kodungallur ) in the early 12th century , the Samoothiris - originally autonomous chiefs of Eranadu - demonstrated their political independence . The Samoothiris maintained elaborate trade relations with the Muslim Middle-Eastern sailors in the Indian Ocean , the primary spice traders on the Malabar Coast in the Middle Ages . Kozhikode was then an important entrep\u00f4t in south-western India where Chinese and West Asian trade met . The Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama visited the Kozhikode in 1498 , opening the sailing route directly from Europe to Asia . The Portuguese efforts to lay the foundations to Estado da \u00cdndia , and to take complete control over the commerce was repeatedly hampered by the forces of Samoothiri of Kozhikode . The Kunjali Marakkars , the famous Muslim warriors , were the naval chiefs of Kozhikode . By the end of the 16th century the Portuguese - now commanding the spice traffic on the Malabar Coast - had succeeded in replacing the Muslim merchants in the Arabian Sea . The Dutch supplanted the Portuguese in the 17th century , only to be followed by the English . In 1766 Haider Ali of Mysore defeated the Samoothiri of Kozhikode - an English East India Company dependant at the time - and absorbed Kozhikode to his state .",
