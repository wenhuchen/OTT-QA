For example , FIFA 98 , Madden NFL 98 , NBA Live 98 , and NHL 98 were released for the Sega Genesis and the Super NES throughout 1997 ; Madden NFL 2005 and FIFA 2005 had PlayStation releases in 2004 ( FIFA 2005 and Madden NFL 2005 were also the last two PlayStation titles to be released ) ; and NCAA Football 08 had an Xbox release in 2007 . Madden NFL 08 also had Xbox and Nintendo GameCube releases in 2007 , and was the final title released for the GameCube , with Madden NFL 09 following as the final Xbox title .
