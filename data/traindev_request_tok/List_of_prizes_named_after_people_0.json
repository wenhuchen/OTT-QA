It is named after Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel ( 1802-1829 ) and directly modeled after the Nobel Prizes . It comes with a monetary award of 7.5 million Norwegian Kroner ( NOK ) . The Abel Prize 's history dates back to 1899 , when its establishment was proposed by the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie when he learned that Alfred Nobel 's plans for annual prizes would not include a prize in mathematics . In 1902 , King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway indicated his willingness to finance a mathematics prize to complement the Nobel Prizes , but the establishment of the prize was prevented by the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905 . It took almost a century before the prize was finally established by the Government of Norway in 2001 , and it was specifically intended to give the mathematicians their own equivalent of a Nobel Prize . The laureates are selected by the Abel Committee , the members of which are appointed by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters . The award ceremony takes place in the Aula of the University of Oslo , where the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded between 1947 and 1989 . The Abel Prize board has also established an Abel symposium , administered by the Norwegian Mathematical Society .",

His most famous single result is the first complete proof demonstrating the impossibility of solving the general quintic equation in radicals . This question was one of the outstanding open problems of his day , and had been unresolved for over 250 years . He was also an innovator in the field of elliptic functions , discoverer of Abelian functions . He made his discoveries while living in poverty and died at the age of 26 from tuberculosis . Most of his work was done in six or seven years of his working life . Regarding Abel , the French mathematician Charles Hermite said : Abel has left mathematicians enough to keep them busy for five hundred years . Another French mathematician , Adrien-Marie Legendre , said : quelle t\u00eate celle du jeune Norv\u00e9gien ! ( what a head the young Norwegian has ! ) .

  "/wiki/Rugby_union": "Rugby union , widely known simply as rugby , is a contact team sport that originated in England in the first half of the 19th century . One of the two codes of rugby football , it is based on running with the ball in hand . In its most common form , a game is played between two teams of 15 players using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field with H-shaped goalposts at either end . Rugby union is a popular sport around the world , played by male and female players of all ages . In 2014 , there were more than 6 million people playing worldwide , of whom 2.36 million were registered players . World Rugby , previously called the International Rugby Football Board ( IRFB ) and the International Rugby Board ( IRB ) , has been the governing body for rugby union since 1886 , and currently has 101 countries as full members and 18 associate members . In 1845 , the first football laws were written by pupils at Rugby School ; other significant events in the early development of rugby include the decision by Blackheath F.C . to leave the Football Association in 1863 and , in 1895 , the acrimonious split between the then amateur rugby union and the professional rugby league . Historically rugby union was an amateur sport , but in 1995 formal restrictions on payments to players were removed , making the game openly professional at the highest level for the first time . Rugby union spread from the Home Nations of Great Britain and Ireland and was embraced by many of the countries associated with the British Empire . Early exponents of the sport included Australia , New Zealand , South Africa and France . Countries that have adopted rugby union as their de facto national sport include Fiji , Georgia , Madagascar , New Zealand , Samoa , and Tonga .",
