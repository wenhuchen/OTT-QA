  "/wiki/Le_Corbeau": "Le Corbeau ( lit . The Crow ) is a 1943 French film directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot and starring Pierre Fresnay , Micheline Francey and Pierre Larquey . The film is about a French town where a number of citizens receive anonymous letters containing libelous information , particularly targeting a doctor accused of being an abortionist . The mystery surrounding the letters eventually escalates into violence . The film caused serious problems for its director after World War II as it had been produced by Continental Films , a German production company established near the beginning of the Occupation of France , and because the film had been perceived by the underground and the Communist press as vilifying the French people . Because of this , Clouzot was initially banned for life from directing in France , but after protests only until 1947 . The film was suppressed until 1969 . It was remade as The 13th Letter ( 1951 ) by Otto Preminger .",
  "/wiki/The_Raven": "The Raven is a narrative poem by American writer Edgar Allan Poe . First published in January 1845 , the poem is often noted for its musicality , stylized language , and supernatural atmosphere . It tells of a talking raven 's mysterious visit to a distraught lover , tracing the man 's slow fall into madness . The lover , often identified as a student , is lamenting the loss of his love , Lenore . Sitting on a bust of Pallas , the raven seems to further distress the protagonist with its constant repetition of the word Nevermore . The poem makes use of folk , mythological , religious , and classical references . Poe claimed to have written the poem logically and methodically , with the intention to create a poem that would appeal to both critical and popular tastes , as he explained in his 1846 follow-up essay , The Philosophy of Composition . The poem was inspired in part by a talking raven in the novel Barnaby Rudge : A Tale of the Riots of Eighty by Charles Dickens . Poe borrows the complex rhythm and meter of Elizabeth Barrett 's poem Lady Geraldine 's Courtship , and makes use of internal rhyme as well as alliteration throughout . The Raven was first attributed to Poe in print in the New York Evening Mirror on January 29 , 1845 . Its publication made Poe popular in his lifetime , although it did not bring him much financial success . The poem was soon reprinted , parodied , and illustrated .",

He was the son of a leading French actor , Lucien Guitry , and followed his father into the theatrical profession . He became known for his stage performances , often in boulevardier roles , in the many plays he wrote , of which there were more than 120 . He was married five times , always to rising actresses whose careers he furthered . Probably his best-known wife was Yvonne Printemps to whom he was married between 1919 and 1932 . Guitry 's plays range from historical dramas to contemporary light comedies . Some have musical scores , by composers including Andr\u00e9 Messager and Reynaldo Hahn . When silent films became popular Guitry avoided them , finding the lack of spoken dialogue fatal to dramatic impact . From the 1930s to the end of his life he enthusiastically embraced the cinema , making as many as five films in a single year . The later years of Guitry 's career were overshadowed by accusations of collaborating with the occupying Germans after the capitulation of France in the Second World War . The charges were dismissed , but Guitry , a strongly patriotic man , was disillusioned by the vilification by some of his compatriots . By the time of his death his popular esteem had been restored to the extent that 12,000 people filed past his coffin before his burial in Paris ."
