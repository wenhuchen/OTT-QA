  "/wiki/Fire": "Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the exothermic chemical process of combustion , releasing heat , light , and various reaction products . Slower oxidative processes like rusting or digestion are not included by this definition . Fire is hot because the conversion of the weak double bond in molecular oxygen , O2 , to the stronger bonds in the combustion products carbon dioxide and water releases energy ( 418 kJ per 32 g of O2 ) ; the bond energies of the fuel play only a minor role here . At a certain point in the combustion reaction , called the ignition point , flames are produced . The flame is the visible portion of the fire . Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide , water vapor , oxygen and nitrogen . If hot enough , the gases may become ionized to produce plasma . Depending on the substances alight , and any impurities outside , the color of the flame and the fire 's intensity will be different . Fire in its most common form can result in conflagration , which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning . Fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe . The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems . The negative effects of fire include hazard to life and property , atmospheric pollution , and water contamination .",
  "/wiki/Great_Chicago_Fire": "The Great Chicago Fire was a conflagration that burned in the American city of Chicago during October 8-10 , 1871 . The fire killed approximately 300 people , destroyed roughly 3.3 square miles ( 9 km2 ) of the city , and left more than 100,000 residents homeless . The fire began in a neighborhood southwest of the city center . A long period of hot , dry , windy conditions , and the wooden construction prevalent in the city led to a conflagration . The fire leapt the south branch of the Chicago River and destroyed much of central Chicago and then leapt the main branch of the river , consuming the near north side . Help flowed to the city from near and far after the fire . The city government improved building codes to stop the rapid spread of future fires and rebuilt rapidly to those higher standards . A donation from the United Kingdom spurred the establishment of the Chicago Public Library , a free public library system , a contrast to the private , fee-for-membership libraries common before the fire .",

After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 , which destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless , the city made a concerted effort to rebuild . The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades , and by 1900 , less than 30 years after the great fire , Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world . Chicago made noted contributions to urban planning and zoning standards , including new construction styles ( including the Chicago School of architecture ) , the development of the City Beautiful Movement , and the steel-framed skyscraper . Chicago is an international hub for finance , culture , commerce , industry , education , technology , telecommunications , and transportation . It is the site of the creation of the first standardized futures contracts , issued by the Chicago Board of Trade , which today is the largest and most diverse derivatives market in the world , generating 20% of all volume in commodities and financial futures alone . Depending on the particular year , the city 's O'Hare International Airport is routinely ranked as the world 's fifth or sixth busiest airport according to tracked data by the Airports Council International .",

  "/wiki/Tornado": "A tornado is a rapidly rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the Earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or , in rare cases , the base of a cumulus cloud . The windstorm is often referred to as a twister , whirlwind or cyclone , although the word cyclone is used in meteorology to name a weather system with a low-pressure area in the center around which , from an observer looking down toward the surface of the earth , winds blow counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern . Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes , and they are often visible in the form of a condensation funnel originating from the base of a cumulonimbus cloud , with a cloud of rotating debris and dust beneath it . Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than 110 miles per hour ( 180 km/h ) , are about 250 feet ( 80 m ) across , and travel a few miles ( several kilometers ) before dissipating . The most extreme tornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than 300 miles per hour ( 480 km/h ) , are more than two miles ( 3 km ) in diameter , and stay on the ground for dozens of miles ( more than 100 km ) . Various types of tornadoes include the multiple vortex tornado , landspout , and waterspout . Waterspouts are characterized by a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current , connecting to a large cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud . They are generally classified as non-supercellular tornadoes that develop over bodies of water , but there is disagreement over whether to classify them as true tornadoes . These spiraling columns of air frequently develop in tropical areas close to the equator and are less common at high latitudes . Other tornado-like phenomena that exist in nature include the gustnado , dust devil , fire whirl , and steam devil . Tornadoes occur most frequently in North America ( particularly in central and southeastern regions of the United States colloquially known as tornado alley ) , Southern Africa , northwestern and southeast Europe , western and southeastern Australia , New Zealand , Bangladesh and adjacent eastern India , and southeastern South America . Tornadoes can be detected before or as they occur through the use of Pulse-Doppler radar by recognizing patterns in velocity and reflectivity data , such as hook echoes or debris balls , as well as through the efforts of storm spotters .",

  "/wiki/Smog": "Smog is a type of intense air pollution . The word smog was coined in the early 20th century , and is a contraction ( portmanteau ) of the words smoke and fog to refer to smoky fog ; its opacity , and odor . The word was then intended to refer to what was sometimes known as pea soup fog , a familiar and serious problem in London from the 19th century to the mid-20th century . This kind of visible air pollution is composed of nitrogen oxides , sulphur oxides , ozone , smoke and other particulates . Man-made smog is derived from coal combustion emissions , vehicular emissions , industrial emissions , forest and agricultural fires and photochemical reactions of these emissions . Smog is often categorized as being either summer smog or winter smog . Summer smog is primarily associated with the photochemical formation of ozone . During the summer season when the temperatures are warmer and there is more sunlight present , photochemical smog is the dominant type of smog formation . During the winter months when the temperatures are colder , and atmospheric inversions are common , there is an increase in coal and other fossil fuel usage to heat homes and buildings . These combustion emissions , together with the lack of pollutant dispersion under inversions , characterize winter smog formation . While photochemical smog is the main smog formation mechanism during summer months , winter smog episodes are still common . Smog formation in general relies on both primary and secondary pollutants .",

New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state by area but the 11th-most populous , with 9 million residents as of 2017 and an area of 8,722.58 square miles , making it the most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states , with its biggest city being Newark . New Jersey lies completely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia . New Jersey was the second-wealthiest U.S. state by median household income as of 2017 . New Jersey was inhabited by Native Americans for more than 2,800 years , with historical tribes such as the Lenape along the coast . In the early 17th century , the Dutch and the Swedes founded the first European settlements in the state . The English later seized control of the region , naming it the Province of New Jersey after the largest of the Channel Islands , Jersey , and granting it as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley , 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton . New Jersey was the site of several important battles during the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century . In the 19th century , factories in the cities Camden , Paterson , Newark , Trenton , Jersey City , and Elizabeth ( known as the Big Six ) , helped drive the Industrial Revolution . New Jersey 's geographic location at the center of the Northeast megalopolis , between Boston and New York City to the northeast , and Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Washington , D.C. , to the southwest , fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century . At the turn of the 21st century , this suburbanization began reverting with the consolidation of New Jersey 's culturally diverse populace toward more urban settings within the state , with towns home to commuter rail stations outpacing the population growth of more automobile-oriented suburbs since 2008 .",

As of the 2010 Census , it has the highest per-capita income , Human Development Index ( 0.962 ) , and median household income in the United States . It is bordered by Rhode Island to the east , Massachusetts to the north , New York to the west , and Long Island Sound to the south . Its capital is Hartford and its most populous city is Bridgeport . It is part of New England , although portions of it are often grouped with New York and New Jersey as the tri-state area . The state is named for the Connecticut River which approximately bisects the state . The word Connecticut is derived from various anglicized spellings of an Algonquian word for long tidal river . Connecticut 's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small , short-lived settlement called Fort Hoop in Hartford at the confluence of the Park and Connecticut Rivers . Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony New Netherland , which included much of the land between the Connecticut and Delaware Rivers , although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English . Thomas Hooker led a band of followers from the Massachusetts Bay Colony and founded the Connecticut Colony ; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the Saybrook Colony and the New Haven Colony . The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of Fundamental Orders , considered the first constitutions in America . In 1662 , the three colonies were merged under a royal charter , making Connecticut a crown colony .",
  "/wiki/Terrorism": "Terrorism is , in the broadest sense , the use of intentional violence for political or religious purposes . It is used in this regard primarily to refer to violence during peacetime or in the context of war against non-combatants ( mostly civilians and neutral military personnel ) . The terms terrorist and terrorism originated during the French Revolution of the late 18th century but gained mainstream popularity in the 1970s during the conflicts of Northern Ireland , the Basque Country and Palestine . The increased use of suicide attacks from the 1980s onwards was typified by the September 11 attacks in New York City and Washington , D.C. in 2001 . There are different definitions of terrorism . Terrorism is a charged term . It is often used with the connotation of something that is morally wrong . Governments and non-state groups use the term to abuse or denounce opposing groups . Varied political organizations have been accused of using terrorism to achieve their objectives . These include right-wing and left-wing political organizations , nationalist groups , religious groups , revolutionaries and ruling governments . Legislation declaring terrorism a crime has been adopted in many states . When terrorism is perpetrated by nation states , it is not considered terrorism by the state conducting it , making legality a largely grey-area issue .",
  "/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing": "The Oklahoma City bombing was a domestic terrorist truck bombing on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City , Oklahoma , United States on April 19 , 1995 . Perpetrated by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols , the bombing happened at 9:02 am and killed at least 168 people , injured more than 680 others , and destroyed one-third of the building . The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings within a 16-block radius , shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings , and destroyed or burned 86 cars , causing an estimated $ 652 million worth of damage . Local , state , federal , and worldwide agencies engaged in extensive rescue efforts in the wake of the bombing , and substantial donations were received from across the country . The Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) activated 11 of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces , consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations . Until the September 11 , 2001 attacks , the Oklahoma City bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack in the history of the United States , and remains the deadliest incident of domestic terrorism in the country 's history . Within 90 minutes of the explosion , McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma Highway Patrolman Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession . Forensic evidence quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack ; Nichols was arrested , and within days , both were charged . Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices . McVeigh , a veteran of the Gulf War and a U.S. militia movement sympathizer , had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives parked in front of the building . His co-conspirator , Nichols , had assisted with the bomb 's preparation . Motivated by his dislike for the U.S. federal government and unhappy about its handling of the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993 , McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco , Texas .",

  "/wiki/Tsunami": "A tsunami ( / ( t ) su\u02d0\u02c8n\u0251\u02d0mi , ( t ) s\u028a\u02c8-/ ( t ) soo-NAH-mee , ( t ) suu- ; from Japanese : \u6d25\u6ce2 , lit . 'harbour wave ' , pronounced [ ts\u026fnami ] ) is a series of waves in a water body caused by the displacement of a large volume of water , generally in an ocean or a large lake . Earthquakes , volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions ( including detonations , landslides , glacier calvings , meteorite impacts and other disturbances ) above or below water all have the potential to generate a tsunami . Unlike normal ocean waves , which are generated by wind , or tides , which are generated by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun , a tsunami is generated by the displacement of water . Tsunami waves do not resemble normal undersea currents or sea waves because their wavelength is far longer . Rather than appearing as a breaking wave , a tsunami may instead initially resemble a rapidly rising tide . For this reason , it is often referred to as a tidal wave , although this usage is not favoured by the scientific community because it might give the false impression of a causal relationship between tides and tsunamis . Tsunamis generally consist of a series of waves , with periods ranging from minutes to hours , arriving in a so-called wave train . Wave heights of tens of metres can be generated by large events . Although the impact of tsunamis is limited to coastal areas , their destructive power can be enormous , and they can affect entire ocean basins . The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was among the deadliest natural disasters in human history , with at least 230,000 people killed or missing in 14 countries bordering the Indian Ocean . The Ancient Greek historian Thucydides suggested in his 5th century BC History of the Peloponnesian War that tsunamis were related to submarine earthquakes , but the understanding of tsunamis remained slim until the 20th century and much remains unknown .",
  "/wiki/Earthquake": "An earthquake ( also known as a quake , tremor or temblor ) is the shaking of the surface of the Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the Earth 's lithosphere that creates seismic waves . Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they can not be felt to those violent enough to propel objects ( and people ) into the air , and wreak destruction across entire cities . The seismicity , or seismic activity , of an area is the frequency , type , and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time . The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling . At the Earth 's surface , earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the ground . When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore , the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami . Earthquakes can also trigger landslides and occasionally , volcanic activity . In its most general sense , the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event - whether natural or caused by humans - that generates seismic waves . Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological faults but also by other events such as volcanic activity , landslides , mine blasts , and nuclear tests . An earthquake 's point of initial rupture is called its focus or hypocenter . The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter .",

The seafloor along the fault was elevated , triggering a Pacific-wide tsunami with multiple destructive waves at heights ranging from 45-130 ft . The tsunami obliterated the Scotch Cap Lighthouse on Unimak Island , Alaska among others , and killed all five lighthouse keepers . Despite the destruction to the Aleutian Island Unimak , the tsunami had almost an imperceptible effect on the Alaskan mainland . Waves reportedly traveled across the ocean at 500 miles an hour and measured 55 feet high , crest to trough , according to the USGS . The wave reached Kauai , Hawaii 4.5 hours after the quake , and Hilo , Hawaii 4.9 hours later . In Hilo , the death toll was high : 173 were killed , 163 injured , 488 buildings were demolished and 936 more were damaged . Witnesses told of waves inundating streets , homes , and storefronts . Many victims were swept out to sea by receding water . The tsunami caused much damage in Maui as well .",

Alaska was occupied by various indigenous peoples for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans . The state is considered the entry point for the settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge . The Russians were the first non-native people to settle the area beginning in the 18th century , eventually establishing the colony of Alaska that spanned most of the current state . The expense and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted its sale to the U.S. in 1867 for $ 7.2 million , or approximately two cents per acre ( $ 4.74/km2 ) .

It moderates Earth 's climate and has important roles in the water cycle , carbon cycle , and nitrogen cycle . It has been travelled and explored since ancient times , while the scientific study of the sea - oceanography - dates broadly from the voyages of Captain James Cook to explore the Pacific Ocean between 1768 and 1779 . The word sea is also used to denote smaller , partly landlocked sections of the ocean and certain large , entirely landlocked , saltwater lakes , such as the Caspian Sea and the Dead Sea . The most abundant solid dissolved in seawater is sodium chloride . The water also contains salts of magnesium , calcium , and potassium , amongst many other elements , some in minute concentrations . Salinity varies widely , being lower near the surface and the mouths of large rivers and higher in the depths of the ocean ; however , the relative proportions of dissolved salts varies little across the oceans . Winds blowing over the surface of the sea produce waves , which break when they enter shallow water . Winds also create surface currents through friction , setting up slow but stable circulations of water throughout the oceans . The directions of the circulation are governed by factors including the shapes of the continents and Earth 's rotation ( the Coriolis effect ) . Deep-sea currents , known as the global conveyor belt , carry cold water from near the poles to every ocean . Tides , the generally twice-daily rise and fall of sea levels , are caused by Earth 's rotation and the gravitational effects of the orbiting Moon and , to a lesser extent , of the Sun .",
  "/wiki/West_Loch_disaster": "The West Loch Disaster was a maritime accident during World War II at Pearl Harbor U.S . Naval Base in Hawaii . The incident , which occurred just after 3:00 p.m. on Sunday , May 21 , 1944 , began following an explosion in a staging area for Landing Ships , Tank ( LSTs ) and other amphibious assault ships in West Loch . A fire quickly spread among the ships being prepared for Operation Forager , the invasion of the Japanese-held Mariana Islands . Over the next 24 hours , six LSTs sank , 163 naval personnel died , and 396 were injured . A subsequent Naval Board of Inquiry never determined the exact cause of the disaster but concluded that the initial explosion was caused when a mortar round aboard LST-353 detonated during an unloading operation because it was either dropped or went off when gasoline vapors ignited . The incident - together with the Port Chicago disaster two months later - led to major changes in weapons-handling practices within the United States Navy . The LST wreckage was quickly cleared in a salvage operation and dumped at sea 3 mi ( 2.6 nmi ; 4.8 km ) south of Hawaii . Only the hull of the partially beached LST-480 was left in West Loch . A press blackout was enforced and naval personnel were ordered not to talk about the incident . The disaster was classified until 1960 and is therefore not well known .

  "/wiki/Tropical_cyclone": "A tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by a low-pressure center , a closed low-level atmospheric circulation , strong winds , and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain or squalls . Depending on its location and strength , a tropical cyclone is referred to by different names , including hurricane ( /\u02c8h\u028cr\u026ak\u0259n , -ke\u026an/ ) , typhoon ( /ta\u026a\u02c8fu\u02d0n/ ) , tropical storm , cyclonic storm , tropical depression , and simply cyclone . A hurricane is a tropical cyclone that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean , and a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean ; in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean , comparable storms are referred to simply as tropical cyclones or severe cyclonic storms . Tropical refers to the geographical origin of these systems , which form almost exclusively over tropical seas . Cyclone refers to their winds moving in a circle , whirling round their central clear eye , with their winds blowing counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere . The opposite direction of circulation is due to the Coriolis effect . Tropical cyclones typically form over large bodies of relatively warm water . They derive their energy through the evaporation of water from the ocean surface , which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when moist air rises and cools to saturation . This energy source differs from that of mid-latitude cyclonic storms , such as nor'easters and European windstorms , which are fueled primarily by horizontal temperature contrasts . Tropical cyclones are typically between 100 and 2,000 km ( 62 and 1,243 mi ) in diameter . The strong rotating winds of a tropical cyclone are a result of the conservation of angular momentum imparted by the Earth 's rotation as air flows inwards toward the axis of rotation . As a result , they rarely form within 5\u00b0 of the equator .",
  "/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy": "Hurricane Sandy ( unofficially referred to as Superstorm Sandy ) was the deadliest and most destructive , as well as the strongest , hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season . Inflicting nearly $ 70 billion ( 2012 USD ) in damage , it was the second-costliest hurricane on record in the United States until surpassed by Hurricanes Harvey and Maria in 2017 . The eighteenth named storm , tenth hurricane , and second major hurricane of the year , Sandy was a Category 3 storm at its peak intensity when it made landfall in Cuba . While it was a Category 2 hurricane off the coast of the Northeastern United States , the storm became the largest Atlantic hurricane on record ( as measured by diameter , with tropical-storm-force winds spanning 900 miles ( 1,400 km ) ) . At least 233 people were killed along the path of the storm in eight countries . Sandy developed from a tropical wave in the western Caribbean Sea on October 22 , quickly strengthened , and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Sandy six hours later . Sandy moved slowly northward toward the Greater Antilles and gradually intensified . On October 24 , Sandy became a hurricane , made landfall near Kingston , Jamaica , re-emerged a few hours later into the Caribbean Sea and strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane . On October 25 , Sandy hit Cuba as a Category 3 hurricane , then weakened to a Category 1 hurricane . Early on October 26 , Sandy moved through the Bahamas . On October 27 , Sandy briefly weakened to a tropical storm and then restrengthened to a Category 1 hurricane . Early on October 29 , Sandy curved west-northwest ( the left turn or left hook ) and then moved ashore near Brigantine , New Jersey , just to the northeast of Atlantic City , as a post-tropical cyclone with hurricane-force winds .",

The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Donna by the following day . Donna moved west-northwestward at roughly 20 mph ( 32 km/h ) and by September 1 , it reached hurricane status . Over the next three days , Donna deepened significantly and reached maximum sustained winds of 130 mph ( 210 km/h ) on September 4 . Thereafter , it maintained intensity as it struck the Lesser Antilles later that day . On Sint Maarten , the storm left a quarter of the island 's population homeless and killed seven people . An additional five deaths were reported in Anguilla , and there were seven other fatalities throughout the Virgin Islands . In Puerto Rico , severe flash flooding led to 107 fatalities , 85 of them in Humacao alone . Donna further intensified to a Category 4 hurricane early on September 6 , and attained peak winds of 145 mph ( 230 km/h ) twenty-four hours later . The storm then weakened over the next few days , making multiple landfalls in The Bahamas as a Category 3 hurricane .

  "/wiki/Aircraft": "An aircraft is a vehicle that is able to fly by gaining support from the air . It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil , or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines . Common examples of aircraft include airplanes , helicopters , airships ( including blimps ) , gliders , paramotors and hot air balloons . The human activity that surrounds aircraft is called aviation . The science of aviation , including designing and building aircraft , is called aeronautics . Crewed aircraft are flown by an onboard pilot , but unmanned aerial vehicles may be remotely controlled or self-controlled by onboard computers . Aircraft may be classified by different criteria , such as lift type , aircraft propulsion , usage and others .",

Serving as a major port , New Orleans is considered an economic and commercial hub for the broader Gulf Coast region of the United States . New Orleans is world-renowned for its distinct music , Creole cuisine , unique dialect , and its annual celebrations and festivals , most notably Mardi Gras . The historic heart of the city is the French Quarter , known for its French and Spanish Creole architecture and vibrant nightlife along Bourbon Street . The city has been described as the most unique in the United States , owing in large part to its cross-cultural and multilingual heritage . Founded in 1718 by French colonists , New Orleans was once the territorial capital of French Louisiana before being traded to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 . New Orleans in 1840 was the third-most populous city in the United States , and it was the largest city in the American South from the Antebellum era until after World War II . The city has historically been very vulnerable to flooding , due to such factors as high rainfall , low lying elevation , poor natural drainage and location next to multiple bodies of water . State and federal authorities have installed a complex system of levees and drainage pumps in an effort to protect the city . New Orleans was severely affected by Hurricane Katrina on August 29 , 2005 , which resulted in flooding more than 80% of the city , thousands of deaths , and so much displacement because of damaged communities and lost housing as to cause a population decline of over 50% . Since Katrina , major redevelopment efforts have led to a rebound in the city 's population ."
