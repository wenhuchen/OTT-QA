In 2005 Zumbo had a population of 33,000 , and it lies in the Zumbo District of Tete Province . Zumbo was established as a trading post in the last part of the 17th century by the Portuguese .

It dominated the area , and traders from Zumbo settled in Feira . Zumbo declined after Northern and Southern Rhodesia ( later Zambia and Zimbabwe ) became part of the British Empire , cutting off its trade with those territories . In the 1970s the Cahora Bassa Dam and lake were created downstream . Zumbo is at the farthest upstream extent of the lake .
