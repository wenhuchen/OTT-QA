  "/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)": "Victoria ( abbreviated as Vic ) is a state in south-eastern Australia . Victoria is Australia 's smallest mainland state and its second-most populous state ( after New South Wales ) , making it the most densely populated state . Most of its population lives concentrated in the area surrounding Port Phillip Bay , which includes the metropolitan area of its state capital and largest city , Melbourne , Australia 's second-largest city . Victoria is bordered by Bass Strait and Tasmania to the south , [ note 1 ] New South Wales to the north , the Tasman Sea ( a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean ) to the east , and South Australia to the west . The area that is now known as Victoria is the home of many Aboriginal people groups , including the Boon wurrung , the Bratauolung , the Djadjawurrung , the Gunai/Kurnai , the Gunditjmara , the Taungurong , the Wathaurong , the Wurundjeri , and the Yorta Yorta . There were more than 30 Aboriginal languages spoken in the area prior to the European settlement of Australia . The Kulin nation is an alliance of five Aboriginal nations which makes up much of the central part of the state . With Great Britain having claimed the half of the Australian continent that is east of the 135th meridian east in 1788 , Victoria formed part of the wider colony of New South Wales . The first European settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay , and much of what is now Victoria was included in 1836 in the Port Phillip District , an administrative division of New South Wales . Named in honour of Queen Victoria , who signed the division 's separation from New South Wales , the colony was officially established in 1851 and achieved self government in 1855 . The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony , and by the time of the Federation of Australia in 1901 , Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in Australasia . Melbourne served as federal capital of Australia until the construction of Canberra in 1927 , with the Federal Parliament meeting in Melbourne 's Parliament House and all principal offices of the federal government being based in Melbourne .",
  "/wiki/West_Australian_Football_League": "The West Australian Football League ( WAFL ) is an Australian rules football league based in Perth , Western Australia . The WAFL is the third-most popular league in the nation , behind the nationwide Australian Football League ( AFL ) and South Australian National Football League ( SANFL ) . The league currently consists of ten teams , which play each other in a 20-round season usually lasting from March to September , with the top five teams playing off in a finals series , culminating in a Grand Final . The league also runs reserves , colts ( under-19 ) and womens competitions . The WAFL was founded in 1885 as the West Australian Football Association ( WAFA ) , and has undergone a variety of name changes since then , re-adopting its current name in 2001 . For most of its existence , the league was considered one of the traditional big three Australian rules football leagues , along with the Victorian Football League ( VFL ) and South Australian National Football League ( SANFL ) . However , since the introduction of two Western Australia-based clubs into the VFL ( later renamed the Australian Football League ) - the West Coast Eagles in 1987 and the Fremantle Football Club in 1995 - the popularity and standard of the league has decreased to the point where it is considered a feeder competition to the AFL . Although payments are made to players , it is generally considered to be a semi-professional competition . A salary cap of A $ 200,000 per club is in place . The league is currently affiliated with the two Western Australia-based AFL clubs . Players who are not selected to play with their respective AFL clubs instead play for allocated clubs in the WAFL . The competition is governed by the West Australian Football Commission , and based at Subiaco Oval .",
  "/wiki/Western_Australia": "Western Australia [ a ] ( abbreviated as WA ) is a state occupying the entire western third of Australia . It is bounded by the Indian Ocean to the north and west , and the Southern Ocean to the south , [ b ] the Northern Territory to the north-east , and South Australia to the south-east . Western Australia is Australia 's largest state , with a total land area of 2,529,875 square kilometres ( 976,790 sq mi ) , and the second-largest country subdivision in the world , surpassed only by Russia 's Sakha Republic . The state has about 2.6 million inhabitants - around 11 percent of the national total - of whom the vast majority ( 92 per cent ) live in the south-west corner , 79 per cent of the population living in the Perth area , leaving the remainder of the state sparsely populated . The first European visitor to Western Australia was the Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog , who visited the Western Australian coast in 1616 . The first European settlement of Western Australia occurred following the landing by Major Edmund Lockyer on 26 December 1826 of an expedition on behalf of the New South Wales colonial government . He established a convict-supported military garrison at King George III Sound , at present-day Albany , and on 21 January 1827 formally took possession of the western third of the continent for the British Crown . This was followed by the establishment of the Swan River Colony in 1829 , including the site of the present-day capital , Perth . York was the first inland settlement in Western Australia . Situated 97 kilometres ( 60 miles ) east of Perth , it was settled on 16 September 1831 . Western Australia achieved responsible government in 1890 and federated with the other British colonies in Australia in 1901 . Today , its economy mainly relies on mining , oil and gas , services and construction .",
  "/wiki/South_Australian_National_Football_League": "The South Australian National Football League , or SANFL ( /\u02c8s\u00e6nf\u0259l/ or S-A-N-F-L ) , is an Australian rules football league based in the Australian state of South Australia . It is also the governing body for the sport of Australian rules football in South Australia . Originally formed as the South Australian Football Association on 30 April 1877 , the SANFL is the oldest surviving football league of any code in Australia and one of the oldest football competitions in the world , forming just a few years after the United Hospitals Challenge Cup ( 1874 ) , the oldest rugby football competition , and over a decade before The Football League , although later than the FA Cup ( soccer ) . Consisting of a single division competition , since 2014 the season has been an 18-round home-and-away ( regular ) season from April to September . The top five teams play-off in a final series culminating in the grand final for the Thomas Seymour Hill Premiership Trophy . The grand final had traditionally been held at Football Park in October , generally the week after the AFL Grand Final , though this was altered ahead of the 2014 season resulting in Adelaide Oval hosting the grand final in the penultimate weekend of September . The league owned the sub-licences for South Australia 's two AFL clubs - Adelaide Football Club and Port Adelaide Football Club until March 2014 , when South Australian Football Commission reached an agreement with the Adelaide and Port Adelaide football clubs - endorsed by the AFL - which will see the two AFL licences transferred to the clubs in return for payments totalling more than $ 18 million . The league is also responsible for the management of all levels of football in the state . This includes junior football , country football , amateur football and specific programs rolled out across schools , indigenous communities ( including the APY Lands in the state 's north ) and newly arrived migrant communities .

  "/wiki/Tasmania": "Tasmania ( /t\u00e6z\u02c8me\u026ani\u0259/ ; abbreviated as TAS , nicknamed Tassie ) is an island state of Australia . It is located 240 km ( 150 mi ) to the south of the Australian mainland , separated by Bass Strait . The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania , the 26th-largest island in the world , and the surrounding 334 islands . The state has a population of around 533,308 as of March 2019 [ update ] . Just over forty percent of the population resides in the Greater Hobart precinct , which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city , Hobart . Tasmania 's area is 68,401 km2 ( 26,410 sq mi ) , of which the main island covers 64,519 km2 ( 24,911 sq mi ) . It is promoted as a natural state , and protected areas of Tasmania cover about 42% of its land area , which includes national parks and World Heritage Sites . Tasmania was the founding place of the first environmental political party in the world . The island is believed to have been occupied by indigenous peoples for 30,000 years before British colonisation . It is thought Aboriginal Tasmanians were separated from the mainland Aboriginal groups about 10,000 years ago when the sea rose to form Bass Strait . The Aboriginal population is estimated to have been between 3,000 and 7,000 at the time of colonisation , but was almost wiped out within 30 years by a combination of violent guerrilla conflict with settlers known as the Black War , intertribal conflict , and from the late 1820s , the spread of infectious diseases to which they had no immunity . The conflict , which peaked between 1825 and 1831 , and led to more than three years of martial law , cost the lives of almost 1,100 Aboriginals and settlers .",
  "/wiki/Victorian_Football_League": "The Victorian Football League ( VFL ) is the major state-level Australian rules football league in Victoria . The league evolved from the former Victorian Football Association ( VFA ) , and has been known by its current name since 1996 . For historical purposes , the present VFL is sometimes referred to as the VFA/VFL , to distinguish it from the present day Australian Football League , which was known until 1990 as the Victorian Football League and is sometimes referred to as the VFL/AFL . The VFA was formed in 1877 and is the second-oldest Australian rules football league , replacing the loose affiliation of clubs that had been the hallmark of the early years of the game . Initially serving a primarily administrative function , the VFA premiership served as the top level of club competition in Victoria until 1896 . The VFA became the secondary level of club competition from 1897 after its eight strongest clubs seceded to form the VFL . From 1897 until 1995 , the VFA remained independent from the VFL as Victoria 's secondary senior club competition . Although always much less popular than the VFL/AFL , the VFA enjoyed peaks of popularity in the 1940s with a faster-paced rival code of rules , and in the 1970s bolstered by playing on Sundays at a time when the VFL was played solely on Saturdays . Since 1995 , the league has been administered by AFL Victoria ( and its predecessors ) , and serves as one of the second-tier regional Australian semi-professional competitions which sits underneath the fully professional Australian Football League . From the 2018 season it will comprise 15 teams from throughout Victoria , nine of which have a continuous VFA heritage . Since 2000 , the VFL has served partially as a reserves competition for the AFL , with some Victorian-based clubs fielding their reserves teams in the VFL and others affiliated such that their reserves player can play in VFL teams . AFL Victoria also operates a women 's football competition under the Victorian Football League brand , known as the VFL Women 's , which was established in 2016 .",
