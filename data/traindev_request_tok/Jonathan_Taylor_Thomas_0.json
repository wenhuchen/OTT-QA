It is the 32nd Disney animated feature film , and the fifth animated film produced during a period known as the Disney Renaissance . The Lion King was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff , produced by Don Hahn , and has a screenplay credited to Irene Mecchi , Jonathan Roberts , and Linda Woolverton .

The film features an ensemble voice cast that includes Matthew Broderick , James Earl Jones , Jeremy Irons , Jonathan Taylor Thomas , Moira Kelly , Nathan Lane , Ernie Sabella , Rowan Atkinson , Robert Guillaume , Madge Sinclair , Whoopi Goldberg , Cheech Marin , and Jim Cummings . The story takes place in a kingdom of lions in Africa and was influenced by the Biblical stories of Joseph and Moses , and William Shakespeare 's Hamlet . The Lion King tells the story of Simba ( Swahili for lion ) , a young lion who is to succeed his father , Mufasa , as King of the Pride Lands ; however , after Simba 's paternal uncle Scar murders Mufasa , Simba is manipulated into thinking he was responsible and flees into exile . After growing up in the company of the carefree outcasts Timon and Pumbaa , Simba receives valuable perspective from his childhood friend , Nala , and his shaman , Rafiki , before returning to challenge Scar to end his tyranny and take his place in the Circle of Life as the rightful King . Development of The Lion King began in 1988 during a meeting between Jeffrey Katzenberg , Roy E. Disney , and Peter Schneider while promoting Oliver & Company in Europe . Thomas M. Disch wrote a film treatment , and Woolverton developed the first scripts , while George Scribner was signed on as director , being later joined by Allers . Production began in 1991 concurrently with Pocahontas , which wound up attracting many of Disney 's top animators . Some time after the staff traveled to Hell 's Gate National Park in Kenya to research the film 's setting and animals , Scribner left production , disagreeing with the decision to turn the film into a musical , and was replaced by Minkoff .",
  "/wiki/Simba": "Simba is the main character of Disney 's The Lion King franchise . Introduced in Walt Disney Animation 's 32nd animated feature film The Lion King ( 1994 ) , the character subsequently appears in The Lion King II : Simba 's Pride ( 1998 ) and The Lion King 1\u00bd ( 2004 ) as well as the 2019 remake of the original film , which is the most recent appearance . Simba was created by screenwriters Irene Mecchi , Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton . While Mark Henn served as Simba 's supervising animator as a cub , Ruben A. Aquino animated the character as he appears as an adult . Simba was inspired by the character Bambi from Disney 's Bambi ( 1942 ) , Osamu Tezuka 's anime Kimba the White Lion , as well as the stories of Moses and Joseph from the Bible . Additionally , several similarities have been drawn between Simba and Prince Hamlet from William Shakespeare 's Hamlet . In 1997 , The Lion King was adapted into a Broadway musical , with actors Scott Irby-Ranniar and Jason Raize originating the roles of the cub and adult Simbas , respectively . JD McCrary and Donald Glover voice the cub and adult Simba respectively in the CGI remake .",
  "/wiki/Pom_Poko": "Pom Poko ( Japanese : \u5e73\u6210\u72f8\u5408\u6226\u307d\u3093\u307d\u3053 , Hepburn : Heisei Tanuki Gassen Ponpoko , lit . Heisei-era Raccoon Dog War Ponpoko ) is a 1994 Japanese animated comedy-drama fantasy film directed by Isao Takahata , animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten , Nippon Television Network and Hakuhodo , and distributed by Toho . The phrase Pom Poko in the title refers to the sound of tanuki ( Japanese raccoon dogs , Nyctereutes procyonoides viverrinus ) drumming their own bellies as a form of Tanuki-bayashi . Specifically , the phrase started as a jocular explanation of meditative percussion at Sh\u014dj\u014d-ji taken up in a 1919 poem by Uj\u014d Noguchi , which became a popular nursery rhyme recorded in 1925 . Consistent with Japanese folklore , the tanuki are portrayed as a highly sociable , mischievous species , who are able to use illusion science to transform into almost anything , but too fun-loving and too fond of tasty treats to be a real threat - unlike the kitsune ( foxes ) and other shape-shifters . Visually , the tanuki in this film are depicted in three distinct ways at various times : as realistic animals , as anthropomorphic animals that occasionally wear clothes , and as cartoon-like figures based on the manga of Shigeru Sugiura ( of whom Takahata was a great fan ) . They tend to assume their realistic form when seen by humans , their cartoon-like form when they are doing something outlandish or whimsical , and their anthropomorphic form at all other times . Prominent scrotums are an integral part of tanuki folklore , and they are shown and referred to throughout the film , and also used frequently in their shape-shifting . This remains unchanged in the DVD release , though the English dub ( but not the subtitles ) refers to them as raccoon pouches . Also , in the English dub and subtitles , the animals are never referred to as raccoon dogs , which is the more accurate English name for the tanuki , instead they are incorrectly referred to as just raccoons .",

Pinocchio was carved by a woodcarver named Geppetto in a Tuscan village . He was created as a wooden puppet but he dreams of becoming a real boy .

His story has been adapted into other media , notably the 1940 Disney film Pinocchio . The origin of the name Pinocchio is uncertain ; it may be related to the word pino ( pine ) , as the puppet is made of wood , in the diminutive Tuscan form pinocchio ( hence equivalent to little piney ) - the author used Florentine dialect frequently in the book - and is also similar to Pino , a nickname for Giuseppe ( the Italian form of Joseph ) , of which Geppetto ( the name of Pinocchio 's maker ) is also a nickname ( hence equivalent to little Joey ) .",

As the platform rotates , parts of the platform are raised and lowered , with the resulting centrifugal and gravitational forces on the cars causing them to spin in different directions and at variable speeds . The weight of passengers in these cars ( as well as the weight distribution ) may intensify or dampen the spinning motion of the cars , adding to the unpredictable nature of the motion .",
