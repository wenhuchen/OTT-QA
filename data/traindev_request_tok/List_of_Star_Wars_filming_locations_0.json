China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa .

Location filming for the spaceport took place from 1975-76 in Tunisia , with interiors filmed at Elstree Studios in London .",

  "/wiki/Mosque": "A mosque ( /m\u0252sk/ ; from Arabic : \u0645\u064e\u0633\u0652\u062c\u0650\u062f , romanized : masjid , pronounced [ masd\u0292id ] ; literally glorious ) is a place of worship for Muslims . Any act of worship that follows the Islamic rules of prayer can be said to create a mosque , whether or not it takes place in a special building . Informal and open-air places of worship are called musalla , while mosques used for communal prayer on Fridays are known as j\u0101mi\u02bf . Mosque buildings typically contain an ornamental niche ( mihrab ) set into the wall that indicates the direction of Mecca ( qiblah ) , ablution facilities and minarets from which calls to prayer are issued . The pulpit ( minbar ) , from which the Friday ( jumu'ah ) sermon ( khutba ) is delivered , was in earlier times characteristic of the central city mosque , but has since become common in smaller mosques . Mosques typically have segregated spaces for men and women . This basic pattern of organization has assumed different forms depending on the region , period and denomination . Mosques commonly serve as locations for prayer , Ramadan vigils , funeral services , Sufi ceremonies , marriage and business agreements , alms collection and distribution , as well as homeless shelters . Historically , mosques were also important centers of elementary education and advanced training in religious sciences . In modern times , they have preserved their role as places of religious instruction and debate , but higher learning now generally takes place in specialised institutions . Special importance is accorded to the Great Mosque of Mecca ( centre of the hajj ) , the Prophet 's Mosque in Medina ( burial place of Muhammad ) and Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem ( believed to be the site of Muhammad 's ascent to heaven ) . In the past , many mosques in the Muslim world were built over burial places of Sufi saints and other venerated figures , which has turned them into popular pilgrimage destinations ."
