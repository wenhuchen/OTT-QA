The island is dominated by a maritime climate with narrow temperature differences between seasons . England , Scotland , and Wales are mostly on Great Britain . Politically , Great Britain and Northern Ireland together constitute the United Kingdom . The term Great Britain is often used to include the whole of England , Scotland and Wales including their component adjoining islands ; and is also occasionally but contentiously applied to the UK as a whole in some contexts . A single Kingdom of Great Britain resulted from the union of the Kingdom of England ( which had already comprised the present-day countries of England and Wales ) and the Kingdom of Scotland by the 1707 Acts of Union . In 1801 , Great Britain united with the neighbouring Kingdom of Ireland , forming the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland , which was renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland after the Irish Free State seceded in 1922 .",
