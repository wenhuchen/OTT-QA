  "/wiki/Jacob_Pavlovitch_Adler": "Jacob Pavlovich Adler ( born Yankev P. Adler ; February 12 , 1855 - April 1 , 1926 ) was a Jewish actor and star of Yiddish theater , first in Odessa , and later in London and in New York City 's Yiddish Theater District . Nicknamed nesher hagodol , ( the Great Eagle , Adler being the Yiddish for eagle ) , he achieved his first theatrical success in Odessa , but his career there was rapidly cut short when Yiddish theater was banned in Russia in 1883 . He became a star in Yiddish theater in London , and in 1889 , on his second voyage to the United States , he settled in New York City . Adler soon started a company of his own , ushering in a new , more serious Yiddish theater , most notably by recruiting the Yiddish theater 's first realistic playwright , Jacob Gordin . Adler scored a great triumph in the title role of Gordin 's Der Yiddisher King Lear ( The Jewish King Lear ) , set in 19th-century Russia , which along with his portrayal of Shakespeare 's Shylock would form the core of the persona he defined as the Grand Jew . Nearly all his family went into theater ; probably the most famous was his daughter Stella , who taught method acting to , among others , Marlon Brando .",

He first attracted notice in vaudeville in the US and then as Harry 'Handcuff ' Houdini on a tour of Europe , where he challenged police forces to keep him locked up . Soon he extended his repertoire to include chains , ropes slung from skyscrapers , straitjackets under water , and having to escape from and hold his breath inside a sealed milk can with water in it . In 1904 , thousands watched as he tried to escape from special handcuffs commissioned by London 's Daily Mirror , keeping them in suspense for an hour . Another stunt saw him buried alive and only just able to claw himself to the surface , emerging in a state of near-breakdown . While many suspected that these escapes were faked , Houdini presented himself as the scourge of fake spiritualists . As President of the Society of American Magicians , he was keen to uphold professional standards and expose fraudulent artists . He was also quick to sue anyone who imitated his escape stunts . Houdini made several movies but quit acting when it failed to bring in money . He was also a keen aviator and aimed to become the first man to fly a plane in Australia .",

  "/wiki/Boris_Thomashefsky": "Boris Thomashefsky ( Russian : \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u041f\u0438\u043d\u0445\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0422\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 ; 1866-1939 , sometimes written Thomashevsky , Thomaschevsky , etc . Yiddish \u05d1\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05e1 \u05d8\u05d0\u05de\u05d0\u05e9\u05e2\u05d1\u05e1\u05e7\u05d9 ) was a Ukrainian-born ( later American ) Jewish singer and actor who became one of the biggest stars in Yiddish theatre . Thomashefsky was born in Ositniashka ( \u041e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u043d\u044f\u0436\u043a\u0430 ) a village in the Kiev Governorate in the Russian Empire , and grew up in the neighboring town Kamianka ( today in the Cherkasy Oblast , Ukraine ) . At the age of 11 , he left for Berdichev ( Berdychiv , Ukraine ) , where he trained as a meshoyrer ( choir singer ) in the renowned synagogue choir of cantor Nisan Belzer . In 1881 , he emigrated with his family to the United States , and just a year later , while still a teenager , he was largely responsible for the first performance of Yiddish theatre in New York City , in what was to become the Yiddish Theater District . He has been credited as the pioneer of Borscht Belt entertainment . Although Thomashefsky left Imperial Russia at a time when Yiddish theater was still thriving there ( it was banned in September 1883 ) , he had never actually seen it performed prior to the 1882 performance he brought together in New York . Thomashefsky , who was earning some money by singing on Saturdays at the Henry Street Synagogue on the Lower East Side , was also working as a cigarette maker in a sweatshop , where he first heard songs from the Yiddish theater , sung by some of his fellow workers . He managed to convince a local tavern owner to invest in bringing over some performers . The first performance was Abraham Goldfaden 's Yiddish operetta \u05d3\u05d9 \u05de\u05db\u05e9\u05e4\u05d4 ( The Witch ) . The performance was a bit of a disaster : pious and prosperous uptown German Jews opposed to Yiddish theater did a great deal to sabotage it . Thomashefsky 's performing career was launched partly because part of the sabotage consisted of bribing the soubrette to fake a sore throat : Thomashefsky went on in her place .",
