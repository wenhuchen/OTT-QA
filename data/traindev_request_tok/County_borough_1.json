  "/wiki/London_Borough_of_Croydon": "The London Borough of Croydon ( pronunciation ( help\u00b7info ) ) is a London borough in South London , part of Outer London . It covers an area of 87 km2 ( 33.6 sq mi ) . It is the southernmost borough of London . At its centre is the historic town of Croydon from which the borough takes its name ; while other urban centres include Coulsdon , Purley , South Norwood , and Thornton Heath . Croydon is mentioned in Domesday Book , and from a small market town has expanded into one of the most populous areas on the fringe of London . The borough is now one of London 's leading business , financial and cultural centres , and its influence in entertainment and the arts contribute to its status as a major metropolitan centre . The borough was formed in 1965 from the merger of the County Borough of Croydon with Coulsdon and Purley Urban District , both of which had been within Surrey . The local authority , Croydon London Borough Council , is now part of London Councils , the local government association for Greater London . The economic strength of Croydon dates back mainly to Croydon Airport which was a major factor in the development of Croydon as a business centre . Once London 's main airport for all international flights to and from the capital , it was closed on 30 September 1959 due to the lack of expansion space needed for an airport to serve the growing city . It is now a Grade II listed building and tourist attraction . Croydon Council and its predecessor Croydon Corporation unsuccessfully applied for city status in 1954 , 2000 , 2002 and 2012 .",

During the British Iron Age , Roman Britain , and the early Middle Ages , this was the homeland of the Dumnonii Brittonic Celts . ( The shift from M to V is a typical Celtic consonant shift . ) The Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain resulted in the partial assimilation of Dumnonia into the Kingdom of Wessex during the eighth and ninth centuries .

  "/wiki/County_Borough_of_Plymouth": "Plymouth ( /\u02c8pl\u026am\u0259\u03b8/ ( listen ) ) is a port city situated on the south coast of Devon , England , approximately 37 miles ( 60 km ) south-west of Exeter and 190 miles ( 310 km ) west-south-west of London . Enclosing the city are the mouths of the river Plym and river Tamar , which are naturally incorporated into Plymouth Sound to form a boundary with Cornwall . Plymouth 's early history extends to the Bronze Age when a first settlement emerged at Mount Batten . This settlement continued as a trading post for the Roman Empire , until it was surpassed by the more prosperous village of Sutton founded in the ninth century , now called Plymouth . In 1620 , the Pilgrim Fathers departed Plymouth for the New World and established Plymouth Colony , the second English settlement in what is now the United States of America . During the English Civil War , the town was held by the Parliamentarians and was besieged between 1642 and 1646 . Throughout the Industrial Revolution , Plymouth grew as a commercial shipping port , handling imports and passengers from the Americas , and exporting local minerals ( tin , copper , lime , china clay and arsenic ) . The neighbouring town of Devonport became a strategic Royal Naval shipbuilding and dockyard town . In 1914 three neighbouring independent towns , viz. , the county borough of Plymouth , the county borough of Devonport , and the urban district of East Stonehouse were merged to form a single County Borough . The combined town took the name of Plymouth which , in 1928 , achieved city status . The city 's naval importance later led to its being targeted by the German military and partially destroyed by bombing during World War II , an act known as the Plymouth Blitz . After the war the city centre was completely rebuilt and subsequent expansion led to the incorporation of Plympton and Plymstock along with other outlying suburbs in 1967 .",

  "/wiki/County_Borough_of_Stoke_on_Trent": "The federation of Stoke-on-Trent was the 1910 amalgamation of the six Potteries towns of Burslem , Tunstall , Stoke-upon-Trent , Hanley , Fenton and Longton into the single county borough of Stoke-on-Trent . An anomaly in the history of English local government , this was the first union of its type and the only such event to take place until the 1960s . [ a ] The 1910 federation was the culmination of a process of urban growth and municipal change that started in the early 19th century . Little interaction between the separate settlements occurred until the 18th century when the pottery industry began to expand rapidly . By the early 19th century , initial steps had been made to ensure greater co-operation between the Potteries towns over the issue of law and order . The county plan of 1888 made the first attempts to form the six towns into one county borough , following an act of Parliament that restructured the county system and created the administrative county of Staffordshire . Wishing to remain independent , the Potteries towns discussed uniting to form a separate county , the Staffordshire Potteries . When it became apparent that such a move would fail , the proposal was revised to one of uniting the six towns into one county borough . This plan failed after Hanley Corporation and Stoke Corporation could not agree on the location of the future administrative centre . Instead , only Hanley gained county borough status because the other towns did not meet the criteria for such designation . The first federation attempt was made in 1900 with a resurrection of the county plan . In 1902 , Hanley Council led attempts to form an expanded county borough , but disagreement over the complex financial issues of rates , assets and loans caused Fenton to pull out , quickly followed by Burslem and Stoke , and the proposal was abandoned in 1903 .",

A bombardment of 1,150 shells on 16 December 1914 resulted in the death of 117 people .
