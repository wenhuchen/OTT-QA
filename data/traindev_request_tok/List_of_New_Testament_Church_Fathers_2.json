  "/wiki/Acts_of_Pilate": "The Gospel of Nicodemus , also known as the Acts of Pilate ( Latin : Acta Pilati ; Greek : \u03a0\u03c1\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b9\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 ) , is an apocryphal gospel claimed to have been derived from an original Hebrew work written by Nicodemus , who appears in the Gospel of John as an associate of Jesus . The title Gospel of Nicodemus is medieval in origin . The dates of its accreted sections are uncertain , but according to the 1907 edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia scholars agree in assigning the resulting work to the middle of the fourth century AD . The section about Pilate is an older text found in the Greek Acts of Peter and Paul and , according to the surviving version , is an official document from Pontius Pilate ( or composed from reports at the praetorium at Jerusalem ) reporting events in Judea to Emperor Tiberius , and referring to the crucifixion of Jesus , as well as his miracles .",
  "/wiki/Acts_of_Thomas": "The early 3rd-century text called Acts of Thomas is one of the New Testament apocrypha . References to the work by Epiphanius of Salamis show that it was in circulation in the 4th century . The complete versions that survive are Syriac and Greek . There are many surviving fragments of the text . Scholars detect from the Greek that its original was written in Syriac , which places the Acts of Thomas in Edessa . The surviving Syriac manuscripts , however , have been edited to purge them of the most unorthodox overtly Encratite passages , so that the Greek versions reflect the earlier tradition . Fragments of four other cycles of romances around the figure of the apostle Thomas survive , but this is the only complete one . It should not be confused with the early sayings Gospel of Thomas . Like other apocryphal acts combining popular legend and religious propaganda , the work attempts to entertain and instruct . In addition to narratives of Thomas ' adventures , its poetic and liturgical elements provide important evidence for early Syrian Christian traditions , according to the Anchor Bible Dictionary . Acts of Thomas is a series of episodic Acts ( Latin passio ) that occurred during the evangelistic mission of Judas Thomas ( Judas the Twin ) to India . It ends with his martyrdom : he dies pierced with spears , having earned the ire of the monarch Misdaeus ( Vasudeva I ) because of his conversion of Misdaeus ' wives and a relative , Charisius .",
  "/wiki/Syriac_language": "Syriac ( /\u02c8s\u026ari\u00e6k/ ; \u0720\u072b\u0722\u0710 \u0723\u0718\u072a\u071d\u071d\u0710 [ a ] Le\u0161\u0161\u0101n\u0101 Sury\u0101y\u0101 ) , also known as Syrian/Syriac Aramaic , Syro-Aramaic or Classical Syriac , is a dialect of Middle Aramaic of the Northwest Semitic languages of the Afroasiatic family that is written in the Syriac alphabet , a derivation of the Aramaic alphabet . Having first appeared in the early first century CE in Edessa , classical Syriac became a major literary language throughout the Middle East from the 4th to the 8th centuries , preserved in a large body of Syriac literature . Indeed , Syriac literature comprises roughly 90% of the extant Aramaic literature . Syriac was once spoken across much of the Near East as well as Anatolia and Eastern Arabia . Syriac originated in Mesopotamia and eventually spread west of Iraq in which it became the lingua franca of the region during the Mesopotamian Neo-Assyrian period . The Old Aramaic language was adopted by the Neo-Assyrian Empire ( 911-609 BC ) when the Assyrians conquered the various Syro-Hittite states to its west . The Achaemenid Empire ( 546-332 BC ) , which rose after the fall of the Assyrian Empire , also retained Old Aramaic as its official language , and Old Aramaic remained the lingua franca of the region . During the course of the third and fourth centuries AD , the inhabitants of the region began to embrace Christianity . Because of theological differences , Syriac-speaking Christians bifurcated during the 5th century into the Church of the East , or East Syrians under Sasanian rule , and the Syriac Orthodox , or West Syrians under the Byzantine empire . After this separation , the two groups developed distinct dialects differing primarily in the pronunciation and written symbolisation of vowels . The modern , and vastly spoken , Syriac varieties today include Assyrian Neo-Aramaic , Chaldean Neo-Aramaic and Turoyo , among others , which , in turn , have their own subdialects as well . Along with Latin and Greek , Syriac became one of the three most important Christian languages in the early centuries of the Common Era .",
  "/wiki/Ambrosiaster": "Ambrosiaster is the name given to the writer of a commentary on St Paul 's epistles , brief in words but weighty in matter , and valuable for the criticism of the Latin text of the New Testament . The commentary itself was written during the papacy of Pope Damasus I , that is , between 366 and 384 , and is considered an important document of the Latin text of Paul before the Vulgate of Jerome , and of the interpretation of Paul prior to Augustine of Hippo . This commentary was erroneously attributed for a long time to St Ambrose . In 1527 , though , Erasmus threw doubt on the accuracy of ascribing the authorship of this document to Ambrose . Erasmus is generally falsely credited for having coined the name Ambrosiaster ( literally in Latin : would-be Ambrose ) to describe its author . The credit for this nickname should go to the Maurists , as Ren\u00e9 Hoven has shown . The name has remained with the unknown author . Attempts to identify this Ambrosiaster with known authors has continued , but with no success . Because Augustine cites Ambrosiaster 's commentary on Romans 5.12 under the name of Hilary , many critics have attempted to identify Ambroasiaster with one of the many writers named Hilary active in the period . In 1899 , Germain Morin suggested that the writer was Isaac , a converted Jew and writer of a tract on the Trinity and Incarnation , who was exiled to Spain in 378-380 and then relapsed to Judaism ; but he afterwards abandoned this theory of the authorship in favour of Decimus Hilarianus Hilarius , proconsul of Africa in 377 . Alternatively , Paolo Angelo Ballerini attempted to sustain the traditional attribution of the work to Ambrose , in his complete edition of that Father 's work . This is extremely problematic , though , since it would require Ambrose to have written the book before he became a bishop , and then added to it in later years , incorporating later remarks of Hilary of Poitiers on Romans .",
  "/wiki/Canons_of_the_Apostles": "The Apostolic Canons or Ecclesiastical Canons of the Same Holy Apostles is a 4th century Syrian Christian text . It is an Ancient Church Order , a collection of ancient ecclesiastical decrees concerning the government and discipline of the Early Christian Church , allegedly written by the Apostles first found as the last chapter of the eighth book of the Apostolic Constitutions . Like the other Ancient Church Orders , the Apostolic Canons use a pseudepigraphic form . These eighty-five canons were approved by the Eastern Council in Trullo in 692 but rejected by Pope Sergius I . In the Western Church only fifty of these canons circulated , translated in Latin by Dionysius Exiguus in about 500 AD , and included in the Western collections and afterwards in the Corpus Juris Canonici . Canon n. 85 contains a list of canonical books , thus it is important for the history of the Biblical canon .",

Tatian sought to combine all the textual material he found in the four gospels - Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John - into a single coherent narrative of Jesus 's life and death . However , and in contradistinction to most later gospel harmonists , Tatian appears not to have been motivated by any aspiration to validate the four separate canonical gospel accounts ; or to demonstrate that , as they stood , they could each be shown as being without inconsistency or error . Although widely used by early Syriac Christians , the original text has not survived , but was reconstructed in 1881 by Theodor Zahn from translations and commentaries .",

The divisions into chapters and verses used in modern texts date only from the 13th and 16th centuries , respectively . The sections are indicated in the margin of nearly all Greek and Latin manuscripts of the Bible , and usually summarized in Canon Tables at the start of the Gospels ( see below ) . There are about 1165 sections : 355 for Matthew , 235 for Mark , 343 for Luke , and 232 for John ; the numbers , however , vary slightly in different manuscripts .

  "/wiki/Gospel_of_the_Ebionites": "The Gospel of the Ebionites is the conventional name given by scholars [ n 1 ] to an apocryphal gospel extant only as seven brief quotations in a heresiology known as the Panarion , by Epiphanius of Salamis ; [ n 2 ] he misidentified it as the Hebrew gospel , believing it to be a truncated and modified version of the Gospel of Matthew . The quotations were embedded in a polemic to point out inconsistencies in the beliefs and practices of a Jewish Christian sect known as the Ebionites relative to Nicene orthodoxy . [ n 3 ] The surviving fragments derive from a gospel harmony of the Synoptic Gospels , composed in Greek with various expansions and abridgments reflecting the theology of the writer . Distinctive features include the absence of the virgin birth and of the genealogy of Jesus ; an Adoptionist Christology , [ n 4 ] in which Jesus is chosen to be God 's Son at the time of his Baptism ; the abolition of the Jewish sacrifices by Jesus ; and an advocacy of vegetarianism . [ n 5 ] It is believed to have been composed some time during the middle of the 2nd century in or around the region east of the Jordan River . [ n 6 ] Although the gospel was said to be used by Ebionites during the time of the early church , [ n 7 ] the identity of the group or groups that used it remains a matter of conjecture . [ n 8 ] The Gospel of the Ebionites is one of several Jewish-Christian gospels , along with the Gospel of the Hebrews and the Gospel of the Nazarenes ; all survive only as fragments in quotations of the early Church Fathers . Due to their fragmentary state , the relationships , if any , between the Jewish-Christian gospels and a hypothetical original Hebrew Gospel are uncertain and have been a subject of intensive scholarly investigation . [ n 9 ] The Ebionite gospel has been recognized as distinct from the others , [ n 10 ] and it has been identified more closely with the lost Gospel of the Twelve .

More specifically , it is part of the Northwest Semitic group , which also includes the Canaanite languages such as Hebrew and Phoenician . The Aramaic alphabet was widely adopted for other languages and is ancestral to the Hebrew , Syriac and Arabic alphabets . During its approximately 3,100 years of written history , Aramaic has served variously as a language of administration of empires , as a language of divine worship and religious study , and as the spoken tongue of a number of Semitic peoples from the Near East . Historically , Aramaic was the language of the Arameans , a Semitic-speaking people of the region between the northern Levant and the northern Tigris valley . By around 1000 BC , the Arameans had a string of kingdoms in what is now part of Syria and Mesopotamia . Aramaic rose to prominence under the Neo-Assyrian Empire ( 911-605 BC ) , under whose influence Aramaic became a prestige language , and its use spread throughout most of Mesopotamia and the Levant . At its height , variants of Aramaic were spoken all over in what is today Iraq , Syria , Lebanon , Palestine , Israel , Jordan , Kuwait , Eastern Arabia , Northern Arabia , and to a lesser extent parts of southeast and south central Turkey , and parts of northwest Iran . Aramaic was the language of Jesus , who spoke the Galilean dialect during his public ministry , as well as the language of large sections of the biblical books of Daniel and Ezra , and also one of the languages of the Talmud . The scribes of the Neo-Assyrian bureaucracy had also used Aramaic , and this practice - together with other administrative practices - was subsequently inherited by the succeeding Neo-Babylonians ( 605-539 BC ) , and the Achaemenids ( 539-323 BC ) . Mediated by scribes that had been trained in the language , highly standardized written Aramaic ( in its Achaemenid form called Imperial Aramaic ) progressively also become the lingua franca of trade and commerce throughout the Achaemenid territories , which extended as far east as the Indus valley . ( That use of written Aramaic subsequently led to the adoption of the Aramaic alphabet and - as logograms - some Aramaic vocabulary in the Pahlavi scripts , which were used by several Middle Iranian languages , including Parthian , Middle Persian , Sogdian , and Khwarazmian ) .",
