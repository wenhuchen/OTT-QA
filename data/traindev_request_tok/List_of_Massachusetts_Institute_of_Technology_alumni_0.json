  "/wiki/Ronald_Reagan": "Ronald Wilson Reagan ( /\u02c8re\u026a\u0261\u0259n/ ; February 6 , 1911 - June 5 , 2004 ) was an American politician who served as the 40th president of the United States from 1981 to 1989 and became a highly influential voice of modern conservatism . Prior to his presidency , he was a Hollywood actor and union leader before serving as the 33rd governor of California from 1967 to 1975 . Reagan was raised in a low-income family in small towns of northern Illinois . He graduated from Eureka College in 1932 and worked as a sports commentator on several regional radio stations . After moving to California in 1937 , he found work as an actor and starred in a few major productions . Reagan was twice elected president of the Screen Actors Guild - the labor union for actors - where he worked to root out Communist influence . In the 1950s , he moved into television and was a motivational speaker at General Electric factories , during which time he became a conservative . Reagan was a Democrat until 1962 when he switched to the Republican Party . In 1964 , Reagan 's speech A Time for Choosing supported Barry Goldwater 's foundering presidential campaign and earned him national attention as a new conservative spokesman . Building a network of supporters , Reagan was elected governor of California in 1966 . As governor , Reagan raised taxes , turned a state budget deficit to a surplus , challenged the protesters at the University of California , ordered in National Guard troops during a period of protest movements in 1969 , and was re-elected in 1970 .

  "/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative_Organization": "The Strategic Defense Initiative ( SDI ) was a proposed missile defense system intended to protect the United States from attack by ballistic strategic nuclear weapons ( intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles ) . The concept was first announced publicly by President Ronald Reagan on March 23 , 1983 . Reagan was a vocal critic of the doctrine of mutual assured destruction ( MAD ) , which he described as a suicide pact , and he called upon the scientists and engineers of the United States to develop a system that would render nuclear weapons obsolete . The Strategic Defense Initiative Organization ( SDIO ) was set up in 1984 within the United States Department of Defense to oversee development . A wide array of advanced weapon concepts , including lasers , particle beam weapons and ground- and space-based missile systems were studied , along with various sensor , command and control , and high-performance computer systems that would be needed to control a system consisting of hundreds of combat centers and satellites spanning the entire globe and involved in a battle that would last only minutes . A number of these concepts were tested through the late 1980s , and follow-on efforts and spin-offs continue to this day . Under the SDIO 's Innovative Sciences and Technology Office , headed by physicist and engineer Dr. James Ionson , the investment was predominantly made in basic research at national laboratories , universities , and in industry ; these programs have continued to be key sources of funding for top research scientists in the fields of high-energy physics , supercomputing/computation , advanced materials , and many other critical science and engineering disciplines - funding which indirectly supports other research work by top scientists , and which would be politically impossible to fund outside of the defense budget environment . [ citation needed ] In 1987 , the American Physical Society concluded that the technologies being considered were decades away from being ready for use , and at least another decade of research was required to know whether such a system was even possible . After the publication of the APS report , SDIs budget was repeatedly cut . By the late 1980s , the effort had been re-focused on the Brilliant Pebbles concept using small orbiting missiles not unlike a conventional air-to-air missile , which was expected to be much less expensive to develop and deploy . SDI was controversial in some sectors , and was criticized for threatening to destabilize the MAD-approach and to possibly re-ignite an offensive arms race . SDI was derisively nicknamed by Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy as Star Wars , after the 1977 film by George Lucas .",
