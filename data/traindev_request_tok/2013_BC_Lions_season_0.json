They are currently members of the West Division of the Canadian Football League ( CFL ) . They play their home games at IG Field after many years of playing at the since demolished Canad Inns Stadium . The Blue Bombers were founded in 1930 as the Winnipeg Football Club , which has always been the organization 's legal name . Unlike most other professional teams in the four most popular North American team sports ( but much more common in soccer , especially in Europe ) the official legal name Winnipeg Football Club continues to see significant everyday use alongside its nickname , particularly in local media and especially when reporting on the club 's business affairs . Another unique aspect to the club compared to other North American professional sports teams ( but also more common in Europe ) is that it is organized as a corporation without share capital , meaning no one person or entity owns the team - while there are two other community-owned non-profit professional football teams in the CFL and one in the NFL , unlike the Winnipeg Football Club they all have shareholders . Since their establishment , the Blue Bombers have won the league 's Grey Cup championship 11 times , most recently in 2019 when they defeated the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 33-12 in the 107th Grey Cup . The team holds the record for most Grey Cup appearances of any team ( 25 ) and were the first club not located in Ontario or Quebec to win a championship .",

The team 's origins date back to a modified version of rugby football that emerged in North America in the latter half of the nineteenth century . The Argonauts played their home games at Rogers Centre ( originally known as SkyDome ) from 1989 until 2016 when the team moved to BMO Field , the fifth stadium site to host the team . The Argonauts have won the Grey Cup a record 17 times and have appeared in the final 23 times . Most recently they defeated the Calgary Stampeders 27-24 in the 105th Grey Cup in 2017 .

The Argonauts have faced every current western CFL team at least once in the Grey Cup , while their most celebrated divisional rivalry has been with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats . The team was founded and owned by the Argonaut Rowing Club for its first 83 years , and has been owned by a series of business interests since 1956 . The Argonauts were a fixture on the Toronto sports scene for decades , with attendance peaking in the 1970s . In May 2015 it was announced that a consortium of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment 's Larry Tanenbaum ( via the Kilmer Group ) and Bell Canada would acquire the team . The sale included a scheduled move to MLSE run BMO Field for the 2016 season , which has long been proposed given attendance under-utilization at Rogers Centre and announced plans to install natural grass at the domed stadium , rendering it unfit for football ."
