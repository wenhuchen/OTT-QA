Knetemann won 127 races as a professional . Knetemann maintained an Amsterdam accent and a sharp sense of humour that made him a favourite with reporters and earned him television and radio appearances . His best year in the Tour de France was 1978 , when he led from the sixth stage . Although he lost the leader 's yellow jersey two days later , he won the stage into Lausanne and then the final stage on the Champs Elys\u00e9es in Paris . Together with Raas and his TI-Raleigh teammates Knetemann played a pivotal role in the victory of Zoetemelk in the 1980 Tour de France , one of the most dominating team performances in Tour de France history in which the team won twelve stages . His career dwindled after a crash in Dwars door Belgi\u00eb in Belgium in March 1983 .
