  "/wiki/Media_market": "A media market , broadcast market , media region , designated market area ( DMA ) , television market area , or simply market is a region where the population can receive the same ( or similar ) television and radio station offerings , and may also include other types of media including newspapers and Internet content . They can coincide or overlap with one or more metropolitan areas , though rural regions with few significant population centers can also be designated as markets . Conversely , very large metropolitan areas can sometimes be subdivided into multiple segments . Market regions may overlap , meaning that people residing on the edge of one media market may be able to receive content from other nearby markets . They are widely used in audience measurements , which are compiled in the United States by Nielsen Media Research . Nielsen measures both television and radio audiences since its acquisition of Arbitron , which was completed in September 2013 . Markets are identified by the largest city , which is usually located in the center of the market region . However , geography and the fact that some metropolitan areas have large cities separated by some distance can make markets have unusual shapes and result in two , three , or more names being used to identify a single region ( such as Wichita-Hutchinson , Kansas ; Chico-Redding , California ; Albany-Schenectady-Troy , New York ; and Harrisburg-Lebanon-Lancaster-York , Pennsylvania ) . In the United States , radio markets are generally a bit smaller than their television counterparts , as broadcast power restrictions are stricter for radio than TV , and TV reaches further via cable . AM band and FM band radio ratings are sometimes separated , as are broadcast and cable television . Market researchers also subdivide ratings demographically between different age groups , genders , and ethnic backgrounds ; as well as psychographically between income levels and other non-physical factors . This information is used by advertisers to determine how to reach a specific audience .",
  "/wiki/City": "A city is a large human settlement . It can be defined as a permanent and densely settled place with administratively defined boundaries whose members work primarily on non-agricultural tasks . Cities generally have extensive systems for housing , transportation , sanitation , utilities , land use , and communication . Their density facilitates interaction between people , government organisations and businesses , sometimes benefiting different parties in the process , such as improving efficiency of goods and service distribution . This concentration also can have significant negative consequences , such as forming urban heat islands , concentrating pollution , and stressing water supplies and other resources . Historically , city-dwellers have been a small proportion of humanity overall , but following two centuries of unprecedented and rapid urbanisation , roughly half of the world population now lives in cities , which has had profound consequences for global sustainability . Present-day cities usually form the core of larger metropolitan areas and urban areas - creating numerous commuters traveling towards city centres for employment , entertainment , and edification . However , in a world of intensifying globalisation , all cities are in different degree also connected globally beyond these regions . This increased influence means that cities also have significant influences on global issues , such as sustainable development , global warming and global health . The world powers feature several renowned cities , the cities of the United States , include New York City and Los Angeles , and other major cities such as Chicago , Houston , and Philadelphia . While the cities in China , rank among the most populated , for example city proper is Chongqing and the Shanghai area . While the most populous metropolitan areas are the Greater Tokyo Area , and the Jakarta metropolitan area .",
  "/wiki/Call_sign": "In broadcasting and radio communications , a call sign ( also known as a call name or call letters - and historically as a call signal - or abbreviated as a call ) is a unique designation for a transmitter station . In the United States of America , they are used for all FCC-licensed transmitters . A call sign can be formally assigned by a government agency , informally adopted by individuals or organizations , or even cryptographically encoded to disguise a station 's identity . The use of call signs as unique identifiers dates to the landline railroad telegraph system . Because there was only one telegraph line linking all railroad stations , there needed to be a way to address each one when sending a telegram . In order to save time , two-letter identifiers were adopted for this purpose . This pattern continued in radiotelegraph operation ; radio companies initially assigned two-letter identifiers to coastal stations and stations aboard ships at sea . These were not globally unique , so a one-letter company identifier ( for instance , 'M ' and two letters as a Marconi station ) was later added . By 1912 , the need to quickly identify stations operated by multiple companies in multiple nations required an international standard ; an ITU prefix would be used to identify a country , and the rest of the call sign an individual station in that country .",
  "/wiki/Network_affiliate": "In the broadcasting industry ( particularly in North America ) , a network affiliate or affiliated station is a local broadcaster , owned by a company other than the owner of the network , which carries some or all of the lineup of television programs or radio programs of a television or radio network . This distinguishes such a television or radio station from an owned-and-operated station ( O & O ) , which is owned by the parent network . Notwithstanding this distinction , it is common in informal speech ( even for networks or O & Os themselves ) to refer to any station , O & O or otherwise , that carries a particular network 's programming as an affiliate , or to refer to the status of carrying such programming in a given market as an affiliation .",

  "/wiki/CBS": "CBS ( an initialism of the network 's former name , the Columbia Broadcasting System ) is an American English-language commercial broadcast television and radio network that is the flagship property of the CBS Entertainment Group division of ViacomCBS . The company is headquartered at the CBS Building in New York City with major production facilities and operations in New York City ( at the CBS Broadcast Center ) and Los Angeles ( at CBS Television City and the CBS Studio Center ) . CBS is sometimes referred to as the Eye Network , in reference to the company 's trademark symbol , in use since 1951 . It has also been called the Tiffany Network , alluding to the perceived high quality of CBS programming during the tenure of William S. Paley . It can also refer to some of CBS 's first demonstrations of color television , which were held in a former Tiffany & Co. building in New York City in 1950 . The network has its origins in United Independent Broadcasters Inc. , a collection of 16 radio stations purchased by Paley in 1928 and renamed the Columbia Broadcasting System . Under Paley 's guidance , CBS would first become one of the largest radio networks in the United States , and eventually one of the Big Three American broadcast television networks . In 1974 CBS dropped its former full name and became known simply as CBS , Inc . The Westinghouse Electric Corporation acquired the network in 1995 , renamed its corporate entity to the current CBS Broadcasting , Inc. in 1997 , and eventually adopted the name of the company it had acquired to become CBS Corporation . In 2000 CBS came under the control of the first Viacom , which was formed as a spin-off of CBS in 1971 . In late 2005 , Viacom split itself into two separate companies and re-established CBS Corporation through the spin-off of its broadcast television , radio , and select cable television and non-broadcasting assets , with the CBS television network at its core . CBS Corporation was controlled by Sumner Redstone through National Amusements , which also controlled the second Viacom until December 4 , 2019 , when the two separated companies agreed to re-merge to become the new single entity known as ViacomCBS .",
  "/wiki/McAdam,_New_Brunswick": "McAdam is a village located in the southwestern corner of York County , New Brunswick , Canada . The village covers 14.28 square kilometres ( 5.51 sq mi ) and had a population of 1,151 as of 2016 . An independent study was executed early 2018 , and the results found that the population of McAdam had grown to 1,225 . Turning the tide of a shrinking population , this is the first time the community 's population grew since 1956 . The area was first settled in the mid-to-late 19th century as a group of small lumber camps . The area further developed due to its advantageous location as an important railway junction between the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway from the Maritime provinces to New England and central Canada and branch lines to St. Stephen , St. Andrews and Woodstock . The town was an important servicing stop for many passenger and freight trains , as well as military trains during the World Wars . A large railway station was built to accommodate travelers and a roundhouse and yard were located in the village . The conversion of locomotives from steam power to diesel during the 1950s , as well as highway improvements and increased trucking during the 1960s and 1970s , saw McAdam decline in importance for rail transport . Decreased employment with the railway caused significant economic challenges for the community during the latter half of the 20th century and early 21st century .",

The hosting United States led the medal count with a total of 101 medals , and the most gold ( 44 ) and silver ( 32 ) medals out of all countries . The U.S. topped the medal count for the first time since 1984 , and for the first time since 1968 in a non-boycotted Summer Olympics . Notable performances during competition included those of Andre Agassi - who became the first men 's singles tennis player to combine a career Grand Slam with an Olympic gold medal , Donovan Bailey - who set a new world record of 9.84 for the men 's 100 meters , and Lilia Podkopayeva - who became the second gymnast to win an individual event gold after winning the all-round title in the same Olympics . The festivities were marred by violence on July 27 , when Eric Rudolph detonated pipe bombs at Centennial Olympic Park - a downtown park that was built to serve as a public focal point for the Games ' festivities , killing 1 and injuring 111 . In 2003 , Rudolph confessed to the bombing and a series of related attacks on abortion centers and a gay bar , and was sentenced to life in prison . He claimed that the bombing was meant to protest the U.S. government 's sanctioning of abortion on demand . The Games turned a profit , helped by record revenue from sponsorship deals and broadcast rights , and reliance on private funding ( as opposed to the extensive public funding used on later Olympics ) , among other factors .",

  "/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company": "The Fox Broadcasting Company ( often shortened to Fox and stylized in all caps as FOX ) is an American broadcast television network that is a flagship property of the Fox Corporation . The network is headquartered at 1211 Avenue of the Americas in New York City , with additional offices at the Fox Broadcasting Center ( also in New York ) and at the Fox Television Center in Los Angeles . Launched on October 9 , 1986 , as a competitor to the Big Three television networks ( ABC , CBS and NBC ) , Fox went on to become the most successful attempt at a fourth television network . It was the highest-rated network in the 18-49 demographic from 2004 to 2012 , and earned the position as the most-watched American television network in total viewership during the 2007-08 season . Fox and its affiliated companies operate many entertainment channels in international markets , although these do not necessarily air the same programming as the U.S. network . Most viewers in Canada have access to at least one U.S.-based Fox affiliate , either free-to-air or through a pay television provider , although Fox 's National Football League broadcasts and most of its prime time programming are subject to simultaneous substitution regulations for pay television providers imposed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) to protect rights held by domestically based networks . Fox is named after what was once called 20th Century Fox , its original corporate sibling ( and still its major supplier of programming , despite its acquisition by Disney ) and indirectly for producer William Fox , who founded one of the movie studio 's predecessors , Fox Film . Fox is a member of the North American Broadcasters Association and the National Association of Broadcasters .",

The X in WGBX 's callsign stands for eXperimental , as WGBX ( more primarily in the 1970s ) was home to programming that was given a trial run on the lower-rated UHF signal before possibly moving onto the more-established WGBH-TV . Such Eastern Educational Network imports from the United Kingdom as Doctor Who were seen first or more frequently on WGBX , and one late 1970s local nightclub-style variety show , Club 44 , proved popular enough to be moved over to WGBH and retitled The Club . The station airs PBS programs that are not aired by WGBH-TV as well as additional supplemental programming . Reruns of the previous night 's programming either from WGBH-TV or from WGBX-TV itself also makes up part of channel 44 's programming schedule . WGBX also carries most of the national digital subchannel networks ( except for World ) which are managed by the WGBH Educational Foundation ( along with an additional station , as described below ) ; this enables WGBH to maintain a high-bitrate 1080i high definition picture resolution on its main channel 2 signal , with little loss in visual quality ."
