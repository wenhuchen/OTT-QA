  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",

With the Packers , Taylor was invited to five straight Pro Bowls and won four NFL championships , as well as a victory in the first Super Bowl . He was recognized as the NFL Most Valuable Player after winning the rushing title in 1962 , beating out Jim Brown . An aggressive player and fluent trash talker , Taylor developed several personal rivalries throughout his career , most notably with New York Giants linebacker Sam Huff . This confrontational attitude , combined with his tenacious running style , a penchant for contact , and ability to both withstand and deliver blows , earned him a reputation as one of the league 's toughest players . Playing college football for Louisiana State University ( LSU ) , Taylor led the Southeastern Conference ( SEC ) in scoring in 1956 and 1957 and earned first-team All-America honors as a senior . He was selected by the Packers in the second round of the 1958 NFL Draft and was used sparingly as a rookie , but with the arrival of coach Vince Lombardi in 1959 Taylor soon became the team 's all-purpose back , especially when only a few yards were needed . In this role , his spirited performance against the Giants in the 1962 NFL Championship Game came to define his mental and physical toughness . Taylor finished his career after carrying 1,941 times for 8,597 yards and 83 touchdowns . He was the first player to record five straight seasons of at least 1,000 rushing yards . His 81 rushing touchdowns for the Packers remains a franchise record by a wide margin , and his 8,207 rushing yards with the team has been surpassed only once . Taylor was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1976 .",
  "/wiki/Fullback_(American_football)": "A fullback ( FB ) is a position known as the best position in the game of football , in the offensive backfield in gridiron football , and is one of the two running back positions along with the halfback . Typically , fullbacks are larger than halfback and in most offensive schemes their duties are split between power running , pass catching , and blocking for both the quarterback and the other running back . Many great runners in the history of American football have been fullbacks , including Jim Brown , Marion Motley , Jim Taylor , Franco Harris , Larry Csonka , John Riggins , Christian Okoye , and Levi Jackson . However , many of these runners would retroactively be labeled as halfbacks , due to their position as the primary ball carrier ; they were primarily listed as fullbacks due to their size and did not often perform the run-blocking duties expected of modern fullbacks . Examples of players who have excelled at the hybrid running-blocking-pass catching role include Mike Alstott , Daryl Johnston , and Lorenzo Neal .",
