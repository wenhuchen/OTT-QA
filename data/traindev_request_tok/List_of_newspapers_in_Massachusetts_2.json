  "/wiki/Albanian_language": "Albanian ( /\u00e6l\u02c8be\u026ani\u0259n/ ; shqip [ \u0283c\u0361\u00e7ip ] or gjuha shqipe [ \u025f\u0361\u029duha \u02c8\u0283c\u0361\u00e7ip\u025b ] ) is an Indo-European language spoken by the Albanians in the Balkans and the Albanian diaspora in the Americas , Europe and Oceania . With about 7.5 million speakers , it comprises an independent branch within the Indo-European languages and is not closely related to any other language . First attested in the 15th century , it is the last Indo-European branch to appear in written records . This is one of the reasons why its still-unknown origin has long been a matter of dispute among linguists and historians . Albanian is considered to be the descendant of one of the Paleo-Balkan languages of antiquity . For more historical and geographical reasons than specifically linguistic ones , there are various modern historians and linguists who believe that the Albanian language may have descended from a southern Illyrian dialect spoken in much the same region in classical times . Alternative hypotheses hold that Albanian may have descended from Thracian or Daco-Moesian , other ancient languages spoken farther east than Illyrian . Not enough is known of these languages to completely prove or disprove the various hypotheses . The two main Albanian dialects , Gheg and Tosk which are primarily distinguished by phonological differences , are mutually intelligible , with Gheg spoken in the north and Tosk spoken in the south of the Shkumbin river . Their characteristics in the treatment of the native and loanwords from other languages , have led to the conclusion that the dialectal split occurred after Christianisation of the region ( 4th century AD ) and at the time of the Slavic migration to the Balkans , with the historic boundary between Gheg and Tosk being the Shkumbin which straddled the Jire\u010dek line . Standard Albanian is a standardised form of spoken Albanian based on the Tosk dialect . It is the official language of Albania and Kosovo [ a ] and a co-official language in North Macedonia as well as a minority language of Italy , Montenegro , Romania and Serbia .",

Boston is the seat of Suffolk County as well , although the county government was disbanded on July 1 , 1999 . The city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area known as Greater Boston , a metropolitan statistical area ( MSA ) home to a census-estimated 4.8 million people in 2016 and ranking as the tenth-largest such area in the country . As a combined statistical area ( CSA ) , this wider commuting region is home to some 8.2 million people , making it the sixth most populous in the United States . Boston is one of the oldest municipalities in the United States , founded on the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630 by Puritan settlers from the English town of the same name . It was the scene of several key events of the American Revolution , such as the Boston Massacre , the Boston Tea Party , the Battle of Bunker Hill , and the Siege of Boston . Upon gaining U.S. independence from Great Britain , it continued to be an important port and manufacturing hub as well as a center for education and culture . The city has expanded beyond the original peninsula through land reclamation and municipal annexation . Its rich history attracts many tourists , with Faneuil Hall alone drawing more than 20 million visitors per year . Boston 's many firsts include the United States ' first public park ( Boston Common , 1634 ) , first public or state school ( Boston Latin School , 1635 ) and first subway system ( Tremont Street Subway , 1897 ) .

It is a global language , the world 's second-most spoken native language , after Mandarin Chinese , and the world 's fourth-most spoken language , after Mandarin Chinese , English and Hindi . Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages , which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century . The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century , and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo , a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile , in the 13th century . Beginning in 1492 , the Spanish language was taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire , most notably to the Americas , as well as territories in Africa , Oceania and the Philippines . A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist Mario Pei , analyzing the degree of difference from a language 's parent ( Latin , in the case of Romance languages ) by comparing phonology , inflection , syntax , vocabulary , and intonation , indicated the following percentages ( the higher the percentage , the greater the distance from Latin ) : In the case of Spanish , it is one of the closest Romance languages to Latin ( 20% distance ) , only behind Sardinian ( 8% distance ) and Italian ( 12% distance ) . Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin , including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek . Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date , having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula . With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin , this language makes up the second greatest vocabulary source after Latin itself . It has also been influenced by Basque , Iberian , Celtiberian , Visigothic , and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages . Additionally , it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages , particularly other Romance languages - French , Italian , Andalusi Romance , Portuguese , Galician , Catalan , Occitan , and Sardinian - as well as from Quechua , Nahuatl , and other indigenous languages of the Americas . Spanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations .",

  "/wiki/Sampan": "A sampan is a relatively flat-bottomed Chinese and Malay wooden boat . Some sampans include a small shelter on board and may be used as a permanent habitation on inland waters . Sampans are generally used for transportation in coastal areas or rivers and are often used as traditional fishing boats . It is unusual for a sampan to sail far from land , as they do not have the means to survive rough weather . The word sampan comes from the original Cantonese term for the boats , s\u0101an b\u00e1an ( \u4e09\u677f ) , literally meaning three planks . The name referred to the hull design , which consists of a flat bottom ( made from one plank ) joined to two sides ( the other two planks ) . The design closely resembles Western hard chine boats like the scow or punt . However , Pierre-Yves Manguin pointed out possible Austronesian origin of the word , attested in a Malay inscription from 684 CE . Sampans may be propelled by poles , oars ( particularly a single , long sculling oar called a yuloh ) or may be fitted with outboard motors . Sampans are still in use by rural residents of Southeast Asia , particularly in Malaysia , Indonesia , Bangladesh , Myanmar , Sri Lanka and Vietnam . In the Malay community in Southeast Asia , they also use the term sampan for their boats . Large boats such as sampan panjang , kolek and perahu panjang are used and built by the Malays and Orang Laut living in their coastal villages .",

Chinese languages are spoken by the ethnic Chinese majority and many minority ethnic groups in China . About 1.2 billion people ( around 16% of the world 's population ) speak some form of Chinese as their first language . The varieties of Chinese are usually considered by native speakers to be regional variants of ethnic Chinese speech , without consideration of whether they are mutually intelligible . Due to their lack of mutual intelligibility , linguists generally describe them as distinct languages , perhaps hundreds , sometimes noting that they are more varied than the Romance languages . [ b ] Investigation of the historical relationships among the Sinitic languages is just getting started . Currently , most classifications posit 7 to 13 main regional groups , based on often superficial phonetic developments , of which the most populous by far is Mandarin ( about 800 million speakers , e.g . Southwestern Mandarin ) , followed by Min ( 75 million , e.g . Southern Min ) , Wu ( 74 million , e.g . Shanghainese ) , Yue ( 68 million , e.g . Cantonese ) .
