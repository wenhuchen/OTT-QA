The Bears were looking to get back into the playoffs for a third straight year and improve on their 11-5 record , which was good enough for second place in the NFC Central , and to win their eighth division title in ten years . Although the Bears had a 4-3 record through seven games , they lost eight of their remaining nine ( including six consecutively ) and finished at 5-11 . The Bears ' poor record resulted in the termination of Mike Ditka as head coach on January 5 , 1993 after eleven seasons . Dave Wannstedt , who was serving as the Dallas Cowboys ' defensive coordinator , was hired to take his place . Ditka was fired from coaching the Bears with a 106-62 record , playoff appearances in seven out of 11 seasons since 1982 and a Super Bowl victory in 1985 , with the defense considered the best of all time .

  "/wiki/Tight_end": "The tight end ( TE ) is a position in American football , arena football , and formerly Canadian football , on the offense . The tight end is often seen as a hybrid position with the characteristics and roles of both an offensive lineman and a wide receiver . Like offensive linemen , they are usually lined up on the offensive line and are large enough to be effective blockers . On the other hand , unlike offensive linemen , they are eligible receivers adept enough to warrant a defense 's attention when running pass patterns . Because of the hybrid nature of the position , the tight end 's role in any given offense depends on the tactical preferences and philosophy of the head coach . In some systems , the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman , rarely going out for passes . Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver , frequently taking advantage of the tight end 's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary . Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking on running plays while using a tight end with better pass-catching skills in obvious passing situations . Offensive formations may have as few as zero or as many as three tight ends at one time .",

  "/wiki/Southwest_Conference": "The Southwest Conference ( SWC ) was an NCAA Division I college athletic conference in the United States that existed from 1914 to 1996 . Composed primarily of schools from Texas , at various times the conference included schools from Oklahoma and Arkansas as well , but not from the actual Southwestern United States . For most of its history , the core members of the conference were Texas-based schools plus one in Arkansas : Rice University , Southern Methodist University , Texas A & M University , Texas Christian University , Baylor University , the University of Arkansas , and the University of Texas . After a long period of stability , the conference 's overall athletic prowess began to decline throughout the 1980s , due in part to numerous member schools violating NCAA recruiting rules , culminating in the suspension of the entire SMU football program ( death penalty ) for the 1987 and 1988 seasons . Arkansas , after years of feeling like an outsider in the conference , left after the 1990-91 school year to join the Southeastern Conference , although they did compete in the SWC in football for the 1991 season . Five years later , the conference precipitously broke up as Baylor , Texas , Texas A & M , and Texas Tech ( which had entered in 1956 ) combined with the members of the former Big Eight Conference to form a new league , the Big 12 Conference , while Rice , SMU , TCU , and Houston ( which entered the SWC in 1976 ) found homes in less prominent conferences ( although TCU later joined the Big 12 ) .",

  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",

  "/wiki/Punter_(football)": "A punter ( P ) in gridiron football is a special teams player who receives the snapped ball directly from the line of scrimmage and then punts ( kicks ) the football to the opposing team so as to limit any field position advantage .

  "/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_FBS_independent_schools": "National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) Football Bowl Subdivision independent schools are four-year institutions whose football programs are not part of an NCAA-affiliated conference . This means that FBS independents are not required to schedule each other for competition like conference schools do . There are fewer independent schools than in years past ; many independent schools join , or attempt to join , established conferences . The main reasons to join a conference are to gain a share of television revenue and access to bowl games that agree to take teams from certain conferences , and to help deal with otherwise potentially difficult challenges in scheduling opponents to play throughout the season . All Division I FBS independents are eligible for the College Football Playoff ( CFP ) , or for the so-called access bowls associated with the CFP , if they are chosen by the CFP selection committee . Notre Dame has a potential tie-in with the Orange Bowl . Army has an agreement with the Military Bowl ( formerly the EagleBank Bowl ) , and Notre Dame , in addition to its CFP agreement , has other bowl agreements as part of its affiliation with the Atlantic Coast Conference ( ACC ) . ( Notre Dame had similar agreements with its previous conference , the Big East . ) BYU had an agreement with the Armed Forces Bowl for 2011 . The ranks of football independents increased by one starting with the 2011 season with the announcement that BYU would leave the Mountain West Conference ( MWC ) to become a football independent starting with that season . The ranks increased by two in 2013 when the Western Athletic Conference ( WAC ) dropped football and New Mexico State and Idaho did not have a conference for football . The ranks of football independents decreased by two in 2014 with the return of Idaho and New Mexico State as football-only members of the Sun Belt Conference ( SBC ) and decreased by one more in 2015 with Navy joining the American Athletic Conference ( AAC ) as a football-only member .",

The Giants finished in fourth place in the National Football Conference East Division with a 6-10 record . Head coach Ray Handley was fired after this season , when the Giants finished 1-6 after starting the season 5-4 . Injuries helped to mar the Giants ' season , especially at quarterback . Phil Simms , once again the team 's starting quarterback , suffered a season-ending elbow injury in Week 4 . With Simms out the team once again turned to Jeff Hostetler , the Giants ' original 1991 starter and winner of Super Bowl XXV , to take his place . Hostetler , who had his own troubles with injuries including a broken back that ended his 1991 season , soon found himself out of the lineup after suffering a concussion in Week 12 . The Giants were then forced to turn to a pair of rookies , Kent Graham and Dave Brown , but Graham suffered from elbow and shoulder problems , and Brown suffered a broken right thumb . Hostetler returned for the final two games of the season , a win over the Kansas City Chiefs and a loss to the Philadelphia Eagles . Perhaps the most catastrophic injury was the torn Achilles ' tendon suffered by future Hall of Fame linebacker Lawrence Taylor in Week 10 , as the Giants only won once more after the injury . It was the second consecutive year that an injury to Taylor ended his season prematurely ( a sprained knee in Week 13 of the 1991 season forced Taylor to miss the final game of the regular season and a previous game against the Cincinnati Bengals ) .",

The conference 's members participated in 24 NCAA sports . The conference had a history of success at the national level in basketball throughout its history , while its shorter ( 1991 to 2013 ) football program , created by inviting one college and four other associate members ( their football programs only ) into the conference , resulted in two national championships . In basketball , Big East teams made 18 Final Four appearances and won seven NCAA Championships ( UConn with three , Villanova , Georgetown , Syracuse , and Louisville with one each ) . Of the Big East 's full members , all but South Florida attended the Final Four , the most of any conference , though Marquette , DePaul , Notre Dame , Rutgers , Cincinnati , and Pittsburgh made all their trips before joining the Big East . In 2011 , the Big East set the record for the most teams sent to the NCAA Division I Men 's Basketball Championship by a single conference with eleven out of their sixteen teams qualifying . In football , the Big East entered competition as a conference in 1991 , after inviting five football colleges to become members of the Big East , joining three teams from the Big East whose football teams were competing as Division I independents ( Boston College , Pittsburgh and Syracuse ) to form a new Division I football league . The strength of this league earned the Big East an automatic berth in the Bowl Championship Series , when that series was created in 1998 . The Big East won two national football championships , both by University of Miami . Between 2005 and 2012 , four of the more successful football schools left the Big East for other conferences , starting a process that led to a complete realignment of the Big East in 2013 . On July 1 , 2013 , the non-football playing schools ( also known collectively as the secular Catholic 7 ) formed a non-football playing conference that retains the Big East Conference name .
