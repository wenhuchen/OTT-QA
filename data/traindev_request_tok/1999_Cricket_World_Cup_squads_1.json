  "/wiki/Captain_(cricket)": "The captain of a cricket team , often referred to as the skipper , is the appointed leader , having several additional roles and responsibilities over and above those of the other players . As in other sports , the captain is usually experienced and has good communication skills , and is likely to be one of the most regular members of the team , as the captain often has a say in team selection . Before the game the captains toss for innings . During the match the captain decides the team 's batting order , who will bowl each over , and where each fielder will be positioned . While the captain has the final say , decisions are often collaborative . A captain 's knowledge of the complexities of cricket strategy and tactics , and shrewdness in the field , may contribute significantly to the team 's success . Due to the smaller coaching/management role played out by support staff , as well as the need for greater on-field decision-making , the captain of a cricket team typically shoulders more responsibility for results than team captains in other sports .",
