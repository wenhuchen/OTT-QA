  "/wiki/Pueblo_Bonito": "Pueblo Bonito ( Spanish for beautiful town ) is the largest and best-known great house in Chaco Culture National Historical Park , northern New Mexico . It was built by the Ancestral Puebloans who occupied the structure between AD 828 and 1126 . According to the National Park Service , Pueblo Bonito is the most thoroughly investigated and celebrated cultural site in Chaco Canyon . Planned and constructed in stages between AD 850 to AD 1150 by ancestral Puebloan peoples , this was the center of the Chacoan world . Anthropologist Brian Fagan has said that Pueblo Bonito is an archeological icon , as famous as England 's Stonehenge , Mexico 's Teotihuacan , or Peru 's Machu Picchu . In January 1941 , a section of the canyon wall known as Threatening Rock , or tse biyaa anii'ahi ( leaning rock gap ) in Navajo , collapsed as a result of a rock fall , destroying some of the structure 's rear wall and a number of rooms . The builders of Pueblo Bonito appear to have been well aware of this threat , but chose to build beneath the fractured stone anyway . The wall stood 97 feet ( 30 m ) high and weighed approximately 30,000 tons ; the Puebloans compensated by building structural reinforcements for the slab . In 2009 , traces of Mexican cacao from at least 1,200 miles ( 1,900 km ) away were detected in pottery sherds at Pueblo Bonito . This was the first demonstration that the substance , important in rituals , had been brought into the area that became the United States at any time before the Spanish arrived around 1500 . Cylindrical pottery jars , common in Central America , had previously been found there , but are rare . 111 jars have been found in Pueblo Bonito 's 800 or so rooms .",

The economy of New Mexico is dependent on oil drilling , mineral extraction , dryland farming , cattle ranching , lumber milling , and retail trade . As of 2018 , its total gross domestic product ( GDP ) was $ 101 billion with a GDP per capita of $ 45,465 . New Mexico 's status as a tax haven yields low to moderate personal income taxes on residents and military personnel , and gives tax credits and exemptions to favorable industries . Because of this , its film industry has grown and contributed $ 1.23 billion to its overall economy . Due to its large area and economic climate , New Mexico has a large U.S. military presence marked notably with the White Sands Missile Range . Various U.S. national security agencies base their research and testing arms in New Mexico such as the Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories .",
