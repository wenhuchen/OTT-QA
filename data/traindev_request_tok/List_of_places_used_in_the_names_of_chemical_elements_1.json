  "/wiki/Atomic_number": "The atomic number or proton number ( symbol Z ) of a chemical element is the number of protons found in the nucleus of every atom of that element . The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element . It is identical to the charge number of the nucleus . In an uncharged atom , the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons . The sum of the atomic number Z and the number of neutrons N gives the mass number A of an atom . Since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass ( and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes ) and the mass defect of nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass , the atomic mass of any atom , when expressed in unified atomic mass units ( making a quantity called the relative isotopic mass ) , is within 1% of the whole number A . Atoms with the same atomic number but different neutron numbers , and hence different mass numbers , are known as isotopes . A little more than three-quarters of naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes ( see monoisotopic elements ) , and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element ( called the relative atomic mass ) in a defined environment on Earth , determines the element 's standard atomic weight . Historically , it was these atomic weights of elements ( in comparison to hydrogen ) that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the 19th century . The conventional symbol Z comes from the German word Zahl meaning number , which , before the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics , merely denoted an element 's numerical place in the periodic table , whose order is approximately , but not completely , consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights . Only after 1915 , with the suggestion and evidence that this Z number was also the nuclear charge and a physical characteristic of atoms , did the word Atomzahl ( and its English equivalent atomic number ) come into common use in this context .",
  "/wiki/Sun": "The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System . It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma , with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process . It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth . Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers ( 864,000 miles ) , or 109 times that of Earth , and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth . It accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System . Roughly three quarters of the Sun 's mass consists of hydrogen ( ~73% ) ; the rest is mostly helium ( ~25% ) , with much smaller quantities of heavier elements , including oxygen , carbon , neon , and iron . The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star ( G2V ) based on its spectral class . As such , it is informally and not completely accurately referred to as a yellow dwarf ( its light is closer to white than yellow ) . It formed approximately 4.6 billion [ a ] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud . Most of this matter gathered in the center , whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System . The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core . It is thought that almost all stars form by this process .",
  "/wiki/Helium": "Helium ( from Greek : \u1f25\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 , romanized : Helios , lit . 'Sun ' ) is a chemical element with the symbol He and atomic number 2 . It is a colorless , odorless , tasteless , non-toxic , inert , monatomic gas , the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table . Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements . Helium is the second lightest and second most abundant element in the observable universe ( hydrogen is the lightest and most abundant ) . It is present at about 24% of the total elemental mass , which is more than 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined . Its abundance is similar to this in both the Sun and in Jupiter . This is due to the very high nuclear binding energy ( per nucleon ) of helium-4 , with respect to the next three elements after helium . This helium-4 binding energy also accounts for why it is a product of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay . Most helium in the universe is helium-4 , the vast majority of which was formed during the Big Bang . Large amounts of new helium are being created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars . Helium is named for the Greek Titan of the Sun , Helios .",
  "/wiki/Mercury_(planet)": "Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System . Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 days , the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System . It is named after the Roman deity Mercury , the messenger of the gods . Like Venus , Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth 's orbit as an inferior planet , and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28\u00b0 . This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or eastern horizon before sunrise , usually in twilight . At this time , it may appear as a bright star-like object , but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus . The planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases , similar to Venus and the Moon , as it moves in its inner orbit relative to Earth , which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days . Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System . It is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance , meaning that relative to the fixed stars , it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun . [ a ] As seen from the Sun , in a frame of reference that rotates with the orbital motion , it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years . An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian years . Mercury 's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System 's planets ( about \u200b1\u204430 degree ) .",
  "/wiki/Mercury_(element)": "Mercury is a chemical element with the symbol Hg and atomic number 80 . It is commonly known as quicksilver and was formerly named hydrargyrum ( /ha\u026a\u02c8dr\u0251\u02d0rd\u0292\u0259r\u0259m/ hy-DRAR-j\u0259r-\u0259m ) . A heavy , silvery d-block element , mercury is the only metallic element that is liquid at standard conditions for temperature and pressure ; the only other element that is liquid under these conditions is the halogen bromine , though metals such as caesium , gallium , and rubidium melt just above room temperature . Mercury occurs in deposits throughout the world mostly as cinnabar ( mercuric sulfide ) . The red pigment vermilion is obtained by grinding natural cinnabar or synthetic mercuric sulfide . Mercury is used in thermometers , barometers , manometers , sphygmomanometers , float valves , mercury switches , mercury relays , fluorescent lamps and other devices , though concerns about the element 's toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favor of alternatives such as alcohol- or galinstan-filled glass thermometers and thermistor- or infrared-based electronic instruments . Likewise , mechanical pressure gauges and electronic strain gauge sensors have replaced mercury sphygmomanometers . Mercury remains in use in scientific research applications and in amalgam for dental restoration in some locales . It is also used in fluorescent lighting . Electricity passed through mercury vapor in a fluorescent lamp produces short-wave ultraviolet light , which then causes the phosphor in the tube to fluoresce , making visible light . Mercury poisoning can result from exposure to water-soluble forms of mercury ( such as mercuric chloride or methylmercury ) , by inhalation of mercury vapor , or by ingesting any form of mercury .",
  "/wiki/Moon": "The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits Earth as its only natural satellite . It is the fifth-largest satellite in the Solar System , and by far the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits ( its primary ) . The Moon is , after Jupiter 's satellite Io , the second-densest satellite in the Solar System among those whose densities are known . The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago , not long after Earth . The most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a hypothetical Mars-sized body called Theia . New research of Moon rocks , although not rejecting the Theia hypothesis , suggests that the Moon may be older than previously thought . The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth , and thus always shows the same side to Earth , the near side . Because of libration , slightly more than half ( about 59% ) of the total lunar surface can be viewed from Earth . The near side is marked by dark volcanic maria that fill the spaces between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters . After the Sun , the Moon is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth 's sky . Its surface is actually dark , although compared to the night sky it appears very bright , with a reflectance just slightly higher than that of worn asphalt . Its gravitational influence produces the ocean tides , body tides , and the slight lengthening of the day .",
  "/wiki/Selenium": "Selenium is a chemical element with the symbol Se and atomic number 34 . It is a nonmetal ( more rarely considered a metalloid ) with properties that are intermediate between the elements above and below in the periodic table , sulfur and tellurium , and also has similarities to arsenic . It rarely occurs in its elemental state or as pure ore compounds in the Earth 's crust . Selenium - from Ancient Greek \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7 ( sel\u1e17n\u0113 ) Moon - was discovered in 1817 by J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius , who noted the similarity of the new element to the previously discovered tellurium ( named for the Earth ) . Selenium is found in metal sulfide ores , where it partially replaces the sulfur . Commercially , selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores , most often during production . Minerals that are pure selenide or selenate compounds are known but rare . The chief commercial uses for selenium today are glassmaking and pigments . Selenium is a semiconductor and is used in photocells . Applications in electronics , once important , have been mostly replaced with silicon semiconductor devices . Selenium is still used in a few types of DC power surge protectors and one type of fluorescent quantum dot . Selenium salts are toxic in large amounts , but trace amounts are necessary for cellular function in many organisms , including all animals .",
  "/wiki/2_Pallas": "Pallas [ d ] ( minor-planet designation : 2 Pallas ) is the second asteroid to have been discovered ( after Ceres ) , and is one of the largest asteroids in the Solar System . With an estimated 7% of the mass of the asteroid belt , it is the third-most-massive asteroid , being 10-30% less massive than Vesta . It is 512 kilometers ( 318 mi ) in diameter , somewhat smaller than 4 Vesta . It is likely a remnant protoplanet . When Pallas was discovered by the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Matth\u00e4us Olbers on 28 March 1802 , it was counted as a planet , as were other asteroids in the early 19th century . The discovery of many more asteroids after 1845 eventually led to their reclassification . Pallas 's surface is most likely composed of a silicate material ; its spectrum and estimated density resemble carbonaceous chondrite meteorites . With an orbital inclination of 34.8\u00b0 , Pallas 's orbit is unusually highly inclined to the plane of the asteroid belt , and its orbital eccentricity is nearly as large as that of Pluto , making Pallas relatively inaccessible to spacecraft . It was considered as a potential planet in 2006 , but it has since been determined that its shape departs significantly from an ellipsoid .",
  "/wiki/Asteroid": "Asteroids are minor planets , especially of the inner Solar System . Larger asteroids have also been called planetoids . These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the Sun that did not resolve into a disc in a telescope and was not observed to have characteristics of an active comet such as a tail . As minor planets in the outer Solar System were discovered that were found to have volatile-rich surfaces similar to comets , these came to be distinguished from the objects found in the main asteroid belt . In this article , the term asteroid refers to the minor planets of the inner Solar System , including those co-orbital with Jupiter . There exist millions of asteroids , many the shattered remnants of planetesimals , bodies within the young Sun 's solar nebula that never grew large enough to become planets . The vast majority of known asteroids orbit within the main asteroid belt located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter , or are co-orbital with Jupiter ( the Jupiter trojans ) . However , other orbital families exist with significant populations , including the near-Earth objects . Individual asteroids are classified by their characteristic spectra , with the majority falling into three main groups : C-type , M-type , and S-type . These were named after and are generally identified with carbon-rich , metallic , and silicate ( stony ) compositions , respectively . The sizes of asteroids varies greatly ; the largest , Ceres , is almost 1,000 km ( 600 mi ) across and massive enough to be a dwarf planet . Asteroids are somewhat arbitrarily differentiated from comets and meteoroids .",
  "/wiki/Palladium": "Palladium is a chemical element with the symbol Pd and atomic number 46 . It is a rare and lustrous silvery-white metal discovered in 1803 by the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston . He named it after the asteroid Pallas , which was itself named after the epithet of the Greek goddess Athena , acquired by her when she slew Pallas . Palladium , platinum , rhodium , ruthenium , iridium and osmium form a group of elements referred to as the platinum group metals ( PGMs ) . They have similar chemical properties , but palladium has the lowest melting point and is the least dense of them . More than half the supply of palladium and its congener platinum is used in catalytic converters , which convert as much as 90% of the harmful gases in automobile exhaust ( hydrocarbons , carbon monoxide , and nitrogen dioxide ) into less noxious substances ( nitrogen , carbon dioxide and water vapor ) . Palladium is also used in electronics , dentistry , medicine , hydrogen purification , chemical applications , groundwater treatment , and jewelry . Palladium is a key component of fuel cells , which react hydrogen with oxygen to produce electricity , heat , and water . Ore deposits of palladium and other PGMs are rare . The most extensive deposits have been found in the norite belt of the Bushveld Igneous Complex covering the Transvaal Basin in South Africa , the Stillwater Complex in Montana , United States ; the Sudbury Basin and Thunder Bay District of Ontario , Canada , and the Norilsk Complex in Russia . Recycling is also a source , mostly from scrapped catalytic converters . The numerous applications and limited supply sources result in considerable investment interest .",
  "/wiki/Earth": "Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life . According to radiometric dating and other evidence , Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago . Earth 's gravity interacts with other objects in space , especially the Sun and the Moon , which is Earth 's only natural satellite . Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.256 days , a period known as an Earth sidereal year . During this time , Earth rotates about its axis about 366.256 times . [ n 6 ] Earth 's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane , producing seasons on Earth . The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides , stabilizes Earth 's orientation on its axis , and gradually slows its rotation . Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets . Earth 's outer layer ( lithosphere ) is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years . About 71% of Earth 's surface is covered with water , mostly by oceans . The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together contain many lakes , rivers and other fresh water , which , together with the oceans , constitute the hydrosphere . The majority of Earth 's polar regions are covered in ice , including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack .",
  "/wiki/Tellurium": "Tellurium is a chemical element with the symbol Te and atomic number 52 . It is a brittle , mildly toxic , rare , silver-white metalloid . Tellurium is chemically related to selenium and sulfur , all three of which are chalcogens . It is occasionally found in native form as elemental crystals . Tellurium is far more common in the Universe as a whole than on Earth . Its extreme rarity in the Earth 's crust , comparable to that of platinum , is due partly to its formation of a volatile hydride that caused tellurium to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of Earth , and partly to tellurium 's low affinity for oxygen , which causes it to bind preferentially to other chalcophiles in dense minerals that sink into the core . Tellurium-bearing compounds were first discovered in 1782 in a gold mine in Kleinschlatten , Transylvania ( now Zlatna , Romania ) by Austrian mineralogist Franz-Joseph M\u00fcller von Reichenstein , although it was Martin Heinrich Klaproth who named the new element in 1798 after the Latin word for earth , tellus . Gold telluride minerals are the most notable natural gold compounds . However , they are not a commercially significant source of tellurium itself , which is normally extracted as a by-product of copper and lead production . Commercially , the primary use of tellurium is copper ( tellurium copper ) and steel alloys , where it improves machinability . Applications in CdTe solar panels and cadmium telluride semiconductors also consume a considerable portion of tellurium production . Tellurium is considered a technology-critical element .",
  "/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet)": "Ceres ( /\u02c8s\u026a\u0259ri\u02d0z/ SEER-eez ; minor-planet designation : 1 Ceres ) is the largest object in the main asteroid belt that lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter . With a diameter of 945 km ( 587 mi ) , Ceres is both the largest of the asteroids and the only unambiguous dwarf planet inside Neptune 's orbit . [ c ] It is the 25th-largest body in the Solar System within the orbit of Neptune . Ceres was the first asteroid to be discovered ( by Giuseppe Piazzi at Palermo Astronomical Observatory on 1 January 1801 ) . It was originally considered a planet , but was reclassified as an asteroid in the 1850s after many other objects in similar orbits were discovered . Ceres is the only object in the asteroid belt known to be currently rounded by its own gravity , although detailed analysis was required to exclude Vesta . From Earth , the apparent magnitude of Ceres ranges from 6.7 to 9.3 , peaking once at opposition every 15 to 16 months , which is its synodic period . Thus even at its brightest , it is too dim to be seen by the naked eye , except under extremely dark skies . Ceres appears to be partially differentiated into a muddy ( ice-rock ) mantle , with a crust that is 60 percent rock and 40 percent ice or less than 30 percent ice . It probably no longer has an internal ocean of liquid water , but there is brine that can flow through the outer mantle and reach the surface . The surface is a mixture of water ice and various hydrated minerals such as carbonates and clay . Cryovolcanoes such as Ahuna Mons form at the rate of about one every fifty million years .",
  "/wiki/Dwarf_planet": "A dwarf planet is a planetary-mass object that does not dominate its region of space ( as a true/classical planet does ) and is not a satellite . That is , it is in direct orbit of the Sun and is massive enough to be plastic - for its gravity to maintain it in a hydrostatically equilibrious shape ( usually a spheroid ) - but has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit of other material . The prototype dwarf planet is Pluto . The number of dwarf planets in the Solar System is unknown , as determining whether a potential body is a dwarf planet requires close observation . The half-dozen largest candidates have at least one known moon , allowing determination of their masses . The interest of dwarf planets to planetary geologists is that , being differentiated and perhaps geologically active bodies , they are likely to display planetary geology , an expectation born out by the 2015 New Horizons mission to Pluto and Dawn mission to Ceres . The term dwarf planet was coined by planetary scientist Alan Stern as part of a three-way categorization of planetary-mass objects in the Solar System : classical planets ( the big eight ) , dwarf planets and satellite planets . Dwarf planets were thus originally conceived of as a kind of planet , as the name suggests . However , in 2006 the term was adopted by the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) as a category of sub-planetary objects , part of a three-way recategorization of bodies orbiting the Sun precipitated by the discovery of Eris , an object farther away from the Sun than Neptune that was more massive than Pluto but still much smaller than the classical planets , after discoveries of a number of other objects that rivaled Pluto in size had forced a reconsideration of what Pluto was . Thus Stern and many other planetary geologists distinguish dwarf planets from classical planets , but since 2006 the IAU and the majority of astronomers have excluded bodies such as Eris and Pluto from the roster of planets altogether . This redefinition of what constitutes a planet has been both praised and criticized .",
  "/wiki/Cerium": "Cerium is a chemical element with the symbol Ce and atomic number 58 . Cerium is a soft , ductile and silvery-white metal that tarnishes when exposed to air , and it is soft enough to be cut with a knife . Cerium is the second element in the lanthanide series , and while it often shows the +3 oxidation state characteristic of the series , it also exceptionally has a stable +4 state that does not oxidize water . It is also considered one of the rare-earth elements . Cerium has no biological role in humans and is not very toxic . Despite always occurring in combination with the other rare-earth elements in minerals such as those of the monazite and bastn\u00e4site groups , cerium is easy to extract from its ores , as it can be distinguished among the lanthanides by its unique ability to be oxidized to the +4 state . It is the most common of the lanthanides , followed by neodymium , lanthanum , and praseodymium . It is the 26th-most abundant element , making up 66 ppm of the Earth 's crust , half as much as chlorine and five times as much as lead . Cerium was the first of the lanthanides to be discovered , in Bastn\u00e4s , Sweden , by J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger in 1803 , and independently by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in Germany in the same year . In 1839 Carl Gustaf Mosander became the first to isolate the metal .

It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System . Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune , and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn . For this reason , scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as ice giants to distinguish them from the gas giants . Uranus ' atmosphere is similar to Jupiter 's and Saturn 's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium , but it contains more ices such as water , ammonia , and methane , along with traces of other hydrocarbons . It has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System , with a minimum temperature of 49 K ( \u2212224 \u00b0C ; \u2212371 \u00b0F ) , and has a complex , layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds . The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock . Like the other giant planets , Uranus has a ring system , a magnetosphere , and numerous moons . The Uranian system has a unique configuration because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways , nearly into the plane of its solar orbit . Its north and south poles , therefore , lie where most other planets have their equators . In 1986 , images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light , without the cloud bands or storms associated with the other giant planets . Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to visit the planet .",
  "/wiki/Uranium": "Uranium is a chemical element with the symbol U and atomic number 92 . It is a silvery-grey metal in the actinide series of the periodic table . A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons , of which 6 are valence electrons . Uranium is weakly radioactive because all isotopes of uranium are unstable ; the half-lives of its naturally occurring isotopes range between 159,200 years and 4.5 billion years . The most common isotopes in natural uranium are uranium-238 ( which has 146 neutrons and accounts for over 99% of uranium on Earth ) and uranium-235 ( which has 143 neutrons ) . Uranium has the highest atomic weight of the primordially occurring elements . Its density is about 70% higher than that of lead , and slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten . It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few parts per million in soil , rock and water , and is commercially extracted from uranium-bearing minerals such as uraninite . In nature , uranium is found as uranium-238 ( 99.2739-99.2752% ) , uranium-235 ( 0.7198-0.7202% ) , and a very small amount of uranium-234 ( 0.0050-0.0059% ) . Uranium decays slowly by emitting an alpha particle . The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 billion years and that of uranium-235 is 704 million years , making them useful in dating the age of the Earth . Many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties .",
  "/wiki/Neptune": "Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System . In the Solar System , it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter , the third-most-massive planet , and the densest giant planet . Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth , slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus . Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere . Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 au ( 4.5 billion km ; 2.8 billion mi ) . It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol \u2646 , a stylised version of the god Neptune 's trident . Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation . Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet . The position of Neptune was subsequently calculated from Bouvard 's observations , independently , by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier after his death . Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier . Its largest moon , Triton , was discovered shortly thereafter , though none of the planet 's remaining 13 known moons were located telescopically until the 20th century . The planet 's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size , making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes .",

Its position in the periodic table just after uranium , named after the planet Uranus , led to it being named after Neptune , the next planet beyond Uranus . A neptunium atom has 93 protons and 93 electrons , of which seven are valence electrons . Neptunium metal is silvery and tarnishes when exposed to air . The element occurs in three allotropic forms and it normally exhibits five oxidation states , ranging from +3 to +7 . It is radioactive , poisonous , pyrophoric , and capable of accumulating in bones , which makes the handling of neptunium dangerous . Although many false claims of its discovery were made over the years , the element was first synthesized by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory in 1940 . Since then , most neptunium has been and still is produced by neutron irradiation of uranium in nuclear reactors . The vast majority is generated as a by-product in conventional nuclear power reactors . While neptunium itself has no commercial uses at present , it is used as a precursor for the formation of plutonium-238 , used in radioisotope thermal generators to provide electricity for spacecraft . Neptunium has also been used in detectors of high-energy neutrons .",
  "/wiki/Pluto": "Pluto ( minor planet designation : 134340 Pluto ) is an icy dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt , a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune . It was the first Kuiper belt object to be discovered and is the largest known dwarf planet . Pluto was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 as the ninth planet from the Sun . After 1992 , its status as a planet was questioned following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt . In 2005 , Eris , a dwarf planet in the scattered disc which is 27% more massive than Pluto , was discovered . This led the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) to define the term planet formally in 2006 , during their 26th General Assembly . That definition excluded Pluto and reclassified it as a dwarf planet . It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object directly orbiting the Sun . It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume but is less massive than Eris . Like other Kuiper belt objects , Pluto is primarily made of ice and rock and is relatively small - about one-sixth the mass of the Moon and one-third its volume . It has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit during which it ranges from 30 to 49 astronomical units or AU ( 4.4-7.4 billion km ) from the Sun . This means that Pluto periodically comes closer to the Sun than Neptune , but a stable orbital resonance with Neptune prevents them from colliding .",
  "/wiki/Plutonium": "Plutonium is a radioactive chemical element with the symbol Pu and atomic number 94 . It is an actinide metal of silvery-gray appearance that tarnishes when exposed to air , and forms a dull coating when oxidized . The element normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states . It reacts with carbon , halogens , nitrogen , silicon , and hydrogen . When exposed to moist air , it forms oxides and hydrides that can expand the sample up to 70% in volume , which in turn flake off as a powder that is pyrophoric . It is radioactive and can accumulate in bones , which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous . Plutonium was first produced and isolated on December 14 , 1940 , by a deuteron bombardment of uranium-238 in the 1.5 metre ( 60 in ) cyclotron at the University of California , Berkeley . First , neptunium-238 ( half-life 2.1 days ) was synthesized , which subsequently beta-decayed to form the new element with atomic number 94 and atomic weight 238 ( half-life 88 years ) . Since uranium had been named after the planet Uranus and neptunium after the planet Neptune , element 94 was named after Pluto , which at the time was considered to be a planet as well . Wartime secrecy prevented the University of California team from publishing its discovery until 1948 . Plutonium is the element with the highest atomic number to occur in nature . Trace quantities arise in natural uranium-238 deposits when uranium-238 captures neutrons emitted by decay of other uranium-238 atoms ."
