  "/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_Ukraine": "Ukraine is divided into several levels of territorial entities . On the first level there are 27 regions : 24 oblasts , one autonomous republic and two cities with special status . Following the 2014 Crimean crisis , Crimea and Sevastopol became de facto administrated by the Russian Federation , which claims them as the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol . Most states have not recognised them as being Russian territory . The administrative division in Ukraine was directly inherited ( grandfathered ) from the local republican administration of the Soviet Union , the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic , and has not changed significantly since the middle of the 20th century . It is somewhat complex , as beside having several levels of a territorial subdivision it also has a classification for various populated places , particularly cities .",
