  "/wiki/Intersectionality": "Intersectionality is a theoretical framework for understanding how aspects of one 's social and political identities ( e.g. , gender , race , class , sexuality , ability , etc . ) might combine to create unique modes of discrimination . It aims to broaden the agenda of the first waves of feminism , which largely focused on the experiences of white , middle class women . The broad agenda means that intersectionality is used to find combinations of injustices that are felt by members of society . For example , a black woman might face discrimination from a company that is not distinctly due to her race ( because the company does not discriminate against black men ) nor her gender ( because the company does not discriminate against white women ) , but by a unique combination of the two . Intersectional feminism aims to separate itself from white feminism by acknowledging the fact that all women have different experiences and identities . It is a qualitative analytic framework that identifies how interlocking systems of power affect those who are most marginalized in society . [ verification needed ] The term was coined by black feminist scholar Kimberl\u00e9 Williams Crenshaw in 1989 . There are various forms of social stratification such as class , race , sexual orientation , age , religion , creed , ability , and gender , which are included in the consideration of intersectional feminism and its social and cultural effects . The purpose of intersectionality as a theory is to identify how overlapping categories of identity impact individuals and institutions , and take these relationships into account when working to promote social and political equity . It ensures that feminism considers not only gender , but also combinations of various types of oppression that result in peoples experiences of injustice . While the theory began as an exploration of the oppression of women of color within society , today the analysis has expanded to include many more aspects of social identity .",

While it includes a wide range of interrelated historical processes and cultural phenomena ( from fashion to modern warfare ) , it can also refer to the subjective or existential experience of the conditions they produce , and their ongoing impact on human culture , institutions , and politics ( Berman 2010 , 15-36 ) . As an analytical concept and normative ideal , modernity is closely linked to the ethos of philosophical and aesthetic modernism ; political and intellectual currents that intersect with the Enlightenment ; and subsequent developments such as existentialism , modern art , the formal establishment of social science , and contemporaneous antithetical developments such as Marxism . It also encompasses the social relations associated with the rise of capitalism , and shifts in attitudes associated with secularisation and post-industrial life ( Berman 2010 , 15-36 ) . By the late 19th and 20th centuries , modernist art , politics , science and culture has come to dominate not only Western Europe and North America , but almost every civilized area on the globe , including movements thought of as opposed to the West and globalization . The modern era is closely associated with the development of individualism , capitalism , urbanization and a belief in the possibilities of technological and political progress . Wars and other perceived problems of this era , many of which come from the effects of rapid change , and the connected loss of strength of traditional religious and ethical norms , have led to many reactions against modern development .",

  "/wiki/Wahhabi_movement": "Wahhabism ( Arabic : \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0647\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0629 , al-Wahh\u0101biya ( h ) ) is an Islamic doctrine and religious movement founded by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab . [ a ] It has been variously described as ultraconservative , far-right austere , fundamentalist , or puritan ( ical ) ; as an Islamic reform movement to restore pure monotheistic worship ( tawhid ) by devotees ; and as a deviant sectarian movement , vile sect and a distortion of Islam by its detractors . The term Wahhabi ( sm ) is often used polemically and adherents commonly reject its use , preferring to be called Salafi or muwahhid , claiming to emphasize the principle of tawhid ( the uniqueness and unity of God ) or monotheism , dismissing other Muslims as practising shirk ( idolatry ) . It follows the theology of Ibn Taymiyyah and the Hanbali school of jurisprudence , although Hanbali leaders renounced ibn Abd al-Wahhab 's views . Wahhabism is named after an eighteenth-century preacher and activist , Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab ( 1703-1792 ) . He started a reform movement in the remote , sparsely populated region of Najd , advocating a purging of such widespread Sunni practices as the veneration of saints and the visiting of their tombs and shrines , that were practiced all over the Islamic world , but which he considered idolatrous impurities and innovations in Islam ( bid'ah ) . Eventually he formed a pact with a local leader , Muhammad bin Saud , offering political obedience and promising that protection and propagation of the Wahhabi movement meant power and glory and rule of lands and men . The alliance between followers of ibn Abd al-Wahhab and Muhammad bin Saud 's successors ( the House of Saud ) proved to be a durable one . The House of Saud continued to maintain its politico-religious alliance with the Wahhabi sect through the waxing and waning of its own political fortunes over the next 150 years , through to its eventual proclamation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932 , and then afterwards , on into modern times . Today Ibn Abd Al-Wahhab 's teachings are the official , state-sponsored form of Sunni Islam in Saudi Arabia . With the help of funding from Saudi petroleum exports ( and other factors ) , the movement underwent explosive growth beginning in the 1970s and now has worldwide influence . The US State Department has estimated that over the past four decades concerns in Riyadh have directed at least $ 10bn ( \u00a36bn ) to select charitable foundations toward the subversion of mainstream Sunni Islam by Wahhabism .",
  "/wiki/Sharia": "Sharia ( /\u0283\u0259\u02c8ri\u02d0\u0259/ , Arabic : \u0634\u0631\u064a\u0639\u0629 [ \u0283a\u02c8ri\u02d0\u0295ah ] ) , Islamic law or sharia law is a religious law forming part of the Islamic tradition . It is derived from the religious precepts of Islam , particularly the Quran and the hadith . In Arabic , the term shar\u012b\u02bfah refers to God 's immutable divine law and is contrasted with fiqh , which refers to its human scholarly interpretations . The manner of its application in modern times has been a subject of dispute between Muslim fundamentalists and modernists . Traditional theory of Islamic jurisprudence recognizes four sources of sharia : the Quran , sunnah ( authentic hadith ) , qiyas ( analogical reasoning ) , [ note 1 ] and ijma ( juridical consensus ) . Different legal schools - of which the most prominent are Hanafi , Maliki , Shafi ' i , Hanbali and Jafari - developed methodologies for deriving sharia rulings from scriptural sources using a process known as ijtihad . Traditional jurisprudence ( fiqh ) distinguishes two principal branches of law , \u02bfib\u0101d\u0101t ( rituals ) and mu\u02bf\u0101mal\u0101t ( social relations ) , which together comprise a wide range of topics . Its rulings are concerned with ethical standards as much as with legal norms , assigning actions to one of five categories : mandatory , recommended , neutral , abhorred , and prohibited . Thus , some areas of sharia overlap with the Western notion of law while others correspond more broadly to living life in accordance with Gods will . Classical jurisprudence was elaborated by private religious scholars , largely through legal opinions ( fatwas ) issued by qualified jurists ( muftis ) . It was historically applied in sharia courts by ruler-appointed judges , who dealt mainly with civil disputes and community affairs . Sultanic courts , the police and market inspectors administered criminal justice , which was influenced by sharia but not bound by its rules .",

  "/wiki/Gender_roles": "A gender role , also known as a sex role , is a social role encompassing a range of behaviors and attitudes that are generally considered acceptable , appropriate , or desirable for people based on their biological or perceived sex . Gender roles are usually centered on conceptions of masculinity and femininity , although there are exceptions and variations . The specifics regarding these gendered expectations may vary substantially among cultures , while other characteristics may be common throughout a range of cultures . There is ongoing debate as to what extent gender roles and their variations are biologically determined , and to what extent they are socially constructed . Various groups , most notably the feminist movements , have led efforts to change aspects of prevailing gender roles that they believe are oppressive or inaccurate . The term gender role was first used by John Money and colleagues in 1954 , during the course of his study of intersex individuals , to describe the manners in which these individuals expressed their status as a male or female in a situation where no clear biological assignment existed .",
