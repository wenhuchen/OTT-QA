It is one of the oldest cities in the world , and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions - Judaism , Christianity , and Islam . Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority claim Jerusalem as their capital , as Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there and the State of Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power ; however , neither claim is widely recognized internationally . [ note 3 ] During its long history , Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice , besieged 23 times , captured and recaptured 44 times , and attacked 52 times . The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE , in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds . Jerusalem was named as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets , probably meaning City of Shalem after a Canaanite deity , during the Canaanite period ( 14th century BCE ) . During the Israelite period , significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE ( Iron Age II ) , and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah . In 1538 , the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent . Today those walls define the Old City , which has been traditionally divided into four quarters - known since the early 19th century as the Armenian , Christian , Jewish , and Muslim Quarters . The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981 , and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger . Since 1860 Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City 's boundaries .

The main dispute revolves around the legal status of East Jerusalem and especially the Old City of Jerusalem , while broader agreement exists regarding future Israeli presence in West Jerusalem in accordance with Israel 's internationally recognised borders . The majority of United Nations ( UN ) member states hold the view that the final status of Jerusalem should be resolved through negotiation , and have therefore favored locating their embassies in Tel Aviv prior to a final status agreement . However , in the late 2010s , the international consensus to abstain from expressing a viewpoint on the city 's final status has shown signs of fragility , with Russia , the United States and Australia adopting new policy positions .

The economy is primarily tourist-driven , peaking during the Christmas season , when Christians make pilgrimage to the Church of the Nativity . Rachel 's Tomb , an important Jewish holy site , is located at the northern entrance of Bethlehem . The earliest known mention of Bethlehem was in the Amarna correspondence of 1350-1330 BCE when the town was inhabited by the Canaanites . The Hebrew Bible , which says that the city of Bethlehem was built up as a fortified city by Rehoboam , identifies it as the city David was from and where he was crowned as the king of Israel . The Gospels of Matthew and Luke identify Bethlehem as the birthplace of Jesus . Bethlehem was destroyed by the Emperor Hadrian during the second-century Bar Kokhba revolt ; its rebuilding was promoted by Empress Helena , mother of Constantine the Great , who commissioned the building of its great Church of the Nativity in 327 CE . The church was badly damaged by the Samaritans , who sacked it during a revolt in 529 , but was rebuilt a century later by Emperor Justinian I. Bethlehem became part of Jund Filastin following the Muslim conquest in 637 . Muslim rule continued in Bethlehem until its conquest in 1099 by a crusading army , who replaced the town 's Greek Orthodox clergy with a Latin one . In the mid-13th century , the Mamluks demolished the city 's walls , which were subsequently rebuilt under the Ottomans in the early 16th century .",

Inhabited since at least the 15th century BCE , Gaza has been dominated by several different peoples and empires throughout its history . The Philistines made it a part of their pentapolis after the Ancient Egyptians had ruled it for nearly 350 years . Under the Romans - in their pagan form as well as after the Christianisation of their empire , for which historians use the term Byzantine Empire - Gaza experienced relative peace and its port flourished . In 635 CE , it became the first city in Palestine to be conquered by the Muslim Rashidun army and quickly developed into a center of Islamic law . However , by the time the Crusaders invaded the country starting in 1099 , Gaza was in ruins . In later centuries , Gaza experienced several hardships - from Mongol raids to floods and locusts , reducing it to a village by the 16th century , when it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire . During the first half of Ottoman rule , the Ridwan dynasty controlled Gaza and under them the city went through an age of great commerce and peace . The municipality of Gaza was established in 1893 . Gaza fell to British forces during World War I , becoming a part of Mandatory Palestine . As a result of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War , Egypt administered the newly formed Gaza Strip territory and several improvements were undertaken in the city . Gaza was captured by Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967 , but in 1993 , the city was transferred to the newly-created Palestinian National Authority .",
