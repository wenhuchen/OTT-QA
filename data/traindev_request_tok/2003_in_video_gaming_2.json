  "/wiki/Big_Rigs:_Over_the_Road_Racing": "Big Rigs : Over the Road Racing is a racing video game developed by Stellar Stone and published by GameMill Publishing , released for Microsoft Windows on November 20 , 2003 , in North America . The packaging of Big Rigs states that the main objective of the game is to race a semi-trailer truck ( known colloquially as a big rig ) in order to safely deliver illegal cargo being carried by the vehicle , while avoiding the local police force . In the game itself , no objectives beyond reaching the finish line of a circular track are presented , no load is attached to the trucks , and the police are nowhere to be found . Much of the game instead centers on the player racing their truck against fellow drivers to the finish line ; however , in the earlier versions the player 's computer-controlled opponent vehicles have no AI and never move from the starting position . In a later version , the computer-controlled opponent will race around the track but will stop just before crossing the finish line . The timer in the game is merely aesthetic and has no limit on the gameplay . In addition , due to a lack of collision detection , there are no obstacles to navigate within the game , and the player is able to phase through buildings and terrain , or even leave the confines of the game level altogether . Big Rigs : Over the Road Racing was unanimously panned by critics . The game 's criticism was largely directed at its blatantly unfinished state : lack of collision detection and frequent violation of the laws of physics , frequent and major software bugs , poor visuals , and severe lack of functionality . As a result , the game is widely regarded by critics as one of the worst video games of all time , with some saying it is so bad it is good and calling bugs the game 's key feature . Because of the notorious negative reception , the game has attracted a cult following . After Stellar Stone shut down , Big Rigs producer and engine programmer , and owner of TS Group Entertainment , Sergey Titov , went on to work for Riot Games on League of Legends , before releasing the controversial title The War Z in 2012 .",
  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

  "/wiki/Activision": "Activision Publishing , Inc. is an American video game publisher based in Santa Monica , California . It currently serves as the publishing business for its parent company , Activision Blizzard , and consists of several subsidiary studios . Activision is one of the largest third-party video game publishers in the world and was the top United States publisher in 2016 . The company was founded as Activision , Inc. in October 1979 in Sunnyvale , California , by former Atari game developers , upset at how they were treated at Atari , to develop their own games for the popular Atari 2600 home video game console . Activision was the first independent , third-party , console video game developer . The 1983 video game crash , in part created by too many new companies trying to follow in Activision 's footsteps without the expertise of Activision 's founders , hurt Activision 's position in console games , forcing them to diversify into games for home computers , including the acquisition of Infocom . After a management shift , with CEO Jim Levy replaced by Bruce Davis , the company renamed itself as Mediagenic and branched out into business software applications . Mediagenic quickly fell into debt , and the company was bought for around US $ 500,000 by Bobby Kotick and a small group of investors around 1991 . Kotick instituted a full rework of the company to cover its debts : dismissing most of its staff , moving the company to Los Angeles , and reverting to the Activision name . Building on existing assets , the Kotick-led Activision pursued more publishing opportunities and , after recovering from the former debt , started acquiring numerous studios and intellectual properties over the 1990s and 2000s , among these being the Call of Duty and Guitar Hero series . A holding company was formed as Activision 's parent company to manage the internal and acquired studios . In 2008 , this holding merged with Vivendi Games ( the parent company of Blizzard Entertainment ) and formed Activision Blizzard , with Kotick as its CEO .",

  "/wiki/Xbox_(console)": "The Xbox is a home video game console and the first installment in the Xbox series of video game consoles manufactured by Microsoft . It was released as Microsoft 's first foray into the gaming console market on November 15 , 2001 , in North America , followed by Australia , Europe and Japan in 2002 . It is classified as a sixth generation console , competing with Sony 's PlayStation 2 and Nintendo 's GameCube . It was also the first major console produced by an American company since the Atari Jaguar ceased production in 1996 . Announced in 2000 , the Xbox was graphically powerful compared to its rivals , featuring a 733 MHz Intel Pentium III processor , a processor that could be found on a standard PC . It was also noted for its PC-like size and weight , and was the first console to feature a built-in hard disk . In November 2002 , Microsoft launched Xbox Live , a fee-based online gaming service that enabled subscribers to download new content and connect with other players through a broadband connection . Unlike online services from Sega and Sony , Xbox Live had support in the original console design through an integrated Ethernet port . The service gave Microsoft an early foothold in online gaming and would help the Xbox become a competitor in the sixth-generation of consoles . The popularity of blockbuster titles such as Bungie 's Halo 2 contributed to the popularity of online console gaming , and in particular first-person shooters . The Xbox had a record-breaking launch in North America , selling 1.5 million units before the end of 2001 , aided by the popularity of one of the system 's launch titles , Halo : Combat Evolved , which sold a million units by April 2002 . The system went on to sell a worldwide total of 24 million units , including 16 million in North America ; however , Microsoft was unable to make a steady profit off of the console , which had a manufacturing price far more expensive than its retail price , despite its popularity , losing over $ 4 billion during its market life .",
