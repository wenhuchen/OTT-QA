  "/wiki/Darwin_Awards": "The Darwin Awards are a tongue-in-cheek honor , originating in Usenet newsgroup discussions around 1985 . They recognize individuals who have supposedly contributed to human evolution by selecting themselves out of the gene pool via death or sterilization by their own actions . The project became more formalized with the creation of a website in 1993 , and followed up by a series of books starting in 2000 , authored by Wendy Northcutt . The criterion for the awards states , In the spirit of Charles Darwin , the Darwin Awards commemorate individuals who protect our gene pool by making the ultimate sacrifice of their own lives . Darwin Award winners eliminate themselves in an extraordinarily idiotic manner , thereby improving our species ' chances of long-term survival . Accidental self-sterilization also qualifies ; however , the site notes : Of necessity , the award is usually bestowed posthumously . The candidate is disqualified , though , if innocent bystanders , who might have contributed positively to the gene pool , are killed in the process . The logical problem presented by award winners who may have already reproduced is not addressed in the selection process due to the difficulty of ascertaining if a person has or does not have children . People who have somehow miraculously survived their suicidal idiocy can be given an Honorable Mention if their attempted act of self removal is deemed worthy ( and humorous ) , i.e . they tried their best . The Darwin Awards books state that an attempt is made to disallow known urban legends from the awards , but some older winners have been grandfathered to keep their awards . The Darwin Awards site does try to verify all submitted stories , but many similar sites , and the vast number of circulating Darwin awards emails , are largely fictional .",
  "/wiki/Charles_Darwin": "Charles Robert Darwin , FRS FRGS FLS FZS ( /\u02c8d\u0251\u02d0rw\u026an/ ; 12 February 1809 - 19 April 1882 ) was an English naturalist , geologist and biologist , best known for his contributions to the science of evolution . [ I ] His proposition that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors is now widely accepted , and considered a foundational concept in science . In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace , he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection , in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding . Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history , and he was honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey . Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species . By the 1870s , the scientific community and a majority of the educated public had accepted evolution as a fact . However , many favoured competing explanations which gave only a minor role to natural selection , and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution . Darwin 's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences , explaining the diversity of life . Darwin 's early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at the University of Edinburgh ; instead , he helped to investigate marine invertebrates . Studies at the University of Cambridge ( Christ 's College ) encouraged his passion for natural science . His five-year voyage on HMS Beagle established him as an eminent geologist whose observations and theories supported Charles Lyell 's conception of gradual geological change , and publication of his journal of the voyage made him famous as a popular author . Puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on the voyage , Darwin began detailed investigations , and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection .",

Fittingly , Wallace was one of the first recipients of the medal , in his case it was , exceptionally , in gold , rather than the silver version presented in the six other initial awards . However , in 2008 the Linnean Society announced that due to the continuing importance of evolutionary research , the medal will be awarded on an annual basis beginning in 2010 .",
  "/wiki/Alfred_Russel_Wallace": "Alfred Russel Wallace OM FRS ( 8 January 1823 - 7 November 1913 ) was a British naturalist , explorer , geographer , anthropologist , biologist and illustrator . He is best known for independently conceiving the theory of evolution through natural selection ; his paper on the subject was jointly published with some of Charles Darwin 's writings in 1858 . This prompted Darwin to publish his own ideas in On the Origin of Species . Like Darwin , Wallace did extensive fieldwork ; first in the Amazon River basin , and then in the Malay Archipelago , where he identified the faunal divide now termed the Wallace Line , which separates the Indonesian archipelago into two distinct parts : a western portion in which the animals are largely of Asian origin , and an eastern portion where the fauna reflect Australasia . He was considered the 19th century 's leading expert on the geographical distribution of animal species and is sometimes called the father of biogeography . Wallace was one of the leading evolutionary thinkers of the 19th century and made many other contributions to the development of evolutionary theory besides being co-discoverer of natural selection . These included the concept of warning colouration in animals , and the Wallace effect , a hypothesis on how natural selection could contribute to speciation by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation . Wallace 's 1904 book Man 's Place in the Universe was the first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate the likelihood of life on other planets . He was also one of the first scientists to write a serious exploration of the subject of whether there was life on Mars . Wallace was strongly attracted to unconventional ideas ( such as evolution ) . His advocacy of spiritualism and his belief in a non-material origin for the higher mental faculties of humans strained his relationship with some members of the scientific establishment . Aside from scientific work , he was a social activist who was critical of what he considered to be an unjust social and economic system ( capitalism ) in 19th-century Britain .",

He has been variously called the father of palaeontology , ichnology , and architecture , and is widely considered one of the greatest painters of all time ( despite perhaps only 15 of his paintings having survived ) . [ b ] Born out of wedlock to a notary , Piero da Vinci , and a peasant woman , Caterina , in Vinci , in the region of Florence , Italy , Leonardo was educated in the studio of the renowned Italian painter Andrea del Verrocchio . Much of his earlier working life was spent in the service of Ludovico il Moro in Milan , and he later worked in Rome , Bologna and Venice . He spent his last three years in France , where he died in 1519 . Leonardo is renowned primarily as a painter . The Mona Lisa is the most famous of his works and the most popular portrait ever made . The Last Supper is the most reproduced religious painting of all time and his Vitruvian Man drawing is regarded as a cultural icon as well . Salvator Mundi was sold for a world record $ 450.3 million at a Christie 's auction in New York , 15 November 2017 , the highest price ever paid for a work of art . Leonardo 's paintings and preparatory drawings - together with his notebooks , which contain sketches , scientific diagrams , and his thoughts on the nature of painting - compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary Michelangelo . Although he had no formal academic training , many historians and scholars regard Leonardo as the prime exemplar of the Universal Genius or Renaissance Man , an individual of unquenchable curiosity and feverishly inventive imagination .

Dirac made fundamental contributions to the early development of both quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics . Among other discoveries , he formulated the Dirac equation which describes the behaviour of fermions and predicted the existence of antimatter . Dirac shared the 1933 Nobel Prize in Physics with Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory . He also made significant contributions to the reconciliation of general relativity with quantum mechanics . Dirac was regarded by his friends and colleagues as unusual in character . In a 1926 letter to Paul Ehrenfest , Albert Einstein wrote of Dirac , This balancing on the dizzying path between genius and madness is awful . He was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge , a member of the Center for Theoretical Studies , University of Miami , and spent the last decade of his life at Florida State University .",
