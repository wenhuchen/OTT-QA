During the Early Middle Ages , he united the majority of western and central Europe . He was the first recognised emperor to rule from western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier . The expanded Frankish state that Charlemagne founded is called the Carolingian Empire . He was later canonised by Antipope Paschal III . Charlemagne was the eldest son of Pepin the Short and Bertrada of Laon , born before their canonical marriage . He became king in 768 following his father 's death , initially as co-ruler with his brother Carloman I. Carloman 's sudden death in December 771 under unexplained circumstances left Charlemagne the sole ruler of the Frankish Kingdom . He continued his father 's policy towards the papacy and became its protector , removing the Lombards from power in northern Italy and leading an incursion into Muslim Spain . He campaigned against the Saxons to his east , Christianising them upon penalty of death and leading to events such as the Massacre of Verden . He reached the height of his power in 800 when he was crowned Emperor of the Romans by Pope Leo III on Christmas Day at Old St. Peter 's Basilica in Rome . Charlemagne has been called the Father of Europe ( Pater Europae ) , as he united most of Western Europe for the first time since the classical era of the Roman Empire and united parts of Europe that had never been under Frankish or Roman rule . His rule spurred the Carolingian Renaissance , a period of energetic cultural and intellectual activity within the Western Church .",

For college football only , D-I schools are further divided into the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) , the Football Championship Subdivision ( FCS ) , and those institutions that do not have any football program . FBS teams have higher game attendance requirements and more players receiving athletic scholarships than FCS teams . The FBS is named for its series of postseason bowl games , with various polls ranking teams after the conclusion of these games , while the FCS national champion is determined by a multi-team bracket tournament . For the 2014-15 school year , Division I contained 345 of the NCAA 's 1,066 member institutions , with 125 in the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) , 125 in the Football Championship Subdivision ( FCS ) , and 95 non-football schools , with six additional schools in the transition from Division II to Division I . There was a moratorium on any additional movement up to D-I until 2012 , after which any school that wants to move to D-I must be accepted for membership by a conference and show the NCAA it has the financial ability to support a D-I program .",

Along with Georgy Flyorov and Andrei Sakharov , Kurchatov is known as the father of the Soviet atomic bomb and , later , the father of the Soviet Nuclear Missile for his directorial role in a clandestine Soviet nuclear program formed during World War II in the wake of the USSR 's discovery of the Western Allied efforts to develop nuclear weapons . After nine years of covert development , as well as Soviet spies successfully infiltrating the Manhattan Project , the Soviet Union successfully tested its first nuclear weapon , codenamed First Lightning at the Semipalatinsk Test Range in 1949 . In 1954 he was awarded the USSR State Prize in physics . From 1940 onward , Kurchatov worked on and contributed to the advancement of the nuclear weapons program , and later advocated for the peaceful development of nuclear technology . In 1950 , Kurchatov contributed in the development of the Hydrogen bomb with Andrei Sakharov who originated this development as Sakharov 's Third Idea . Other projects completed under Kurchatov included the installation and development of Soviet Union 's first particle accelerator , the Cyclotron ; inauguration and establishment in Obninsk of the Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant , the world 's first nuclear power plant ; and the completion and launching of the Lenin , the first nuclear-powered surface vessel , under his leadership , in 1959 .",
