He was also a historian and wrote Latin prose . In 60 BC , Caesar , Crassus and Pompey formed the First Triumvirate , a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years . Their attempts to amass power as Populares were opposed by the Optimates within the Roman Senate , among them Cato the Younger with the frequent support of Cicero . Caesar rose to become one of the most powerful politicians in the Roman Republic through a number of his accomplishments , notably his victories in the Gallic Wars , completed by 51 BC . During this time , Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both the English Channel and the Rhine River , when he built a bridge across the Rhine and crossed the Channel to invade Britain . Caesar 's wars extended Rome 's territory to Britain and past Gaul . These achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey , who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53 BC . With the Gallic Wars concluded , the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome . Leaving his command in Gaul meant losing his immunity from being charged as a criminal for waging unsanctioned wars . As a result , Caesar found himself with no other options but to cross the Rubicon with the 13th Legion in 49 BC , leaving his province and illegally entering Roman Italy under arms . This began Caesar 's civil war , and his victory in the war by 45 BC put him in an unrivaled position of power and influence .",

He is typically portrayed as a dashing masked vigilante who defends the commoners and indigenous peoples of California against corrupt and tyrannical officials and other villains . His signature all-black costume includes a cape , a hat known as a sombrero cordob\u00e9s , and a mask covering the upper half of his face . In the stories , Zorro has a high bounty on his head , but is too skilled and cunning for the bumbling authorities to catch , and he also delights in publicly humiliating them . Zorro is an acrobat and an expert in various weapons , but the one he employs most frequently is his rapier , which he uses often to carve the initial Z on his defeated foes , and other objects . He is also an accomplished rider , his trusty steed being a black horse called Tornado . Zorro is the secret identity of Don Diego de la Vega ( originally Don Diego Vega ) , a young man who is the only son of Don Alejandro de la Vega ( originally Don Alejandro Vega ) , the richest landowner in California , while Diego 's mother is dead . In most versions , Diego learned his swordsmanship while at university in Spain , and created his masked alter ego after he was unexpectedly summoned home by his father because California had fallen into the hands of an oppressive dictator . Diego is usually shown living with his father in a huge hacienda , which contains a number of secret passages and tunnels , leading to a secret cave that serves as headquarters for Zorro 's operations and as Tornado 's hiding place . In order to divert suspicion about his identity , Diego hides his fighting abilities while also pretending to be a coward and a fop . Zorro made his debut in the 1919 novel The Curse of Capistrano , originally meant as a stand-alone story . However , the success of the 1920 film adaptation The Mark of Zorro starring Douglas Fairbanks convinced McCulley to write more Zorro stories for about four decades : the character was featured in a total of five serialized stories and 57 short stories , the last one appearing in print posthumously in 1959 , the year after his death .",

He was subsequently exiled from Rome , and led troops of Rome 's enemy the Volsci to besiege Rome . In later ancient times , it was generally accepted by historians that Coriolanus was a real historical individual , and a consensus narrative story of his life appeared , retold by leading historians such as Livy , Plutarch , and Dionysius of Halicarnassus . More recent scholarship has cast doubt on the historicity of Coriolanus , with some portraying him as either a wholly legendary figure or at least disputing the accuracy of the conventional story of his life or the timing of the events . According to Plutarch , his ancestors included prominent patricians such as Censorinus and even an early King of Rome .

  "/wiki/Spaghetti_western": "Spaghetti Western , also known as Italian Western or Macaroni Western ( primarily in Japan ) , is a broad subgenre of Western films that emerged in the mid-1960s in the wake of Sergio Leone 's film-making style and international box-office success . The term was used by American critics and those in other countries because most of these Westerns were produced and directed by Italians . According to veteran Spaghetti Western actor Aldo Sambrell , the phrase Spaghetti Western was coined by Spanish journalist Alfonso S\u00e1nchez . The denomination for these films in Italy is western all'italiana ( Italian-style Western ) . Italo-Western is also used , especially in Germany . In addition , the term Paella Western has been used for the many Western films produced in Spain . The term Eurowesterns may be used to also include similar Western movies that were produced in Continental Europe but without involvement by Italians , like the West German Winnetou films or Ostern Westerns . The majority of the films in the Spaghetti Western genre were actually international co-productions between Italy and Spain , and sometimes France , West Germany , Portugal , Greece , Israel , Yugoslavia , or the United States . These movies were originally released in Italian or with Italian dubbing , but as most of the films featured multilingual casts and sound was post-synched , most western all'italiana do not have an official dominant language . The typical Spaghetti Western team was made up of an Italian director , Italo-Spanish technical staff , and a cast of Italian , Spanish , German , and American actors , sometimes a fading Hollywood star and sometimes a rising one like the young Clint Eastwood in three of Sergio Leone 's films . Over six hundred European Westerns were made between 1960 and 1978 . The best-known Spaghetti Westerns were directed by Sergio Leone and scored by Ennio Morricone , notably the three films of the Dollars Trilogy ( starring Clint Eastwood as the main character ) - A Fistful of Dollars ( 1964 ) , For a Few Dollars More ( 1965 ) and The Good , the Bad and the Ugly ( 1966 ) - as well as Once Upon a Time in the West ( 1968 , starring Charles Bronson ) .",

Many novels in the spy fiction genre have been adapted as films , including works by John Buchan , le Carr\u00e9 , Ian Fleming ( Bond ) and Len Deighton . It is a significant aspect of British cinema , with leading British directors such as Alfred Hitchcock and Carol Reed making notable contributions and many films set in the British Secret Service . Spy films show the espionage activities of government agents and their risk of being discovered by their enemies . From the Nazi espionage thrillers of the 1940s to the James Bond films of the 1960s and to the high-tech blockbusters of today , the spy film has always been popular with audiences worldwide . Offering a combination of exciting escapism , technological thrills , and exotic locales , many spy films combine the action and science fiction genres , presenting clearly delineated heroes for audiences to root for and villains for them to hate . They may also involve elements of political thrillers . However , there are many that are comedic ( mostly action comedies if they fall under that genre ) . James Bond is the most famous of film spies , but there were also more serious , probing works like le Carr\u00e9 's The Spy Who Came in from the Cold which also emerged from the Cold War .

  "/wiki/Eurospy_film": "Eurospy film , or Spaghetti spy film ( when referring to Italian-produced films in the genre ) , is a genre of spy films produced in Europe , especially in Italy , France , and Spain , that either sincerely imitated or else parodied the British James Bond spy series feature films . The first wave of Eurospy films were released in 1964 , two years after the first James Bond film , Dr. No , and in the same year as the premiere of what many consider to be the apotheosis of the Bond series , Goldfinger . For the most part , the Eurospy craze lasted until around 1967 or 1968 . In Italy , where most of these films were produced , this trend replaced the declining sword and sandal genre . Christopher Frayling , who estimated the number of Eurospy films at 50 , felt that they passed on such traits to the Spaghetti Western as emphasis on the technology of death , such as special weapons , the anonymity of the protagonist , the money = power equation of the villains and humorous asides that released the audience 's laughter after a violent sequence . For additional verisimilitude , these films often featured American and British stars in the lead roles . The heroes of the films were secret agents who were often given a name similar to James Bond ( including Charles Bind , Charles Vine and James Tont , where Tont is a pun on tonto which is Italian for dumb , stupid ) , and/or a code name matching , or similar to , James Bond 's 007 . Other Eurospy films made use of existing literary fictional spies , including Bulldog Drummond , Harry Palmer , Hubert Bonisseur de La Bath , AKA OSS 117 ( who was not based on James Bond but rather had helped to inspire James Bond ) , Francis Coplan and Rolf Torring ."
