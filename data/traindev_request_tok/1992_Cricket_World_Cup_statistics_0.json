The country has two main landmasses - the North Island ( Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui ) , and the South Island ( Te Waipounamu ) - and around 600 smaller islands . It has a total land area of 268,000 square kilometres ( 103,500 sq mi ) . New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 mi ) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres ( 600 mi ) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal , fungal , and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , and its most populous city is Auckland . Sometime between 1250 and 1300 , Polynesians settled in the islands and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture . In 1642 , Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight New Zealand . In 1840 , representatives of the United Kingdom and M\u0101ori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi , which declared British sovereignty over the islands . In 1841 , New Zealand became a colony within the British Empire and in 1907 it became a dominion ; it gained full statutory independence in 1947 and the British monarch remained the head of state .",

In terms of population Ballarat is the third largest inland city in Australia . Just months after Victoria was granted separation from the state of New South Wales , the Victorian gold rush transformed Ballarat from a small sheep station to a major settlement . Gold was discovered on 18 August 1851 , and news quickly spread of rich alluvial fields where gold could easily be extracted . Unlike many other gold boom towns , the Ballarat fields experienced sustained high gold yields for many decades , which can be evidenced to this day in the city 's rich architecture . The city is famous for the 1854 tax-revolt known as the Eureka Rebellion . In response to this event the first male suffrage in Australia was instituted and as such Eureka is interpreted by some as the origin of democracy in Australia . The rebellion 's symbol , the Eureka Flag , has become a national symbol and is held at the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka in Ballarat . Proclaimed a city in 1871 , its prosperity continued until late in the 19th century , after which its importance relative to both Melbourne and Geelong rapidly faded with the slowing of gold extraction . It has endured as a major regional centre hosting the rowing and kayaking events from the 1956 Summer Olympics .

  "/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)": "Victoria ( abbreviated as Vic ) is a state in south-eastern Australia . Victoria is Australia 's smallest mainland state and its second-most populous state ( after New South Wales ) , making it the most densely populated state . Most of its population lives concentrated in the area surrounding Port Phillip Bay , which includes the metropolitan area of its state capital and largest city , Melbourne , Australia 's second-largest city . Victoria is bordered by Bass Strait and Tasmania to the south , [ note 1 ] New South Wales to the north , the Tasman Sea ( a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean ) to the east , and South Australia to the west . The area that is now known as Victoria is the home of many Aboriginal people groups , including the Boon wurrung , the Bratauolung , the Djadjawurrung , the Gunai/Kurnai , the Gunditjmara , the Taungurong , the Wathaurong , the Wurundjeri , and the Yorta Yorta . There were more than 30 Aboriginal languages spoken in the area prior to the European settlement of Australia . The Kulin nation is an alliance of five Aboriginal nations which makes up much of the central part of the state . With Great Britain having claimed the half of the Australian continent that is east of the 135th meridian east in 1788 , Victoria formed part of the wider colony of New South Wales . The first European settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay , and much of what is now Victoria was included in 1836 in the Port Phillip District , an administrative division of New South Wales . Named in honour of Queen Victoria , who signed the division 's separation from New South Wales , the colony was officially established in 1851 and achieved self government in 1855 . The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony , and by the time of the Federation of Australia in 1901 , Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in Australasia . Melbourne served as federal capital of Australia until the construction of Canberra in 1927 , with the Federal Parliament meeting in Melbourne 's Parliament House and all principal offices of the federal government being based in Melbourne .",

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories .

The city is located in the state 's south-east on the estuary of the River Derwent , making it the most southern of Australia 's capital cities . Its skyline is dominated by the 1,271-metre ( 4,170 ft ) Mount Wellington , and its harbour forms the second-deepest natural port in the world , with much of the city 's waterfront consisting of reclaimed land . The metropolitan area is often referred to as Greater Hobart , to differentiate it from the City of Hobart , one of the five local government areas that cover the city . Founded in 1804 as a British penal colony , Hobart is Australia 's second oldest capital city after Sydney , New South Wales . Prior to British settlement , the Hobart area had been occupied for possibly as long as 35,000 years , by the semi-nomadic Mouheneener tribe , a sub-group of the Nuennone , or South-East tribe . The descendants of these Aboriginal Tasmanians often refer to themselves as 'Palawa ' . Since its foundation , the city has expanded from the mouth of Sullivans Cove in a generally north-south direction along both banks of the River Derwent , from 22 km inland from the estuary at Storm Bay to the point where the river reverts to fresh water at Bridgewater . Penal transportation ended in the 1850s , after which the city experienced periods of growth and decline . The early 20th century saw an economic boom on the back of mining , agriculture and other primary industries , and the loss of men who served in the world wars was counteracted by an influx of immigration .

The conflict , which peaked between 1825 and 1831 , and led to more than three years of martial law , cost the lives of almost 1,100 Aboriginals and settlers .",

India 's national cricket team did not play its first Test match until 25 June 1932 at Lord 's , becoming the sixth team to be granted test cricket status . From 1932 India had to wait until 1952 , almost 20 years for its first Test victory . In its first fifty years of international cricket , India was one of the weaker teams , winning only 35 of the first 196 Test matches it played . The team , however , gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of players such as batsmen Gavaskar , Viswanath , Kapil Dev , and the Indian spin quartet . Traditionally much stronger at home than abroad , the Indian team has improved its overseas form , especially in limited-overs cricket , since the start of the 21st century , winning Test matches in Australia , England and South Africa . It has won the Cricket World Cup twice - in 1983 under the captaincy of Kapil Dev and in 2011 under the captaincy of Mahendra Singh Dhoni . After winning the 2011 World Cup , India became only the third team after West Indies and Australia to have won the World Cup more than once , and the first cricket team to win the World Cup at home .

South Africa is a full member of the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) with Test , One-Day International ( ODI ) and Twenty20 International ( T20I ) status . South Africa entered first-class and international cricket at the same time when they hosted an England cricket team in the 1888-89 season . At first , the team was no match for Australia or England but , having gained in experience and expertise , they were able to field a competitive team in the first decade of the 20th century . The team regularly played against Australia , England and New Zealand through to the 1960s , by which time there was considerable opposition to the country 's apartheid policy and an international ban was imposed by the ICC , commensurate with actions taken by other global sporting bodies . When the ban was imposed , South Africa had developed to a point where its team including Eddie Barlow , Graeme Pollock and Mike Procter was arguably the best in the world and had just outplayed Australia . The ban remained in place until 1991 and South Africa could then play against India , Pakistan , Sri Lanka and the West Indies for the first time . The team since reinstatement has mostly been strong and has at times held number one positions in international rankings ( had best ranking of No.1 in all three formats ) but has lacked success in ICC organised tournaments . Outstanding players since reinstatement have included Allan Donald , Makhaya Ntini , Shaun Pollock , Jacques Kallis , Graeme Smith , Kagiso Rabada , AB de Villiers , Dale Steyn , Herschelle Gibbs , Faf du Plessis , Morne Morkel , Imran Tahir and Hashim Amla .",
