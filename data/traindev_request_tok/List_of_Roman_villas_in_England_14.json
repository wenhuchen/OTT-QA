  "/wiki/Ordnance_Survey_National_Grid": "The Ordnance Survey National Grid reference system is a system of geographic grid references used in Great Britain , distinct from latitude and longitude . It is often called British National Grid ( BNG ) . The Ordnance Survey ( OS ) devised the national grid reference system , and it is heavily used in their survey data , and in maps based on those surveys , whether published by the Ordnance Survey or by commercial map producers . Grid references are also commonly quoted in other publications and data sources , such as guide books and government planning documents . A number of different systems exist that can provide grid references for locations within the British Isles : this article describes the system created solely for Great Britain and its outlying islands ( including the Isle of Man ) ; the Irish grid reference system was a similar system created by the Ordnance Survey of Ireland and the Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland for the island of Ireland . The Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system ( UTM ) is used to provide grid references for worldwide locations , and this is the system commonly used for the Channel Islands and Ireland ( since 2001 ) . European-wide agencies also use UTM when mapping locations , or may use the Military Grid Reference System ( MGRS ) system , or variants of it . OSGB uses Orthorectified images of many temporal resolution for one area .",
  "/wiki/English_Heritage": "English Heritage ( officially the English Heritage Trust ) is a charity that manages over 400 historic monuments , buildings and places . These include prehistoric sites , medieval castles , Roman forts and country houses . The charity states that it uses these properties to bring the story of England to life for over 10 million people each year . Within its portfolio are Stonehenge , Dover Castle , Tintagel Castle and the best preserved parts of Hadrian 's Wall . English Heritage also manages the London Blue Plaque scheme , which links influential historical figures to particular buildings . When originally formed in 1983 , English Heritage was the operating name of an executive non-departmental public body of the British Government , officially titled the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England , that ran the national system of heritage protection and managed a range of historic properties . It was created to combine the roles of existing bodies that had emerged from a long period of state involvement in heritage protection . In 1999 the organisation merged with the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England and the National Monuments Record , bringing together resources for the identification and survey of England 's historic environment . On 1 April 2015 , English Heritage was divided into two parts : Historic England , which inherited the statutory and protection functions of the old organisation , and the new English Heritage Trust , a charity that would operate the historic properties , and which took on the English Heritage operating name and logo . The British government gave the new charity an \u00a380 million grant to help establish it as an independent trust , although the historic properties remained in the ownership of the state .",

  "/wiki/Welwyn_Roman_Baths": "The Welwyn Roman Baths are a Roman ruin preserved under the A1 ( M ) just north of modern-day Welwyn Garden City , Hertfordshire , England . The baths were a small part of the Dicket Mead villa , which was originally built in the 3rd century AD . The village of Welwyn has been described as being the site of a Romano-British settlement , where a Roman road crossed the river Mimram . There was another Roman villa near Welwyn on the Lockleys estate . The full extent of the Dicket Mead villa was never fully excavated prior to the construction of the motorway , but the baths were only one of at least four buildings in total . The complex was probably part of a farm . It has been speculated that it might have been at least in part the equivalent of a hotel , lying as it does near Roman roads . The ruins were uncovered in 1960 by local archaeologist Tony Rook , and the baths were gradually uncovered over the following 10 years by excavation . Shortly after the excavation was completed , the Ministry of Transport announced the route of a new motorway , straight over the top of the excavation . Eventually arrangements were made whereby a steel vault would be built over the top of the baths with an access tunnel for the public . Once the vault was completed the motorway was built over the top of it , and the remains of the baths sit 9 metres below junction 6 . Only about half of the original extent of the baths is now on display .",

When saying where they live , locals will often be asked , Welwyn or Welwyn Garden City ? , as the latter 's title is often shortened to simply Welwyn . To avoid confusion , there were plans to change Welwyns name to Welwyn Minster in 1990 but this met with local resistance and the idea was abandoned .",
