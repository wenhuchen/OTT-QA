  "/wiki/The_Smashing_Pumpkins": "The Smashing Pumpkins ( or Smashing Pumpkins ) [ note 1 ] are an American alternative rock band from Chicago , Illinois . Formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan ( lead vocals , guitar ) , D'arcy Wretzky ( bass ) , James Iha ( guitar ) , and Jimmy Chamberlin ( drums ) , the band has undergone many line-up changes . The current lineup features Corgan , Chamberlin , Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder . Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries , they have a diverse , densely layered , and guitar-heavy sound , containing elements of gothic rock , heavy metal , dream pop , psychedelic rock , progressive rock , shoegazing , and electronica in later recordings . Corgan is the group 's primary songwriter ; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band 's albums and songs , which have been described as anguished , bruised reports from Billy Corgan 's nightmare-land . The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album , 1993 's Siamese Dream . The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up , the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness , debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart . With 30 million albums sold worldwide , the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s . However , internal fighting , drug use , and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up . In 2006 , Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album , Zeitgeist . After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder , Chamberlin left the band in early 2009 . Later that year , Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope , which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles , compilation EP releases , and two full albums that also fell under the project 's scope - Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014 .",

  "/wiki/Jeff_Buckley": "Jeffrey Scott Buckley ( November 17 , 1966 - May 29 , 1997 ) , raised as Scott Moorhead , was an American singer , songwriter and guitarist . After a decade as a session guitarist in Los Angeles , Buckley amassed a following in the early 1990s by playing cover songs at venues in Manhattan 's East Village such as Sin-\u00e9 , gradually focusing more on his own material . After rebuffing much interest from record labels and his father 's manager , Herb Cohen , he signed with Columbia , recruited a band , and recorded what would be his only studio album , Grace , in 1994 . Over the following three years , the band toured extensively to promote the album , including concerts in the U.S. , Europe , Japan , and Australia . In 1996 , they stopped touring and made sporadic attempts to record Buckley 's second album in New York City with Tom Verlaine as producer . In 1997 , Buckley moved to Memphis , Tennessee , to resume work on the album , to be titled My Sweetheart the Drunk , recording many four-track demos while also playing weekly solo shows at a local venue . On May 29 , 1997 , while awaiting the arrival of his band from New York , he drowned during a spontaneous evening swim , fully clothed , in the Mississippi River when he was caught in the wake of a passing boat ; his body was found on June 4 . Since his death , there have been many posthumous releases of his material , including a collection of four-track demos and studio recordings for his unfinished second album My Sweetheart the Drunk , expansions of Grace , and the Live at Sin-\u00e9 EP . Chart success also came posthumously : with his cover of Leonard Cohen 's song Hallelujah he attained his first number one on Billboard 's Hot Digital Songs in March 2008 and reached number 2 in the UK Singles Chart that December . Buckley and his work remain popular and are regularly featured in greatest lists in the music press ; in 2004 , Rolling Stone listed him at number 39 on their list of greatest singers of all time ."
