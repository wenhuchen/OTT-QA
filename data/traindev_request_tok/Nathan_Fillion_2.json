  "/wiki/Nathan_Drake_(character)": "Nathan Nate Drake ( born Nathan Morgan ) is the protagonist of the Uncharted video game series , developed by Naughty Dog . He appears in all mainline games : Uncharted : Drake 's Fortune , Uncharted 2 : Among Thieves , Uncharted 3 : Drake 's Deception , and Uncharted 4 : A Thief 's End , the spinoffs Uncharted : Golden Abyss and Uncharted : Fight for Fortune , the motion comic prequel series Uncharted : Eye of Indra by DC Comics , and other related media . A charismatic yet rebellious treasure hunter , the player controls Drake as he journeys across the world to uncover various historical mysteries . He is played through voice and motion capture by Nolan North , who influenced Drake 's personality by ad-libbing segments of the character 's dialogue . Naughty Dog based Drake 's appearance and personality on daredevil Johnny Knoxville , actor Harrison Ford , and the heroes of pulp magazines , novels and films . To make him relatable , the character was dressed in jeans and a Henley long sleeve , and given an everyman persona ; he is strong-willed , and often jokes and quips . The designers focused on giving him realistic reactions to his environment ; for example , he stumbles while running , barely clears objects during leaps , and recognizes the absurdity of the situations in which he finds himself . The design and personality of Drake have drawn comparisons to other video game and film characters , such as Lara Croft and Indiana Jones . Many reviewers have called Drake a likable and believable character , and have noted that he is a rare example of a physically attractive character who is not hypermasculine ."
