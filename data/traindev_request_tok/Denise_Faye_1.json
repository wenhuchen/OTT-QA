  "/wiki/The_Winter's_Tale": "The Winter 's Tale is a play by William Shakespeare originally published in the First Folio of 1623 . Although it was grouped among the comedies , many modern editors have relabelled the play as one of Shakespeare 's late romances . Some critics consider it to be one of Shakespeare 's problem plays because the first three acts are filled with intense psychological drama , while the last two acts are comedic and supply a happy ending . The play has been intermittently popular , revived in productions in various forms and adaptations by some of the leading theatre practitioners in Shakespearean performance history , beginning after a long interval with David Garrick in his adaptation Florizel and Perdita ( first performed in 1753 and published in 1756 ) . The Winter 's Tale was revived again in the 19th century , when the fourth pastoral act was widely popular . In the second half of the 20th century , The Winter 's Tale in its entirety , and drawn largely from the First Folio text , was often performed , with varying degrees of success .",

  "/wiki/Richard_III_(play)": "Richard III is a historical play by William Shakespeare believed to have been written around 1593 . It depicts the Machiavellian rise to power and subsequent short reign of King Richard III of England . The play is grouped among the histories in the First Folio and is most often classified as such . Occasionally , however , as in the quarto edition , it is termed a tragedy . Richard III concludes Shakespeare 's first tetralogy ( also containing Henry VI parts 1-3 ) . It is the second longest play in the Shakespearean canon after Hamlet and is the longest of the First Folio , whose version of Hamlet is shorter than its Quarto counterpart . The play is often abridged ; for example , certain peripheral characters are removed entirely . In such instances , extra lines are often invented or added from elsewhere in the sequence to establish the nature of characters ' relationships . A further reason for abridgment is that Shakespeare assumed that his audiences would be familiar with his Henry VI plays and frequently made indirect references to events in them , such as Richard 's murder of Henry VI or the defeat of Henry 's wife , Margaret .",
  "/wiki/Marquis_Theatre": "The Marquis Theatre is a Broadway theatre located on the third floor of the New York Marriott Marquis at 210 W. 46th Street in midtown-Manhattan . The Marquis opened July 9 , 1986 , with a series of concerts by Shirley Bassey . The 1611-seat venue was designed by developer/architect John C. Portman , Jr. Because construction of the hotel involved the demolition of five theaters - the original Helen Hayes , the Morosco , the Bijou , and remnants of the Astor and the Gaiety - New York City officials permitted Portman to construct the new property only if he agreed to include a theater within the structure . It presently is one of nine operated by the Nederlander Organization . In the 2006 production of The Drowsy Chaperone , the Man In Chair remarks that the show within the show originally played the Morosco theatre , but they tore it down and put up a hotel , which earned an enormous laugh from theatre buffs in the audience .
