  "/wiki/West_Branch_Susquehanna_River": "The West Branch Susquehanna River is one of the two principal branches , along with the North Branch , of the Susquehanna River in the northeastern United States . The North Branch , which rises in upstate New York , is generally regarded as the extension of the main branch , with the shorter West Branch being its principal tributary . The West Branch , which is 243 miles ( 391 km ) long , is entirely within the state of Pennsylvania , draining a large mountainous area within the Allegheny Plateau in the western part of the state . Along most of its course it meanders along mountain ridges and through water gaps , forming a large zigzag arc through central Pennsylvania around the north end of the Allegheny Ridge . In colonial times the river provided an important water route to the Ohio River valley . In the 18th century , its lower valley became a significant industrial heartland of Pennsylvania . In the 20th century , the upper reaches of the West Branch turned a yellow/orange color due to sulfurous drainage from nearby and abandoned deep bituminous coal mines . [ citation needed ]",

At 444 miles ( 715 km ) long , it is the longest river on the East Coast of the United States that drains into the Chesapeake Bay . With its watershed , it is the 16th-largest river in the United States , and the longest river in the early 21st-century continental United States without commercial boat traffic . The Susquehanna River forms from two main branches : the North Branch , which rises in Cooperstown , New York , and is regarded by federal mapmakers as the main branch or headwaters , and the West Branch , which rises in western Pennsylvania and joins the main branch near Northumberland in central Pennsylvania . The river drains 27,500 square miles ( 71,000 km2 ) , including nearly half of the land area of Pennsylvania . The drainage basin ( watershed ) includes portions of the Allegheny Plateau region of the Appalachian Mountains , cutting through a succession of water gaps in a broad zigzag course to flow across the rural heartland of southeastern Pennsylvania and northeastern Maryland in the lateral near-parallel array of mountain ridges . The river empties into the northern end of the Chesapeake Bay at Perryville and Havre de Grace , Maryland , providing half of the Bay 's freshwater inflow .
