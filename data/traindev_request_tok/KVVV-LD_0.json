  "/wiki/480i": "480i is a shorthand name for the video mode used for standard-definition analog or digital television in Caribbean , Myanmar , Japan , South Korea , Taiwan , Philippines , Laos , Western Sahara , and most of the Americas ( with the exception of Argentina , Paraguay and Uruguay ) . The 480 identifies a vertical resolution of 480 lines , and the i identifies it as an interlaced resolution . The field rate , which is 60 Hz ( or 59.94 Hz when used with NTSC color ) , is sometimes included when identifying the video mode , i.e . 480i60 ; another notation , endorsed by both the International Telecommunication Union in BT.601 and SMPTE in SMPTE 259M , includes the frame rate , as in 480i/30 . The other common standard , used in the other parts of the world , is 576i . In analogue contexts , this resolution is often called 525 lines . It is mandated by CCIR Systems M and J , which are usually paired with NTSC color - which led to the NTSC name being often inaccurately used to refer to this video mode . Other color encodings have also been used with System M , notably PAL-M in Brazil .",
