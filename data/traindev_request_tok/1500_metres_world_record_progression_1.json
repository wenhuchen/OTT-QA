Nurmi set 22 official world records at distances between 1500 metres and 20 kilometres , and won nine gold and three silver medals in his twelve events in the Olympic Games . At his peak , Nurmi was undefeated for 121 races at distances from 800 m upwards . Throughout his 14-year career , he remained unbeaten in cross country events and the 10,000 m. Born into a working-class family , Nurmi left school at the age of twelve to provide for his family . In 1912 , he was inspired by the Olympic feats of Hannes Kolehmainen and began developing a strict training program . Nurmi started to flourish during his military service , setting national records en route to his international debut at the 1920 Summer Olympics . After winning a silver medal in the 5000 m , he took gold in the 10,000 m and the cross country events . In 1923 , Nurmi became the first runner to hold simultaneous world records in the mile , the 5000 m and the 10,000 m races , a feat which has never since been repeated . He set new world records for the 1500 m and the 5000 m with just an hour between the races , and took gold medals in both distances in less than two hours at the 1924 Olympics . Seemingly unaffected by the Paris heat wave , Nurmi won all his races and returned home with five gold medals , although he was frustrated that Finnish officials had refused to enter him for the 10,000 m. Struggling with injuries and motivation issues after his exhaustive U.S. tour in 1925 , Nurmi found his long-time rivals Ville Ritola and Edvin Wide ever more serious challengers .

The region was originally called Suomi ( Finland ) , which later became the name for the whole country . Turku , as a town , was never founded . The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city . As the oldest town in the country Turku was the most important city in Finland , a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden . After the war Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire ( 1809 ) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki ( 1812 ) . It was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku ( Turun Akatemia ) founded in 1640 , which then became the University of Helsinki . Turku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s , and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port . Because of its long history , it has been the site of many important events , and has extensively influenced Finnish history . The history of the country is closely linked to Turku , the former capital . Along with Tallinn , the capital city of Estonia , Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011 . In 1996 , it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland .",

It constitutes both a county and a municipality . During the Viking Age the area was part of Viken , the northernmost Danish province . Oslo was founded as a city at the end of the Viking Age in the year 1040 under the name \u00c1nslo , and established as a kaupstad or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada . The city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300 . Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 reduced its influence . After being destroyed by a fire in 1624 , during the reign of King Christian IV , a new city was built closer to Akershus Fortress and named Christiania in the king 's honour . It was established as a municipality ( formannskapsdistrikt ) on 1 January 1838 . The city functioned as the capital of Norway during the 1814-1905 union between Sweden and Norway . From 1877 , the city 's name was spelled Kristiania in government usage , a spelling that was adopted by the municipal authorities only in 1897 . In 1925 the city , after incorporating the village retaining its former name , was renamed Oslo . In 1948 Oslo merged with Aker , a municipality which surrounded the capital and which was 27 times larger , thus creating the modern , vastly enlarged Oslo municipality .",
  "/wiki/Gunnar_Nielsen_(athlete)": "Niels Gunnar Nielsen ( 25 March 1928 - 29 May 1985 ) was a Danish middle distance runner who equalled the world record over both 880 yards and 1500 metres . He represented the \u00d8sterbro-based club K\u00f8benhavns Idr\u00e6ts Forening throughout his career . Nielsen participated in three major championships - two Olympic Games and one European Championships . He made his international breakthrough at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki , where he finished fourth in the 800 metres - finishing with exactly the same time , 1:49.7 , as the bronze medal winner , Heinz Ulzheimer . At the 1954 European Championships in Bern , Nielsen set a new Danish record of 3:44.4 in the final of the 1500 metres , in which he finished second behind Roger Bannister . Nielsen was Denmark 's greatest male athlete during the 1950s and his ability to draw large crowds meant that he was much in demand by his country 's promoters . His hectic schedule eventually took its toll on his health , and , with his times strongly affected by illness and exhaustion , Nielsen announced in September 1956 that he would retire after the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne . Though he won his 800 metres heat in a time of 1:51.2 , Nielsen chose not to run the semi-final and instead chose to focus on the 1500 metres . In what proved to be the final race of his career , Nielsen finished the 1500 metres final in tenth place , over four seconds behind the winner , Ronnie Delany . Following his athletic career Nielsen worked as a typographer for Det Berlingske Officin ."
