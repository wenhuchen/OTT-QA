His name may be translated as Earth Treasury , Earth Store , Earth Matrix , or Earth Womb . K\u1e63itigarbha is known for his vow to take responsibility for the instruction of all beings in the six worlds between the death of Gautama Buddha and the rise of Maitreya , as well as his vow not to achieve Buddhahood until all hells are emptied . He is therefore often regarded as the bodhisattva of hell-beings , as well as the guardian of children and patron deity of deceased children and aborted fetuses in Japanese culture , where he is known as Jiz\u014d or Ojiz\u014d-sama . Usually depicted as a monk with a halo around his shaved head , he carries a staff to force open the gates of hell and a wish-fulfilling jewel to light up the darkness .",

  "/wiki/Tao_Yuanming": "Tao Yuanming ( 365 ? -427 ) , also known as Tao Qian ( Hanyu Pinyin ) or T'ao Ch'ien ( Wade-Giles ) , was a Chinese poet who lived during the Eastern Jin ( 317-420 ) and Liu Song ( 420-479 ) dynasties . He is considered to be one of the greatest poets of the Six dynasties period . Tao Yuanming spent most of his life in reclusion , living in a small house in the countryside , reading , drinking wine , receiving the occasional guest , and writing poems in which he often reflected on the pleasures and difficulties of life in the countryside , as well as his decision to withdraw from civil service . His simple , direct , and unmannered style was at odds with the norms for literary writing in his time . Some say that although he was relatively well-known as a recluse poet in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) , it was not until the Northern Song dynasty ( 960-1127 ) , when influential literati figures such as Su Shi ( 1037-1101 ) declared him a paragon of authenticity and spontaneity in poetry , that Tao Yuanming would achieve lasting literary fame . However , Tao Yuanming 's inclusion in the 6th century Wen Xuan would argue for lasting fame beginning somewhat earlier . Tao Yuanming , or Tao Qian , is also regarded as the foremost representative of what would latter be known as Fields and Gardens poetry , a style of landscape poetry that found inspiration in the beauty and serenity of the natural world close at hand .",

The incident has since become legendary . The story tells of a group of samurai who were left leaderless after their daimy\u014d ( feudal lord ) Asano Naganori was compelled to perform seppuku ( ritual suicide ) for assaulting a court official named Kira Yoshinaka , whose title was K\u014dzuke no suke . After waiting and planning for a year , the r\u014dnin avenged their master 's honor by killing Kira . They were then themselves obliged to commit seppuku for the crime of murder . This true story was popularized in Japanese culture as emblematic of the loyalty , sacrifice , persistence , and honor that people should preserve in their daily lives . The popularity of the tale grew during the Meiji era , in which Japan underwent rapid modernization , and the legend became entrenched within discourses of national heritage and identity . Fictionalized accounts of the tale of the forty-seven r\u014dnin are known as Ch\u016bshingura . The story was popularized in numerous plays , including in the genres of bunraku and kabuki . Because of the censorship laws of the shogunate in the Genroku era , which forbade portrayal of current events , the names were changed . While the version given by the playwrights may have come to be accepted as historical fact by some , [ who ? ] the first Ch\u016bshingura was written some 50 years after the event , and numerous historical records about the actual events that predate the Ch\u016bshingura survive .",
