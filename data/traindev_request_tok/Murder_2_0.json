  "/wiki/Atheist": "Atheism is , in the broadest sense , an absence of belief in the existence of deities . Less broadly , atheism is a rejection of the belief that any deities exist . In an even narrower sense , atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities . Atheism is contrasted with theism , which , in its most general form , is the belief that at least one deity exists . The etymological root for the word atheism originated before the 5th century BCE from the ancient Greek \u1f04\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2 ( atheos ) , meaning without god ( s ) . In antiquity , it had multiple uses as a pejorative term applied to those thought to reject the gods worshiped by the larger society , those who were forsaken by the gods , or those who had no commitment to belief in the gods . The term denoted a social category created by orthodox religionists into which those who did not share their religious beliefs were placed . The actual term atheism emerged first in the 16th century . With the spread of freethought , skeptical inquiry , and subsequent increase in criticism of religion , application of the term narrowed in scope . The first individuals to identify themselves using the word atheist lived in the 18th century during the Age of Enlightenment . The French Revolution , noted for its unprecedented atheism , witnessed the first major political movement in history to advocate for the supremacy of human reason . Arguments for atheism range from philosophical to social and historical approaches .",
  "/wiki/Casual_relationship": "Casual dating or a casual relationship is a physical and emotional relationship between two people who may have casual sex or a near-sexual relationship without necessarily demanding or expecting the extra commitments of a more formal romantic relationship . Motives for casual relationships vary . There are significant gender and cultural differences in acceptance of and breadth of casual relationships , as well as in regrets about action/inaction in those relationships . Casual dating may or may not entail partner-exclusivity . In each case , the relationship 's dominance in the lives of those involved is being voluntarily limited , and there is usually a sense that the relationship is intended to endure only so long as both parties wish it to . Casual relationships sometimes include mutual support , affection and enjoyment , which underpin other forms of loving relationship . A casual relationship is sometimes referred to as a no strings attached relationship .",

  "/wiki/Item_number": "In Indian cinema , an item number or item song is a musical number inserted into a film that does not have any relevance to the plot . The term is commonly used within Indian films ( Hindi , Kannada , Tamil , Telugu , Malayalam and Bengali ) to describe a catchy , upbeat , often sexually provocative dance sequence for a song in a movie . The main aim of an item number is to entertain movie-goers and to lend support to the marketability of the film by being featured in trailers . They are favoured by filmmakers as they afford the opportunity pick potential hit songs from the stocks , since they do not add to the continuity of the plot . It is thus a vehicle for commercial success that ensures repeat viewing . A female actor , singer , or dancer , especially someone who is poised to become a star , who appears in an item number is known as an item girl ( there are item boys as well ) . However , second generation South Asian females are more commonly featured in item numbers than males . Item numbers usually feature one or more persons other than the lead actors . Sometimes , established female and male actors will appear in item numbers ( a phenomenon billed as a special appearance by that actor ) . Although the origin of the term item number is obscure , it is likely that it derives its meaning from objectification of women . This is because item in Mumbai film slang is used by Indian men to objectify women . The classic meaning of item number refers to highly sexualized songs with racy imagery and suggestive lyrics ."
