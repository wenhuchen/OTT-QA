An officer so promoted was referred to as being brevetted ( for example , he was brevetted Major General ) . The promotion would be noted in the officer 's title ( for example , Bvt . Maj. Gen. Joshua L. Chamberlain or Bvt . Col. Arthur MacArthur ) . It is not to be confused with a brevet in Francophone European military circles , where it is an award , nor should it be confused with temporary commissions .",

The battle was tactically inconclusive , as Grant disengaged and continued his offensive . Grant attempted to move quickly through the dense underbrush of the Wilderness of Spotsylvania , but Lee launched two of his corps on parallel roads to intercept him . On the morning of May 5 , the Union V Corps under Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren attacked the Confederate Second Corps , commanded by Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell , on the Orange Turnpike . That afternoon the Third Corps , commanded by Lt. Gen. A. P. Hill , encountered Brig . Gen. George W. Getty 's division ( VI Corps ) and Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock 's II Corps on the Orange Plank Road . Fighting until dark was fierce but inconclusive as both sides attempted to maneuver in the dense woods . At dawn on May 6 , Hancock attacked along the Plank Road , driving Hill 's Corps back in confusion , but the First Corps of Lt. Gen. James Longstreet arrived in time to prevent the collapse of the Confederate right flank . Longstreet followed up with a surprise flanking attack from an unfinished railroad bed that drove Hancock 's men back to the Brock Road , but the momentum was lost when Longstreet was wounded by his own men . An evening attack by Brig . Gen. John B. Gordon against the Union right flank caused consternation at Union headquarters , but the lines stabilized and fighting ceased .",

  "/wiki/First_Battle_of_Bull_Run": "The First Battle of Bull Run ( the name used by Union forces ) , also known as the First Battle of Manassas ( the name used by Confederate forces ) , was the first major battle of the American Civil War and was a Confederate victory . The battle was fought on July 21 , 1861 in Prince William County , Virginia , just north of the city of Manassas and about 25 miles west-southwest of Washington , D.C . The Union 's forces were slow in positioning themselves , allowing Confederate reinforcements time to arrive by rail . Each side had about 18,000 poorly trained and poorly led troops in their first battle . It was a Confederate victory , followed by a disorganized retreat of the Union forces . Just months after the start of the war at Fort Sumter , the Northern public clamored for a march against the Confederate capital of Richmond , Virginia , which was expected to bring an early end to the Confederacy . Yielding to political pressure , Brig . Gen. Irvin McDowell led his unseasoned Union Army across Bull Run against the equally inexperienced Confederate Army of Brig . Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard camped near Manassas Junction . McDowell 's ambitious plan for a surprise flank attack on the Confederate left was poorly executed ; nevertheless , the Confederates , who had been planning to attack the Union left flank , found themselves at an initial disadvantage . Confederate reinforcements under Brig . Gen. Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the Shenandoah Valley by railroad , and the course of the battle quickly changed .",
  "/wiki/Governor_of_Mississippi": "The governor of Mississippi is the head of the executive branch of Mississippi 's state government and the commander-in-chief of the state 's military forces . The Governor has a duty to enforce state laws , and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Mississippi Legislature , to convene the legislature at any time , and , except in cases of treason or impeachment , to grant pardons and reprieves . To be elected governor , a person must be at least 30 years old , and must have been a citizen of the United States for twenty years and a resident of Mississippi for at least five years at the time of inauguration . The Constitution of Mississippi , ratified in 1890 , calls for a four-year term for the governor . He or she may be reelected once ( prior to a 1987 amendment to the state Constitution , governors were limited to one term ) . The original Constitution of 1817 had only a two-year term for governor ; this was expanded to four years in the 1868 Constitution . Uniquely among the states , the Mississippi Constitution requires a gubernatorial candidate to win not just a majority of the popular vote but also a majority of state legislative districts in order to be elected - if no candidate gets both majorities , the state House chooses from the highest two popular vote-getters . The lieutenant governor is elected at the same time as the governor and serves as president of the Mississippi Senate . When the office of governor becomes vacant for any reason , the lieutenant governor becomes governor for the remainder of the term . The governor of Mississippi is also appoints the members of the Institutions of Higher Learning Board of Trustees .",

  "/wiki/Benjamin_Butler_(politician)": "Benjamin Franklin Butler ( November 5 , 1818 - January 11 , 1893 ) was a major general of the Union Army , politician , lawyer and businessman from Massachusetts . Born in New Hampshire and raised in Lowell , Massachusetts , Butler is best known as a political major general of the Union Army during the American Civil War , and for his leadership role in the impeachment of U.S. President Andrew Johnson . He was a colorful and often controversial figure on the national stage and in the Massachusetts political scene and ran several campaigns for Governor before his election to that office in 1882 . Butler , a successful trial lawyer , served in the Massachusetts legislature as an antiwar Democrat and as an officer in the state militia . Early in the Civil War he joined the Union Army , where he was noted for his lack of military skill , and his controversial command of New Orleans , which brought him wide dislike in the South and the Beast epithet . He helped create the legal idea of effectively freeing fugitive slaves by designating them as contraband of war in service of military objectives , which led to a political groundswell in the North which included general emancipation and the end of slavery as official war goals . His commands were marred by financial and logistical dealings across enemy lines , some of which probably took place with his knowledge and to his financial benefit . Butler was dismissed from the Union Army after his failures in the First Battle of Fort Fisher , but soon won election to the United States House of Representatives from Massachusetts . As a Radical Republican he opposed President Johnson 's Reconstruction agenda , and was the House 's lead manager in the Johnson impeachment proceedings . As Chairman of the House Committee on Reconstruction , Butler authored the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 and coauthored the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1875 . In Massachusetts , Butler was often at odds with more conservative members of the political establishment over matters of both style and substance . Feuds with Republican politicians led to his being denied several nominations for the governorship between 1858 and 1880 .",
