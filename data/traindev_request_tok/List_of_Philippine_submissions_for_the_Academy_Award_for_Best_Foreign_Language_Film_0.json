  "/wiki/29th_Academy_Awards": "During the 29th Academy Awards , the regular competitive category of Best Foreign Language Film was introduced , instead of only being recognized as a Special Achievement Award or as a Best Picture nominee ( as in 1938 ) . The first winner in this new category was Federico Fellini 's La Strada with Anthony Quinn and a second nomination for Best Original Screenplay . Its win would help spur an interest in foreign-language films . Another Fellini film , Nights of Cabiria would win the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar in the following year . This was also the first year that all of the five Best Picture nominees were in color . It was also the first Oscar telecast to be videotaped for later broadcast , especially for those network affiliates that did n't want to broadcast the event live . All of the major awards winners were large-scale epics - Mike Todd 's Around the World in 80 Days , The King and I , Anastasia , George Stevens ' Giant , Cecil B. DeMille 's The Ten Commandments ( the highest-grossing film of the year ) , King Vidor 's War and Peace and William Wyler 's Friendly Persuasion . And the trend toward blockbusters and colorful spectaculars was established for years to come , with The Bridge on the River Kwai , Gigi , and Ben-Hur being subsequent Best Picture champions . The Best Original Story category had two interesting quirks this year . First , the Oscar for Best Original Story for The Brave One was awarded to Robert Rich , a pseudonym of Dalton Trumbo , who was blacklisted at the time and thus unable to receive credit under his own name . Second , Edward Bernds and Elwood Ullman withdrew their names from consideration in this category for their work on High Society , as the nomination had been intended for the musical starring Grace Kelly , while Bernds and Ullman had instead written a Bowery Boys film of the same name . In fact , the nomination was a double mistake , as High Society was based on the play and film The Philadelphia Story and probably would not have qualified as an original story anyway .",
