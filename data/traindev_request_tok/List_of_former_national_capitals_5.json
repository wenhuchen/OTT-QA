China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty .

The military control of China by the royal house , surnamed Ji , lasted initially from 1046 until 771 BC for a period known as the Western Zhou and the political sphere of influence it created continued well into Eastern Zhou for another 500 years . During the Zhou dynasty , centralized power decreased throughout the Spring and Autumn period until the Warring States period in the last two centuries of the dynasty . In this period , the Zhou court had little control over its constituent states that were at war with each other until the Qin state consolidated power and formed the Qin dynasty in 221 BC . The Zhou dynasty had formally collapsed only 35 years earlier , although the dynasty had only nominal power at that point . This period of Chinese history produced what many consider the zenith of Chinese bronze-ware making .

Named for its heartland in Qin state ( modern Gansu and Shaanxi ) , the dynasty was founded by Qin Shi Huang , the First Emperor of Qin . The strength of the Qin state was greatly increased by the Legalist reforms of Shang Yang in the fourth century BC , during the Warring States period . In the mid and late third century BC , the Qin state carried out a series of swift conquests , first ending the powerless Zhou dynasty , and eventually conquering the other six of the Seven Warring States . Its 15 years was the shortest major dynasty in Chinese history , consisting of only two emperors , but inaugurated an imperial system that lasted from 221 BC , with interruption and adaptation , until 1912 AD . The Qin sought to create a state unified by structured centralized political power and a large military supported by a stable economy . The central government moved to undercut aristocrats and landowners to gain direct administrative control over the peasantry , who comprised the overwhelming majority of the population and labour force . This allowed ambitious projects involving three hundred thousand peasants and convicts , such as connecting walls along the northern border , eventually developing into the Great Wall of China . The Qin introduced a range of reforms such as standardized currency , weights , measures , and a uniform system of writing , which aimed to unify the state and promote commerce . Additionally , its military used the most recent weaponry , transportation , and tactics , though the government was heavy-handedly bureaucratic . Han Confucians portrayed the legalistic Qin dynasty as a monolithic tyranny , notably citing a purge known as the burning of books and burying of scholars although some modern scholars dispute the veracity of these accounts . When the first emperor died in 210 BC , two of his advisers placed an heir on the throne in an attempt to influence and control the administration of the dynasty .",

Spanning over four centuries , the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history . To this day , China 's majority ethnic group refers to themselves as the Han Chinese ( Han Zu ) and the Chinese script is referred to as Han characters . It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang , known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han , and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty ( 9-23 AD ) of the former regent Wang Mang . This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods : the Western Han or Former Han ( 206 BC - 9 AD ) and the Eastern Han or Later Han ( 25-220 AD ) . The emperor was at the pinnacle of Han society . He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly gentry class . The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government using an innovation inherited from the Qin known as commanderies , and a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms . These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence , particularly following the Rebellion of the Seven States . From the reign of Emperor Wu ( r. 141-87 BC ) onward , the Chinese court officially sponsored Confucianism in education and court politics , synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as Dong Zhongshu . This policy endured until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911 AD .

The Sui unified the Northern and Southern dynasties and reinstalled the rule of ethnic Chinese in the entirety of China proper , along with sinicization of former nomadic ethnic minorities ( Five Barbarians ) within its territory . It was succeeded by the Tang dynasty , which largely inherited its foundation . Founded by Emperor Wen of Sui , the Sui dynasty capital was Chang'an ( which was renamed Daxing , 581-605 ) and later Luoyang ( 605-618 ) . Emperors Wen and Yang undertook various centralized reforms , most notably the equal-field system , intended to reduce economic inequality and improve agricultural productivity ; the institution of the Three Departments and Six Ministries system ; and the standardization and re-unification of the coinage . They also spread and encouraged Buddhism throughout the empire . By the middle of the dynasty , the newly unified empire entered a golden age of prosperity with vast agricultural surplus that supported rapid population growth . A lasting legacy of the Sui dynasty was the Grand Canal . With the eastern capital Luoyang at the center of the network , it linked the west-lying capital Chang'an to the economic and agricultural centers of the east towards Hangzhou , and to the northern border near modern Beijing . While the pressing initial motives were for shipment of grains to the capital , and for transporting troops and military logistics , the reliable inland shipment links would facilitate domestic trades , flow of people and cultural exchange for centuries . Along with the extension of the Great Wall , and the construction of the eastern capital city of Luoyang , these mega projects , led by an efficient centralized bureaucracy , would amass millions of conscripted workers from the large population base , at heavy cost of human lives . After a series of costly and disastrous military campaigns against Goguryeo , one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea , ended in defeat by 614 , the dynasty disintegrated under a series of popular revolts culminating in the assassination of Emperor Yang by his ministers in 618 .",

It was preceded by the Sui dynasty and followed by the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period in Chinese history . Historians generally regard the Tang as a high point in Chinese civilization , and a golden age of cosmopolitan culture . Tang territory , acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers , rivaled that of the Han dynasty . The Tang capital at Chang'an ( present-day Xi'an ) was the most populous city in the world in its day . The L\u01d0 family ( \u674e ) founded the dynasty , seizing power during the decline and collapse of the Sui Empire . The dynasty was interrupted for 15 years when Empress Wu Zetian seized the throne , proclaiming the Wu Zhou dynasty and becoming the only legitimate Chinese empress regnant . In two censuses of the 7th and 8th centuries , the Tang records estimated the population by number of registered households at about 50 million people . Yet , even when the central government was breaking down and unable to compile an accurate census of the population in the 9th century , it is estimated that the population had grown by then to about 80 million people . [ b ] With its large population base , the dynasty was able to raise professional and conscripted armies of hundreds of thousands of troops to contend with nomadic powers in dominating Inner Asia and the lucrative trade-routes along the Silk Road . Various kingdoms and states paid tribute to the Tang court , while the Tang also conquered or subdued several regions which it indirectly controlled through a protectorate system . Besides political hegemony , the Tang also exerted a powerful cultural influence over neighboring East Asian states such as those in Japan and Korea .",
  "/wiki/Five_Dynasties_and_Ten_Kingdoms": "The Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period ( 907-979 ) was an era of political upheaval and division in 10th-century Imperial China . Five states quickly succeeded one another in the Central Plain , and more than a dozen concurrent states were established elsewhere , mainly in South China . It was the last prolonged period of multiple political division in Chinese imperial history . Traditionally , the era started with the fall of the Tang dynasty in 907 AD and reached its climax with the founding of the dominant Song dynasty in 960 . In the remaining 19 years Song gradually subdued all the remaining states . Many states had been de facto independent kingdoms long before 907 , as Tang dynasty 's ability to control its vassals gradually waned , but have now been recognized as such by foreign powers . After the Tang had collapsed , the kings who controlled the Central Plain crowned themselves as emperors . During the 70-year-long period , there was near constant warfare between all the emerged kingdoms and alliances they formed . All of them had the control of the Central Plain as their ultimate goal as that would have granted them the legitimacy over all their territories and rest of China as the legitimate successor to Tang .

The dynasty was founded by Emperor Taizu of Song following his usurpation of the throne of the Later Zhou , ending the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period . The Song often came into conflict with the contemporaneous Liao , Western Xia and Jin dynasties to its north . It was eventually conquered by the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty . The Song government was the first in world history to issue banknotes or true paper money nationally and the first Chinese government to establish a permanent standing navy . This dynasty also saw the first known use of gunpowder , as well as the first discernment of true north using a compass . The Song dynasty is divided into two distinct periods : Northern Song and Southern Song . During the Northern Song ( Chinese : \u5317\u5b8b ; 960-1127 ) , the Song capital was in the northern city of Bianjing ( now Kaifeng ) and the dynasty controlled most of what is now Eastern China .

During this time , the Song court retreated south of the Yangtze and established its capital at Lin'an ( now Hangzhou ) . Although the Song dynasty had lost control of the traditional birthplace of Chinese civilization along the Yellow River , the Song economy was still strong , as the Southern Song empire contained a large population and productive agricultural land .

He also founded the Yuan dynasty in China as a conquest dynasty in 1271 , and ruled as the first Yuan emperor until his death in 1294 . Kublai was the fourth son of Tolui ( his second son with Sorghaghtani Beki ) and a grandson of Genghis Khan . He succeeded his older brother M\u00f6ngke as Khagan in 1260 , but had to defeat his younger brother Ariq B\u00f6ke in the Toluid Civil War lasting until 1264 . This episode marked the beginning of disunity in the empire . Kublai 's real power was limited to China and Mongolia , though as Khagan he still had influence in the Ilkhanate and , to a significantly lesser degree , in the Golden Horde . If one counts the Mongol Empire at that time as a whole , his realm reached from the Pacific Ocean to the Black Sea , from Siberia to what is now Afghanistan . In 1271 , Kublai established the Yuan dynasty , which ruled over present-day Mongolia , China , Korea , and some adjacent areas , and assumed the role of Emperor of China . By 1279 , the Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty was completed and Kublai became the first non-Han emperor to conquer all of China .

  "/wiki/Mongol_Empire": "The Mongol Empire existed during the 13th and 14th centuries , and was the largest contiguous land empire in history . Originating in Mongolia , the Mongol Empire eventually stretched from Eastern Europe and parts of Central Europe to the Sea of Japan , extending northward into parts of Siberia ; eastward and southward into the Indian subcontinent , Mainland Southeast Asia and the Iranian Plateau ; and westward as far as the Levant and the Carpathian Mountains . The Mongol Empire emerged from the unification of several nomadic tribes in the Mongol homeland under the leadership of Genghis Khan ( c. 1162-1227 ) , whom a council proclaimed ruler of all the Mongols in 1206 . The empire grew rapidly under his rule and that of his descendants , who sent out invading armies in every direction . The vast transcontinental empire connected the East with the West in an enforced Pax Mongolica , allowing the dissemination and exchange of trade , technologies , commodities and ideologies across Eurasia . The empire began to split due to wars over succession , as the grandchildren of Genghis Khan disputed whether the royal line should follow from his son and initial heir \u00d6gedei or from one of his other sons , such as Tolui , Chagatai , or Jochi . The Toluids prevailed after a bloody purge of \u00d6gedeid and Chagataid factions , but disputes continued among the descendants of Tolui . A key reason for the split was the dispute over whether the Mongol Empire would become a sedentary , cosmopolitan empire , or would stay true to the Mongol nomadic and steppe-based lifestyle . After M\u00f6ngke Khan died ( 1259 ) , rival kurultai councils simultaneously elected different successors , the brothers Ariq B\u00f6ke and Kublai Khan , who fought each other in the Toluid Civil War ( 1260-1264 ) and also dealt with challenges from the descendants of other sons of Genghis . Kublai successfully took power , but civil war ensued as he sought unsuccessfully to regain control of the Chagatayid and \u00d6gedeid families . During the reigns of Genghis and \u00d6gedei , the Mongols suffered the occasional defeat when a less skilled general received a command . The Siberian Tumeds defeated the Mongol forces under Borokhula around 1215-1217 ; Jalal al-Din defeated Shigi-Qutugu at the Battle of Parwan in 1221 ; and the Jin generals Heda and Pu ' a defeated Dolqolqu in 1230 .",

The Ming dynasty was the last imperial dynasty of China ruled by Han Chinese . Although the primary capital of Beijing fell in 1644 to a rebellion led by Li Zicheng ( who established the Shun dynasty , soon replaced by the Manchu-led Qing dynasty ) , numerous rump regimes loyal to the Ming throne - collectively called the Southern Ming - survived until 1662 . [ d ] The Hongwu Emperor ( r. 1368-1398 ) attempted to create a society of self-sufficient rural communities ordered in a rigid , immobile system that would guarantee and support a permanent class of soldiers for his dynasty : the empire 's standing army exceeded one million troops and the navy 's dockyards in Nanjing were the largest in the world . He also took great care breaking the power of the court eunuchs and unrelated magnates , enfeoffing his many sons throughout China and attempting to guide these princes through the Huang-Ming Zuxun , a set of published dynastic instructions . This failed when his teenage successor , the Jianwen Emperor , attempted to curtail his uncles ' power , prompting the Jingnan Campaign , an uprising that placed the Prince of Yan upon the throne as the Yongle Emperor in 1402 . The Yongle Emperor established Yan as a secondary capital and renamed it Beijing , constructed the Forbidden City , and restored the Grand Canal and the primacy of the imperial examinations in official appointments . He rewarded his eunuch supporters and employed them as a counterweight against the Confucian scholar-bureaucrats .

Combining both modern and traditional architecture , Beijing is one of the oldest cities in the world , with a rich history dating back three millennia . As the last of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China , Beijing has been the political center of the country for most of the past eight centuries , and was the largest city in the world by population for much of the second millennium AD . Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica notes that few cities in the world have served for so long as the political headquarters and cultural center of an area as immense as China . With mountains surrounding the inland city on three sides , in addition to the old inner and outer city walls , Beijing was strategically poised and developed to be the residence of the emperor and thus was the perfect location for the imperial capital .",
  "/wiki/Republic_of_China_(1912\u201349)": "The Republic of China ( ROC ) was a sovereign state in mainland China between 1912 and 1949 , prior to the nationalist government 's relocation to the island of Taiwan . It was established in January 1912 after the Xinhai Revolution , which overthrew the Qing dynasty , the last imperial dynasty of China . The Republic 's first president , Sun Yat-sen , served only briefly before handing over the position to Yuan Shikai , the leader of the Beiyang Army . Sun 's party , the Kuomintang ( KMT ) , then led by Song Jiaoren , won the parliamentary election held in December 1912 . However , Song was assassinated on Yuan 's orders shortly after ; and the Beiyang Army , led by Yuan , maintained full control of the Beiyang government . Between late 1915 and early 1916 , Yuan proclaimed himself Emperor of China before abdicating not long after due to popular unrest . After Yuan 's death in 1916 , the authority of the Beiyang government was further weakened by a brief restoration of the Qing dynasty . Cliques in the Beiyang Army claimed individual autonomy and clashed with each other during the ensuing Warlord Era . In 1921 , the KMT established a rival government in Canton , supported by the fledgling Communist Party of China ( CPC ) . The economy of northern China , overtaxed to support warlord adventurism , collapsed between 1927 and 1928 . General Chiang Kai-shek , who became the KMT leader after Sun 's death , started the Northern Expedition in 1926 to overthrow the Beiyang government , which was accomplished in 1928 . In April 1927 , Chiang established a nationalist government in Nanking , and massacred Communists in Shanghai .",
