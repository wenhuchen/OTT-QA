The work premiered in 1949 on Broadway and was an immediate hit , running for 1,925 performances . The plot is based on James A. Michener 's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1947 book Tales of the South Pacific and combines elements of several of those stories . Rodgers and Hammerstein believed they could write a musical based on Michener 's work that would be financially successful and , at the same time , send a strong progressive message on racism . The plot centers on an American nurse stationed on a South Pacific island during World War II , who falls in love with a middle-aged expatriate French plantation owner but struggles to accept his mixed-race children . A secondary romance , between a U.S. lieutenant and a young Tonkinese woman , explores his fears of the social consequences should he marry his Asian sweetheart . The issue of racial prejudice is candidly explored throughout the musical , most controversially in the lieutenant 's song , You 've Got to Be Carefully Taught . Supporting characters , including a comic petty officer and the Tonkinese girl 's mother , help to tie the stories together . Because he lacked military knowledge , Hammerstein had difficulty writing that part of the script ; the director of the original production , Logan , assisted him and received credit as co-writer of the book . The original Broadway production enjoyed immense critical and box-office success , became the second-longest running Broadway musical to that point ( behind Rodgers and Hammerstein 's earlier Oklahoma ! ( 1943 ) ) , and has remained popular ever since .

The story involves a politically driven , Cold War-era chess tournament between two grandmasters , one American and the other Soviet Russian , and their fight over a woman who manages one and falls in love with the other . Although the protagonists were not intended to represent any real individuals , the character of the American grandmaster ( named Freddie Trumper in the stage version ) was loosely based on Bobby Fischer , while elements of the story may have been inspired by the chess careers of Russian grandmasters Viktor Korchnoi and Anatoly Karpov . Chess allegorically reflected the Cold War tensions present in the 1980s . The musical has been referred to as a metaphor for the whole Cold War , with the insinuation being made that the Cold War is itself a manipulative game . Released and staged at the height of the strong anti-communist agenda that came to be known as the Reagan Doctrine , Chess addressed and satirized the hostility of the international political atmosphere of the 1980s . As with other productions such as Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita , a highly successful concept album was released prior to the first theatrical production in order to raise money . In the case of Chess , the concept album was released in the autumn of 1984 while the show opened in London 's West End in 1986 where it played for three years . A much-altered US version premiered on Broadway in 1988 with a book by Richard Nelson , but survived only for two months . Chess is frequently revised for new productions , many of which try to merge elements from both the British and American versions , but no major revival production of the musical had been attempted until a West End revival in 2018 .
