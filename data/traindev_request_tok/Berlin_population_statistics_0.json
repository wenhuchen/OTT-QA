  "/wiki/Turkish_people": "Turkish people or the Turks ( Turkish : T\u00fcrkler ) , also known as Anatolian Turks ( Turkish : Anadolu T\u00fcrkleri ) , are a Turkic ethnic group and nation living mainly in Turkey and speaking Turkish , the most widely spoken Turkic language . They are the largest ethnic group in Turkey , as well as by far the largest ethnic group among the speakers of Turkic languages . Ethnic Turkish minorities exist in the former lands of the Ottoman Empire . In addition , a Turkish diaspora has been established with modern migration , particularly in Western Europe . Turks arrived from Central Asia and Western China and settled in the Anatolian basin in around the 11th century through the conquest of Seljuk Turks , mixing with the peoples of Anatolia . The region then began to transform from a predominately Greek Christian one to a Turkish Muslim society . Thereafter , the Ottoman Empire came to rule much of the Balkans , the Caucasus , the Middle East ( excluding Iran ) , and North Africa over the course of several centuries , with an advanced army and navy . The Empire lasted until the end of the First World War , when it was defeated by the Allies and partitioned . Following the successful Turkish War of Independence that ended with the Turkish national movement retaking most of the land lost to the Allies , the movement abolished the Ottoman sultanate on 1 November 1922 and proclaimed the Republic of Turkey on 29 October 1923 . Not all Ottomans were Muslims and not all Ottoman Muslims were Turks , but by 1923 , the majority of people living within the borders of the new Turkish republic identified as Turks . Article 66 of the Turkish Constitution defines a Turk as anyone who is bound to the Turkish state through the bond of citizenship ; therefore , the legal use of the term Turkish as a citizen of Turkey is different from the ethnic definition . However , the majority of the Turkish population are of Turkish ethnicity and are estimated at 70-75 percent .",
  "/wiki/Arabs": "Arabs ( /\u02c8\u00e6r\u0259bz/ ; Arabic : \u0639\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064c , ISO 233 arab ; Arabic pronunciation : [ \u02c8\u0295arab ] ( listen ) ) are a population inhabiting the Arab world . They primarily live in the Arab states in Western Asia , North Africa , the Horn of Africa and western Indian Ocean islands ( including the Comoros ) , as well as in significant numbers in the Americas , Western Europe , Indonesia , Israel , Turkey and Iran . The Arab diaspora is established around the world . The first mention of Arabs is from the mid-ninth century BCE as a tribal people in eastern and southern Syria and the north of the Arabian Peninsula . The Arabs appear to have been under the vassalage of the Neo-Assyrian Empire ( 911-612 BCE ) , and the succeeding Neo-Babylonian ( 626-539 BCE ) , Achaemenid ( 539-332 BCE ) , Seleucid , and Parthian empires . Arab tribes , most notably the Ghassanids and Lakhmids , begin to appear in the southern Syrian Desert from the mid 3rd century CE onward , during the mid to later stages of the Roman and Sasanian empires . Before the expansion of the Rashidun Caliphate ( 632-661 C.E . ) , Arab referred to any of the largely nomadic and settled Semitic people from the Arabian Peninsula , Syrian Desert , and North and Lower Mesopotamia . Today , Arab refers to a large number of people whose native regions form the Arab world due to the spread of Arabs and the Arabic language throughout the region during the early Muslim conquests of the 7th and 8th centuries and the subsequent Arabisation of indigenous populations . The Arabs forged the Rashidun ( 632-661 ) , Umayyad ( 661-750 ) , Abbasid ( 750-1517 ) and the Fatimid ( 901-1071 ) caliphates , whose borders reached southern France in the west , China in the east , Anatolia in the north , and the Sudan in the south . This was one of the largest land empires in history . In the early 20th century , the First World War signalled the end of the Ottoman Empire ; which had ruled much of the Arab world since conquering the Mamluk Sultanate in 1517 .",
  "/wiki/Kurds": "Kurds ( Kurdish : \u06a9\u0648\u0631\u062f , Kurd ) are an ethnic group native to a mountainous region of Western Asia known as Kurdistan , which spans southeastern Turkey , northwestern Iran , northern Iraq , and northern Syria . There are also exclaves of Kurds in central Anatolia and Khorasan . Additionally , there are significant Kurdish diaspora communities in the cities of western Turkey , in particular Istanbul , while a Kurdish diaspora has developed in Western Europe , primarily in Germany . Numerically , the Kurds are estimated to number between 30 and 45 million . Kurds speak the Kurdish languages and the Zaza-Gorani languages , which belong to the Western Iranian branch of the Iranian languages in the Indo-European language family . A majority of Kurds belong to the Shafii school of Sunni Islam , but significant numbers practise Shia Islam and Alevism , while some are adherents of Yarsanism , Yazidism , Zoroastrianism and Christianity . After World War I and the defeat of the Ottoman Empire , the victorious Western allies made provision for a Kurdish state in the 1920 Treaty of Sevres . However , that promise was nullified three years later , when the Treaty of Lausanne set the boundaries of modern Turkey and made no such provision , leaving Kurds with minority status in their respective countries . This fact has led to numerous genocides and rebellions , along with the current ongoing armed guerrilla conflicts in Turkey , Iran , and Syria / Rojava . Kurds have an autonomous region in Iraq named the Kurdistan Region , while Kurdish nationalist movements continue to pursue greater cultural rights , autonomy , and independence throughout Greater Kurdistan .",

  "/wiki/Ethnic_groups_of_Africa": "The ethnic groups of Africa number in the thousands , with each population generally having its own language ( or dialect of a language ) and culture . The ethnolinguistic groups include various Afroasiatic , Khoisan , Niger-Congo and Nilo-Saharan populations . The official population count of the various ethnic groups in Africa is highly uncertain , both due to limited infrastructure to perform censuses and due to the rapid population growth . There have also been accusations of deliberate misreporting in order to give selected ethnicities numerical superiority ( as in the case of Nigeria 's Hausa , Fulani , Yoruba and Igbo people ) . A 2009 genetic clustering study , which genotyped 1327 polymorphic markers in various African populations , identified six ancestral clusters . The clustering corresponded closely with ethnicity , culture and language . A 2018 whole genome sequencing study of the world 's populations observed similar clusters among the populations in Africa . At K=9 , distinct ancestral components defined the Afrosiatic-speaking populations inhabiting North Africa and Northeast Africa ; the Nilo-Saharan-speaking populations in Northeast Africa and East Africa ; the Ari populations in Northeast Africa ; the Niger-Congo-speaking populations in West-Central Africa , West Africa , East Africa and Southern Africa ; the Pygmy populations in Central Africa ; and the Khoisan populations in Southern Africa .",

A wide-ranging Polish diaspora ( the Polonia ) exists throughout Europe , the Americas , and in Australasia . Today , the largest urban concentrations of Poles are within the Warsaw and Silesian metropolitan areas . Poland 's history dates back over a thousand years , to c. 930-960 AD , when the Western Polans - an influential tribe in the Greater Poland region , now home to such cities as Pozna\u0144 , Gniezno , Kalisz , Konin and Wrze\u015bnia - united various Lechitic clans under what became the Piast dynasty , thus creating the first Polish state . The subsequent Christianization of Poland by the Catholic Church , in 966 CE , marked Poland 's advent to the community of Western Christendom . However , throughout its existence , the Polish state followed a tolerant policy towards minorities resulting in numerous ethnic and religious identities of the Poles , such as Polish Jews . Poles have made important contributions to the world in every major field of human endeavor , among them Copernicus , Marie Curie , Joseph Conrad , Fryderyk Chopin and Pope John Paul II . Notable Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9s - many of them forced from their homeland by historic vicissitudes - have included physicist Joseph Rotblat , mathematician Stanis\u0142aw Ulam , pianist Arthur Rubinstein , actresses Helena Modjeska and Pola Negri , military leaders Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko and Casimir Pulaski , U.S. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski , politician Rosa Luxemburg , painter Tamara de Lempicka , filmmakers Samuel Goldwyn and the Warner Brothers , cartoonist Max Fleischer , and cosmeticians Helena Rubinstein and Max Factor .",

The majority of Italian nationals are native speakers of the country 's official language , Italian , or a regional variety thereof .

Arabic is also widely spoken , arguably the largest minority language in France as of the 21st century ( a spot previously held by Breton and Occitan ) . Modern French society is a melting pot . From the middle of the 19th century , it experienced a high rate of inward migration , mainly consisting of Arab-Berbers , Jews , Sub-Saharan Africans , Chinese , and other peoples from Africa , the Middle East and East Asia , and the government , defining France as an inclusive nation with universal values , advocated assimilation through which immigrants were expected to adhere to French values and cultural norms .

It may also refer to citizens of the former British Empire . Though early assertions of being British date from the Late Middle Ages , the creation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 triggered a sense of British national identity . The notion of Britishness was forged during the Napoleonic Wars between Britain and the First French Empire , and developed further during the Victorian era . The complex history of the formation of the United Kingdom created a particular sense of nationhood and belonging in Great Britain and Ireland ; Britishness became superimposed on much older identities , of English , Scots , Welsh and Irish cultures , whose distinctiveness still resists notions of a homogenised British identity . Because of longstanding ethno-sectarian divisions , British identity in Northern Ireland is controversial , but it is held with strong conviction by Unionists . Modern Britons are descended mainly from the varied ethnic groups that settled in Great Britain in and before the 11th century : Prehistoric , Brittonic , Roman , Anglo-Saxon , Norse and Normans . The progressive political unification of the British Isles facilitated migration , cultural and linguistic exchange , and intermarriage between the peoples of England , Scotland and Wales during the late Middle Ages , early modern period and beyond . Since 1922 and earlier , there has been immigration to the United Kingdom by people from what is now the Republic of Ireland , the Commonwealth , mainland Europe and elsewhere ; they and their descendants are mostly British citizens , with some assuming a British , dual or hyphenated identity .
