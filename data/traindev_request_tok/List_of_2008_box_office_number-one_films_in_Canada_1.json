Nolan 's inspiration for the film was the Joker 's comic book debut in 1940 , the 1988 graphic novel The Killing Joke , and the 1996 series The Long Halloween , which retold Harvey Dent 's origin . The Dark Knight nickname was first applied to Batman in Batman # 1 ( 1940 ) , in a story written by Bill Finger .

The film was the first mainstream feature to partially utilize IMAX 70 mm cameras , with Nolan using them for 28 minutes of the film , including the Joker 's first appearance . Warner Bros. initially created a viral marketing campaign for The Dark Knight , developing promotional websites and trailers highlighting screenshots of Ledger as the Joker . Ledger died on January 22 , 2008 , some months after he completed filming and six months before the film 's release from a toxic combination of prescription drugs , leading to intense attention from the press and movie-going public . A co-production of the United States and the United Kingdom , The Dark Knight was released on July 18 , 2008 , in the United States and on July 25 , 2008 , in the United Kingdom .

The Dark Knight appeared on 287 critics ' top-ten lists , more than any other film of 2008 with the exception of WALL-E , and more critics ( 77 ) named The Dark Knight the best film released that year .",

It is the second in The Chronicles of Narnia film series from Walden Media , following The Chronicles of Narnia : The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe ( 2005 ) . William Moseley , Anna Popplewell , Skandar Keynes , Georgie Henley , Liam Neeson , and Tilda Swinton reprise their roles from the first film , while new cast includes Ben Barnes , Sergio Castellitto , Peter Dinklage , Eddie Izzard , Warwick Davis , Ken Stott , and Vincent Grass . In the film , the four Pevensie children return to Narnia to aid Prince Caspian in his struggle with the secret help of Aslan for the throne against his corrupt uncle , King Miraz . Prince Caspian , a British-American production , is the last Narnia film to be co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures , as 20th Century Fox became the distributor for the next film The Chronicles of Narnia : The Voyage of the Dawn Treader due to budgetary disputes between Disney and Walden Media , but as a result of Disney eventually purchasing Fox on March 20 , 2019 , Disney now owns the rights to all three Narnia movies . Work on the script began before The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe was released , so filming could begin before the actors grew too old for their parts . Director Andrew Adamson wanted to make the film more spectacular than the first , and created an action sequence not in the novel . The Narnians were designed to look wilder as they have been hiding from persecution , stressing the darker tone of the sequel . The filmmakers also took a Spanish influence for the antagonistic race of the Telmarines . Filming began in February 2007 in New Zealand , but unlike the previous film , the majority of shooting took place in Central Europe , because of the larger sets available in those countries . To keep costs down , Adamson chose to base post-production in the UK , because of recent tax credits there . The Chronicles of Narnia : Prince Caspian premiered on May 7 , 2008 at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City , before it was theatrically released on May 16 in the United States and on June 26 in the United Kingdom .",
