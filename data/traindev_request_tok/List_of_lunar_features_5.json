  "/wiki/Latitude": "In geography , latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the north-south position of a point on the Earth 's surface . Latitude is an angle ( defined below ) which ranges from 0\u00b0 at the Equator to 90\u00b0 ( North or South ) at the poles . Lines of constant latitude , or parallels , run east-west as circles parallel to the equator . Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth . On its own , the term latitude should be taken to be the geodetic latitude as defined below . Briefly , geodetic latitude at a point is the angle formed by the vector perpendicular ( or normal ) to the ellipsoidal surface from that point , and the equatorial plane . Also defined are six auxiliary latitudes which are used in special applications .",
  "/wiki/Longitude": "Longitude ( /\u02c8l\u0252nd\u0292\u026atju\u02d0d/ , AU and UK also /\u02c8l\u0252\u014b\u0261\u026a-/ ) , is a geographic coordinate that specifies the east-west position of a point on the Earth 's surface , or the surface of a celestial body . It is an angular measurement , usually expressed in degrees and denoted by the Greek letter lambda ( \u03bb ) . Meridians ( lines running from pole to pole ) connect points with the same longitude . By convention , one of these , the Prime Meridian , which passes through the Royal Observatory , Greenwich , England , was allocated the position of 0\u00b0 longitude . The longitude of other places is measured as the angle east or west from the Prime Meridian , ranging from 0\u00b0 at the Prime Meridian to +180\u00b0 eastward and \u2212180\u00b0 westward . Specifically , it is the angle between a plane through the Prime Meridian and a plane through both poles and the location in question . ( This forms a right-handed coordinate system with the z-axis ( right hand thumb ) pointing from the Earth 's center toward the North Pole and the x-axis ( right hand index finger ) extending from the Earth 's center through the Equator at the Prime Meridian . ) A location 's north-south position along a meridian is given by its latitude , which is approximately the angle between the local vertical and the equatorial plane . If the Earth were perfectly spherical and radially homogeneous , then the longitude at a point would be equal to the angle between a vertical north-south plane through that point and the plane of the Greenwich meridian . Everywhere on Earth the vertical north-south plane would contain the Earth 's axis . But the Earth is not radially homogeneous and has rugged terrain , which affect gravity and so can shift the vertical plane away from the Earth 's axis . The vertical north-south plane still intersects the plane of the Greenwich meridian at some angle ; that angle is the astronomical longitude , calculated from star observations .",

Born in the small town of Glauchau , in the Electorate of Saxony of the Holy Roman Empire , he was broadly educated , but took a particular interest in the mining and refining of metals . He is well known for his pioneering work De re metallica libri XII , that was published in 1556 , one year after his death . This 12-volume work is a comprehensive and systematic study , classification and methodical guide on all available factual and practical aspects , that are of concern for mining , the mining sciences and metallurgy , investigated and researched in its natural environment by means of direct observation . Unrivalled in its complexity and accuracy , it served as the standard reference work for two centuries . Agricola stated in the preface , that he will exclude all those things which I have not myself seen , or have not read or heard of. [ . ] .That which I have neither seen , nor carefully considered after reading or hearing of , I have not written about . He thereby refuses to rely on abstruse methods through philosophical considerations and instead submits his work to the strict principles of the modern scientific method , centuries before its time . As a scholar of the Renaissance he was committed to a universal approach towards learning and research and published over 40 complete scholarly works during his professional life on a wide range of subjects and disciplines , such as pedagogy , medicine , metrology , mercantilism , pharmacy , philosophy , geology , history and many more . His innovative and comprehensive scholarly work , based on new and precise methods of production and control is remarkable and has earned him international admiration to this day .",

The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided . Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn . Mont Blanc spans the French-Italian border , and at 4,810 m ( 15,781 ft ) is the highest mountain in the Alps . The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4,000 metres ( 13,000 ft ) . The altitude and size of the range affects the climate in Europe ; in the mountains precipitation levels vary greatly and climatic conditions consist of distinct zones . Wildlife such as ibex live in the higher peaks to elevations of 3,400 m ( 11,155 ft ) , and plants such as Edelweiss grow in rocky areas in lower elevations as well as in higher elevations . Evidence of human habitation in the Alps goes back to the Palaeolithic era . A mummified man , determined to be 5,000 years old , was discovered on a glacier at the Austrian-Italian border in 1991 . By the 6th century BC , the Celtic La T\u00e8ne culture was well established . Hannibal famously crossed the Alps with a herd of elephants , and the Romans had settlements in the region .

It is a global language , the world 's second-most spoken native language , after Mandarin Chinese , and the world 's fourth-most spoken language , after Mandarin Chinese , English and Hindi . Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages , which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century . The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century , and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo , a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile , in the 13th century . Beginning in 1492 , the Spanish language was taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire , most notably to the Americas , as well as territories in Africa , Oceania and the Philippines . A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist Mario Pei , analyzing the degree of difference from a language 's parent ( Latin , in the case of Romance languages ) by comparing phonology , inflection , syntax , vocabulary , and intonation , indicated the following percentages ( the higher the percentage , the greater the distance from Latin ) : In the case of Spanish , it is one of the closest Romance languages to Latin ( 20% distance ) , only behind Sardinian ( 8% distance ) and Italian ( 12% distance ) . Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin , including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek . Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date , having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula . With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin , this language makes up the second greatest vocabulary source after Latin itself . It has also been influenced by Basque , Iberian , Celtiberian , Visigothic , and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages . Additionally , it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages , particularly other Romance languages - French , Italian , Andalusi Romance , Portuguese , Galician , Catalan , Occitan , and Sardinian - as well as from Quechua , Nahuatl , and other indigenous languages of the Americas .

The mountain range forms part of the conventional boundary between the continents of Europe and Asia . Vaygach Island and the islands of Novaya Zemlya form a further continuation of the chain to the north into the Arctic Ocean . The mountains lie within the Ural geographical region and significantly overlap with the Ural Federal District and with the Ural economic region . They have rich resources , including metal ores , coal , and precious and semi-precious stones . Since the 18th century the mountains have contributed significantly to the mineral sector of the Russian economy .",
  "/wiki/Montes_Rook": "Montes Rook is a ring-shaped mountain range that lies along the western limb of the Moon , crossing over to the far side . It completely encircles the Mare Orientale , and forms part of a massive impact basin feature . This range in turn is encircled by the larger Montes Cordillera , which is separated from the Montes Rook by a rugged , ring-shaped plain . The Montes Rook is actually a double-ring formation , sometimes divided into the outer Rook and the inner Rook , having respective diameters of 620 km and 480 km . The material excavated to form Montes Rook came from a mafic layer below an anorthositic zone . Many of the peaks in this ring are composed of pure anorthosite . Sections of the gap between these sub-ranges contain long valleys filled in places with basaltic lava , forming small lunar maria . One such section along the northeastern part of the range has been named Lacus Veris . The selenographic coordinates of this range are 20.6\u00b0 S , 82.5\u00b0 W , and the diameter is 791 km . The range was named after the English astronomer Lawrence Rooke . Due to its location this range is viewed from the edge from Earth , and not much detail can be seen . However a partial view of the range can be obtained by projecting an image of the range acquired from the earth onto the surface of a white globe .",

  "/wiki/Montes_Secchi": "Montes Secchi ( Latin for Secchi Mountains ) is a minor range of lunar mountains located near the northwestern edge of Mare Fecunditatis . This roughly linear formation of low ridges grazes the northwestern outer rim of the crater Secchi , the formation from which this range gained its name . This crater is named after Angelo Secchi , a 19th-century Italian astronomer . The ridges trend from southwest to northeast . In the vicinity of Montes Secchi is Mount Marilyn , a distinctly triangular mountain formation . It was named in 1968 by Apollo 8 astronaut Jim Lovell , after his wife . The name was not approved by the IAU until July 26 , 2017 . Before its approval , it was known as Secchi Theta . The selenographic coordinates of the range midpoint are 2.4\u00b0 N , 43.6\u00b0 E , and they lie within a diameter of 50 km .
