It consists of Belle Isle , an island in the Detroit River , as well as several surrounding islets . The U.S.-Canada border is in the channel south of Belle Isle such that the island is not in Canada . Owned by the city of Detroit , Belle Isle is managed as a state park by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources through a 30-year lease initiated in 2013 ; it was previously a city park . Belle Isle Park is the largest city-owned island park in the United States , and Belle Isle is the third largest island in the Detroit River , after Grosse Ile and Fighting Island . It is connected to mainland Detroit by the MacArthur Bridge . Belle Isle Park is home to the Belle Isle Aquarium , the Belle Isle Conservatory , the Belle Isle Nature Center , the James Scott Memorial Fountain , the Dossin Great Lakes Museum , a municipal golf course , a half-mile ( 800 m ) swimming beach , and numerous other monuments and attractions .

  "/wiki/State_park": "State parks are parks or other protected areas managed at the sub-national level within those nations which use state as a political subdivision . State parks are typically established by a state to preserve a location on account of its natural beauty , historic interest , or recreational potential . There are state parks under the administration of the government of each U.S. state , some of the Mexican states , and in Brazil . The term is also used in the Australian state of Victoria . The equivalent term used in Canada , Argentina , South Africa and Belgium , is provincial park . Similar systems of local government maintained parks exist in other countries , but the terminology varies . State parks are thus similar to national parks , but under state rather than federal administration . Similarly , local government entities below state level may maintain parks , e.g. , regional parks or county parks . In general , state parks are smaller than national parks , with a few exceptions such as the Adirondack Park in New York and Anza-Borrego Desert State Park in California .",

He was commonly referred to as Mies , his surname . Along with Alvar Aalto , Le Corbusier , Walter Gropius and Frank Lloyd Wright , he is regarded as one of the pioneers of modernist architecture . Mies was the last director of the Bauhaus , a seminal school in modern architecture . After Nazism 's rise to power , with its strong opposition to modernism ( leading to the closing of the Bauhaus itself ) , Mies emigrated to the United States . He accepted the position to head the architecture school at the Armour Institute of Technology ( later the Illinois Institute of Technology ) , in Chicago . Mies sought to establish his own particular architectural style that could represent modern times just as Classical and Gothic did for their own eras . He created his own twentieth-century architectural style , stated with extreme clarity and simplicity . His mature buildings made use of modern materials such as industrial steel and plate glass to define interior spaces , as also conducted by other modernist architects in the 1920s and 1930s such as Richard Neutra . Mies strove toward an architecture with a minimal framework of structural order balanced against the implied freedom of unobstructed free-flowing open space . He called his buildings skin and bones architecture . He sought an objective approach that would guide the creative process of architectural design , but was always concerned with expressing the spirit of the modern era .",

  "/wiki/Black_Bottom,_Detroit": "Black Bottom was a predominantly black neighborhood in Detroit , Michigan . The term has sometimes been used to apply to the entire neighborhood including Paradise Valley , but in fact , the two neighborhoods were considered separate . Together , both Black Bottom and Paradise Valley were bounded by Brush Street to the west , and the Grand Trunk railroad tracks to the east . Bisected by Gratiot Avenue , the area known as Black Bottom reached south to the Detroit River . To the north to Grand Boulevard was defined as Paradise Valley . Although the name Black Bottom is often erroneously believed to be a reference to the African-American community that developed in the twentieth century , the neighborhood was actually named by early French colonial settlers for the dark , fertile topsoil found in the area ( known as river bottomlands ) . During World War I , Black Bottom was home to many Eastern European Jewish immigrants , but with the Great Migration and influx of southern African Americans , it became one of Detroit 's most lively black neighborhoods . As the Black Bottom grew , it soon became known as a lively and bustling area filled with jazz bars and nightclubs . From the 1930s to the 1950s , residents in Black Bottom made significant contributions to American music , including Blues , Big Band , and Jazz . Despite the rich cultural and musical hub of Black Bottom , however , the neighborhood was plagued with urban poverty . Most of Black Bottom 's residents were employed in manufacturing and the automotive factory jobs . Although some black business owners and clergymen operating in the neighborhood were able to rise to the middle class , they quickly fled Black Bottom and Paradise Valley for the more attractive Detroit West Side neighborhoods .",
  "/wiki/International_architecture": "The International Style or internationalism is a major architectural style that was developed in the 1920s and 1930s and was closely related to modernism and modern architecture . It was first defined by Museum of Modern Art curators Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson in 1932 , based on works of architecture from the 1920s . The terms rationalist architecture and modern movement are often used interchangeably with International Style , although the former is mostly used in the English-speaking world to specifically refer to the Italian rationalism of architects such as Giuseppe Terragni and Gino Pollini , or even the International Style that developed in Europe as a whole . It is defined by the Getty Research Institute as the style of architecture that emerged in Holland , France , and Germany after World War I and spread throughout the world , becoming the dominant architectural style until the 1970s . The style is characterized by an emphasis on volume over mass , the use of lightweight , mass-produced , industrial materials , rejection of all ornament and colour , repetitive modular forms , and the use of flat surfaces , typically alternating with areas of glass .",
  "/wiki/Tint": "In color theory , a tint is a mixture of a color with white , which reduces darkness , while a shade is a mixture with black , which increases darkness . Both processes affect the resulting color mixture 's relative lightness . A tone is produced either by mixing a color with grey , or by both tinting and shading . Mixing a color with any neutral color ( including black , gray , and white ) reduces the chroma , or colorfulness , while the hue ( the relative mixture of red , yellow , green , etc . depending on the colorspace ) remains unchanged . In common language , the term shade can be generalized to furthermore encompass any varieties of a particular color , whether technically they are shades , tints , tones , or slightly different hues . Meanwhile , the term tint can be generalized to refer to any lighter or darker variation of a color ( e.g . tinted windows ) . When mixing colored light ( additive color models ) , the achromatic mixture of spectrally balanced red , green , and blue ( RGB ) is always white , not gray or black . When we mix colorants , such as the pigments in paint mixtures , a color is produced which is always darker and lower in chroma , or saturation , than the parent colors . This moves the mixed color toward a neutral color - a gray or near-black . Lights are made brighter or dimmer by adjusting their brightness , or energy level ; in painting , lightness is adjusted through mixture with white , black , or a color 's complement .",
  "/wiki/Glass": "Glass is a non-crystalline , often transparent amorphous solid , that has widespread practical , technological , and decorative use in , for example , window panes , tableware , and optics . Glass is most often formed by rapid cooling ( quenching ) of the molten form , some glasses such as volcanic glass are naturally occurring . The most familiar , and historically the oldest , types of manufactured glass are silicate glasses based on the chemical compound silica ( silicon dioxide , or quartz ) , the primary constituent of sand . Soda-lime glass , containing around 70% silica , account for around 90% of manufactured glass . The term glass , in popular usage , is often used to refer only to this type of material , although silica-free glasses often have desirable properties for applications in modern communications technology . Some objects , such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses , are so commonly made of silicate-based glass that they are simply called by the name of the material . Although brittle , silicate glass is extremely durable , and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures . The earliest known glass objects , of the mid third millennium BCE , were beads , perhaps initially created as accidental by-products of metal-working ( slags ) or during the production of faience , a pre-glass vitreous material made by a process similar to glazing . Due to its ease of formability into any shape , it has been traditionally used for vessels : bowls , vases , bottles , jars and drinking glasses . In its most solid forms , it has also been used for paperweights , marbles . Glass can be coloured by adding metal salts or painted and printed with vitreous enamels , leading to its use in stained glass windows and other Glass art objects . The refractive , reflective and transmission properties of glass make glass suitable for manufacturing optical lenses , prisms , and optoelectronics materials .",
  "/wiki/Aluminum": "Aluminium ( aluminum in American and Canadian English ) is a chemical element with the symbol Al and atomic number 13 . It is a silvery-white , soft , non-magnetic and ductile metal in the boron group . By mass , aluminium makes up about 8% of the Earth 's crust , where it is the third most abundant element ( after oxygen and silicon ) and also the most abundant metal . Occurrence of aluminium decreases in the Earth 's mantle below , however . The chief ore of aluminium is bauxite . Aluminium metal is highly reactive , such that native specimens are rare and limited to extreme reducing environments . Instead , it is found combined in over 270 different minerals . Aluminium is remarkable for its low density and its ability to resist corrosion through the phenomenon of passivation . Aluminium and its alloys are vital to the aerospace industry and important in transportation and building industries , such as building facades and window frames . The oxides and sulfates are the most useful compounds of aluminium . Despite its prevalence in the environment , no known form of life uses aluminium salts metabolically , but aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals . Because of these salts ' abundance , the potential for a biological role for them is of continuing interest , and studies continue .",
