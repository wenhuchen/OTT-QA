  "/wiki/Batman_(1989_film)": "Batman is a 1989 American superhero film directed by Tim Burton and produced by Jon Peters and Peter Guber , based on the DC Comics character of the same name . It is the first installment of Warner Bros. ' initial Batman film series . The film stars Jack Nicholson as the Joker and Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne / Batman , alongside Kim Basinger , Robert Wuhl , Pat Hingle , Billy Dee Williams , Michael Gough , and Jack Palance . The film takes place early in the title character 's war on crime , and depicts a battle with the Joker . After Burton was hired as director in 1986 , Steve Englehart and Julie Hickson wrote film treatments before Sam Hamm wrote the first screenplay . Batman was not greenlit until after the success of Burton 's Beetlejuice ( 1988 ) . Numerous A-list actors were considered for the role of Batman before Keaton was cast . Keaton 's casting caused a controversy since , by 1988 , he had become typecast as a comedic actor and many observers doubted he could portray a serious role . Nicholson accepted the role of the Joker under strict conditions that dictated top billing , a portion of the film 's earnings ( including associated merchandise ) , and his own shooting schedule . The tone and themes of the film were influenced in part by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland 's The Killing Joke and Frank Miller 's The Dark Knight Returns . The film primarily adapts the Red Hood origin story for the Joker , in which Batman inadvertently creates the Joker by causing him to fall into Axis Chemical acid , resulting in his transformation into a psychopath , but it adds a unique twist in presenting him specifically as a gangster named Jack Napier . Filming took place at Pinewood Studios from October 1988 to January 1989 .",
