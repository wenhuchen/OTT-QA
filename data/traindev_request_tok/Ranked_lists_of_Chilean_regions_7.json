The capital of the 115-island country , Victoria , lies 1,500 kilometres ( 932 mi ) east of mainland Africa . Other nearby island countries and territories include Comoros , Mayotte ( territory of France ) , Madagascar , R\u00e9union ( territory of France ) , and Mauritius to the south ; as well as the Maldives and Chagos Archipelago to the east . With a population of roughly 94,367 , it has the smallest population of any sovereign African country . Seychelles is a member of the United Nations , the African Union , the Southern African Development Community , and the Commonwealth of Nations . After proclaiming independence from the United Kingdom in 1976 , Seychelles has developed from a largely agricultural society to a market-based diversified economy , with agriculture being supplanted by rapidly rising service and public sectors as well as tourism . From 1976 until 2015 , nominal GDP output increased nearly sevenfold , and the purchasing power parity increased nearly sixteenfold . In the late 2010s , President Danny Faure and the National Assembly presented plans to encourage foreign investment in order to further upgrade these sectors . Today , Seychelles boasts the highest nominal per capita GDP in Africa , excluding the French regions . It is one of only a handful of countries in Africa with a high Human Development Index and is the first country in Africa with an HDI score exceeding 0.800 ( excluding French territorial possessions ) . It is also the only country in Africa which is classed as a high-income economy by the World Bank . Despite the country 's somewhat economic prosperity , poverty remains widespread , and there is a high level of economic inequality , one of the highest in the world , and unequal wealth distribution among the populace , with the upper and ruling class commanding a vast proportion of the country 's wealth .",

It is a member of the Commonwealth Realms under the monarchy of Queen Elizabeth II . The archipelagic state consists of more than 700 islands , cays , and islets in the Atlantic Ocean , and is located north of Cuba and Hispaniola Island ( Haiti and the Dominican Republic ) , northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands , southeast of the U.S. state of Florida , and east of the Florida Keys . The capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence . The Royal Bahamas Defence Force describes the Bahamas ' territory as encompassing 470,000 km2 ( 180,000 sq mi ) of ocean space . The Bahamas were inhabited by the Lucayans , a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Ta\u00edno people , for many centuries . Columbus was the first European to see the islands , making his first landfall in the 'New World ' in 1492 . Later , the Spanish shipped the native Lucayans to slavery on Hispaniola , after which the Bahama islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648 , when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera . The Bahamas became a British crown colony in 1718 , when the British clamped down on piracy . After the American Revolutionary War , the Crown resettled thousands of American Loyalists to the Bahamas ; they took their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants . African slaves and their descendants constituted the majority of the population from this period on . The slave trade was abolished by the British in 1807 ; slavery in the Bahamas was abolished in 1834 .",

The republic of Honduras is bordered to the west by Guatemala , to the southwest by El Salvador , to the southeast by Nicaragua , to the south by the Pacific Ocean at the Gulf of Fonseca , and to the north by the Gulf of Honduras , a large inlet of the Caribbean Sea . Honduras was home to several important Mesoamerican cultures , most notably the Maya , before the Spanish Colonization in the sixteenth century . The Spanish introduced Roman Catholicism and the now predominant Spanish language , along with numerous customs that have blended with the indigenous culture . Honduras became independent in 1821 and has since been a republic , although it has consistently endured much social strife and political instability , and remains one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere . In 1960 , the northern part of what was the Mosquito Coast was transferred from Nicaragua to Honduras by the International Court of Justice . The nation 's economy is primarily agricultural , making it especially vulnerable to natural disasters such as Hurricane Mitch in 1998 . The lower class is primarily agriculturally based while wealth is concentrated in the country 's urban centers . Honduras has a Human Development Index of 0.625 , classifying it as a nation with medium development . When the Index is adjusted for income inequality , its Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index is 0.443 . Honduran society is predominantly Mestizo ; however , American Indian , black and white individuals also live in Honduras ( 2017 ) .

For more than 200 of those years , Burundi was an independent kingdom , until the beginning of the 20th century , when Germany colonised the region . After the First World War and Germany 's defeat , it ceded the territory to Belgium . Both Germans and Belgians ruled Burundi and Rwanda as a European colony known as Ruanda-Urundi . Despite common misconceptions , Burundi and Rwanda had never been under common rule until the time of European colonisation . Burundi gained independence in 1962 and initially had a monarchy , but a series of assassinations , coups and a general climate of regional instability culminated in the establishment of a republic and one-party state in 1966 . Bouts of ethnic cleansing and ultimately two civil wars and genocides during the 1970s and again in the 1990s left the economy undeveloped and the population as one of the world 's poorest . The presidents of Rwanda and Burundi , both Hutus , died together when their aeroplane was shot down in April 1994 . 2015 witnessed large-scale political strife as President Pierre Nkurunziza opted to run for a third term in office , a coup attempt failed and the country 's parliamentary and presidential elections were broadly criticised by members of the international community .",

The sovereign state is separated from the Comoros , Mayotte and Madagascar by the Mozambique Channel to the east . The capital and largest city of Mozambique is Maputo ( formerly known as Louren\u00e7o Marques from 1876 to 1976 ) . Between the first and fifth centuries AD , Bantu-speaking peoples migrated to present-day Mozambique from farther north and west . Northern Mozambique lies within the monsoon trade winds of the Indian Ocean . Between the 7th and 11th centuries , a series of Swahili port towns developed here , which contributed to the development of a distinct Swahili culture and language . In the late medieval period , these towns were frequented by traders from Somalia , Ethiopia , Egypt , Arabia , Persia , and India . The voyage of Vasco da Gama in 1498 marked the arrival of the Portuguese , who began a gradual process of colonisation and settlement in 1505 . After over four centuries of Portuguese rule , Mozambique gained independence in 1975 , becoming the People 's Republic of Mozambique shortly thereafter . After only two years of independence , the country descended into an intense and protracted civil war lasting from 1977 to 1992 .

The earliest known human activity on the island dates to around the 10th millennium BC . Archaeological remains from this period include the well-preserved Neolithic village of Khirokitia , and Cyprus is home to some of the oldest water wells in the world . Cyprus was settled by Mycenaean Greeks in two waves in the 2nd millennium BC . As a strategic location in the Middle East , it was subsequently occupied by several major powers , including the empires of the Assyrians , Egyptians and Persians , from whom the island was seized in 333 BC by Alexander the Great . Subsequent rule by Ptolemaic Egypt , the Classical and Eastern Roman Empire , Arab caliphates for a short period , the French Lusignan dynasty and the Venetians , was followed by over three centuries of Ottoman rule between 1571 and 1878 ( de jure until 1914 ) . Cyprus was placed under the UK 's administration based on the Cyprus Convention in 1878 and was formally annexed by the UK in 1914 . While Turkish Cypriots made up 18% of the population , the partition of Cyprus and creation of a Turkish state in the north became a policy of Turkish Cypriot leaders and Turkey in the 1950s . Turkish leaders for a period advocated the annexation of Cyprus to Turkey as Cyprus was considered an extension of Anatolia by them ; while , since the 19th century , the majority Greek Cypriot population and its Orthodox church had been pursuing union with Greece , which became a Greek national policy in the 1950s .

Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands , and features a string of volcanoes and lakes . The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords , inlets , canals , twisting peninsulas , and islands .
