  "/wiki/A_Nightmare_on_Elm_Street_(2010_film)": "A Nightmare on Elm Street is a 2010 American slasher film directed by Samuel Bayer , and written by Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer . The film stars Jackie Earle Haley , Kyle Gallner , Rooney Mara , Katie Cassidy , Thomas Dekker , and Kellan Lutz . It is a remake of Wes Craven 's 1984 film of the same name . Produced by Michael Bay and Platinum Dunes , the film was designed to reboot the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise and is the ninth installment in the series . The film is set in a fictitious town of Ohio and centers around a group of teenagers living on one street who are stalked and murdered in their dreams by a disfigured man named Freddy Krueger . The teenagers discover that they all share a common link from their childhood that makes them targets for Krueger . A Nightmare on Elm Street was originally to follow the same design as Platinum Dunes ' other remake , Friday the 13th , where the writers took the best elements from each of the films in the original series and created a single storyline with them . Eventually , they decided to use Craven 's original storyline but tried to create a scarier film . To that end , they decided to remove the one-line quipping Freddy , who had become less scary and more comical over the years , and bring back his darker nature . The writers developed the character to be a child molester , something that Craven wanted to do originally in 1984 but changed to a child killer instead . Freddy 's physical appearance was changed with the use of computer-generated imagery to be closer to that of a burn victim . Because of the positive experiences Platinum Dunes ' producers had in the area , A Nightmare on Elm Street was filmed primarily in Illinois .",
