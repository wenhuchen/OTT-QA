  "/wiki/Pincho": "A pincho ( Spanish : [ \u02c8pint\u0283o ] ; literally thorn or spike ) , pintxo ( Basque : [ pint\u0283o ] ) or pinchu ( Asturian : [ \u02c8pint\u0283\u028a ] ) is a small snack , typically eaten in bars , traditional in northern Spain and especially popular in La Rioja , Cantabria , Asturias , the Basque country and Navarra . They are usually eaten in bars or taverns as a small snack while hanging out with friends or relatives ; thus , they have a strong socializing component , and in the Basque country and Navarre they are usually regarded as a cornerstone of local culture and society . They are related to tapas , the main difference being that pinchos are usually 'spiked ' with a skewer or toothpick , often to a piece of bread . They are served in individual portions and always ordered and paid for independently from the drinks . It is not impossible , however , to have the same item called pincho in one place and tapa in another . They are called pinchos because many of them have a pincho ( Spanish for spike ) , typically a toothpick - or a skewer for the larger varieties - through them . They should not be confused with brochettes , which in Latin America and some parts of Spain are called pinchos too ; in brochettes , the skewer or toothpick is needed in order to cook the food or keep it together .",

  "/wiki/Mediterranean_cuisine": "Mediterranean cuisine is the foods and methods of preparation by people of the Mediterranean Basin region . The idea of a Mediterranean cuisine originates with the cookery writer Elizabeth David 's book , A Book of Mediterranean Food ( 1950 ) , though she wrote mainly about French cuisine . She and other writers including the Tunisian historian Mohamed Yassine Essid define the three core elements of the cuisine as the olive , wheat , and the grape , yielding olive oil , bread and pasta , and wine ; other writers emphasize the diversity of the region 's foods and deny that it is a useful concept . The geographical area covered broadly follows the distribution of the olive tree , as noted by David and Essid . The region spans a wide variety of cultures with distinct cuisines , in particular ( going anticlockwise around the region ) the Maghrebi , Egyptian , Levantine , Ottoman ( Turkish ) , Greek , Italian , Proven\u00e7al ( French ) , and Spanish . However , the historical connections of the region , as well as the impact of the Mediterranean Sea on the region 's climate and economy , mean that these cuisines share dishes beyond the core trio of oil , bread , and wine , such as roast lamb or mutton , meat stews with vegetables and tomato ( for example , Spanish andrajos and Italian ciambotta ) , and the salted cured fish roe , bottarga , found across the region . Spirits based on anise are drunk in many countries around the Mediterranean . The cooking of the area is not to be confused with the Mediterranean diet , made popular because of the apparent health benefits of a diet rich in olive oil , wheat and other grains , fruits , vegetables , and a certain amount of seafood , but low in meat and dairy products . Mediterranean cuisine encompasses the ways that these and other ingredients , including meat , are dealt with in the kitchen , whether they are health-giving or not .",

  "/wiki/Shortbread": "Shortbread is a traditional Scottish biscuit ( cookie in American English ) usually made from one part white sugar , two parts butter , and three parts plain wheat flour . Other ingredients like ground rice or cornflour are sometimes added to alter the texture . Modern recipes also often deviate from the original by splitting the sugar into equal parts granulated and icing sugar and many add a portion of salt . Shortbread is so named because of its crumbly texture ( from an old meaning of the word short ) . The cause of this texture is its high fat content , provided by the butter . The short or crumbly texture is a result of the fat inhibiting the formation of long protein ( gluten ) strands . The related word shortening refers to any fat that may be added to produce a short ( crumbly ) texture . Alternatively , the name may be derived from 'shorts ' , the bran and coarse part of meal . Shortbread is different from shortcake , though they are similar : shortcake can be made using vegetable fat instead of butter and usually has a chemical leavening agent such as baking powder , which gives it a different texture . Shortbread biscuits are often associated with normal egg-based biscuits , but they hold their shape under pressure , making them ideal for packed meals . Shortbread originated in Scotland , with the first printed recipe , in 1736 , from a Scotswoman named Mrs McLintock . Shortbread is widely associated with Christmas and Hogmanay festivities in Scotland , and some Scottish brands are exported around the world .",
