It is the seventh-largest country in Africa , bordered by Namibia to the south , the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north , Zambia to the east , and the Atlantic Ocean to the west . Angola has an exclave province , the province of Cabinda that borders the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The capital and largest city of Angola is Luanda . The territory of Angola has been inhabited since the Paleolithic Era , hosting a wide variety of ethnic groups , tribes and kingdoms . The nation state of Angola originated from Portuguese colonisation , which initially began with coastal settlements and trading posts founded in the 16th century . In the 19th century , European settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior . The Portuguese colony that became Angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century because of resistance by groups such as the Cuamato , the Kwanyama and the Mbunda . After a protracted anti-colonial struggle , independence was achieved in 1975 as the Marxist-Leninist People 's Republic of Angola , a one-party state supported by the Soviet Union and Cuba . The civil war between the ruling People 's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ( MPLA ) and the insurgent anti-communist National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) , supported by the United States and apartheid South Africa , lasted until 2002 . The sovereign state has since become a relatively stable unitary , presidential constitutional republic . Angola has vast mineral and petroleum reserves , and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world , especially since the end of the civil war ; however , the standard of living remains low for most of the population , and life expectancy in Angola is among the lowest in the world , while infant mortality is among the highest .",

  "/wiki/Armenia": "The original native Armenian name for the country was \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0584 ( Hayk ) ; however , it is currently rarely used . The contemporary name \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576 ( Hayastan ) became popular in the Middle Ages by addition of the Persian suffix -stan ( place ) . [ citation needed ] . However the origins of the name Hayastan trace back to much earlier dates and were first attested in circa 5th century in the works of Agathangelos , Faustus of Byzantium , Ghazar Parpetsi , Koryun , and Sebeos . The name has traditionally been derived from Hayk ( \u0540\u0561\u0575\u056f ) , the legendary patriarch of the Armenians and a great-great-grandson of Noah , who , according to the 5th-century AD author Moses of Chorene ( Movsis Khorenatsi ) , defeated the Babylonian king Bel in 2492 BC and established his nation in the Ararat region . The further origin of the name is uncertain . It is also further postulated that the name Hay comes from one of the two confederated , Hittite vassal states - the \u1e2aaya\u0161a-Azzi ( 1600-1200 BC ) . The exonym Armenia is attested in the Old Persian Behistun Inscription ( 515 BC ) as Armina ( ) . The Ancient Greek terms \u1f08\u03c1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 ( Armen\u00eda ) and \u1f08\u03c1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 ( Arm\u00e9nioi , Armenians ) are first mentioned by Hecataeus of Miletus ( c. 550 BC - c. 476 BC ) . Xenophon , a Greek general serving in some of the Persian expeditions , describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BC . Some scholars have linked the name Armenia with the Early Bronze Age state of Armani ( Armanum , Armi ) or the Late Bronze Age state of Arme ( Shupria ) .

Today the party operates in Armenia , Artsakh and in countries where the Armenian diaspora is present . Nowadays it constitutes a minor party , and as of December 2018 was represented in two national parliaments with 7 seats in the National Assembly of Artsakh and three seats in the Parliament of Lebanon as part of the March 8 Alliance . The ARF has traditionally advocated democratic socialism and is a full member of the Socialist International since 2003 , which it had originally joined in 1907 . It has the largest membership of the political parties present in the Armenian diaspora , having established affiliates in more than 20 countries . Compared to other Armenian parties which tend to primarily focus on educational or humanitarian projects , the ARF is the most politically oriented of the organizations and traditionally has been one of the staunchest supporters of Armenian nationalism . The party campaigns for the recognition of the Armenian Genocide and the right to reparations . It also advocates the establishment of United Armenia , partially based on the Treaty of S\u00e8vres of 1920 . The ARF became active within the Ottoman Empire in the early 1890s with the aim of unifying the various small groups in the empire that were advocating for reform and defending Armenian villages from massacres that were widespread in some of the Armenian-populated areas of the empire . ARF members formed fedayi groups that defended Armenian civilians through armed resistance . The Dashnaks aspired towards the wider goal of creating a free , independent and unified Armenia , although they nearly always set aside this goal in favor of a more realistic approach , such as advocating autonomy . In 1918 , the party was instrumental in the creation of the First Republic of Armenia , which fell to the Soviet communists in 1920 .",

While German is the country 's official language , many Austrians communicate informally in a variety of Bavarian dialects .

In the 16th century , Austria started serving as the heart of the Habsburg Monarchy and the junior branch of the House of Habsburg - one of the most influential royal dynasties in history . As an archduchy , it was a major component and administrative centre of the Holy Roman Empire . Early in the 19th century , Austria established its own empire , which became a great power and the leading force of the German Confederation but pursued its own course independently of the other German states . Following the Austro-Prussian War and the compromise with Hungary , the Dual Monarchy was established . Austria was involved in World War I under Emperor Franz Joseph following the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand , the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne . After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy , the Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed with the intent of the union with Germany , which eventually failed because of the Allied Powers and the state remained unrecognized .",

It borders Peru to the north , Bolivia to the northeast , Argentina to the east , and the Drake Passage in the far south . Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fern\u00e1ndez , Salas y G\u00f3mez , Desventuradas , and Easter Island in Oceania . Chile also claims about 1,250,000 square kilometres ( 480,000 sq mi ) of Antarctica under the Chilean Antarctic Territory . [ nb 3 ] , The arid Atacama Desert in northern Chile contains great mineral wealth , principally copper and lithium . The relatively small central area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources , and is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century when it incorporated its northern and southern regions . Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands , and features a string of volcanoes and lakes . The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords , inlets , canals , twisting peninsulas , and islands . Spain conquered and colonized the region in the mid-16th century , replacing Inca rule in the north and centre , but failing to conquer the independent Mapuche who inhabited what is now south-central Chile . After declaring its independence from Spain in 1818 , Chile emerged in the 1830s as a relatively stable authoritarian republic . In the 19th century , Chile saw significant economic and territorial growth , ending Mapuche resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in the War of the Pacific ( 1879-83 ) after defeating Peru and Bolivia . In the 1960s and 1970s , the country experienced severe left-right political polarization and turmoil .",
