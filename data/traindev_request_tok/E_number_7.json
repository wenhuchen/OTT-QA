  "/wiki/Anti-foaming_agent": "A defoamer or an anti-foaming agent is a chemical additive that reduces and hinders the formation of foam in industrial process liquids . The terms anti-foam agent and defoamer are often used interchangeably . Strictly speaking , defoamers eliminate existing foam and anti-foamers prevent the formation of further foam . Commonly used agents are insoluble oils , polydimethylsiloxanes and other silicones , certain alcohols , stearates and glycols . The additive is used to prevent formation of foam or is added to break a foam already formed . In industrial processes , foams pose serious problems . They cause defects on surface coatings and prevent the efficient filling of containers . A variety of chemical formulae are available to prevent formation of foams .",
  "/wiki/Anti-caking_agent": "An anticaking agent is an additive placed in powdered or granulated materials , such as table salt or confectioneries , to prevent the formation of lumps ( caking ) and for easing packaging , transport , flowability , and consumption . Caking mechanisms depend on the nature of the material . Crystalline solids often cake by formation of liquid bridge and subsequent fusion of microcrystals . Amorphous materials can cake by glass transitions and changes in viscosity . Polymorphic phase transitions can also induce caking . Some anticaking agents function by absorbing excess moisture or by coating particles and making them water-repellent . Calcium silicate ( CaSiO3 ) , a commonly used anti-caking agent , added to e.g . table salt , absorbs both water and oil . Anticaking agents are also used in non-food items such as road salt , fertilisers , cosmetics , synthetic detergents , and in manufacturing applications . Some studies suggest that anticaking agents may have a negative effect on the nutritional content of food ; one such study indicated that most anti-caking agents result in the additional degradation of vitamin C added to food .",

Chemically , beeswax consists mainly of esters of fatty acids and various long-chain alcohols . Beeswax has been used since prehistory as the first plastic , as a lubricant and waterproofing agent , in lost wax casting of metals and glass , as a polish for wood and leather and for making candles , as an ingredient in cosmetics and as an artistic medium in encaustic painting .

  "/wiki/Flavour_enhancer": "Flavor ( American English ) or flavour ( British English ; see spelling differences ) is the sensory impression of food or other substances , and is determined primarily by the chemical senses of taste and smell . The trigeminal senses , which detect chemical irritants in the mouth and throat , as well as temperature and texture , are also important to the overall gestalt of flavor perception . The flavor of the food , as such , can be altered with natural or artificial flavorants which affect these senses . A flavorant is defined as a substance that gives another substance flavor , altering the characteristics of the solute , causing it to become sweet , sour , tangy , etc . A flavor is a quality of something that affects the sense of taste . Of the three chemical senses , smell is the main determinant of a food item 's flavor . Five basic tastes - sweet , sour , bitter , salty and umami ( savory ) are universally recognized , although some cultures also include pungency and oleogustus ( fattiness ) . The number of food smells is unbounded ; a food 's flavor , therefore , can be easily altered by changing its smell while keeping its taste similar . This is exemplified in artificially flavored jellies , soft drinks and candies , which , while made of bases with a similar taste , have dramatically different flavors due to the use of different scents or fragrances . The flavorings of commercially produced food products are typically created by flavorists . Although the terms flavoring and flavorant in common language denote the combined chemical sensations of taste and smell , the same terms are used in the fragrance and flavors industry to refer to edible chemicals and extracts that alter the flavor of food and food products through the sense of smell . Due to the high cost or unavailability of natural flavor extracts , most commercial flavorants are nature-identical , which means that they are the chemical equivalent of natural flavors , but chemically synthesized rather than being extracted from source materials .",

  "/wiki/E913": "Lanolin ( from Latin l\u0101na wool , and oleum oil ) , also called wool yolk , wool wax , or wool grease , is a wax secreted by the sebaceous glands of wool-bearing animals . Lanolin used by humans comes from domestic sheep breeds that are raised specifically for their wool . Historically , many pharmacopoeias have referred to lanolin as wool fat ( adeps lanae ) ; however , as lanolin lacks glycerides ( glycerol esters ) , it is not a true fat . Lanolin primarily consists of sterol esters instead . Lanolin 's waterproofing property aids sheep in shedding water from their coats . Certain breeds of sheep produce large amounts of lanolin . Lanolin 's role in nature is to protect wool and skin from climate and the environment ; it also plays a role in skin ( integumental ) hygiene . Lanolin and its derivatives are used in the protection , treatment and beautification of human skin .",

  "/wiki/Polyethylene": "Polyethylene or polythene ( abbreviated PE ; IUPAC name polyethene or poly ( methylene ) ) is the most common plastic . As of 2017 [ update ] , over 100 million tonnes of polyethylene resins are produced annually , accounting for 34% of the total plastics market . Its primary use is in packaging ( plastic bags , plastic films , geomembranes , containers including bottles , etc. ) . Many kinds of polyethylene are known , with most having the chemical formula ( C2H4 ) n. PE is usually a mixture of similar polymers of ethylene with various values of n. Polyethylene is a thermoplastic ; however , it can become a thermoset plastic when modified ( such as cross-linked polyethylene ) .",
  "/wiki/E915": "Rosin , also called colophony or Greek pitch ( Latin : pix gr\u00e6ca ) , is a solid form of resin obtained from pines and some other plants , mostly conifers , produced by heating fresh liquid resin to vaporize the volatile liquid terpene components . It is semi-transparent and varies in color from yellow to black . At room temperature rosin is brittle , but it melts at stove-top temperature . It chiefly consists of various resin acids , especially abietic acid . The term colophony comes from colophonia resina , Latin for resin from Colophon , an ancient Ionic city .",
