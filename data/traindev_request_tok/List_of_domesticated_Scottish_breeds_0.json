The cat is either a house cat , a farm cat or a feral cat ; latter ranges freely and avoids human contact . Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt rodents . About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries . The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species , has a strong flexible body , quick reflexes , sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey . Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed . Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing , purring , trilling , hissing , growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language . It is a solitary hunter , but a social species . It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears , such as those made by mice and other small mammals . It is a predator that is most active at dawn and dusk .

They are used as riding animals and draft animals ( oxen or bullocks , which pull carts , plows and other implements ) . Another product of cattle is dung , which can be used to create manure or fuel . In some regions , such as parts of India , cattle have significant religious meaning . Cattle , mostly small breeds such as the Miniature Zebu , are also kept as pets .

  "/wiki/Rough_Collie": "The Rough Collie ( also known as the Long-Haired Collie ) is a long-coated dog breed of medium to large size that , in its original form , was a type of collie used and bred for herding sheep in Scotland . Originating in the 1800s , the breed is now well known through the works of author Albert Payson Terhune , beginning with books about Lad , and through Lassie novels , movies , and television shows . Rough Collies generally come in shades of sable and white ( sometimes mahogany ) , blue merle , tri-colored , and white . The breed has a distinctive long tapered snout and tipped ears . There is a smooth-coated variety known as a Smooth Collie ; some breed organisations , including both the American and Canadian Kennel Clubs , consider the smooth-coat and rough-coat breeds to be variations of the same breed . Rough Collies closely resemble the smaller Shetland Sheepdog or Sheltie , but the two breeds do not have an exclusive linear relationship .",
