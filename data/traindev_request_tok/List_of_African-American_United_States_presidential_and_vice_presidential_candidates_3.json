  "/wiki/1848_United_States_presidential_election": "The 1848 United States presidential election was the 16th quadrennial presidential election , held on Tuesday , November 7 , 1848 . In the aftermath of the Mexican-American War , General Zachary Taylor of the Whig Party defeated Senator Lewis Cass of the Democratic Party . The contest was the first presidential election that took place on the same day in every state , and it was the first time that Election Day was statutorily a Tuesday . Despite Taylor 's unclear political affiliations and beliefs , and the Whig opposition to the Mexican-American War , the 1848 Whig National Convention nominated the popular general over party stalwarts such as Henry Clay and Daniel Webster . For vice president , the Whigs nominated Millard Fillmore , a New York Whig known for his moderate views on slavery . Incumbent President James K. Polk , a Democrat , honored his promise not to seek re-election , leaving his party 's nomination open . The 1848 Democratic National Convention rejected former President Martin Van Buren 's bid for a second term , instead nominating Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan . Van Buren broke from his party to lead the ticket of the Free Soil Party , which opposed the extension of slavery into the territories . The Whig choice of Zachary Taylor was made almost out of desperation ; he was not clearly committed to Whig principles , but he was popular for leading the war effort . The Democrats had a record of prosperity and had acquired the Mexican cession and parts of Oregon country . It appeared almost certain that they would win unless the Whigs picked Taylor . Taylor won a plurality of the popular vote and a majority of the electoral vote , while Van Buren won 10.1% of the popular vote , a strong showing for a third party candidate .",
  "/wiki/Frederick_Douglass": "Frederick Douglass ( born Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey ; c. February 1818 - February 20 , 1895 ) was an American social reformer , abolitionist , orator , writer , and statesman . After escaping from slavery in Maryland , he became a national leader of the abolitionist movement in Massachusetts and New York , gaining note for his oratory and incisive antislavery writings . In his time , he was described by abolitionists as a living counter-example to slaveholders ' arguments that slaves lacked the intellectual capacity to function as independent American citizens . Northerners at the time found it hard to believe that such a great orator had once been a slave . Douglass wrote several autobiographies . He described his experiences as a slave in his 1845 autobiography , Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass , an American Slave , which became a bestseller , and was influential in promoting the cause of abolition , as was his second book , My Bondage and My Freedom ( 1855 ) . After the Civil War , Douglass remained an active campaigner against slavery and wrote his last autobiography , Life and Times of Frederick Douglass . First published in 1881 and revised in 1892 , three years before his death , it covered events during and after the Civil War . Douglass also actively supported women 's suffrage , and held several public offices . Without his approval , Douglass became the first African American nominated for Vice President of the United States as the running mate and Vice Presidential nominee of Victoria Woodhull , on the Equal Rights Party ticket . Douglass was a firm believer in the equality of all peoples , whether white , black , female , Native American , or Chinese immigrants . He was also a believer in dialogue and in making alliances across racial and ideological divides , and in the liberal values of the U.S. Constitution .",
  "/wiki/Liberty_Party_(1840s)": "The Liberty Party was a minor political party in the United States in the 1840s ( with some offshoots surviving into the 1860s ) . The party was an early advocate of the abolitionist cause and it broke away from the American Anti-Slavery Society ( AASS ) to advocate the view that the Constitution was an anti-slavery document . William Lloyd Garrison , leader of the AASS , held the contrary view , that the Constitution should be condemned as an evil pro-slavery document . The party included abolitionists who were willing to work within electoral politics to try to influence people to support their goals . By contrast , the radical Garrison opposed voting and working within the system . Many Liberty Party members joined the anti-slavery ( but not abolitionist ) Free Soil Party in 1848 and eventually helped establish the Republican Party in the 1850s .",

Smith , a significant financial contributor to the Liberty Party and the Republican Party throughout his life , spent much time and money working towards social progress in the nineteenth-century United States . Besides making substantial donations of both land and money to create Timbuctoo , an African-American community in North Elba , New York , he was involved in the temperance movement and the colonization movement , before abandoning colonization in favor of abolitionism , the immediate freeing of all the slaves . He was a member of the Secret Six who financially supported John Brown 's raid at Harpers Ferry , in 1859 . Brown 's farm , in North Elba , was on land he bought from Smith .",

It was the third of five U.S. presidential elections ( and second within 12 years ) in which the winner did not win a plurality of the national popular vote . Cleveland , the first Democratic president since the American Civil War , was unanimously re-nominated at the 1888 Democratic National Convention . He was the first incumbent president to win re-nomination since Ulysses S. Grant was nominated to a second term in 1872 . Harrison , the grandson of former President William Henry Harrison , emerged as the Republican nominee on the eighth ballot of the 1888 Republican National Convention . He defeated other prominent party leaders such as Senator John Sherman and former Governor Russell Alger . Tariff policy was the principal issue in the election , as Cleveland had proposed a dramatic reduction in tariffs , arguing that high tariffs were unfair to consumers . Harrison took the side of industrialists and factory workers who wanted to keep tariffs high . Cleveland 's opposition to Civil War pensions and inflated currency also made enemies among veterans and farmers . On the other hand , he held a strong hand in the South and border states , and appealed to former Republican Mugwumps . Cleveland won a plurality of the popular vote , but Harrison won the election with a majority in the Electoral College .",
  "/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)": "The Republican Party , also referred to as the GOP ( Grand Old Party ) , is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States ; the other is its historic rival , the Democratic Party . The GOP was founded in 1854 by opponents of the Kansas-Nebraska Act , which allowed for the potential expansion of slavery into certain U.S. territories . The party supported classical liberalism , opposed the expansion of slavery , and supported economic reform . Abraham Lincoln was the first Republican president . Under the leadership of Lincoln and a Republican Congress , slavery was banned in the United States in 1865 . The Party was generally dominant during the Third Party System and the Fourth Party System . After 1912 , the Party underwent an ideological shift to the right . Following the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the party 's core base shifted , with Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics . The party 's 21st-century base of support includes people living in rural areas , men , people without college degrees , the elderly , white Americans , and evangelical Christians . The 21st-century Republican Party ideology is American conservatism , which incorporates both economic policies and social values . The GOP supports lower taxes , free market capitalism , restrictions on immigration , increased military spending , gun rights , restrictions on abortion , deregulation and restrictions on labor unions . After the Supreme Court 's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade , the Republican Party opposed abortion in its party platform and grew its support among evangelicals .",

The Republican nominee , former Vice President Richard Nixon , defeated the Democratic nominee , incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey . Analysts have argued the election of 1968 was a major realigning election as it permanently disrupted the New Deal Coalition that had dominated presidential politics for 36 years . Incumbent Democratic United States President Lyndon B. Johnson had been the early front-runner for his party 's nomination , but he announced his withdrawal from the race after anti-Vietnam War candidate United States Senator Eugene McCarthy finished second in the New Hampshire primary . McCarthy , former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy , and Vice President Hubert Humphrey emerged as the three major candidates in the Democratic primaries until Kennedy was assassinated on June 5 , 1968 at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles , California . Humphrey won the presidential nomination at the 1968 Democratic National Convention , which saw numerous anti-war protests . Nixon entered the 1968 Republican primaries as the front-runner , and he defeated Nelson Rockefeller , Ronald Reagan , and other candidates at the 1968 Republican National Convention to win his party 's nomination . Governor George Wallace of Alabama ran on the American Independent Party ticket , campaigning in favor of racial segregation . The election year was tumultuous ; it was marked by the assassination of Civil Rights Movement leader Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4 , 1968 in Memphis , Tennessee , subsequent King assassination riots across the nation , the assassination of Kennedy , and widespread opposition to the Vietnam War across university campuses . Nixon ran on a campaign that promised to restore law and order to the nation 's cities and provide new leadership in the Vietnam War .

  "/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)": "The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States , along with its main rival , the Republican Party . Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison 's Democratic-Republican Party , the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson , making it the world 's oldest active political party . In its early years , the Party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s , the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform . Well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings ; following the New Deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South . The New Deal Coalition of 1932-1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction - many of whom were Catholics based in the cities . After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the core bases of the two parties shifted , with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic . The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s . White evangelicals and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local levels since the 1990s . People living in urban areas , women , college graduates , sexual and gender minorities , millennials , and black , Latino , Jewish , Muslim and Asian Americans tend to support the Democratic Party . The Democratic Party 's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality , along with the welfare state . It seeks to provide government regulation in the economy .",

Nixon easily swept aside challenges from two Republican congressmen in the 1972 Republican primaries to win re-nomination . McGovern , who had played a significant role in reforming the Democratic nomination system after the 1968 election , mobilized the anti-war movement and other liberal supporters to win his party 's nomination . Among the candidates he defeated were early front-runner Edmund Muskie , 1968 nominee Hubert Humphrey , and Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm , the first African-American to run for a major party 's presidential nomination . Nixon emphasized the strong economy and his success in foreign affairs , while McGovern ran on a platform calling for an immediate end to the Vietnam War , and the institution of a guaranteed minimum income . Nixon maintained a large and consistent lead in polling . Separately , Nixon 's reelection committee broke into the Watergate complex to wiretap the Democratic National Committee 's headquarters , a scandal that would later be known as Watergate .

On the last day of the convention , Lawrence F. O'Brien departed and Burke was left to preside for about fourteen hours . The convention nominated Senator George McGovern of South Dakota for president and Senator Thomas Eagleton of Missouri for vice president . Eagleton withdrew from the race just 19 days later after it was disclosed that he had previously undergone mental health treatment , including electroshock therapy , and he was replaced on the ballot by Sargent Shriver of Maryland , a Kennedy in-law . The convention , which has been described as a disastrous start to the general election campaign , was one of the most unusual - perhaps the most contentious in the history of the Democratic Party since 1924 - with sessions beginning in the early evening and lasting until sunrise the next morning . Previously excluded political activists gained influence at the expense of elected officials and traditional core Democratic constituencies such as organized labor . A protracted vice presidential nominating process delayed McGovern 's acceptance speech ( which he considered the best speech of his life ) until 2:48 a.m. - after most television viewers had gone to bed .

As a senator , McGovern was an example of modern American liberalism . He became most known for his outspoken opposition to the growing U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War . He staged a brief nomination run in the 1968 presidential election as a stand-in for the assassinated Robert F. Kennedy . The subsequent McGovern-Fraser Commission fundamentally altered the presidential nominating process , by greatly increasing the number of caucuses and primaries and reducing the influence of party insiders .

Founded after the American Revolution as the seat of government of the newly independent country , Washington was named after George Washington , the first president of the United States and a Founding Father . As the seat of the United States federal government and several international organizations , Washington is an important world political capital . The city , located on the Potomac River bordering Maryland and Virginia , is one of the most visited cities in the world , with more than 20 million tourists annually . The signing of the Residence Act on July 16 , 1790 , approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River on the country 's East Coast . The U.S. Constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress , and the District is therefore not a part of any U.S. state . The states of Maryland and Virginia each donated land to form the federal district , which included the pre-existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria . The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital . In 1846 , Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia , including the city of Alexandria ; in 1871 , it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the District . Washington had an estimated population of 702,455 as of July 2018 [ update ] , making it the 20th most populous city in the United States .

Reagan touted a strong economic recovery from the 1970s stagflation and the 1981-82 recession , as well as the widespread perception that his presidency had overseen a revival of national confidence and prestige . The Reagan campaign produced effective television advertising and deftly neutralized concerns regarding Reagan 's age . Mondale criticized Reagan 's supply-side economic policies and budget deficits , and he called for a nuclear freeze and ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment . Reagan won 58.8% of the popular vote and carried 49 of the 50 states , becoming the oldest person to win a presidential election . Reagan 's showing ranks fifth in the share of electoral votes received and fifth in the share of the popular vote won .

Unlike primary elections in most other U.S. states , where registered voters go to polling places to cast ballots , Iowans instead gather at local caucus meetings to discuss and vote on the candidates . During both the presidential and midterm election seasons , registered Iowan voters vote in a per-precinct caucus for the party of which they are registered as a member . The caucuses are also held to select delegates to county conventions and party committees , among other party activities . The Iowa caucuses are noteworthy as the first major contest of the United States presidential primary season . Although caucus-goers have been unrepresentative of the nation 's overall ethnic demographic , caucuses are still seen by some as a strong indicator of how a presidential candidate will do in later contests . This could be seen as a self-fulfilling prophecy , however , due to the positioning of the Iowa caucus as the first major contest in the election season ; being the first , it strongly influences later races and provides candidates with momentum going into the following contests .
