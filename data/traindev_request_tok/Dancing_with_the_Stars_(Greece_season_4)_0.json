  "/wiki/Singer": "Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality , rhythm , and a variety of vocal techniques . A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist ( in jazz and popular music ) . Singers perform music ( arias , recitatives , songs , etc . ) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments . Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians , such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists . Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument ( as in art song or some jazz styles ) up to a symphony orchestra or big band . Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera , Indian music and religious music styles such as gospel , traditional music styles , world music , jazz , blues , ghazal and popular music styles such as pop , rock , electronic dance music and filmi ( Indian film songs ) . Singing can be formal or informal , arranged or improvised . It may be done as a form of religious devotion , as a hobby , as a source of pleasure , comfort or ritual , as part of music education or as a profession . Excellence in singing requires time , dedication , instruction and regular practice . If practice is done on a regular basis then the sounds can become more clear and strong . Professional singers usually build their careers around one specific musical genre , such as classical or rock , although there are singers with crossover success ( singing in more than one genre ) .",

This way , personal trainers can figure out what kind of stress their client may be putting on certain areas of the body during their every day lives . Qualified personal trainers or certified personal trainers ( CPTs ) recognize their own areas of expertise . If a trainer suspects that one of their clients has a medical condition that could prevent the client from safe participation in an exercise program , they must refer the client to the proper health professional for prior clearance .",

  "/wiki/Olympic_Games": "The modern Olympic Games or Olympics ( French : Jeux olympiques ) are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions . The Olympic Games are considered the world 's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating . The Olympic Games are held every four years , with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart . Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games ( Ancient Greek : \u1f48\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u1f08\u03b3\u1ff6\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 ) , which were held in Olympia , Greece , from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD . Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) in 1894 , leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896 . The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement , with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority . The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games . Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports , the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability , the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18 , the five Continental games ( Pan American , African , Asian , European , and Pacific ) , and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games . The Deaflympics and Special Olympics are also endorsed by the IOC . The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic , political , and technological advancements . The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism , as envisioned by Coubertin , to allowing participation of professional athletes . The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games .",

  "/wiki/Fashion_design": "Fashion design is the art of applying design , aesthetics and natural beauty to clothing and its accessories . It is influenced by cultural and social attitudes , and has varied over time and place . Fashion designers work in a number of ways in designing clothing and accessories such as bracelets and necklaces . Because of the time required to bring a garment onto the market , designers must at times anticipate changes to consumer tastes . Designers conduct research on fashion trends and interpret them for their audience . Their specific designs are used by manufacturers . This is the essence of a designer 's role ; however , there is variation within this that is determined by the buying and merchandising approach , and product quality ; for example , budget retailers will use inexpensive fabrics to interpret trends , but high-end retailers will ensure that the best available fabrics are used . Fashion designers attempt to design clothes which are functional as well as aesthetically pleasing . They consider who is likely to wear a garment and the situations in which it will be worn , and they work within a wide range of materials , colors , patterns and styles . Though most clothing worn for everyday wear falls within a narrow range of conventional styles , unusual garments are usually sought for special occasions such as evening wear or party dresses . Some clothes are made specifically for an individual , as in the case of haute couture or bespoke tailoring . Today , most clothing is designed for the mass market , especially casual and every-day wear are called ready to wear .",
