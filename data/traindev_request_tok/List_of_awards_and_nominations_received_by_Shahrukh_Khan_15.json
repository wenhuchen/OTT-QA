Since the foundation of the first Moroccan state by Idris I in 788 AD , the country has been ruled by a series of independent dynasties , reaching its zenith under Almoravid and Almohad rule , when it spanned parts of Iberia and northwestern Africa . The Marinid and Saadi dynasties resisted foreign domination into the 17th century , allowing Morocco to remain the only northwest African country to avoid Ottoman occupation . The Alaouite dynasty , which rules to this day , seized power in 1631 . The country 's strategic location near the mouth of the Mediterranean attracted the interest of Europe , and in 1912 , Morocco was divided into French and Spanish protectorates , with an international zone in Tangier . It regained its independence in 1956 , and has since remained comparatively stable and prosperous by regional standards , with the fifth largest economy in Africa .",

  "/wiki/Goodwill_ambassador": "A goodwill ambassador is a person who advocates for a specific cause or global issue on the basis of their notability as a public figure . Goodwill ambassadors generally deliver goodwill by promoting ideals from one entity to another , or to a population . The term should be distinguished from the related concept of a brand ambassador , who plays a role in promoting a company or product through personal interaction . A goodwill ambassador may be an individual from one country who resides in or travels to another country , on a diplomatic mission ( or international friendship mission ) at a peer to peer level ; that is : country to country , state to state , city to city , or as an intermediate emissary representative of the people of a specific organization or cultural group such as an indigenous tribe or enclave population . Goodwill ambassadors have been a part of governments and countries for as long as diplomacy has existed . They represent their constituents by traveling abroad exchanging or delivering gifts and presents while bringing awareness to their cause or purpose through public relations activities and organizing events . Goodwill ambassadors are responsible for delivering humanitarian relief , implementing public programs and providing development assistance to demonstrate benevolence and compassion between parties . Most often nation-states and organizations use well-known celebrities such as actors , actresses , musicians , scientists , authors , former politicians and other high society figures ; but they also engage civilians and government officials to fulfill the role . Goodwill missions of US states and international nations are usually carried out or overseen by the head of state , but do not necessarily involve official diplomatic credentials beyond a letter of presentation , letters patent or a letter of credence , it is very rare that goodwill ambassadors are ever issued a diplomatic passport . However , some countries , such as Haiti , do issue credentials that include diplomatic immunity for goodwill ambassadors and organizations sometimes issue a civil service credential or international identification such as a laissez-passer .",

Members are elected to represent constituencies by the first-past-the-post system and hold their seats until Parliament is dissolved . The House of Commons of England started to evolve in the 13th and 14th centuries . It became the House of Commons of Great Britain after the political union with Scotland in 1707 , and assumed the title of House of Commons of Great Britain and Ireland after the political union with Ireland at the start of the 19th century . The United Kingdom referred to was the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 1800 , and became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland after the independence of the Irish Free State in 1922 . Accordingly , the House of Commons assumed its current title . Under the Parliament Act 1911 , the Lords ' power to reject legislation was reduced to a delaying power . The government is solely responsible to the House of Commons and the prime minister stays in office only as long as he or she retains the confidence of a majority of the Commons ."
