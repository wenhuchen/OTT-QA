  "/wiki/Ontario": "Ontario is one of the thirteen provinces and territories of Canada . Located in Central Canada , it is Canada 's most populous province , with 38.3 percent of the country 's population , and is the second-largest province in total area . Ontario is fourth-largest jurisdiction in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are included . It is home to the nation 's capital city , Ottawa , and the nation 's most populous city , Toronto , which is also Ontario 's provincial capital . Ontario is bordered by the province of Manitoba to the west , Hudson Bay and James Bay to the north , and Quebec to the east and northeast , and to the south by the U.S. states of ( from west to east ) Minnesota , Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and New York .

  "/wiki/Governor_General_of_Canada": "The Governor General of Canada ( French : Gouverneure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada [ n 1 ] ) is the federal viceregal representative of the Canadian monarch , currently Queen Elizabeth II . The person of the sovereign is shared equally both with the 15 other Commonwealth realms and the 10 provinces of Canada , but resides predominantly in her oldest and most populous realm , the United Kingdom . The Queen , on the advice of her Canadian prime minister , appoints a governor general to carry out most of her constitutional and ceremonial duties . The commission is for an unfixed period of time - known as serving at Her Majesty 's pleasure - though five years is the normal convention . Beginning in 1959 , it has also been traditional to rotate between anglophone and francophone officeholders - although many recent governors general have been bilingual . Once in office , the governor general maintains direct contact with the Queen , wherever she may be at the time . The office began in the 16th and 17th centuries with the Crown-appointed governors of the French colony of Canada followed by the British governors of Canada in the 18th and 19th centuries . Subsequently , the office is , along with the Crown , the oldest continuous institution in Canada . The present incarnation of the office emerged with Canadian Confederation and the passing of the British North America Act , 1867 , which defines the role of the governor general as carrying on the Government of Canada on behalf and in the Name of the Queen , by whatever Title he is designated . Although the post initially still represented the government of the United Kingdom ( that is , the monarch in her British council ) , the office was gradually Canadianized until , with the passage of the Statute of Westminster in 1931 and the establishment of a separate and uniquely Canadian monarchy , the governor general became the direct personal representative of the independently and uniquely Canadian sovereign , the monarch in his Canadian council . Throughout this process of gradually increasing Canadian independence , the role of governor general took on additional responsibilities . For example , in 1904 , the Militia Act granted permission for the governor general to use the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian militia , while Command-in-Chief remained vested in the sovereign , and in 1927 the first official international visit by a governor general was made .",

  "/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada": "The prime minister of Canada ( French : premier ministre du Canada ) is the primary Minister of the Crown , chair of the Cabinet , and Canada 's head of government . The current , and 23rd , prime minister of Canada is the Liberal Party 's Justin Trudeau , following the 2019 Canadian federal election . Canadian prime ministers are styled as The Right Honourable ( French : Le Tr\u00e8s Honorable ) , a privilege maintained for life . The prime minister of Canada is in charge of the Prime Minister 's Office . The prime minister also chooses the ministers who make up the Cabinet . The two groups , with the authority of the Parliament of Canada , manage the Government of Canada and the Canadian Armed Forces . The Cabinet and the prime minister also appoint members of the Senate of Canada , the judges of the Supreme Court of Canada and other federal courts , and the leaders and boards , as required under law , of various Crown Corporations , and selects the governor general of Canada . Under the Canadian constitution , all of the power to exercise these activities is actually vested in the monarch of Canada , but in practice the monarch ( who is the head of state ) or her representative , the governor general of Canada , approves them routinely , and their role is largely ceremonial , and their powers are only exercised under the advice of the prime minister . Not outlined in any constitutional document , the office exists only as per long-established convention ( originating in Canada 's former colonial power , the United Kingdom ) that stipulates the monarch 's representative , the governor general , must select as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons ; this individual is typically the leader of the political party that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber .

His tenure of 15 years and 164 days makes him Canada 's third longest-serving Prime Minister , behind William Lyon Mackenzie King and John A. Macdonald . Trudeau rose to prominence as a lawyer , intellectual , and activist in Quebec politics . He joined the Liberal Party of Canada and was elected to the Canadian Parliament in 1965 , quickly being appointed as Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson 's Parliamentary Secretary . In 1967 , he was appointed Minister of Justice . Trudeau 's outgoing personality caused a media sensation , inspiring Trudeaumania , and helped him to win the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1968 , when he was appointed Prime Minister of Canada . From the late 1960s until the early 1980s , Trudeau 's personality dominated the political scene to an extent never before seen in Canadian political life . After his appointment as Prime Minister , he won the 1968 , 1972 and 1974 elections , before narrowly losing in 1979 . He won a fourth election victory shortly afterwards , in 1980 , and eventually retired from politics shortly before the 1984 election . Despite his personal motto , Reason before passion , his personality and political career aroused polarizing reactions throughout Canada during his time in office . Admirers praised what they consider to be the force of Trudeau 's intellect and his political acumen , maintaining national unity over the Quebec sovereignty movement , suppressing a Quebec terrorist crisis , fostering a pan-Canadian identity , and in achieving sweeping institutional reform , including the implementation of official bilingualism , patriation of the Constitution , and the establishment of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . Critics accused him of arrogance , of economic mismanagement , and of unduly centralizing Canadian decision-making to the detriment of the culture of Quebec and the economy of the Prairies .",

Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived on two major river systems , what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system . A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson 's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert 's Land . During the next 200 years , communities continued to grow and evolve , with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg . The assertion of M\u00e9tis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba . There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the M\u00e9tis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion .

  "/wiki/Black_Canadian": "Black Canadians is a designation used for people of full or partial Sub-Saharan African descent , who are citizens or permanent residents of Canada . The majority of Black Canadians are of Caribbean origin , though the population also consists of African-American immigrants and their descendants ( including Black Nova Scotians ) , as well as many native African immigrants . Black Canadians often draw a distinction between those of Afro-Caribbean ancestry and those of other African roots . The term African Canadian is occasionally used by some Black Canadians who trace their heritage to the first slaves brought by British and French colonists to the North American mainland . Promised freedom by the British during the American Revolutionary War , thousands of Black Loyalists were resettled by the Crown in Canada afterward , such as Thomas Peters . In addition , an estimated ten to thirty thousand fugitive slaves reached freedom in Canada from the Southern United States during the antebellum years , aided by people along the Underground Railroad . Many Black people of Caribbean origin in Canada reject the term African Canadian as an elision of the uniquely Caribbean aspects of their heritage , and instead identify as Caribbean Canadian . Unlike in the United States , where African American has become a widely used term , in Canada controversies associated with distinguishing African or Caribbean heritage have resulted in the term Black Canadian being widely accepted there . Black Canadians have contributed to many areas of Canadian culture . Many of the first visible minorities to hold high public offices have been Black , including Micha\u00eblle Jean , Donald Oliver , Stanley G. Grizzle , Rosemary Brown and Lincoln Alexander , in turn opening the door for other minorities . Black Canadians form the third-largest visible minority group in Canada , after South Asian and Chinese Canadians .",
