  "/wiki/ISO_639-3": "ISO 639-3:2007 , Codes for the representation of names of languages - Part 3 : Alpha-3 code for comprehensive coverage of languages , is an international standard for language codes in the ISO 639 series . It defines three-letter codes for identifying languages . The standard was published by ISO on 1 February 2007 . ISO 639-3 extends the ISO 639-2 alpha-3 codes with an aim to cover all known natural languages . The extended language coverage was based primarily on the language codes used in the Ethnologue ( volumes 10-14 ) published by SIL International , which is now the registration authority for ISO 639-3 . It provides an enumeration of languages as complete as possible , including living and extinct , ancient and constructed , major and minor , written and unwritten . However , it does not include reconstructed languages such as Proto-Indo-European . ISO 639-3 is intended for use as metadata codes in a wide range of applications . It is widely used in computer and information systems , such as the Internet , in which many languages need to be supported . In archives and other information storage , they are used in cataloging systems , indicating what language a resource is in or about . The codes are also frequently used in the linguistic literature and elsewhere to compensate for the fact that language names may be obscure or ambiguous .",

It was developed in ancient India from the 1st to the 4th century CE and was in regular use by the 7th century CE . The Devanagari script , composed of 47 primary characters including 14 vowels and 33 consonants , is one of the most adopted writing systems in the world , being used for over 120 languages . The ancient Nagari script for Sanskrit had two additional consonantal characters . The orthography of this script reflects the pronunciation of the language . Unlike the Latin alphabet , the script has no concept of letter case . It is written from left to right , has a strong preference for symmetrical rounded shapes within squared outlines and is recognisable by a horizontal line that runs along the top of full letters . In a cursory look , the Devanagari script appears different from other Indic scripts such as Bengali , Odia or Gurmukhi , but a closer examination reveals they are very similar except for angles and structural emphasis . Among the languages using it - as either their only script or one of their scripts - are P\u0101\u1e37i , Sanskrit , Hindi , Nepali , Sherpa , Prakrit , Apabhramsha , Awadhi , Bhojpuri , Braj Bhasha , Chhattisgarhi , Haryanvi , Magahi , Nagpuri , Rajasthani , Bhili , Dogri , Marathi , Maithili , Kashmiri , Konkani , Sindhi , Bodo , Nepalbhasa , Mundari and Santali .
