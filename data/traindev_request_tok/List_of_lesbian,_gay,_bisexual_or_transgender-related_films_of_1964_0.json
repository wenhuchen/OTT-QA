It stars Francis Lacombrade as Georges , Didier Haudepin as Alexandre and Michel Bouquet as P\u00e8re de Trennes . It was released in English as This Special Friendship . The film was produced by Christine Gouze-R\u00e9nal , whose sister Danielle was the wife of future French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand . The filming location for the movie was the 13th-century Royaumont Abbey , some 50 km north of Paris . The movie is mostly true to the novel , changing only relatively minor plot points such as Alexandre 's suicide from poisoning to death by throwing himself from a train . Also , Alexandre in the movie is brown-haired , not blond , which also removes some of the inside jokes between Alexandre and Georges which are present in the book . On the set of the film , Peyrefitte , who was 57-years-old at the time , met the 12-year-old aristocrat Alain-Philippe Malagnac d'Argens de Vill\u00e8le who had been cast as a choir boy and was a big fan of the book . Not only did Peyrefitte sign Alain-Philippe 's copy of the book but the two also fell in love , pursuing a stormy relationship that Peyrefitte chronicled in some of his later novels such as Notre amour ( 1967 ) and L'enfant de c\u0153ur ( 1978 ) . Alain-Philippe Malagnac was later married to the French entertainer Amanda Lear and died in a house fire in 2000 at the age of forty-nine , shortly after Peyrefitte 's death . It is unknown whether this was a suicide , even though Peyrefitte in his novels describes a suicide pact between the two , i.e . their intention to commit suicide if the other one dies .",

Huston studied and worked as a fine art painter in Paris in his early years . He explored the visual aspects of his films throughout his career , sketching each scene on paper beforehand , then carefully framing his characters during the shooting . While most directors rely on post-production editing to shape their final work , Huston instead created his films while they were being shot , with little editing needed . Some of Huston 's films were adaptations of important novels , often depicting an heroic quest , as in Moby Dick , or The Red Badge of Courage . In many films , different groups of people , while struggling toward a common goal , would become doomed , forming destructive alliances , giving the films a dramatic and visual tension .
