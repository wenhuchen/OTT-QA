The local government county is now divided between two local government areas : the Highland area and Na h-Eileanan Siar ( the Western Isles ) . Ross and Cromarty border Sutherland to the north and Inverness-shire to the south . The county was formed by the uniting of the shires of Ross-shire and Cromartyshire . Both these shires had themselves been formed from the historic province of Ross , out of which the many enclaves and exclaves that formed Cromartyshire were carved out , leaving the remaining area to become Ross-shire . These parcels of land were for many purposes administered as part of Ross-shire rather than Cromartyshire .
