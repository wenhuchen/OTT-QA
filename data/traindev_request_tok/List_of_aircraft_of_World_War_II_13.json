  "/wiki/Arado_Ar_232": "The Arado Ar 232 Tausendf\u00fc\u00dfler ( German : Millipede ) , sometimes also called Tatzelwurm , was a cargo aircraft , designed and built in small numbers by the German firm Arado Flugzeugwerke during World War II . The design introduced , or brought together , almost all of the features now considered to be standard in modern cargo transport aircraft designs , including a box-like fuselage slung beneath a high wing ; a rear loading ramp ( that had first appeared on the December 1939-flown Junkers Ju 90 V5 fifth prototype four-engined transport via its Trapoklappe ) ; a high-mounted twin tail for easy access to the hold ; and various features for operating from rough fields . Although the Luftwaffe was interested in replacing or supplementing its fleet of outdated Junkers Ju 52/3m transports , it had an abundance of types in production at the time , and did not purchase large numbers of the Ar 232 .",

  "/wiki/Avro_Lancastrian": "The Avro 691 Lancastrian was a Canadian and British passenger and mail transport aircraft of the 1940s and 1950s developed from the Avro Lancaster heavy bomber . The Lancaster was named after Lancaster , Lancashire ; a Lancastrian is an inhabitant of Lancashire . The Lancastrian was basically a modified Lancaster bomber without armour or armament and with the gun turrets replaced by streamlined metal fairings , including a new nose section . The initial batch was converted directly from Lancasters ; later batches were new builds .",
  "/wiki/Avro_York": "The Avro York was a British transport aircraft developed by Avro during the Second World War . The design was derived from the Avro Lancaster heavy bomber , several sections of the York and Lancaster being identical . Due to the importance of Lancaster production , York output proceeded at a slow pace until 1944 , after which a higher priority was placed upon transport aircraft . The York saw service in military and civilian roles with various operators between 1943 and 1964 . In civilian service , British South American Airways ( BSAA ) and British Overseas Airways Corporation ( BOAC ) were the largest users of the type . In military service , large numbers of Yorks were used for air-supply missions during the Berlin Blockade 1948-49 . A number of the type were used as air transports of heads of state and government ; VIPs who flew on Yorks , included British Prime Minister Winston Churchill , French General Charles de Gaulle , Indian Governor-General Lord Mountbatten and South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts .",
  "/wiki/Boeing_247": "The Boeing Model 247 was an early United States airliner , considered the first such aircraft to fully incorporate advances such as all-metal ( anodized aluminium ) semimonocoque construction , a fully cantilevered wing and retractable landing gear . Other advanced features included control surface trim tabs , an autopilot and de-icing boots for the wings and tailplane . Ordered off the drawing board , the 247 first flew on February 8 , 1933 and entered service later that year . Subsequent development in airliner design saw engines and airframes becoming larger and four-engined designs emerged , but no significant changes to this basic formula appeared until cabin pressurization and high altitude cruise were introduced in 1940 , with the Boeing 307 Stratoliner .",
  "/wiki/Boeing_307": "The Boeing Model 307 Stratoliner was a commercial transport aircraft that entered service in 1938 . It was the first to offer a pressurized cabin , allowing it to cruise at an altitude of 20,000 ft ( 6,000 m ) , well above many weather disturbances . The pressure differential was 2.5 psi ( 17 kPa ) , so at 14,700 ft ( 4,480 m ) the cabin air pressure was equivalent to an altitude of 8,000 ft ( 2,440 m ) . The Model 307 had capacity for a crew of six and 33 passengers . The cabin was nearly 12 ft ( 3.6 m ) across . It was the first land-based aircraft to include a flight engineer as a crew member ( several flying boats had included a flight engineer position earlier ) . In addition to its civilian service it was also flown as the Boeing C-75 Stratoliner by the United States Army Air Forces , who used it as a long-range cargolift aircraft .",

Originally developed as a civilian airliner and successor to the Ca.101 , the Ca.133 prototype first flew in December 1934 , and production began in 1935 . The military versions of the aircraft were used as transports and light bombers and saw action on all fronts . A stretched transport version of the aircraft was produced as the Caproni Ca.148 .",

A total of 287 C-87s were built alongside the B-24 at the Consolidated Aircraft plant in Fort Worth , Texas . The plant also developed and delivered a USAAF flight engineer trainer designated as the AT-22 , a United States Navy VIP transport designated as the RY , and a Royal Air Force VIP transport designated as the Liberator C.IX .

  "/wiki/Curtiss_C-46_Commando": "The Curtiss C-46 Commando is a twin-engine transport aircraft derived from the Curtiss CW-20 pressurised high-altitude airliner design . Early press reports used the name 'Condor III ' but the Commando name was in use by early 1942 in company publicity . It was used as a military transport during World War II by the United States Army Air Forces and also the U.S. Navy/Marine Corps , which used the designation R5C . The C-46 served in a similar role to its Douglas-built counterpart , the C-47 Skytrain , but it was not as extensively produced as the latter . After World War II , a few surplus C-46 aircraft were briefly used in their originally designated role as passenger airliners , but the glut of surplus C-47s dominated the marketplace and the C-46 was soon relegated to primarily cargo duty . The type continued in U.S. Air Force service in a secondary role until 1968 . The C-46 continues in operation as a rugged cargo transport for Arctic and remote locations with its service life extended into the 21st century .",

Like the Douglas C-47 Skytrain derived from the DC-3 , the C-54 Skymaster was derived from a civilian airliner , the Douglas DC-4 . Besides transport of cargo , the C-54 also carried presidents , prime ministers , and military staff . Dozens of variants of the C-54 were employed in a wide variety of non-combat roles such as air-sea rescue , scientific and military research , and missile tracking and recovery . During the Berlin Airlift it hauled coal and food supplies to West Berlin . After the Korean War it continued to be used for military and civilian uses by more than 30 countries . It was one of the first aircraft to carry the President of the United States .",
  "/wiki/Douglas_DC-2": "The Douglas DC-2 is a 14-seat , twin-engined airliner that was produced by the American company Douglas Aircraft Corporation starting in 1934 . It competed with the Boeing 247 . In 1935 , Douglas produced a larger version called the DC-3 , which became one of the most successful aircraft in history .",
  "/wiki/Douglas_DC-3": "The Douglas DC-3 is a propeller-driven airliner which had a lasting effect on the airline industry in the 1930s/1940s and World War II . It was developed as a larger , improved 14-bed sleeper version of the Douglas DC-2 . It is a low-wing metal monoplane with a tailwheel landing gear , powered by two 1,200 hp ( 890 kW ) Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp radial piston engines . It has a cruise speed of 207 mph ( 333 km/h ) , capacity of 21 to 32 passengers or 6,000 lbs ( 2,700 kg ) of cargo , a range of 1,500 mi ( 2,400 km ) , and could operate from short runways . Before the war , it pioneered many air travel routes as it could cross the continental US and made worldwide flights possible , carried passengers in greater comfort , and was reliable and easy to maintain . It is considered the first airliner that could profitably carry only passengers . Following the war , the airliner market was flooded with surplus military transport aircraft , and the DC-3 could not be upgraded by Douglas due to cost . It was made obsolete on main routes by more advanced types such as the Douglas DC-6 and Lockheed Constellation , but the design proved adaptable and useful . Civil DC-3 production ended in 1942 at 607 aircraft . Military versions , including the C-47 Skytrain ( the Dakota in British RAF service ) , and Soviet- and Japanese-built versions , brought total production to over 16,000 . Many continue to see service in a variety of niche roles : 2,000 DC-3s and military derivatives were estimated to be still flying in 2013 . [ contradictory ]"
