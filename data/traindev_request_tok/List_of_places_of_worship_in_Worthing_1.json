  "/wiki/St_Paul's_Church,_Worthing": "St Paul 's Church in Worthing , England , was opened in 1812 as the Worthing Chapel of Ease . It was built so that the residents and visitors to the newly created town of Worthing would not need to travel to the parish church of St Mary in Broadwater . As a growing resort , it was felt that for the town to prosper , residents and visitors would demand a local church or chapel . The Chapel of Ease gave its name to Worthing town centre 's principal north-south route , Chapel Road . The Reverend William Davison was appointed the chapel 's first chaplain . The Reverend Davison went on to set up schools for boys , girls and infants in the town with money raised from the congregation . The girls ' school he established was the original Davison High School . The building of the chapel was funded by the sale and leasing of pews , making the chapel a proprietary chapel . This policy effectively excluded the poor from the church , which was criticised until 1893 when funds allowed for the building to be extended and the chapel was upgraded to parish church status and dedicated to St Paul . Designed by John Rebecca and built by Ambrose Cartwright , who also built nearby Ambrose Place , the building has a Doric portico with four columns facing Chapel Road , with a bell cupola behind it . The building 's yellow bricks are made from the blue clay taken from Worthing Common ( also known as the Saltgrass ) , the green space which in the 19th century existed south of the current beach and is now underwater . The building is partly stuccoed .",
  "/wiki/Worthing": "Worthing ( /\u02c8w\u025c\u02d0r\u00f0\u026a\u014b/ ) is a large seaside town in England , and district with borough status in West Sussex . It is situated at the foot of the South Downs , 10 miles ( 16 km ) west of Brighton , and 18 miles ( 29 km ) east of the county town of Chichester . With an estimated population of about 110,000 and an area of 12.5 square miles ( 32.37 km2 ) , the borough is the second largest component of the Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton conurbation , which makes it part of the 15th most populous urban area in the United Kingdom . Since 2010 , northern parts of the borough , including the Worthing Downland Estate , have formed part of the South Downs National Park . In April 2019 , the Art Deco Worthing Pier was dubbed the best in Britain . The area around Worthing has been populated for at least 6,000 years and contains Britain 's greatest concentration of Stone Age flint mines , which are some of the earliest mines in Europe . Lying within the borough , the Iron Age hill fort of Cissbury Ring is one of Britain 's largest . Worthing means ( place of ) Worth/Wor\u014d 's people , from the Old English personal name Worth/Wor\u014d ( the name means valiant one , one who is noble ) , and -ingas people of ( reduced to -ing in the modern name ) . The recorded history of Worthing began with the Domesday Book . It is historically part of Sussex in the rape of Bramber , although Goring , which forms part of the rape of Arundel , was incorporated in 1929 . For many centuries Worthing was a small mackerel fishing hamlet until in the late 18th century it developed into an elegant Georgian seaside resort and attracted the well-known and wealthy of the day . In the 19th and 20th centuries the area was one of Britain 's chief market gardening centres .",
  "/wiki/Church_of_England": "The Church of England ( C of E ) is the established church of England . The Archbishop of Canterbury is the most senior cleric , although the monarch is the supreme governor . The Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion . It traces its history to the Christian church recorded as existing in the Roman province of Britain by the third century , and to the 6th-century Gregorian mission to Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury . The English church renounced papal authority when Henry VIII failed to secure an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon in 1534 . The English Reformation accelerated under Edward VI 's regents , before a brief restoration of papal authority under Queen Mary I and King Philip . The Act of Supremacy 1558 renewed the breach , and the Elizabethan Settlement charted a course enabling the English church to describe itself as both catholic and reformed :",

  "/wiki/John_Rebecca": "John Biagio Rebecca ( died 1847 ) , the son of Italian-born decorative painter Biagio Rebecca ( 1735-1808 ) , was an architect of many buildings in Sussex and London . He lived in London 's Leicester Square from 1825 to 1827 but many of his buildings were built in the seaside town of Worthing in Sussex and he is credited [ by whom ? ] as being the town 's principal Georgian architect . In Worthing Rebecca designed St. Paul 's Chapel of Ease ( now St. Paul 's Church ) , Beach House and 19-20 Marine Parade , which housed Stafford 's Marine Library in the 19th century . 19 Marine Parade was known as Rebecca House as it was believed that the architect himself stayed in the building . Rebecca was also the architect of Worthing 's Royal Baths ( now demolished ) and several other buildings around the town . The Royal Sea House in Worthing , later the Royal Hotel , with Ionic columns and pilasters was rebuilt to Rebecca 's designs in 1829 ( and destroyed by fire in 1901 ) . Rebecca designed Castle Goring at Goring-by-Sea for Sir Bysshe Shelley , 1st Baronet . Howard Colvin called the house an extraordinary fantasy , suavely neo-classical on one side and romantically castellated on the other . Around 1813-16 Rebecca designed the facade of Knebworth House , Hertfordshire , for Mrs Bulwer-Lytton . Also in the 1820s he restored Penshurst Place , Kent , in Tudor Gothic style , and it was probably to Rebecca 's designs that Sir John Shelley Sidney rebuilt the Sidney Chapel . Around 1820 Buckingham House ( originally 'Buckinghams ' or 'Buckingham Place ' ) in Shoreham-by-Sea in West Sussex was rebuilt to John Rebecca 's designs .",
  "/wiki/Stucco": "Stucco or render is a construction material made of aggregates , a binder , and water . Stucco is applied wet and hardens to a very dense solid . It is used as a decorative coating for walls and ceilings , and as a sculptural and artistic material in architecture . Stucco may be used to cover less visually appealing construction materials , such as metal , concrete , cinder block , or clay brick and adobe . In English , stucco usually refers to a coating for the outside of a building and plaster to a coating for interiors ; as described below , the material itself is often little different . However , other European languages , notably including Italian , do not have the same distinction ; stucco means plaster in Italian and serves for both . This has led to English-speakers sometimes using stucco for interior decorative plasterwork in relief .",
  "/wiki/Doric_order": "The Doric order was one of the three orders of ancient Greek and later Roman architecture ; the other two canonical orders were the Ionic and the Corinthian . The Doric is most easily recognized by the simple circular capitals at the top of columns . Originating in the western Dorian region of Greece , it is the earliest and in its essence the simplest of the orders , though still with complex details in the entablature above . The Greek Doric column was fluted or smooth-surfaced , and had no base , dropping straight into the stylobate or platform on which the temple or other building stood . The capital was a simple circular form , with some mouldings , under a square cushion that is very wide in early versions , but later more restrained . Above a plain architrave , the complexity comes in the frieze , where the two features originally unique to the Doric , the triglyph and guttae , are skeuomorphic memories of the beams and retaining pegs of the wooden constructions that preceded stone Doric temples . In stone they are purely ornamental . The relatively uncommon Roman and Renaissance Doric retained these , and often introduced thin layers of moulding or further ornament , as well as often using plain columns . More often they used versions of the Tuscan order , elaborated for nationalistic reasons by Italian Renaissance writers , which is in effect a simplified Doric , with un-fluted columns and a simpler entablature with no triglyphs or guttae . The Doric order was much used in Greek Revival architecture from the 18th century onwards ; often earlier Greek versions were used , with wider columns and no bases to them . Since at least Vitruvius , it has been customary for writers to associate the Doric with masculine virtues ( the Ionic representing the feminine ) . It is also normally the cheapest of the orders to use .",

  "/wiki/Scouting": "The Scout movement , also known as Scouting or the Scouts , is a voluntary non-political educational movement for young people open to all without distinction of gender , origin , race or creed , in accordance with the purpose , principles and method conceived by the founder , Lord Baden-Powell . The purpose of the Scout Movement is to contribute to the development of young people in achieving their full physical , intellectual , emotional , social and spiritual potentials as individuals , as responsible citizens and as members of their local , national and international communities . During the first half of the twentieth century , the movement grew to encompass three major age groups for boys ( Cub Scout , Boy Scout , Rover Scout ) and , in 1910 , a new organization , Girl Guides , was created for girls ( Brownie Guide , Girl Guide and Girl Scout , Ranger Guide ) . It is one of several worldwide youth organizations . In 1906 and 1907 Robert Baden-Powell , a lieutenant general in the British Army , wrote a book for boys about reconnaissance and scouting . This book , Scouting for Boys , was based on his earlier books about military scouting , with influence and support of Frederick Russell Burnham ( Chief of Scouts in British Africa ) , Ernest Thompson Seton of the Woodcraft Indians , William Alexander Smith of the Boys ' Brigade , and his publisher Pearson . In mid-1907 Baden-Powell held a camp on Brownsea Island in England to test ideas for his book . This camp and the publication of Scouting for Boys ( London , 1908 ) are generally regarded as the start of the Scout movement .",

  "/wiki/Open_Brethren": "The Open Brethren , sometimes called Christian Brethren , are a group of Evangelical Christian churches that arose in the late 1820s as part of the Assembly Movement . They originated in Ireland before spreading throughout the British Isles , and now have an estimated 26,000 assemblies worldwide . The Open Brethren form independent , autonomous assemblies and the name Open is given to them to distinguish them from Exclusive Brethren , with whom they share historical roots . The division of the Plymouth Brethren into the Open Brethren and Exclusive Brethren took place in 1848 . Open Brethren are also commonly known as Plymouth Brethren , especially in North America . Many Open Brethren outside of North America , however , are unwilling to use the Plymouth Brethren designation because it is associated with the Exclusive Brethren , particularly the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church , which has often been accused of being a cult and has attracted a considerable degree of unfavourable publicity in the media . The Brethren are committed to missionary work and hold that the Bible is the first authority in matters of faith and practice . Each assembly ( or congregation ) is independent of the others in doctrinal matters , yet there is a high degree of communication and cooperation among those who share similar doctrine and practice . Open Brethren assemblies form a continuum , from tight gatherings that extend fellowship only to those who have first left other denominations , to very loose gatherings that receive into fellowship any stranger without question . A building associated with a group of open brethren is usually called a Gospel Chapel , Gospel Hall , Bible Chapel , Christian Assembly , or other similar term . A sub-set of the Open Brethren are the Gospel Hall Assemblies , who tend to be more conservative than their fellow Brethren in their practices . Theologically , however , they differ very little .",
  "/wiki/Classical_architecture": "Classical architecture usually denotes architecture which is more or less consciously derived from the principles of Greek and Roman architecture of classical antiquity , or sometimes even more specifically , from the works of the Roman architect Vitruvius . Different styles of classical architecture have arguably existed since the Carolingian Renaissance , and prominently since the Italian Renaissance . Although classical styles of architecture can vary greatly , they can in general all be said to draw on a common vocabulary of decorative and constructive elements . In much of the Western world , different classical architectural styles have dominated the history of architecture from the Renaissance until the second world war , though it continues to inform many architects to this day . The term classical architecture also applies to any mode of architecture that has evolved to a highly refined state , such as classical Chinese architecture , or classical Mayan architecture . It can also refer to any architecture that employs classical aesthetic philosophy . The term might be used differently from traditional or vernacular architecture , although it can share underlying axioms with it . For contemporary buildings following authentic classical principles , the term New Classical architecture is sometimes used .",

  "/wiki/Methodism": "Methodism is an umbrella term used to describe denominations of Protestant Christianity which follow the line of the Methodist movement . Methodist denominations are historically related and derive their doctrine of practice and belief from the life and teachings of John Wesley . George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . [ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals , collectively known as the Social Gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people .",
  "/wiki/Wesleyanism": "Wesleyan theology , otherwise known as Wesleyan-Arminian theology , or Methodist theology , is a theological tradition in Protestant Christianity that emphasizes the methods of the eighteenth-century evangelical reformers John Wesley and his brother Charles Wesley . More broadly , it refers to the theological system inferred from the various sermons , theological treatises , letters , journals , diaries , hymns , and other spiritual writings of the Wesleys and their contemporary coadjutors such as John William Fletcher . Wesleyan-Arminian theology , manifest today in Methodism ( inclusive of the Holiness movement ) , is named for its founders , the Wesleys , as well as for Jacob Arminius , since it is a subset of Arminian theology . In 1736 , these two brothers traveled to the Georgia colony in America as missionaries for the Church of England ; they left rather disheartened at what they saw . Both of them subsequently had religious experiences , especially John in 1738 , being greatly influenced by the Moravian Christians . They began to organize a renewal movement within the Church of England to focus on personal faith and holiness . John Wesley took Protestant churches to task over the nature of sanctification , the process by which a believer is conformed to the image of Christ , emphasizing New Testament teachings regarding the work of God and the believer in sanctification . The movement did well within the Church of England in Britain , but when the movement crossed the ocean into America , it took on a form of its own , finally being established as the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1784 . The Methodist churches are similar to Anglicanism ( in Church government and liturgical practices ) , yet have added a strong emphasis on personal faith and personal experience , especially on the new birth and entire sanctification . At its heart , the theology of John Wesley stressed the life of Christian holiness : to love God with all ones heart , mind , soul and strength , and to love one 's neighbour as oneself . Wesleys teaching also stressed experiential religion and moral responsibility .",
  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",

It is a social drinking establishment and a prominent part of British , Irish , Breton , New Zealand , Canadian , South African and Australian cultures . In many places , especially in villages , a pub is the focal point of the community . In his 17th-century diary , Samuel Pepys described the pub as the heart of England . Pubs can be traced back to Roman taverns , through the Anglo-Saxon alehouse to the development of the tied house system in the 19th century . In 1393 , King Richard II of England introduced legislation that pubs had to display a sign outdoors to make them easily visible for passing ale tasters , who would assess the quality of ale sold . Most pubs focus on offering beers , ales and similar drinks . As well , pubs often sell wines , spirits , and soft drinks , meals and snacks . The owner , tenant or manager ( licensee ) is known as the pub landlord or landlady , or publican . Referred to as their local by regulars , pubs are typically chosen for their proximity to home or work , the availability of a particular beer or ale or a good selection , good food , a social atmosphere , the presence of friends and acquaintances , and the availability of recreational activities such as a darts team , a skittles team , and a pool or snooker table .

  "/wiki/Baptists": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and doing so by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or aspersion ) . Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency ( the responsibility and accountability of every person before God ) , sola fide ( salvation by faith alone ) , sola scriptura ( scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice ) and congregationalist church government . Baptists generally recognize two ordinances : baptism and communion . Diverse from their beginning , those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe , how they worship , their attitudes toward other Christians , and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship . Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam , Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law , so that individuals might have freedom of religion . Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the 18th and 19th centuries , the First and Second Great Awakening increased church membership in the United States . Baptist missionaries have spread their faith to every continent .",
  "/wiki/Planning_permission": "Planning permission or developmental approval refers to the approval needed for construction or expansion ( including significant renovation ) , and sometimes for demolition , in some jurisdictions . It is usually given in the form of a building permit ( or construction permit ) . House building permits , for example , are subject to Building codes . There is also a plan check ( PLCK ) to check compliance with plans for the area , if any . For example , one can not obtain permission to build a nightclub in an area where it is inappropriate such as a high-density suburb . The criteria for planning permission are a part of urban planning and construction law , and are usually managed by town planners employed by local governments . Failure to obtain a permit can result in fines , penalties , and demolition of unauthorized construction if it can not be made to meet code . Generally , the new construction must be inspected during construction and after completion to ensure compliance with national , regional , and local building codes . Since building permits usually precede outlays for construction , employment , financing and furnishings , they are often used as a leading indicator for developments in other areas of the economy .",

Evangelicals believe in the centrality of the conversion or born again experience in receiving salvation , in the authority of the Bible as God 's revelation to humanity , and in spreading the Christian message . The movement has long had a presence in the Anglosphere before spreading further afield in the 19th , 20th and early 21st centuries . Its origins are usually traced to 1738 , with various theological streams contributing to its foundation , including English Methodism , the Moravian Church ( in particular its bishop Nicolaus Zinzendorf and his community at Herrnhut ) , and German Lutheran Pietism . Preeminently , John Wesley and other early Methodists were at the root of sparking this new movement during the First Great Awakening . Today , evangelicals are found across many Protestant branches , as well as in various denominations not subsumed to a specific branch . Among leaders and major figures of the evangelical Protestant movement were John Wesley , George Whitefield , Jonathan Edwards , Billy Graham , Bill Bright , Harold Ockenga , John Stott and Martyn Lloyd-Jones . The movement gained great momentum during the 18th and 19th centuries with the Great Awakenings in Great Britain and the United States . In 2016 , there were an estimated 619 million evangelicals in the world , meaning that one in four Christians would be classified as evangelical .

  "/wiki/English_Gothic_architecture": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style . So are numerous castles , palaces , great houses , universities , and many smaller unpretentious secular buildings , including almshouses and trade halls .",

They believe that the destruction of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent , and that the establishment of God 's kingdom over the earth is the only solution for all problems faced by humanity . The group emerged from the Bible Student movement founded in the late 1870s by Charles Taze Russell , who also co-founded Zion 's Watch Tower Tract Society in 1881 to organize and print the movement 's publications . A leadership dispute after Russell 's death resulted in several groups breaking away , with Joseph Franklin Rutherford retaining control of the Watch Tower Society and its properties . Rutherford made significant organizational and doctrinal changes , including adoption of the name Jehovah 's witnesses [ note 1 ] in 1931 to distinguish them from other Bible Student groups and symbolize a break with the legacy of Russell 's traditions . Jehovah 's Witnesses are best known for their door-to-door preaching , distributing literature such as The Watchtower and Awake ! , and for refusing military service and blood transfusions . They consider the use of God 's name vital for proper worship . They reject Trinitarianism , inherent immortality of the soul , and hellfire , which they consider to be unscriptural doctrines .

Congregations are further organized into circuits of about twenty congregations each . The Governing Body directly appoints circuit overseers as its representatives to supervise activities within circuits . Headquarters representatives visit groups of branch offices to provide instruction and report the branch 's activities to the Governing Body . Each congregation is served by a group of locally recommended male elders and ministerial servants , appointed by the circuit overseer . Elders take responsibility for congregational governance , pastoral work , setting meeting times , selecting speakers , conducting meetings , directing the public preaching work , and forming judicial committees to investigate and decide disciplinary action in cases where members are believed to have committed serious sins . Ministerial servants fulfil clerical and attendant duties , but may also teach and conduct meetings .",
  "/wiki/Pentecostalism": "Pentecostalism or Classical Pentecostalism is a Protestant Christian movement that emphasises direct personal experience of God through baptism with the Holy Spirit . The term Pentecostal is derived from Pentecost , the Greek name for the Jewish Feast of Weeks . For Christians , this event commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the followers of Jesus Christ , as described in the second chapter of the Acts of the Apostles . Like other forms of evangelical Protestantism , Pentecostalism adheres to the inerrancy of the Bible and the necessity of accepting Jesus Christ as personal Lord and Savior . It is distinguished by belief in the baptism in the Holy Spirit that enables a Christian to live a Spirit-filled and empowered life . This empowerment includes the use of spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and divine healing - two other defining characteristics of Pentecostalism . Because of their commitment to biblical authority , spiritual gifts , and the miraculous , Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the Apostolic Age of the early church . For this reason , some Pentecostals also use the term Apostolic or Full Gospel to describe their movement . Pentecostalism emerged in the early 20th century among radical adherents of the Holiness movement who were energized by revivalism and expectation for the imminent Second Coming of Christ . Believing that they were living in the end times , they expected God to spiritually renew the Christian Church thereby bringing to pass the restoration of spiritual gifts and the evangelization of the world . In 1900 , Charles Parham , an American evangelist and faith healer , began teaching that speaking in tongues was the Bible evidence of Spirit baptism and along with William J. Seymour , a Wesleyan-Holiness preacher , he taught that this was the third work of grace . The three-year-long Azusa Street Revival , founded and led by Seymour in Los Angeles , California , resulted in the spread of Pentecostalism throughout the United States and the rest of the world as visitors carried the Pentecostal experience back to their home churches or felt called to the mission field .",

  "/wiki/Terracotta": "Terracotta , terra cotta or terra-cotta ( pronounced [ \u02cct\u025brra\u02c8k\u0254tta ] ; Italian : baked earth , from the Latin terra cocta ) , a type of earthenware , is a clay-based unglazed or glazed ceramic , where the fired body is porous . Terracotta is the term normally used for sculpture made in earthenware , and also for various practical uses including vessels ( notably flower pots ) , water and waste water pipes , roofing tiles , bricks , and surface embellishment in building construction . The term is also used to refer to the natural brownish orange color of most terracotta , which varies considerably . [ citation needed ] This article covers the senses of terracotta as a medium in sculpture , as in the Terracotta Army and Greek terracotta figurines , and architectural decoration . Asian and European sculpture in porcelain is not covered . Glazed architectural terracotta and its unglazed version as exterior surfaces for buildings were used in Asia for some centuries before becoming popular in the West in the 19th century . Architectural terracotta can also refer to decorated ceramic elements such as antefixes and revetments , which made a large contribution to the appearance of temples and other buildings in the classical architecture of Europe , as well as in the Ancient Near East . [ citation needed ] In archaeology and art history , terracotta is often used to describe objects such as figurines not made on a potter 's wheel . Vessels and other objects that are or might be made on a wheel from the same material are called earthenware pottery ; the choice of term depends on the type of object rather than the material or firing technique . Unglazed pieces , and those made for building construction and industry , are also more likely to be referred to as terracotta , whereas tableware and other vessels are called earthenware ( though sometimes terracotta if unglazed ) , or by a more precise term such as faience .

  "/wiki/Congregational_church": "Congregational churches ( also Congregationalist churches ; Congregationalism ) are Protestant churches in the Reformed tradition practicing congregationalist church governance , in which each congregation independently and autonomously runs its own affairs . Congregationalism , as defined by the Pew Research Center , is estimated to represent 0.5 percent of the worldwide Protestant population ; though their polity-related customs and other ideas influenced significant parts of Protestantism , as well as other Christian congregations . The report defines it very narrowly , encompassing mainly denominations in the United States and the United Kingdom , which can trace their history back to nonconforming Protestants , Puritans , Separatists , Independents , English religious groups coming out of the English Civil War , and other English dissenters not satisfied with the degree to which the Church of England had been reformed . Congregationalist tradition has a presence in the United States , the United Kingdom , Ireland , Canada , South Africa , Australia , New Zealand , and various island nations in the Pacific region . It has been introduced either by immigrant dissenter Protestants or by missionary organization such as the London Missionary Society . A number of evangelical Congregational churches are members of the World Evangelical Congregational Fellowship . In the United Kingdom , many Congregational churches claim their descent from Protestant denominations formed on a theory of union published by the theologian and English separatist Robert Browne in 1582 . Other accounts trace these origins further back to the London Underground Church of the 1560s . Ideas of nonconforming Protestants during the Puritan Reformation of the Church of England laid foundation for these churches . In England , the early Congregationalists were called Separatists or Independents to distinguish them from the similarly Calvinistic Presbyterians , whose churches embrace a polity based on the governance of elders . Congregationalists also differed with the Reformed churches using episcopalian church governance , which is usually led by a bishop . Congregationalism in the United States traces its origins to the Puritans of New England , who wrote the Cambridge Platform of 1648 to describe the autonomy of the church and its association with others ."
