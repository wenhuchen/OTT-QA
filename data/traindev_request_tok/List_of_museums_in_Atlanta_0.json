  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country . [ f ] The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union . [ g ] The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years .",

  "/wiki/Jewish_history": "Jewish history is the history of the Jews , and their nation , religion and culture , as it developed and interacted with other peoples , religions and cultures . Although Judaism as a religion first appears in Greek records during the Hellenistic period ( 323 BCE - 31 BCE ) and the earliest mention of Israel is inscribed on the Merneptah Stele dated 1213-1203 BCE , religious literature tells the story of Israelites going back at least as far as c. 1500 BCE . The Jewish diaspora began with the Assyrian captivity and continued on a much larger scale with the Babylonian captivity . Jews were also widespread throughout the Roman Empire , and this carried on to a lesser extent in the period of Byzantine rule in the central and eastern Mediterranean . In 638 CE the Byzantine Empire lost control of the Levant . The Arab Islamic Empire under Caliph Omar conquered Jerusalem and the lands of Mesopotamia , Syria , Palestine and Egypt . The Golden Age of Jewish culture in Spain coincided with the Middle Ages in Europe , a period of Muslim rule throughout much of the Iberian Peninsula . During that time , Jews were generally accepted in society and Jewish religious , cultural , and economic life blossomed . During the Classical Ottoman period ( 1300-1600 ) , the Jews , together with most other communities of the empire , enjoyed a certain level of prosperity . In the 17th century , there were many significant Jewish populations in Western Europe . During the period of the European Renaissance and Enlightenment , significant changes occurred within the Jewish community . Jews began in the 18th century to campaign for emancipation from restrictive laws and integration into the wider European society .",
  "/wiki/The_Holocaust": "The Holocaust , also known as the Shoah , [ b ] was the World War II genocide of the European Jews . Between 1941 and 1945 , across German-occupied Europe , Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically murdered some six million Jews , around two-thirds of Europe 's Jewish population . [ a ] [ c ] The murders were carried out in pogroms and mass shootings ; by a policy of extermination through work in concentration camps ; and in gas chambers and gas vans in German extermination camps , chiefly Auschwitz , Be\u0142\u017cec , Che\u0142mno , Majdanek , Sobib\u00f3r , and Treblinka in occupied Poland . Germany implemented the persecution in stages . Following Adolf Hitler 's appointment as Chancellor on 30 January 1933 , the regime built a network of concentration camps in Germany for political opponents and those deemed undesirable , starting with Dachau on 22 March 1933 . After the passing of the Enabling Act on 24 March , which gave Hitler plenary powers , the government began isolating Jews from civil society ; this included boycotting Jewish businesses in April 1933 and enacting the Nuremberg Laws in September 1935 . On 9-10 November 1938 , eight months after Germany annexed Austria , Jewish businesses and other buildings were ransacked , smashed or set on fire throughout Germany and Austria during what became known as Kristallnacht ( the Night of Broken Glass ) . After Germany invaded Poland in September 1939 , triggering World War II , the regime set up ghettos to segregate Jews from the rest of the population . Eventually thousands of camps and other detention sites were established across German-occupied Europe . The segregation of Jews in ghettos culminated in the policy of extermination the Nazis called the Final Solution to the Jewish Question , discussed by senior Nazi officials at the Wannsee Conference in Berlin in January 1942 . As German forces captured territories in the East , all anti-Jewish measures were radicalized . Under the coordination of the SS , with directions from the highest leadership of the Nazi Party , killings were committed within Germany itself , throughout occupied Europe , and within territories controlled by Germany 's allies .",

  "/wiki/Puppets": "A puppet is an object , often resembling a human , animal or mythical figure , that is animated or manipulated by a person called a Puppeteer . The Puppeteer uses movements of his hands , arms , or control devices such as rods or strings to move the body , head , limbs , and in some cases the mouth and eyes of the puppet . The Puppeteer often speaks in the voice of the character of the puppet , and then synchronizes the movements of the puppet 's mouth with this spoken part . The actions , gestures and spoken parts acted out by the Puppeteer with the puppet are typically used in storytelling . Puppetry is a very ancient form of theatre which dates back to the 5th century BC in Ancient Greece . There are many different varieties of puppets , and they are made from a wide range of materials , depending on their form and intended use . They range from very simple in construction and operation to very complex . Two simple types of puppets are the finger puppet , which is a tiny puppet that fits onto a single finger , and the sock puppet , which is formed and operated by inserting one 's hand inside a sock , with the opening and closing of the hand simulating the movement of the puppet 's mouth . The sock puppet is a type of hand puppet , which is controlled using one hand that occupies the interior of the puppet and moves the puppet around . A live-hand puppet is similar to a hand puppet but is larger and requires two puppeteers for each puppet . A Marionette is a much more complicated type of puppet that is suspended and controlled by a number of strings connected to the head , back and limbs , plus sometimes a central rod attached to a control bar held from above by the puppeteer . A rod puppet is constructed around a central rod secured to the head .",

A dominant feature of most planetaria is the large dome-shaped projection screen onto which scenes of stars , planets , and other celestial objects can be made to appear and move realistically to simulate the complex 'motions of the heavens ' . The celestial scenes can be created using a wide variety of technologies , for example precision-engineered 'star balls ' that combine optical and electro-mechanical technology , slide projector , video and fulldome projector systems , and lasers . Whatever technologies are used , the objective is normally to link them together to simulate an accurate relative motion of the sky . Typical systems can be set to simulate the sky at any point in time , past or present , and often to depict the night sky as it would appear from any point of latitude on Earth . Planetariums range in size from the 37 meter dome in St. Petersburg , Russia ( called Planetarium No 1 ) to three-meter inflatable portable domes where attendees sit on the floor .
