It is in the northeastern reaches of the Sonoran Desert and has a hot desert climate . Despite this , its canal system led to a thriving farming community with the original settler 's crops remaining important parts of the Phoenix economy for decades , such as alfalfa , cotton , citrus , and hay . Cotton , cattle , citrus , climate , and copper were known locally as the Five C 's anchoring Phoenix 's economy . These remained the driving forces of the city until after World War II , when high-tech companies began to move into the valley and air conditioning made Phoenix 's hot summers more bearable .
