  "/wiki/Xander_Harris": "Alexander Lavelle Harris is a fictional character created for the action-horror/fantasy television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer ( 1997-2003 ) . He was developed by Joss Whedon and portrayed throughout the television series by Nicholas Brendon and in two episodes by his twin brother , Kelly Donovan . He was conceived as an everyman and a male character for series heroine Buffy Summers ( Sarah Michelle Gellar ) to interact with , and to provide comic relief in the series . Xander is one of several friends of Buffy who assist her in saving the world against numerous supernatural events that plague Sunnydale , California , a town built over a doorway to hell . Xander is based in part on Whedon himself , particularly in his high school years ; as such , he is often the most geeky as well as witty and verbose of Buffy 's characters . The character 's overriding arc through the series has been his struggle towards maturity and earning the respect of others . In the canonical comic book continuation of the series , Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight ( 2007-2011 ) , Xander comes to achieve these goals in becoming the tactical leader of a global army of Vampire Slayers alongside Buffy . Academic attention to the character has frequently come in the form of gender studies or with a focus on social class , reflecting Xander 's working class home life and his fears of inadequacy . However , Xander 's unique position as both outside and within the main group enhances his insight into the other characters , especially as the series continues ; in Season Eight , he is Buffy 's unofficial Watcher , who watches over her and has a clear perspective . Critics have noted that although Xander frequently exhibits a struggle of masculinity , his storylines often focus on his romantic conquests . Following his unreciprocated love for Buffy , these include the tumultuous relationship with rich girl Cordelia Chase ( Charisma Carpenter ) , brief fling with his best friend Willow ( Alyson Hannigan ) prior to her coming out , and his long-term relationship with ex-demon Anya ( Emma Caulfield ) . In Season Eight , the character 's older-brother relationship with Buffy 's little sister Dawn ( Michelle Trachtenberg ) also develops along romantic lines , too late for Buffy to realize her compatibility with Xander .",
