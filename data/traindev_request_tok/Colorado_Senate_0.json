  "/wiki/Majority_Leader": "In U.S. politics , the majority floor leader is a partisan position in a legislative body . In the federal Congress , the role of the Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives and the Majority Leader of the United States Senate differ slightly . In the United States Senate , the majority leader is the chief spokesperson for the majority party , as the president of the Senate is also the Vice-President of the United States , and the President pro tempore , though technically a substitute for the president of the Senate , is in reality a largely ceremonial position . In the United States House of Representatives , the majority leader is elected by U.S. Congresspeople in the political party holding the largest number of seats in the House . While the responsibilities vary depending upon the political climate , the Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives typically sets the floor agenda and oversees the committee chairmen . Given the two-party nature of the U.S. system , the majority leader is almost inevitably either a Republican or a Democrat . The majority leader is often assisted in their role by whips , whose job is to enforce party discipline on votes deemed to be crucial by the party leadership and to ensure that members do not vote in a way not approved of by the party . Some votes are deemed to be so crucial as to lead to punitive measures ( such as demotion from choice committee assignments ) if the party line is violated ; decisions such as these are often made by the majority leader in conjunction with other senior party leaders . In the states , the majority leader of a state legislative chamber usually performs a similar role to the Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives . State senate presidents pro tempore are typically not ceremonial , but more akin to the Majority Leader of the United States Senate .",

  "/wiki/Majority_Whip": "A whip is an official of a political party whose task is to ensure party discipline in a legislature . This means ensuring that members of the party vote according to the party platform , rather than according to their own individual ideology or the will of their constituents . Whips are the party 's enforcers . They ensure that their fellow legislators attend voting sessions and vote according to official policy . The term is taken from the whipper-in during a hunt , who tries to prevent hounds from wandering away from a hunting pack . Additionally , the term whip may mean the voting instructions issued to legislators , or the status of a certain legislator in their party 's parliamentary grouping .",

  "/wiki/Minority_leader": "In U.S. politics , the minority leader is the floor leader of the second largest caucus in a legislative body . Given the two-party nature of the U.S. system , the minority leader is almost inevitably either a Republican or a Democrat . The position could be considered similar to that of the Leader of the Opposition in parliamentary systems . In bicameral legislatures , the counterpart to the minority leader in the lower house is the Speaker , and the majority leader is hence only the second-most senior member of the majority caucus . Contrastingly , in upper houses , the titular Speaker is frequently a separately elected officer such as a lieutenant governor or vice president . The minority leader is often assisted in his/her role by one or more whips , whose job is to enforce party discipline on votes deemed to be crucial by the party leadership and to ensure that members do not vote against the position of the party leaders . Some votes are deemed to be so crucial as to lead to punitive measures ( such as demotion from choice committee assignments ) for members who violate the party line ; decisions such as these are often made by the minority leader in conjunction with other senior party leaders . In a state where the executive branch and both houses of the state legislature are controlled by the other party , the minority leader of one of the houses ( most often the upper one ) may be seen as the most senior member of the party in that state with regard to state government ( although inferior in rank to a United States Senator or United States Representative , if there be such in that party from that state ) . At times , particularly during crucial legislation , the minority leader may be consulted by the opposite leader in order to more easily get things passed and ensure that provisions important to the interests the minority party be included . The level of partisanship in state legislative bodies varies greatly from one state to another .",
