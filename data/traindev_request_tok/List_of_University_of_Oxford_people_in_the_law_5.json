  "/wiki/Associate_Justice_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States": "Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States is the title of all members of the Supreme Court of the United States other than the chief justice of the United States . The number of associate justices is eight , as set by the Judiciary Act of 1869 . Article II , Section 2 , Clause 2 of the United States Constitution grants plenary power to the president to nominate , and with the advice and consent ( confirmation ) of the Senate , appoint justices to the Supreme Court . Article III , Section 1 of the Constitution effectively grants life tenure to associate justices , and all other federal judges , which ends only when a justice dies , retires , resigns , or is removed from office by impeachment . Each Supreme Court justice has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it ; the chief justice 's vote counts no more than that of any other justice . However , the chief justice - when in the majority - decides who writes the court 's opinion . Otherwise , the senior justice in the majority assigns the writing of a decision . Furthermore , the chief justice leads the discussion of the case among the justices . The chief justice has certain administrative responsibilities that the other justices do not and is paid slightly more ( $ 267,000 per year as of 2018 , as opposed to $ 255,300 per year for each associate justice ) . Associate justices have seniority by order of appointment , although the chief justice is always considered to be the most senior . If two justices are appointed on the same day , the older is designated the senior justice of the two . Currently , the senior associate justice is Clarence Thomas .",
  "/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States": "The Supreme Court of the United States ( SCOTUS ) is the highest court in the federal judiciary of the United States . It has ultimate ( and largely discretionary ) appellate jurisdiction over all federal and state court cases that involve a point of federal law , and original jurisdiction over a narrow range of cases , specifically all Cases affecting Ambassadors , other public Ministers and Consuls , and those in which a State shall be Party . The Court holds the power of judicial review , the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the U.S. Constitution . It is also able to strike down presidential directives for violating either the Constitution or statutory law . However , it may act only within the context of a case in an area of law over which it has jurisdiction . The Court may decide cases having political overtones , but it has ruled that it does not have power to decide non-justiciable political questions . Established by Article III of the Constitution , the composition and procedures of the Supreme Court were initially established by the 1st Congress through the Judiciary Act of 1789 . As later set by the Judiciary Act of 1869 , the Court consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices . Each justice has lifetime tenure , meaning they remain on the Court until they resign , retire , die , or are removed from office . When a vacancy occurs , the president , with the advice and consent of the Senate , appoints a new justice . Each justice has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it . When in majority , the chief justice decides who writes the opinion of the court ; otherwise , the most senior justice in the majority assigns the task of writing the opinion .",

In 1954 Harlan was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit , and a year later president Dwight Eisenhower nominated Harlan to the United States Supreme Court following the death of Justice Robert H. Jackson . Harlan is often characterized as a member of the conservative wing of the Warren Court . He advocated a limited role for the judiciary , remarking that the Supreme Court should not be considered a general haven for reform movements . In general , Harlan adhered more closely to precedent , and was more reluctant to overturn legislation , than many of his colleagues on the Court . He strongly disagreed with the doctrine of incorporation , which held that the provisions of the federal Bill of Rights applied to the state governments , not merely the Federal . At the same time , he advocated a broad interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment 's Due Process Clause , arguing that it protected a wide range of rights not expressly mentioned in the United States Constitution .",

An important feature of Walter 's foundation was that this college was to be self-governing and the endowments were directly vested in the Warden and Fellows . By 1274 , when Walter retired from royal service and made his final revisions to the college statutes , the community was consolidated at its present site in the south east corner of the city of Oxford , and a rapid programme of building commenced . The hall and the chapel and the rest of the front quad were complete before the end of the 13th century . Mob Quad , one of Merton 's quadrangles , was constructed between 1288 and 1378 , and is claimed to be the oldest quadrangle in Oxford , while Merton College Library , located in Mob Quad and dating from 1373 , is the oldest continuously functioning library for university academics and students in the world .
