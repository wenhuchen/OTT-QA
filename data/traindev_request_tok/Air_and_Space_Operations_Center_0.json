An exclave of the U.S. , it borders the Canadian province of British Columbia and territory of Yukon to the east and southeast has a maritime border with Russia 's Chukotka Autonomous Okrug to the west . To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seas of the Arctic Ocean , while the Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest . Alaska is the largest U.S. state by area and the seventh largest subnational division in the world . It is the third least populous and the most sparsely populated state , but by far the continent 's most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel , with an estimated population of 738,432 as 2015 - more than quadruple the combined populations of Northern Canada and Greenland . Approximately half of Alaska 's residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area . The state capital of Juneau is the second largest city in the United States by area , comprising more territory than the states of Rhode Island and Delaware . Alaska was occupied by various indigenous peoples for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans . The state is considered the entry point for the settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge . The Russians were the first non-native people to settle the area beginning in the 18th century , eventually establishing the colony of Alaska that spanned most of the current state . The expense and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted its sale to the U.S. in 1867 for $ 7.2 million , or approximately two cents per acre ( $ 4.74/km2 ) .

  "/wiki/National_Security_Agency": "The National Security Agency ( NSA ) is a national-level intelligence agency of the United States Department of Defense , under the authority of the Director of National Intelligence . The NSA is responsible for global monitoring , collection , and processing of information and data for foreign and domestic intelligence and counterintelligence purposes , specializing in a discipline known as signals intelligence ( SIGINT ) . The NSA is also tasked with the protection of U.S. communications networks and information systems . The NSA relies on a variety of measures to accomplish its mission , the majority of which are clandestine . Originating as a unit to decipher coded communications in World War II , it was officially formed as the NSA by President Harry S. Truman in 1952 . Since then , it has become the largest of the U.S. intelligence organizations in terms of personnel and budget . The NSA currently conducts worldwide mass data collection and has been known to physically bug electronic systems as one method to this end . The NSA is also alleged to have been behind such attack software as Stuxnet , which severely damaged Iran 's nuclear program . The NSA , alongside the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , maintains a physical presence in many countries across the globe ; the CIA/NSA joint Special Collection Service ( a highly classified intelligence team ) inserts eavesdropping devices in high value targets ( such as Presidential palaces or embassies ) . SCS collection tactics allegedly encompass close surveillance , burglary , wiretapping , [ and ] breaking and entering . Unlike the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) , both of which specialize primarily in foreign human espionage , the NSA does not publicly conduct human-source intelligence gathering . The NSA is entrusted with providing assistance to , and the coordination of , SIGINT elements for other government organizations - which are prevented by law from engaging in such activities on their own ."
