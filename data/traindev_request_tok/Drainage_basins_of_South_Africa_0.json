The term Limpopo is derived from Rivombo ( Livombo/Lebombo ) , a group of Tsonga settlers led by Hosi Rivombo who settled in the mountainous vicinity and named the area after their leader . The river is approximately 1,750 kilometres ( 1,087 mi ) long , with a drainage basin 415,000 square kilometres ( 160,200 sq mi ) in size . The mean discharge measured over a year is 170 m3/s ( 6,200 cu ft/s ) at its mouth . The Limpopo is the second largest river in Africa that drains to the Indian Ocean , after the Zambezi River . [ citation needed ] The first European to sight the river was Vasco da Gama , who anchored off its mouth in 1498 and named it Espiritu Santo River . Its lower course was explored by St Vincent Whitshed Erskine in 1868-69 , and Captain J F Elton travelled down its middle course in 1870 . The drainage area of Limpopo River has decreased over geological time . Up to Late Pliocene or Pleistocene times the upper course of Zambezi River drained into the Limpopo River . The change of the drainage divide is the result of epeirogenic movement that uplifted the surface north of present-day Limpopo River diverting waters into Zambezi River .",
