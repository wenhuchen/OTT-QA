Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip ( Palestine ) and Israel to the northeast , the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea to the east , Sudan to the south , and Libya to the west . Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan , across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia , and across the Mediterranean lie Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , although none share a land border with Egypt . Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",

The club is best known for its football team . Also it 's considered as an Egyptian National Club , where they helped the famous local tour of duty to play for the benefit of the homeland against the occupying armies . The club 's nickname The Brazilians , is a reference to their uniforms , which echo those of the Brazilian national team , and similar style of play . Ismaily won the Egyptian Premier League three times in 1967 , 1991 and 2002 , as well as the Egyptian Cup in 1997 and 2000 . In 1969 the club won the CAF Champions League . That event , the first for an Egyptian team , was so monumental at the time that in many ways it remains a legendary victory in the minds of a whole generation . The club reached the CAF Champions League final match in 2003 , but lost to Nigerian club Enyimba FC in a match that included many controversial incidents . Ismaily also is well known for being rich in skillful players and for the enjoyable style of play which is the reason they are known as The Egyptian Samba . However , the club is also known for being usually unsuccessful to translate these abilities into championships . Ismaily continues to face difficult circumstances in building and maintaining a team in a country where most of the population cheers for one of the two most established clubs Al-Ahly and El Zamalek situated in the capital of Egypt , Cairo . For the same reasons , it has been very difficult along the years for Ismaily club to manage to keep its top players at the club ."
