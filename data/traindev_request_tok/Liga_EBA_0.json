Cantabria has archaeological sites from the Upper Paleolithic period , although the first signs of human occupation date from the Lower Paleolithic . The most significant site for cave paintings is that in the cave of Altamira , dating from about 37,000 BC and declared , along with nine other Cantabrian caves , as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO .
