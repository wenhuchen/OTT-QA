  "/wiki/Call_to_the_Bar": "The call to the bar is a legal term of art in most common law jurisdictions where persons must be qualified to be allowed to argue in court on behalf of another party and are then said to have been called to the bar or to have received a call to the bar . The bar is now used as a collective noun for barristers , but literally referred to the wooden barrier in old courtrooms , which separated the often crowded public area at the rear from the space near the judges reserved for those having business with the Court . Barristers would sit or stand immediately behind it , facing the judge , and could use it as a table for their briefs . Like many other common law terms , the term originated in England in the Middle Ages , and the call to the bar refers to the summons issued to one found fit to speak at the 'bar ' of the royal courts . In time , English judges allowed only legally qualified men to address them on the law and later delegated the qualification and admission of barristers to the four Inns of Court . Once an Inn calls one of its members to its bar , they are thereafter a barrister . They may not , however , practise as a barrister until they have completed ( or been exempted from ) an apprenticeship called pupillage . After completing pupillage , they are considered to be a practising barrister with a right of audience before all courts . England and Wales and some other jurisdictions distinguish two types of lawyers , who are regulated by different bodies , with separate training , examinations , regulation and traditions :",

  "/wiki/Serjeant-at-Law": "A Serjeant-at-Law ( SL ) , commonly known simply as a Serjeant , was a member of an order of barristers at the English and Irish bar . The position of Serjeant-at-Law ( servientes ad legem ) , or Sergeant-Counter , was centuries old ; there are writs dating to 1300 which identify them as descended from figures in France before the Norman Conquest . The Serjeants were the oldest formally created order in England , having been brought into existence as a body by Henry II . The order rose during the 16th century as a small , elite group of lawyers who took much of the work in the central common law courts . With the creation of Queen 's Counsel ( or Queen 's Counsel Extraordinary ) during the reign of Elizabeth I , the order gradually began to decline , with each monarch opting to create more King 's or Queen 's Counsel . The Serjeants ' exclusive jurisdictions were ended during the 19th century and , with the Judicature Act 1873 coming into force in 1875 , it was felt that there was no need to have such figures , and no more were created . The last appointed was Nathaniel Lindley , later a Law Lord , who retired in 1905 and died in 1921 . The number of Irish Serjeants-at-law was limited to three ( originally one , later two ) . The last appointment was A. M. Sullivan in 1912 ; after his 1921 relocation to the English bar he remained Serjeant Sullivan as a courtesy title . The Serjeants had for many centuries exclusive jurisdiction over the Court of Common Pleas , being the only lawyers allowed to argue a case there . At the same time they had rights of audience in the other central common law courts ( the Court of King 's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas ) and precedence over all other lawyers . Only Serjeants-at-Law could become judges of these courts right up into the 19th century , and socially the Serjeants ranked above Knights Bachelor and Companions of the Bath .",

  "/wiki/Barrister": "A barrister is a type of lawyer in common law jurisdictions . Barristers mostly specialise in courtroom advocacy and litigation . Their tasks include taking cases in superior courts and tribunals , drafting legal pleadings , researching the philosophy , hypothesis and history of law , and giving expert legal opinions . Barristers are distinguished from solicitors , who have more direct access to clients , and may do transactional-type legal work . It is mainly barristers who are appointed as judges , and they are rarely hired by clients directly . In some legal systems , including those of Scotland , South Africa , Scandinavia , Pakistan , India , Bangladesh , and the British Crown dependencies of Jersey , Guernsey and the Isle of Man , the word barrister is also regarded as an honorific title . In a few jurisdictions , barristers are usually forbidden from conducting litigation , and can only act on the instructions of a solicitor , who performs tasks such as corresponding with parties and the court , and drafting court documents . In England and Wales , barristers may seek authorisation from the Bar Standards Board to conduct litigation . This allows a barrister to practise in a 'dual capacity ' , fulfilling the role of both barrister and solicitor . In some countries with common law legal systems , such as New Zealand and some regions of Australia , lawyers are entitled to practise both as barristers and solicitors , but it remains a separate system of qualification to practise exclusively as a barrister .",

Queen 's Counsel is an office , conferred by the Crown , that is recognised by courts . Members have the privilege of sitting within the bar of court . The term is recognised as an honorific .
