  "/wiki/Airlock": "An airlock is a device which permits the passage of people and objects between a pressure vessel and its surroundings while minimizing the change of pressure in the vessel and loss of air from it . The lock consists of a small chamber with two airtight doors in series which do not open simultaneously . An airlock may be used for passage between environments of different gases rather than different pressures , to minimize or prevent the gases from mixing . An airlock may also be used underwater to allow passage between an air environment in a pressure vessel and the water environment outside , in which case the airlock can contain air or water . This is called a floodable airlock or an underwater airlock , and is used to prevent water from entering a submersible vessel or an underwater habitat .",

Formed in Liverpool in 1992 , its video games were marked by an emphasis on graphical effects with arcade gameplay . Rage 's first title Striker sold more than one million copies throughout its two-year life cycle and established Rage as a major creative force in the interactive entertainment industry .

Rage continued to form commercial partnerships with major publishing houses , including Microsoft , Intel , Dell , Compaq , Nintendo , Sony and Sega , and re-registered as a private company as Rage Software Limited in 1999 . In 2000 , Rage began to expand into publishing . However , the costs of publishing and a run of games that did not sell as expected ( most notably the David Beckham franchise ) eventually led to the company closing in January 2003 due to bankruptcy . At its peak , it had offices in Liverpool , Birmingham , Sheffield , Newcastle , Bristol , Dundee and Warrington . Some of the former development staff have formed other game development companies such as Swordfish Studios in Birmingham , Juice Games in Warrington and Venom Games in Newcastle .",

Most modern handset internet browsers now fully support HTML , so they do not need to use WAP markup for web page compatibility , and therefore , most are no longer able to render and display pages written in WML , WAP 's markup language . Before the introduction of WAP , mobile service providers had limited opportunities to offer interactive data services , but needed interactivity to support Internet and Web applications such as email , stock prices , news and sports headlines .
