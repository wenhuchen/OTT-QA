  "/wiki/Delta_1000": "The Delta 1000 series ( also referred to as Straight-Eight ) was an American expendable launch system which was used to conduct eight orbital launches between 1972 and 1975 . It was a member of the Delta family of rockets . Several variants existed , differentiated by a four digit numerical code . The same first stage and boosters were used on all variants . The first stage was an Extended Long Tank Thor , a further stretched version of the Long Tank Thor used on earlier versions , itself derived from the Thor missile . Four , six or nine Castor-2 solid rocket boosters were attached to increase thrust at lift-off . These improvements permitted the Delta 1000 series to lift 1,835 kg ( 4,045 lbs ) to LEO or 635 kg ( 1,400 lbs ) to GTO . The nickname Straight-Eight comes from the fact that its second stage variants had the same 8 ft. ( 2.4 m ) diameter as the first stage ; previous Delta second stages were smaller in diameter . Two different second stages were flown , depending on the variant :",

  "/wiki/Westar_1": "Westar 1 was America 's first domestic and commercially launched geostationary communications satellite , launched by Western Union ( WU ) and NASA on April 13 , 1974 . It was built by Hughes for Western Union , using the HS-333 platform of spin-stabilized satellites . Westar 1 was the first of five Westar satellites launched by Western Union from 1974 to 1982 . Westars 1 , 2 , and 3 were 12-transponder satellites while Westar 4 and Westar 5 were launched with 24 transponders . Western Union built a teleport in Cedar Hill , Texas , to uplink content to the Westar satellites ( it was interconnected to WU 's existing terrestrial microwave network at the time ) , and another teleport that , in addition to uplink services , would become the main TT & C ( telemetry , tracking & control ) center for the satellite ( and for all of the Westar fleet later on ) , in Glenwood , New Jersey . A sixth satellite , Westar 6 , was launched in 1984 but failed to reach orbit and was retrieved by the STS-51-A Space Shuttle mission later that year . It was later refurbished and relaunched in orbit of Asia as AsiaSat 1 in 1990 .",
  "/wiki/Western_Union": "The Western Union Company is an American worldwide financial services and communications company . Its headquarters is in Denver , Colorado . Until it discontinued the service in 2006 , Western Union was globally the best-known American company in the business of exchanging telegrams . Western Union has several divisions , with products such as person-to-person money transfer , money orders , business payments , and commercial services . The company offered standard Cablegrams , as well as Candygrams , Dollygrams , and Melodygrams . Western Union , as an industrialized monopoly , dominated the American telegraph industry in the late 19th century . It was the first communications empire and set a pattern for American-style communications businesses as they are known today . [ neutrality is disputed ]",
  "/wiki/Delta_2000": "The Delta 2000 series was an American expendable launch system which was used to conduct forty-four orbital launches between 1974 and 1981 . It was a member of the Delta family of rockets . Several variants existed , which were differentiated by a four digit numerical code . The Delta 1000 , 2000 and 3000 series used surplus NASA Apollo program rockets engines for its first and second stages . The first stage was an Extended Long Tank Thor , re-engined with the Rocketdyne RS-27 replacing the earlier MB-3-III engine . The RS-27 engine was a rebranded H-1 engine used in the Saturn 1B with minor changes . Three or nine Castor-2 solid rocket boosters were attached to increase thrust at lift-off . The Delta-P second stage used the TRW TR-201 engine . The TR-201 engine was a Lunar Module Descent Engine reconfigured for fixed thrust output . Launches which required a three-stage configuration in order to reach higher orbits used the Thiokol Star-37D or 37E upper stage as an apogee kick motor . Delta 2000 launches occurred from Space Launch Complex 2W at Vandenberg AFB and both pads of Launch Complex 17 at Cape Canaveral . Forty-three out of forty-four launches were successful .",
