They established themselves as a major force within the first 15 years of the League of Ireland , winning 5 league titles , 2 FAI Cups and 4 Shields , but struggled for decades after that , largely due to their strict amateur status , going 34 seasons without winning a major trophy . Bohemians dropped their amateur ethos in 1969 and proceeded to win 2 League titles , 2 FAI Cups and 2 League cups during the 1970s . They suffered a further decline throughout the 1980s and most of the 1990s before claiming League and Cup doubles in 2001 and 2008 , alongside the 2003 and most recently 2009 title wins .
