Only 45 by 25 feet ( 13.7 by 7.6 m ) in size , it was built between 1865 and 1885 as a mission of the Oblate Fathers . Father \u00c9mile Petitot , renowned ethnologist , linguist and geographer of the Canadian northwest was a resident of the mission from 1864 to 1878 . The building 's simple exterior , with its wooden siding , steep pitched roof , lancet windows and lancet entranceway under a steepled bell tower , make it a rather plain example of Carpenter Gothic style architecture , which belies the extraordinary painted decoration of its interior . The Church of Our Lady of Good Hope was designated a National Historic Site of Canada on June 6 , 1977 .

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture_in_Canada": "Gothic Revival architecture in Canada is an historically influential style , with many prominent examples . The Gothic Revival was imported to Canada from Britain and the United States in the early 19th century , and rose to become the most popular style for major projects throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries . The Gothic Revival period lasted longer and was more thoroughly embraced in Canada than in either Britain or the United States , only falling out of style in the 1930s . The late 19th and early 20th centuries was also the period when many major Canadian institutions were founded . Throughout Canada many of the most prominent religious , civic , and scholastic institutions are housed in Gothic Revival style buildings . In the 1960s and 1970s several scholars , most notably Alan Gowans , embraced Canadian Gothic Revival architecture as one of the nation 's signature styles and as an integral part of Canadian nationalism . While largely abandoned in the modernist period , several postmodern architects have embraced Canada 's neo-Gothic past .",

  "/wiki/Aboriginal_peoples_in_Canada": "Indigenous Canadians , also known as Aboriginal Canadians , are the indigenous peoples within the boundaries of Canada . They comprise the First Nations , Inuit and M\u00e9tis , and are sometimes referred to by the initialism FNIM ( First Nations , Inuit , M\u00e9tis ) . Although Indian is a term still commonly used in legal documents , the descriptors Indian and Eskimo have somewhat fallen into disuse in Canada and some consider them to be pejorative . Similarly , Aboriginal as a collective noun is a specific term of art used in some legal documents , including the Constitution Act , 1982 , though in some circles that word is also falling into disfavour . Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are some of the earliest known sites of human habitation in Canada . The Paleo-Indian Clovis , Plano and Pre-Dorset cultures pre-date current indigenous peoples of the Americas . Projectile point tools , spears , pottery , bangles , chisels and scrapers mark archaeological sites , thus distinguishing cultural periods , traditions and lithic reduction styles . The characteristics of Canadian Indigenous culture included permanent settlements , agriculture , civic and ceremonial architecture , complex societal hierarchies and trading networks . The M\u00e9tis culture of mixed blood originated in the mid-17th century when First Nation and Inuit people married Europeans . The Inuit had more limited interaction with European settlers during that early period . Various laws , treaties , and legislation have been enacted between European immigrants and First Nations across Canada .

He upheld the Church 's teachings on such matters as the right to life , artificial contraception , the ordination of women , and a celibate clergy , and although he supported the reforms of the Second Vatican Council , he was seen as generally conservative in their interpretation . He was one of the most travelled world leaders in history , visiting 129 countries during his pontificate . As part of his special emphasis on the universal call to holiness , he beatified 1,340 and canonised 483 people , more than the combined tally of his predecessors during the preceding five centuries . By the time of his death , he had named most of the College of Cardinals , consecrated or co-consecrated a large number of the world 's bishops , and ordained many priests .

It is the longest river system in Canada , and includes the second largest drainage basin of any North American river after the Mississippi . The Mackenzie River flows through a vast , thinly populated region of forest and tundra entirely within the Northwest Territories in Canada , although its many tributaries reach into five other Canadian provinces and territories . The river 's main stem is 1,738 kilometres ( 1,080 mi ) long , flowing north-northwest from Great Slave Lake into the Arctic Ocean , where it forms a large delta at its mouth . Its extensive watershed drains about 20 percent of Canada . It is the largest river flowing into the Arctic from North America , and including its tributaries has a total length of 4,241 kilometres ( 2,635 mi ) , making it the thirteenth longest river system in the world . The ultimate source of the Mackenzie River is Thutade Lake , in the Northern Interior of British Columbia .

  "/wiki/North-West_Mounted_Police": "The North-West Mounted Police ( NWMP ) was a Canadian police force , established in 1873 by the Prime Minister , Sir John Macdonald , to maintain order in the North-West Territories . The mounted police combined military , police and judicial functions along similar lines to the Royal Irish Constabulary , and deployed the following year to the Alberta border in response to the Cypress Hills Massacre and subsequent fears of a United States military intervention . Their ill-planned and arduous journey of nearly 900 miles ( 1,400 km ) became known as the March West and was portrayed by the force as an epic journey of endurance . Over the next few years , the police extended Canadian law across the region , establishing good working relationships with the First Nations . The force formed part of the military response to the North-West Rebellion in 1885 , but faced criticism for their performance during the conflict . The mounted police assisted in the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway , including relocating indigenous communities living along the route . The force established a wide network of posts and patrols , enabling them to protect and assist the ranchers who created huge cattle businesses across the prairies . The living conditions of the police on the prairies were spartan and often uncomfortable , and only slowly improved over the course of the century . Meanwhile , the railway enabled more settlers to migrate west , creating new towns and industries , while the force restricted the First Nations to the reserves . The mounted police faced challenges in adapting to the changing situation , especially when applying the unpopular prohibition laws to the white community . The force also became drawn into the growing number of industrial disputes between organised labour and company owners . By 1896 , the government planned to pass policing responsibilities to the provincial authorities and ultimately close the force .",

Aboriginal peoples in Canada and Native Americans in the United States of various regions traded among themselves in the pre-Columbian Era . Europeans participated in the trade from the time of their arrival in the New World , extending the trade 's reach to Europe . The French started trading in the 16th century , the English established trading posts on Hudson Bay in present-day Canada during the 17th century , while the Dutch had trade by the same time in New Netherland . North American fur trade was at its peak of economic importance in the 19th century , and involved the development of elaborate trade networks . The fur trade became one of the main economic ventures in North America attracting competition among the French , British , Dutch , Spanish , and Russians . Indeed , in the early history of the United States , capitalizing on this trade , and removing the British stranglehold over it , was seen as a major economic objective . Many Native American societies across the continent came to depend on the fur trade as their primary source of income . By the mid-1800s changing fashions in Europe brought about a collapse in fur prices . The American Fur Company and some other companies failed .

  "/wiki/Beluga_(whale)": "The beluga whale ( /b\u026a\u02c8lu\u02d0\u0261\u0259/ ) ( Delphinapterus leucas ) is an Arctic and sub-Arctic cetacean . It is one of two members of the family Monodontidae , along with the narwhal , and the only member of the genus Delphinapterus . It is also known as the white whale , as it is the only cetacean of this colour ; the sea canary , due to its high-pitched calls ; and the melonhead , though that more commonly refers to the melon-headed whale , which is an oceanic dolphin . The beluga is adapted to life in the Arctic , so it has anatomical and physiological characteristics that differentiate it from other cetaceans . Amongst these are its all-white colour and the absence of a dorsal fin , which allows them to swim under ice with ease . It possesses a distinctive protuberance at the front of its head which houses an echolocation organ called the melon , which in this species is large and deformable . The beluga 's body size is between that of a dolphin and a true whale , with males growing up to 5.5 m ( 18 ft ) long and weighing up to 1,600 kg ( 3,530 lb ) . This whale has a stocky body . Like many cetaceans , a large percentage of its weight is blubber ( subcutaneous fat ) . Its sense of hearing is highly developed and its echolocation allows it to move about and find breathing holes under sheet ice . Belugas are gregarious and form groups of 10 animals on average , although during the summer , they can gather in the hundreds or even thousands in estuaries and shallow coastal areas . They are slow swimmers , but can dive to 700 m ( 2,300 ft ) below the surface .",

  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",
  "/wiki/William_Parry_(explorer)": "Sir William Edward Parry FRS ( 19 December 1790 - 8 July 1855 ) was an Anglo-Welsh explorer of the Arctic who was known for his 1819 expedition through the Parry Channel , probably the most successful in the long quest for the Northwest Passage . In 1827 , he attempted one of the earliest expeditions to the North Pole . He reached 82\u00b0 45\u2032 N , setting the record for human exploration Farthest North that stood for nearly five decades before being surpassed at 83\u00b0 20\u2032 N by Sir Albert Hastings Markham in 1875 .",
  "/wiki/Northwest_Passage": "The Northwest Passage ( NWP ) is the sea route to the Pacific Ocean through the Arctic Ocean , along the northern coast of North America via waterways through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago . The eastern route along the Arctic coasts of Norway and Siberia is accordingly called the Northeast Passage ( NEP ) . The various islands of the archipelago are separated from one another and from the Canadian mainland by a series of Arctic waterways collectively known as the Northwest Passages or Northwestern Passages . For centuries , European explorers sought a navigable passage as a possible trade route to Asia . An ice-bound northern route was discovered in 1850 by the Irish explorer Robert McClure ; it was through a more southerly opening in an area explored by the Scotsman John Rae in 1854 that Norwegian Roald Amundsen made the first complete passage in 1903-1906 . Until 2009 , the Arctic pack ice prevented regular marine shipping throughout most of the year . Arctic sea ice decline has rendered the waterways more navigable for ice navigation . The contested sovereignty claims over the waters may complicate future shipping through the region : the Canadian government maintains that the Northwestern Passages are part of Canadian Internal Waters , but the United States and various European countries claim that they are an international strait and transit passage , allowing free and unencumbered passage . If , as has been claimed , parts of the eastern end of the Passage are barely 15 metres ( 49 ft ) deep , the route 's viability as a Euro-Asian shipping route is reduced . In 2016 a Chinese shipping line expressed a desire to make regular voyages of cargo ships using the passage to the eastern United States and Europe , after a successful passage by Nordic Orion of 73,500 tonnes deadweight tonnage in September 2013 . [ needs update ] Fully loaded , Nordic Orion sat too deep in the water to sail through the Panama Canal .",

  "/wiki/Prince_Edward_Island": "Prince Edward Island ( PEI ) is a province of Canada and one of the three Maritime Provinces . It is the smallest province of Canada in both land area and population , but it is the most densely populated . Part of the traditional lands of the Mi'kmaq , it became a British colony in the 1700s and was federated into Canada as a province in 1873 . Its capital is Charlottetown . According to Statistics Canada , the province of PEI has 155,318 residents . The backbone of the island economy is farming ; it produces 25% of Canada 's potatoes . Other important industries include the fisheries , tourism , aerospace , bio-science , IT , and renewable energy . The island has several informal names : Garden of the Gulf , referring to the pastoral scenery and lush agricultural lands throughout the province ; and Birthplace of Confederation or Cradle of Confederation , referring to the Charlottetown Conference in 1864 , although PEI did not join Confederation until 1873 , when it became the seventh Canadian province . Historically , PEI is one of Canada 's older settlements and demographically still reflects older immigration to the country , with Scottish , Irish , English and French surnames being dominant . PEI is located about 200 kilometres ( 120 miles ) north of Halifax , Nova Scotia , and 600 kilometres ( 370 miles ) east of Quebec City and has a land area of 5,686.03 km2 ( 2,195.39 sq mi ) .
