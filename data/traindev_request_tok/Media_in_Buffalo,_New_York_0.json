  "/wiki/Sports_radio": "Sports radio ( or sports talk radio ) is a radio format devoted entirely to discussion and broadcasting of sporting events . A widespread programming genre that has a narrow audience appeal , sports radio is characterized by an often-boisterous on-air style and extensive debate and analysis by both hosts and callers . Many sports talk stations also carry play-by-play ( live commentary ) of local sports teams as part of their regular programming . Hosted by Bill Mazer , the first sports talk radio show in history launched in March 1964 on New York 's WNBC ( AM ) . Soon after WNBC launched its program , in 1965 Seton Hall University 's radio station , WSOU , started Hall Line , a call-in sports radio talk show focusing on the team 's basketball program . Having celebrated its 50th anniversary on air during the 2015-2016 season , Hall Line , which broadcasts to central and northern New Jersey as well as all five boroughs of New York , is the oldest and longest running sports talk call-in show in the NY-NJ Metropolitan area , and is believed to be the oldest in the nation . Enterprise Radio Network became the first national all-sports network , operating out of Avon , Connecticut , from New Year 's Day 1981 through late September of that year before going out of business . ER had two channels , one for talk and a second for updates and play-by-play . ER 's talk lineup included current New York Yankees voice John Sterling , New York Mets radio host Ed Coleman and former big-league pitcher Bill Denehy . Sports talk is available in local , network and syndicated forms , is available in multiple languages , and is carried in multiple forms on both major North American satellite radio networks . In the United States , most sports talk-formatted radio stations air syndicated programming from ESPN Radio , SB Nation Radio , Sports Byline USA , Fox Sports Radio , CBS Sports Radio , or NBC Sports Radio , while in the Spanish language , ESPN Deportes Radio is the largest current network . In contrast , Canadian sports talk stations may carry a national brand ( such as TSN Radio or Sportsnet Radio ) but carry mostly local programming , with American-based shows filling in gaps .",

  "/wiki/Multilingual": "Multilingualism is the use of more than one language , either by an individual speaker or by a group of speakers . It is believed that multilingual speakers outnumber monolingual speakers in the world 's population . More than half of all Europeans claim to speak at least one language other than their mother tongue ; but many read and write in one language . Always useful to traders , multilingualism is advantageous for people wanting to participate in globalization and cultural openness . Owing to the ease of access to information facilitated by the Internet , individuals ' exposure to multiple languages is becoming increasingly possible . People who speak several languages are also called polyglots . Multilingual speakers have acquired and maintained at least one language during childhood , the so-called first language ( L1 ) . The first language ( sometimes also referred to as the mother tongue ) is acquired without formal education , by mechanisms about which scholars disagree . Children acquiring two languages natively from these early years are called simultaneous bilinguals . It is common for young simultaneous bilinguals to be more proficient in one language than the other . People who know more than one language have been reported to be more adept at language learning compared to monolinguals . Multilingualism in computing can be considered part of a continuum between internationalization and localization .",

  "/wiki/Border_blaster": "A border blaster is a broadcast station that , though not licensed as an external service , is , in practice , used to target another country . The term border blaster is of North American origin , and usually associated with Mexican AM stations covering large parts of the United States and United States border AM stations covering large parts of Canada . Conceptually similar European broadcasting included some pre-World War II broadcasting towards the United Kingdom , radio p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique around France and the U.S. government-funded propaganda station Radio Free Europe , targeting eastern Europe . With broadcasting signals far more powerful than U.S. stations , the Mexican border blasters could be heard over large areas of the U.S. from the 1940s to the 1970s , often to the great irritation of American radio stations , whose signals could be overpowered by their Mexican counterparts . These are also sometimes referred to as X stations for their call letters : Mexico assigns callsigns beginning with XE or XH to broadcast stations . On November 9 , 1972 in Washington , D.C. , the United States and Mexico signed an Agreement Concerning Frequency Modulation Broadcasting in the 87.5 to 108 MHz Band . Since then , in the FM band power levels and frequency assignments have been set by mutual agreement between the two countries . AM radio border blasters still exist , though they are largely ignored due to the decline of AM radio in the U.S. and in Mexico . There are several such stations licensed by Mexico 's Secretariat of Communications and Transportation using transmitters with an effective radiated power similar to those of major licensed commercial stations located within the USA .",

People have travelled through and inhabited the Toronto area , located on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers , deep ravines , and urban forest , for more than 10,000 years . After the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase , when the Mississauga surrendered the area to the British Crown , the British established the town of York in 1793 and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada . During the War of 1812 , the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy damage by American troops . York was renamed and incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto . It was designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation . The city proper has since expanded past its original borders through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of 630.2 km2 ( 243.3 sq mi ) . The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada .

Sometimes campus radio stations are operated for the purpose of training professional radio personnel , sometimes with the aim of broadcasting educational programming , while other radio stations exist to provide alternative to commercial broadcasting or government broadcasters .

Because of this , campus radio has come to be associated with emerging musical trends , including genres such as punk and new wave , alternative rock , indie rock and hip hop , long before those genres become part of the musical mainstream . Campus radio stations also often provide airplay and promotional exposure to new and emerging local artists .

A number of these radio stations have gained critical acclaim for their programming and are considered by the community in which they are embedded to be an essential media outlet .
