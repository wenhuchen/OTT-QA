  "/wiki/Belle_(Disney)": "Belle is a fictional character in Walt Disney Pictures ' 30th animated feature film Beauty and the Beast ( 1991 ) . Originally voiced by American actress and singer Paige O'Hara , Belle is the non-conforming daughter of an inventor who yearns to abandon her predictable village life in return for adventure . When her father Maurice is imprisoned by a cold-hearted beast , Belle offers him her own freedom in exchange for her father 's , and eventually learns to love the Beast despite his unsightly outward appearance . Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg commissioned Beauty and the Beast as an animated musical with a strong heroine and hired first-time screenwriter Linda Woolverton to write it . Basing her on the heroine of Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont 's fairy tale Beauty and the Beast , Woolverton adapted Belle into a stronger and less passive character for the film . Inspired by the women 's rights movement , Woolverton wanted Belle to be a unique Disney heroine different from The Little Mermaid 's popular Ariel , and thus deliberately conceived the character as a feminist in an effort to avoid the criticism Disney had long been receiving due to the studio 's reputation of depicting its female characters as victims . Belle 's strength and love of reading was inspired by American actress Katharine Hepburn 's performance as Jo March in the film Little Women ( 1933 ) , while the writers instilled the adventure-seeking heroine with goals and aspirations beyond romance . However , the story artists and animators often contested Woolverton 's liberated vision for the character . Animated by James Baxter and Mark Henn , the former of whom based the character 's graceful gait on those of impressionist Edgar Degas ' ballerinas , Belle 's European facial features were inspired by those of British actresses Vivien Leigh and Audrey Hepburn . Several additional Hollywood actresses inspired Belle 's appearance , including Natalie Wood , Elizabeth Taylor , and Grace Kelly . Belle has garnered widespread acclaim from film critics who appreciated the character 's bravery , intelligence and independence . Reception towards her feminism , however , has been more mixed , with commentators accusing the character 's actions of being romance-oriented .",
