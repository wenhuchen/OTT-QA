  "/wiki/Win_(baseball)": "In baseball and softball , a pitcher 's win-loss record ( also referred to simply as their record ) indicates the number of wins ( denoted W ) and losses ( denoted L ) they have been credited with . For example , a 20-10 win-loss record would represent 20 wins and 10 losses . In each game , one pitcher on the winning team is awarded a win ( the winning pitcher ) and one pitcher on the losing team is given a loss ( the losing pitcher ) in their respective statistics . These pitchers are collectively known as the pitchers of record . The designation of win or loss for a pitcher is known as a decision , and only one pitcher for each team receives a decision . A starting pitcher who does not receive credit for a win or loss is said to have no decision . In certain situations , another pitcher on the winning team who pitched in relief of the winning pitcher can be credited with a save , and holds can be awarded to relief pitchers on both sides , but these are never awarded to the same pitcher who is awarded the win . The decisions are awarded by the official scorer of the game in accordance with the league 's rules . The official scorer does not assign a winning or losing pitcher in some games which are forfeited , such as those that are tied at the time of forfeiture . If the game is tied ( a rare event ) , no pitcher is awarded any decision . A pitcher 's winning percentage is calculated by dividing the number of wins by the number of decisions ( wins plus losses ) , and it is commonly expressed with three decimal places .",
  "/wiki/Jack_Chesbro": "John Dwight Chesbro ( June 5 , 1874 - November 6 , 1931 ) was an American Major League Baseball ( MLB ) pitcher . Nicknamed Happy Jack , Chesbro played for the Pittsburgh Pirates ( 1899-1902 ) , the New York Highlanders ( 1903-1909 ) , and the Boston Red Sox ( 1909 ) . Chesbro finished his career with a 198-132 win-loss record , a 2.68 earned run average , and 1,265 strikeouts . His 41 wins during the 1904 season remains an American League record . Though some pitchers have won more games in some seasons prior to 1901 , historians demarcating 1901 as the beginning of 'modern-era ' major league baseball refer to and credit Jack Chesbro and his 1904 win-total as the modern era major league record and its holder . Some view Chesbro 's 41 wins in a season as an unbreakable record . Chesbro 's 1904 pitching totals of 51 games started and 48 complete games also fall into the same historical category as his 1904 wins total , as they are all-time American League single-season records . These 1904 single-season totals for games started and complete games , like the wins total , are also the most recorded by a pitcher in either the American or National League since the beginning of the twentieth century and the co-existence of the American and National Leagues as major leagues . If one demarcates 1901 as the beginning of major league baseball 's modern era , Jack Chesbro holds the modern era major league historical single-season records for wins by a pitcher ( 41 ) , games started by a pitcher ( 51 ) , and complete games pitched ( 48 ) . Chesbro was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946 by the Veterans Committee , though he had received little consideration from the Baseball Writers ' Association of America ( BBWAA ) . Some baseball historians consider the 1946 election a mistake , and believe that Chesbro was elected solely on the basis of his 1904 season .",

  "/wiki/Strikeout": "In baseball or softball , a strikeout ( or strike-out ) occurs when a batter racks up three strikes during a time at bat . It usually means the batter is out . A strikeout is a statistic recorded for both pitchers and batters , and is denoted by K. A strikeout looking - in which the batter does not swing and the third strike is called by the umpire - is usually denoted by a \ua4d8 . Although a strikeout suggests that the pitcher dominated the batter , the free-swinging style that generates home runs also leaves batters susceptible to striking out . Some of the greatest home run hitters of all time - such as Alex Rodriguez , Reggie Jackson , and Jim Thome - were notorious for striking out .",

In 2003 , the Yankees retired Guidry 's uniform number ( 49 ) and dedicated a plaque to him in Monument Park .",
  "/wiki/Earned_run_average": "In baseball statistics , earned run average ( ERA ) is the average of earned runs given up by a pitcher per nine innings pitched ( i.e . the traditional length of a game ) . It is determined by dividing the number of earned runs allowed by the number of innings pitched and multiplying by nine . Runs resulting from passed balls or defensive errors ( including pitchers ' defensive errors ) are recorded as unearned runs and omitted from ERA calculations .",
  "/wiki/Spud_Chandler": "Spurgeon Ferdinand Spud Chandler ( September 12 , 1907 - January 9 , 1990 ) was an American professional baseball player . He played in Major League Baseball as a right-handed starting pitcher and played his entire career for the New York Yankees from 1937 through 1947 . He was named the American League 's Most Valuable Player in 1943 after anchoring the team 's pitching staff with 20 wins and only 4 losses as New York won its third consecutive pennant ; his 1.64 earned run average in that season was the lowest by any major league pitcher between 1920 and 1967 , and remains a Yankees team record . In eleven seasons , he never suffered a losing record ; with a total of 109 wins and 43 losses , his career winning percentage of .717 is the highest of any pitcher with at least 100 victories since 1876 .",
  "/wiki/Earned_run": "In baseball , an earned run is any run that was fully enabled by the offensive team 's production in the face of competent play from the defensive team . Conversely , an unearned run is a run that would not have been scored without the aid of an error or a passed ball committed by the defense . An unearned run counts just as much as any other run for the purpose of determining the score of the game . However , it is unearned in that it was , in a sense , given away by the defensive team . Both total runs and earned runs are tabulated as part of a pitcher 's statistics . However , earned runs are specially denoted because of their use in calculating a pitcher 's earned run average ( ERA ) , the number of earned runs allowed by the pitcher per nine innings pitched ( i.e. , averaged over a regulation game ) . Thus , in effect , the pitcher is held personally accountable for earned runs , while the responsibility for unearned runs is shared with the rest of the team . To determine whether a run is earned , the official scorer must reconstruct the inning as it would have occurred without errors or passed balls .",
  "/wiki/Sam_Jones_(baseball)": "Samuel Toothpick Jones ( December 14 , 1925 - November 5 , 1971 ) was an American Major League Baseball pitcher with the Cleveland Indians , Chicago Cubs , St. Louis Cardinals , San Francisco Giants , Detroit Tigers and the Baltimore Orioles between 1951 and 1964 . He batted and threw right-handed . Born in Stewartsville , Ohio , Jones played for several Negro League teams , including the Orlando All-Stars in 1946 ; and the Cleveland Buckeyes , where he played under the management of Quincy Trouppe , in 1947 and 1948 ; and the Kansas City Royals , touring Negro League squad handpicked by Satchel Paige . In 1948-49 he played in Panama , and then , with the end of the Negro National League , played semi-pro ball until he was signed by the Indians organization in the fall of 1949 , playing Class A ball in the season and winter ball for Panama in 1949-50 . Jones began his major league career with the Cleveland Indians in 1951 . When he entered a game on May 3 , 1952 , 39-year-old rookie Quincy Trouppe , a Negro League veteran , was behind the plate . Together they formed the first black battery in American League history . Both Sam Jones and Quincy Trouppe played for the Cleveland Buckeyes in the Negro American League . After the 1954 season , the Tribe traded him to the Chicago Cubs for two players to be named later , one of whom was slugger Ralph Kiner . In 1956 , the Cubs traded him to the St. Louis Cardinals in a multi-player deal ; prior to the 1959 season , he was dealt this time to the San Francisco Giants for Bill White and Ray Jablonski . He was picked 25th by the expansion Houston Colt .45s in the 1961 expansion draft , then traded to the Detroit Tigers for Bob Bruce and Manny Montejo . He rejoined the Cardinals for the 1963 campaign and played 1964 with the Baltimore Orioles .",

  "/wiki/Jack_Powell_(baseball)": "John Joseph Powell ( July 9 , 1874 - October 17 , 1944 ) was a Major League Baseball pitcher around the turn of the 19th and 20th century . He had a relatively successful 16-year career , which lasted from 1897 to 1912 - he won 245 games , but also lost 254 games . So , despite his sparking 2.97 career ERA , he holds the record for most wins by a pitcher with a career losing record . Powell was born in Bloomington , Illinois . He made his debut with the Cleveland Spiders in 1897 , and by 1898 he became one of the best pitchers on the team . His 23 wins trailed only teammate Cy Young . He was one of the star players sold to the St. Louis Browns before the 1899 season . He won 23 games again that year , which was three more than the Spiders had all year . After three successful seasons , he was lured to the new American League in 1902 , where he pitched for the St. Louis Browns . Powell was traded to the New York Highlanders before the 1904 season , where he went 23-19 . However , after an 8-13 start in 1905 , he was traded back to the Browns . By this time , the Browns had become one of the worst teams in the league .",
  "/wiki/Shutouts_in_baseball": "In Major League Baseball , a shutout ( denoted statistically as ShO or SHO ) refers to the act by which a single pitcher pitches a complete game and does not allow the opposing team to score a run . If two or more pitchers combine to complete this act , no pitcher is awarded a shutout , although the team itself can be said to have shut out the opposing team . The ultimate single achievement among pitchers is a perfect game , which has been accomplished 23 times in over 135 years , most recently by F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez of the Seattle Mariners on August 15 , 2012 . By definition , a perfect game is counted as a shutout . A no-hitter completed by one pitcher is also a shutout unless the opposing team manages to score through a series of errors , base on balls , catcher 's interferences , dropped third strikes , or hit batsmen . The all-time career leader in shutouts is Walter Johnson , who pitched for the Washington Senators from 1907-1927 . He accumulated 110 shutouts , which is 20 more than the second place leader , Pete Alexander . The most shutouts recorded in one season was 16 , which was a feat accomplished by both Pete Alexander ( 1916 ) and George Bradley ( 1876 ) . These records are considered among the most secure records in baseball , because pitchers today rarely earn more than one or two shutouts per season with a heavy emphasis on pitch count and relief pitching . Complete games themselves have also become rare among starting pitchers . The current leader among active players for career shutouts is Clayton Kershaw , who has thrown 15 .",
  "/wiki/Save_(baseball)": "In baseball , a save ( abbreviated SV or S ) is credited to a pitcher who finishes a game for the winning team under certain prescribed circumstances . Most commonly a pitcher earns a save by entering in the ninth inning of a game in which his team is winning by three or fewer runs and finishing the game by pitching one inning without losing the lead . The number of saves or percentage of save opportunities successfully converted are oft-cited statistics of relief pitchers , particularly those in the closer role . The save statistic was created by journalist Jerome Holtzman in 1959 to measure the effectiveness of relief pitchers and was adopted as an official MLB statistic in 1969 . The save has been retroactively measured for pitchers before that date . Mariano Rivera is MLB 's all-time leader in regular-season saves with 652 .",
  "/wiki/Mariano_Rivera": "Mariano Rivera ( born November 29 , 1969 ) is a Panamanian-American former professional baseball pitcher who played 19 seasons in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) for the New York Yankees , from 1995 to 2013 . Nicknamed Mo and Sandman , he spent most of his career as a relief pitcher and served as the Yankees ' closer for 17 seasons . A thirteen-time All-Star and five-time World Series champion , he is MLB 's career leader in saves ( 652 ) and games finished ( 952 ) . Rivera won five American League ( AL ) Rolaids Relief Man Awards and three Delivery Man of the Year Awards , and he finished in the top three in voting for the AL Cy Young Award four times . He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame as part of its class of 2019 in his first year of eligibility , and was the first player ever to be elected unanimously by the Baseball Writers ' Association of America ( BBWAA ) . Raised in the modest Panamanian fishing village of Puerto Caimito , Rivera was an amateur player until he was signed by the Yankees organization in 1990 . He debuted in the major leagues in 1995 as a starting pitcher , before permanently converting to a relief pitcher late in his rookie year . After a breakthrough season in 1996 as a setup man , he became the Yankees ' closer in 1997 . In the following seasons , he established himself as one of baseball 's top relievers , leading the major leagues in saves in 1999 , 2001 , and 2004 . Rivera primarily threw a sharp-moving , mid-90s mile-per-hour cut fastball that frequently broke hitters ' bats and earned a reputation as one of the league 's toughest pitches to hit . With his presence at the end of games , signaled by his foreboding entrance song Enter Sandman , Rivera was a key contributor to the Yankees ' success in the late 1990s and early 2000s . An accomplished postseason performer , he was named the 1999 World Series Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) and the 2003 AL Championship Series MVP , and he holds several postseason records , including lowest earned run average ( ERA ) ( 0.70 ) and most saves ( 42 ) .",

  "/wiki/Games_started": "In baseball statistics , games started ( denoted by GS ) indicates the number of games that a pitcher has started for his team . A pitcher is credited with starting the game if he throws the first pitch to the first opposing batter . If a player is listed in the starting lineup as the team 's pitcher , but is replaced before facing an opposing batter , the player is credited with a game pitched but not a game started ; there have been instances in major league history in which a starting pitcher was removed before his first pitch due to an injury , perhaps suffered while batting or running the bases during the top half of the first inning . The all-time leader for games started is Cy Young with 815 over a 22-year career . The players with the most starts in a single season are Pud Galvin and Will White , each with 75 games started . For position players , games started is also used to denote the number of times their names appear in a team 's starting lineup during the season .",
  "/wiki/Complete_game": "In baseball , a complete game ( denoted by CG ) is the act of a pitcher pitching an entire game without the benefit of a relief pitcher . A pitcher who meets this criterion will be credited with a complete game regardless of the number of innings played - pitchers who throw an entire official game that is shortened by rain will still be credited with a complete game , while starting pitchers who are relieved in extra innings after throwing nine or more innings will not be credited with a complete game . A starting pitcher who is replaced by a pinch hitter in the final half inning of a game will still be credited with a complete game . The frequency of complete games has evolved since the early days of baseball . The complete game was essentially an expectation in the early 20th century and pitchers completed almost all of the games they started . In modern baseball , the feat is much more rare and no pitcher has reached 30 complete games in a season since 1975 ; in the 21st century , a pitcher has thrown 10 or more complete games in a season only twice .",
  "/wiki/Innings_pitched": "In baseball , innings pitched ( IP ) are the number of innings a pitcher has completed , measured by the number of batters and baserunners that are put out while the pitcher is on the pitching mound in a game . Three outs made is equal to one inning pitched . One out counts as one-third of an inning , and two outs counts as two-thirds of an inning . Sometimes , the statistic is written 34.1 , 72.2 , or 91.0 , for example , to represent \u200b34 1\u20443 innings , \u200b72 2\u20443 innings , and 91 innings exactly , respectively . Runners left on base by a pitcher are not counted in determining innings pitched . It is possible for a pitcher to enter a game , give up several hits and possibly even several runs , and be removed before achieving any outs , thereby recording a total of zero innings pitched . Alternatively , it is possible for a pitcher to enter a situation where there are two runners on base and no outs . He 'll throw one pitch which will result in a triple play , and for that one pitch he 'll be credited with a full inning pitched ."
