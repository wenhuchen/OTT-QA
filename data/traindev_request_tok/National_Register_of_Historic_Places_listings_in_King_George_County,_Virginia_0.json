An important river in American history , the Rappahannock was long an area of occupation by indigenous peoples . During the colonial era , early settlements in the Virginia Colony were formed along the river . It was at the center of a major theater of battle in the American Civil War , where tens of thousands of troops fought against each other . Some 10,000 African-American slaves escaped across the river to Union lines and freedom , after the first Battle of Fredericksburg . Due to the river 's significance as an obstacle to north-south movements , it effectively functioned as the boundary of the eastern theater of the war , between the North ( the Union ) and the South ( the Confederate States of America ) . The river drains an area of 2,848 square miles ( 7,380 km2 ) , approximately 6% of Virginia . Much of the watershed is rural and forested , but development in it has increased since the late 20th century with the southward expansion of the Washington , D.C. suburbs ."
