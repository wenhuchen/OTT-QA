  "/wiki/U.S._Route_50": "U.S. Route 50 or U.S. Highway 50 ( US 50 ) is a major east-west route of the U.S. Highway system , stretching just over 3,000 miles ( 4,800 km ) from Interstate 80 ( I-80 ) in West Sacramento , California , to Maryland Route 528 ( MD 528 ) in Ocean City , Maryland , on the Atlantic Ocean . Until 1972 , when it was replaced by Interstate Highways west of the Sacramento area , it extended ( by way of Stockton , the Altamont Pass , and the Bay Bridge ) to San Francisco , near the Pacific Ocean . The Interstates were constructed later and are mostly separate from this route . It generally serves a corridor south of I-70 and I-80 and north of I-64 and I-40 . The route runs through mostly rural desert and mountains in the western United States , with the section through Nevada known as The Loneliest Road in America . In the Midwest , US 50 heads through mostly rural areas of farms as well as a few large cities including Kansas City , Missouri ; St. Louis , Missouri ; and Cincinnati , Ohio . The route continues into the eastern United States , where it passes through the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia before heading through Washington , D.C. From there , US 50 continues through Maryland as a high-speed road to Ocean City . Signs at each end give the length as 3,073 miles ( 4,946 km ) , but the actual distance is slightly less , due to realignments since the former figure was measured . US 50 passes through a total of 12 states ; California , Nevada , Utah , Colorado , Kansas , Missouri , Illinois , Indiana , Ohio , West Virginia , Virginia , and Maryland , as well as the District of Columbia . US 50 was created in 1926 as part of the original U.S. Highway system . The original route planned in 1925 ran from Wadsworth , Nevada , east to Annapolis , Maryland , along several auto trails including the Lincoln Highway , Midland Trail , and the National Old Trails Road . The final 1926 plan had US 50 running from Sacramento , California , east to Annapolis with a gap in west Utah that was bridged by running the route north via Salt Lake City before rerouting it to US 6 in the 1950s .",

The Civil War Trust ( a division of the American Battlefield Trust ) and its federal , state and local partners have acquired and preserved 661 acres ( 2.67 km2 ) of the battlefield , some of which has been acquired by the National Park Service and incorporated into the park . In 2012 , the park acquired land on which sits a monument to the 8th Vermont Infantry and now offers access through semi-regular programs at the site . In March 2013 , the park opened a Visitor Contact Station in Middletown , Virginia , featuring interpretive exhibits and information on how visitors can experience the park .
