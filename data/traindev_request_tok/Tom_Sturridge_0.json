  "/wiki/John_Everett_Millais": "Sir John Everett Millais , 1st Baronet PRA ( UK : /\u02c8m\u026ale\u026a/ MIL-ay , US : /m\u026a\u02c8le\u026a/ mil-AY ; 8 June 1829 - 13 August 1896 ) was an English painter and illustrator who was one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood . He was a child prodigy who , aged eleven , became the youngest student to enter the Royal Academy Schools . The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was founded at his family home in London , at 83 Gower Street ( now number 7 ) . Millais became the most famous exponent of the style , his painting Christ in the House of His Parents ( 1850 ) generating considerable controversy , and painting perhaps the embodiment of the school , Ophelia , in 1850-51 . By the mid-1850s , Millais was moving away from the Pre-Raphaelite style to develop a new form of realism in his art . His later works were enormously successful , making Millais one of the wealthiest artists of his day , but some former admirers including William Morris saw this as a sell-out ( Millais notoriously allowed one of his paintings to be used for a sentimental soap advertisement ) . While these and early 20th-century critics , reading art through the lens of Modernism , viewed much of his later production as wanting , this perspective has changed in recent decades , as his later works have come to be seen in the context of wider changes and advanced tendencies in the broader late nineteenth-century art world , and can now be seen as predictive of the art world of the present . Millais 's personal life has also played a significant role in his reputation . His wife Effie was formerly married to the critic John Ruskin , who had supported Millais 's early work . The annulment of the marriage and her wedding to Millais have sometimes been linked to his change of style , but she became a powerful promoter of his work and they worked in concert to secure commissions and expand their social and intellectual circles .",
