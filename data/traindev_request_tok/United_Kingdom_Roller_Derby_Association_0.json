It is the second-largest city and metropolitan area in England and the United Kingdom , [ b ] with roughly 1.1 million inhabitants within the city area and 3.8 million inhabitants within the metropolitan area . Birmingham is commonly referred to as the second city of the United Kingdom . Located in the West Midlands county and region in England , approximately 100 miles ( 160 km ) from Central London , Birmingham , as one of the United Kingdom 's major cities , is considered to be the social , cultural , financial , and commercial centre of both the East and West Midlands . Distinctively , Birmingham only has small rivers flowing through it , mainly the River Tame and its tributaries River Rea and River Cole - one of the closest main rivers is the Severn , approximately 20 miles ( 32 km ) west of the city centre . Birmingham 's urban area is the second-largest in the United Kingdom , with its most recently estimated population in 2017 being 2,897,303 , and it also lies within the most populated English district . A market town in the medieval period , Birmingham grew in the 18th-century Midlands Enlightenment and subsequent Industrial Revolution , which saw advances in science , technology , and economic development , producing a series of innovations that laid many of the foundations of modern industrial society . By 1791 it was being hailed as the first manufacturing town in the world . Birmingham 's distinctive economic profile , with thousands of small workshops practising a wide variety of specialised and highly skilled trades , encouraged exceptional levels of creativity and innovation and provided an economic base for prosperity that was to last into the final quarter of the 20th century . The Watt steam engine was invented in Birmingham . The resulting high level of social mobility also fostered a culture of political radicalism which , under leaders from Thomas Attwood to Joseph Chamberlain , was to give it a political influence unparalleled in Britain outside London , and a pivotal role in the development of British democracy . From the summer of 1940 to the spring of 1943 , Birmingham was bombed heavily by the German Luftwaffe in what is known as the Birmingham Blitz .",

It came into existence as a metropolitan county in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972 , formed from parts of Staffordshire , Worcestershire and Warwickshire . The county itself is a NUTS 2 region within the wider NUTS 1 region of the same name . The county consists of seven metropolitan boroughs : the City of Birmingham , the City of Coventry and the City of Wolverhampton , as well as the boroughs of Dudley , Sandwell , Solihull and Walsall . The metropolitan county exists in law and as a geographic frame of reference , and as a ceremonial county it has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff . Between 1974 and 1986 , the West Midlands County Council was the administrative body covering the county ; this was abolished on 31 March 1986 , and the constituent metropolitan boroughs effectively became unitary authorities . A new administrative body for the county ( and some of the district surrounding it as Non-Constituent members ) , the West Midlands Combined Authority , was created in June 2016 . Since May 2017 , the authority has been headed by a directly elected Mayor of the West Midlands , a position currently held by Andy Street of the Conservative Party . Other county-wide bodies include the West Midlands Police , the West Midlands Fire Service and Transport for West Midlands . The county is sometimes described as the West Midlands metropolitan area or the West Midlands conurbation or Greater Birmingham , although these have different , and less clearly defined , boundaries . The main conurbation , or urban area , does not include Coventry for example . The name West Midlands is also used for the much larger West Midlands region , which sometimes causes confusion , not surprising perhaps when geographically it is on the eastern side of the region , the western side comprising Shropshire and Herefordshire the southern side comprising Worcestershire and most of Warwickshire .",

Brighton began to attract more visitors following improved road transport to London and becoming a boarding point for boats travelling to France . The town also developed in popularity as a health resort for sea bathing as a purported cure for illnesses . In the Georgian era , Brighton developed as a fashionable seaside resort , encouraged by the patronage of the Prince Regent , later King George IV , who spent much time in the town and constructed the Royal Pavilion in the Regency era . Brighton continued to grow as a major centre of tourism following the arrival of the railways in 1841 , becoming a popular destination for day-trippers from London . Many of the major attractions were built in the Victorian era , including the Metropole Hotel ( now Hilton ) Grand Hotel , the West Pier , and the Brighton Palace Pier .
