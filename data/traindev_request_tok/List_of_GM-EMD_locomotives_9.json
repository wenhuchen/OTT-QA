  "/wiki/AAR_wheel_arrangement": "The AAR wheel arrangement system is a method of classifying locomotive ( or unit ) wheel arrangements that was developed by the Association of American Railroads . It is essentially a simplification of the European UIC classification , and it is widely used in North America to describe diesel and electric locomotives . It is not used for steam locomotives which use the Whyte notation instead . The AAR system counts axles instead of wheels . Letters refer to powered axles , and numbers to unpowered ( or idler ) axles . A refers to one powered axle , B to two powered axles in a row , C to three powered axles in a row , and D to four powered axles in a row . 1 refers to one idler axle , and 2 to two idler axles in a row . A dash ( - ) separates trucks , or wheel assemblies . A plus sign ( + ) refers to articulation , either by connecting bogies with span bolsters or by connecting individual locomotives via solid drawbars instead of couplers .",
  "/wiki/Prime_mover_(locomotive)": "In engineering , a prime mover is an engine that converts fuel to useful work . In locomotives , the prime mover is thus the source of power for its propulsion . In an engine-generator set , the engine is the prime mover , as distinct from the generator .",
  "/wiki/Horsepower": "Horsepower ( hp ) is a unit of measurement of power , or the rate at which work is done , usually in reference to the output of engines or motors . There are many different standards and types of horsepower . Two common definitions being used today are the mechanical horsepower ( or imperial horsepower ) , which is about 745.7 watts , and the metric horsepower , which is approximately 735.5 watts . The term was adopted in the late 18th century by Scottish engineer James Watt to compare the output of steam engines with the power of draft horses . It was later expanded to include the output power of other types of piston engines , as well as turbines , electric motors and other machinery . The definition of the unit varied among geographical regions . Most countries now use the SI unit watt for measurement of power . With the implementation of the EU Directive 80/181/EEC on January 1 , 2010 , the use of horsepower in the EU is permitted only as a supplementary unit .",
  "/wiki/EMD_FP45": "The EMD FP45 is a cowl unit type of C-C diesel locomotive produced in the United States by General Motors Electro-Motive Division ( EMD ) . It was produced beginning in 1967 at the request of the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway , which did not want its prestigious Super Chief/El Capitan and other passenger trains pulled by freight style hood unit locomotives , which have external walkways .",
  "/wiki/EMD_645": "The EMD 645 family of diesel engines was designed and manufactured by the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors . While the 645 series was intended primarily for locomotive , marine and stationary engine use , one 16-cylinder version powered the 33-19 Titan prototype haul truck designed by GM 's Terex division . The 645 series was an evolution of the earlier 567 series and a precursor to the later 710 series . First introduced in 1965 , the EMD 645 series remained in production on a by-request basis long after it was replaced by the 710 , and most 645 service parts are still in production . The EMD 645 engine series is currently supported by Electro-Motive Diesel , Inc. , which purchased the assets of the Electro-Motive Division from General Motors in 2005 . In 1951 , E. W. Kettering wrote a paper for the ASME entitled , History and Development of the 567 Series General Motors Locomotive Engine , which goes into great detail about the technical obstacles that were encountered during the development of the 567 engine . These same considerations apply to the 645 and 710 , as these engines were a logical extension of the 567C , by applying a cylinder bore increase , 645 , and a cylinder bore increase and a stroke increase , 710 , to achieve a greater power output , without changing the external size of the engines , or their weight , thereby achieving significant improvements in horsepower per unit volume and horsepower per unit weight .",
  "/wiki/Watt": "The watt ( symbol : W ) is a unit of power . In the International System of Units ( SI ) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second , and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer . In SI base units , the watt is described as k g m 2 s \u2212 3 { \\displaystyle kg\\ , m^ { 2 } s^ { -3 } } , which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis . The watt is named after James Watt , an 18th century scottish inventor .",
  "/wiki/EMD_F45": "The EMD F45 was a C-C cowled diesel-electric locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division between 1968 and 1971 . Power was provided by an EMD 645E3 20-cylinder engine which generated 3,600 hp ( 2,680 kW ) .",
  "/wiki/EMD_SDP40F": "The EMD SDP40F was a six-axle 3,000 hp ( 2.2 MW ) C-C diesel-electric locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division ( EMD ) from 1973-1974 . EMD built 150 for Amtrak , the operator of most intercity passenger trains in the United States . Amtrak , a private company but funded by the United States government , had begun operation in 1971 with a fleet of aging diesel locomotives inherited from various private railroads . The SDP40F was the first diesel locomotive built new for Amtrak and for a brief time they formed the backbone of the company 's long-distance fleet . A series of derailments in the mid-1970s shattered Amtrak 's confidence in the locomotive , and many railroads banned it from their tracks . Multiple investigations pointed to issues with the locomotive 's trucks , the weight of the water and steam generators used for train heating , or the vibration of baggage cars behind the locomotive . In 1977 Amtrak decided to move on from the SDP40F in favor of the EMD F40PH , which was already in use on short-distance routes . Amtrak traded most of its fleet into EMD ; the components were incorporated into new F40PHs . The remainder were traded to the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway ( ATSF ) for use in freight service . The Santa Fe rebuilt the locomotives and designated them SDF40-2 . The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway ( BNSF ) , successor to the Santa Fe , retired them in 2002 .",
  "/wiki/EMD_F40C": "The EMD F40C is a 6-axle 3,200 horsepower ( 2.4 MW ) diesel-electric locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division in 1974 for commuter service in Chicago . EMD only built 15 locomotives ; the decline of the 6-axle design for passenger service led to the adoption of the 4-axle EMD F40PH as the standard passenger locomotive in the United States . As of January 2017 , all but two F40Cs have been retired , though none are operating . They have been replaced by the MPI MP36PH-3S in 2003-2004 . Locomotives # 600- # 609 and # 613 were sent to East Saint Louis , Illinois in 2004 and had their road numbers unregistered with the Federal Railroad Administration . They were all scrapped before 2007 . # 610 was unregistered in 2004 and was sent to National Railway Equipment in Dixmoor , Illinois . The only F40Cs that remain in operable condition are # 611 and # 614 . Both locomotives are on long-term hold and are stored in Metra 's Western Avenue rail yard .",
  "/wiki/EMD_F40PH": "The EMD F40PH is a four-axle 3,000-3,200 hp ( 2.2-2.4 MW ) B-B diesel-electric locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division in several variants from 1975 to 1992 . Intended for use on Amtrak 's short-haul passenger routes , it became the backbone of Amtrak 's diesel fleet after the failure of the EMD SDP40F . The F40PH also found widespread use on commuter railroads in the United States and with Via Rail Canada . Additional F40PH variants were remanufactured from older locomotives by Morrison-Knudsen and MotivePower Industries between 1988 and 1998 . Amtrak retired its fleet of F40PHs in the mid-1990s in favor of the GE Genesis , but the locomotive remains the mainstay of Via Rail 's long-distance trains and an image of the locomotive hauling the Canadian was featured on the frontier series of the Canadian $ 10 bill . The F40PHs are still a common sight on many other commuter railroads throughout the United States , and a semi-rare sight on freight railroads . In addition , Amtrak has kept a number of de-engined F40PHs in use as cab cars .",
  "/wiki/GMD_SD40-2F": "The GMD SD40-2F was a 3,000 horsepower ( 2,200 kW ) C-C diesel locomotive built by General Motors Diesel . It was fundamentally an SD40-2 in a cowl unit full-width body . A total of 25 units were built solely for the Canadian Pacific Railway . They were delivered in 1988 and 1989 , after the end of production for the regular SD40-2 . The engines were CP 's only cowl units , and have been nicknamed Red Barns by railfans . The locomotives are numbered 9000-9024 . These were the only new locomotives to be delivered to the CPR in the Action Red paint scheme , a variation upon the Multimark paint scheme lacking the black-and-white emblem . Two engines , numbers 9000 and 9022 , have been repainted in the Dual Flags paint scheme . They were delivered without the porthole in the nose door ; this was retrofitted to most units in the early 1990s . On December 13 , 2012 , CP retired SD40-2F 9000 , 9002 , 9005 , 9010 , 9016 , 9018 , 9019 , 9022 , and 9024 . The 9000 and 9018 ( along with the 9001 ) had been involved in a June 9 , 2009 derailment in Oshawa , Ontario , on CP 's Belleville Sub . In mid to late 2016 , CP retired all of the remaining units .",

  "/wiki/EMD_710": "The EMD 710 is a line of diesel engines built by Electro-Motive Diesel ( previously General Motors ' Electro-Motive Division ) . The 710 series replaced the earlier EMD 645 series when the 645F series proved to be unreliable in the early 1980s 50-series locomotives which featured a maximum engine speed of 950 rpm . The EMD 710 is a relatively large medium speed two-stroke diesel engine that has 710 cubic inches ( 11.6 liters ) displacement per cylinder , and a maximum engine speed of 900 rpm . [ note 1 ] In 1951 , E. W. Kettering wrote a paper for the ASME entitled , History and Development of the 567 Series General Motors Locomotive Engine , which goes into great detail about the technical obstacles that were encountered during the development of the 567 engine . These same considerations apply to the 645 and 710 , as these engines were a logical extension of the 567C , by applying a cylinder bore increase ( 645 ) , and a stroke increase ( 710 ) , to achieve a greater power output , without changing the external size of the engines , or their weight , thereby achieving significant improvements in horsepower per unit volume and horsepower per unit weight . Since its introduction , EMD has continually upgraded the 710G diesel engine . Power output has increased from 3,800 horsepower ( 2,800 kW ) on 1984 's 16-710G3A to 4,500 horsepower ( 3,400 kW ) ( as of 2012 ) on the 16-710G3C-T2 , although most current examples are 4,300 horsepower ( 3,200 kW ) . The 710 has proved to be exceptionally reliable , but the earlier 645 is still supported and most 645 service parts are still in new production , as many 645E-powered GP40-2 and SD40-2 locomotives are still operating after four decades of trouble-free service , and these often serve as a benchmark for engine reliability , which the 710 would meet and eventually exceed , and quite a number of non-SD40-2 locomotives ( SD40 , SD45 , SD40T-2 , and SD45T-2 , for example , and even some SD50s ) , have been rebuilt to the equivalent of SD40-2s with new or remanufactured engines and other subsystems , using salvaged locomotives as a starting point . Some of these rebuilds have been made using new 12-cylinder 710 engines in place of the original 16-cylinder 645 engines , retaining the nominal rating of 3000 horsepower , but with lower fuel consumption . Over the production span of certain locomotive models , upgraded engine models have been fitted when these became available . For example , an early 1994-built SD70MAC had a 16-710G3B , whereas a later 2003-built SD70MAC would have a 16-710G3C-T1 . The engine is made in V-8 , V-12 , V-16 , and V-20 configurations , although most current locomotive production is the V-16 engine , whereas most current marine and stationary engine production is the V-20 engine .",
