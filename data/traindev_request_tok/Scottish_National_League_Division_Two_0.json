The first fifty years of the Gordonian rugby had seen the establishment of a solid and vibrant club , the next fifty one years were to see the club experience many highs and lows as the game was restructured at a national level . First international recognition came to the Club when Bert Bruce took the field for Scotland against Australia at Murrayfield in 1946-47 . The international torch was carried through the rest of the century by players like Donald MacDonald , Ron Glasgow and Ian McCrae . Throughout the late 1950s and the 1960s the club constantly improved its fixture list and played an active role in the development of the game in the North East of Scotland with many players representing the district with Ian McRae , Gordon Hill , A Whyte , and Ian Spence going on to become Scottish trialists . Ian McRae a fantastically energetic and skilled scrum-halve won six Scottish International caps between 1967 and 1972 and like Gordon Hill ( 1961 ) and Ian Spence ( 1963-64 ) also enjoyed the honour of playing for the Barbarians in 1965 . The solid player base and management structure of the 1960s took the club into the 1970s in a strong position . Having established themselves as a force in the 1960s , Gordonians were to see many changes in the 1970s with the introduction of National Leagues in season 1973-74 , the club going open in 1974-75 and being able to welcome many new talented and committed players . The club would see the gradual introduction of a more professional and committed approach to training and the beginning of the occasional end of season tours for the various teams to the North East of England , the West Coast of Scotland or even France in the 80s and South Africa in the 90s . Gordonians started life in Division III of the new National League system in season 1973-74 and immediately won promotion to Division II . However the climb from Division II to I took a further five years to achieve but in the interim the Club had been fortunate to retain a consistent pool of players , the 2nd and 3rd fifteens established themselves at the head of the Midland League and Aberdeen District League respectively .",
