  "/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire": "A Song of Ice and Fire is a series of epic fantasy novels by the American novelist and screenwriter George R. R. Martin . He began the first volume of the series , A Game of Thrones , in 1991 , and it was published in 1996 . Martin , who initially envisioned the series as a trilogy , has published five out of a planned seven volumes . The fifth and most recent volume of the series , A Dance with Dragons , was published in 2011 and took Martin six years to write . He is currently writing the sixth novel , The Winds of Winter . A Song of Ice and Fire takes place on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos . The point of view of each chapter in the story is a limited perspective of a range of characters growing from nine in the first novel , to 31 characters by the fifth novel . Three main stories interweave : a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros , the rising threat of the supernatural Others in northernmost Westeros , and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen , the deposed king 's exiled daughter , to assume the Iron Throne . Martin 's inspirations included the Wars of the Roses and the French historical novels The Accursed Kings by Maurice Druon . A Song of Ice and Fire received praise for its diverse portrayal of women and religion , as well as its realism . An assortment of disparate and subjective points of view confronts the reader , and the success or survival of point-of-view characters is never assured . Within the often morally ambiguous world of A Song of Ice and Fire , questions concerning loyalty , pride , human sexuality , piety , and the morality of violence frequently arise .",

  "/wiki/A_Series_of_Unfortunate_Events": "A Series of Unfortunate Events is a series of thirteen novels written by American author Daniel Handler under the pen name Lemony Snicket . Although they are classified children 's novels , the books often have a dark , mysterious feeling to them . The books follow the turbulent lives of Violet , Klaus , and Sunny Baudelaire . After their parents ' death in a fire , the children are placed in the custody of a murderous relative , Count Olaf , who attempts to steal their inheritance and , later , orchestrates numerous disasters with the help of his accomplices as the children attempt to flee . As the plot progresses , the Baudelaires gradually confront further mysteries surrounding their family and deep conspiracies involving a secret society known as V.F.D. , with connections to Olaf , their parents , and many other relatives . The series is narrated by Lemony Snicket , who dedicates each of his works to his deceased love interest , Beatrice , and often attempts to dissuade the reader from reading the Baudelaires ' story . Characterized by Victorian Gothic tones and absurdist textuality , the books are noted for their dark humor , sarcastic storytelling , and anachronistic elements , as well as frequent cultural and literary allusions . They have been classified as postmodern and metafictional writing , with the plot evolution throughout the later novels being cited as an exploration of the psychological process of transition from the idyllic innocence of childhood to the moral complexity of maturity . Likewise , the final installments of the series are also acknowledged for their escalatingly intricate ethical ambiguity toward philosophical ambivalence , as the nature of some of the Baudelaires ' actions becomes increasingly harder to discern from those of their antagonist counterparts and more characters are revealed to be responsible for permanent wrongdoing , despite their identification with the self-proclaimed good side of the tale . Since the release of the first novel , The Bad Beginning , in September 1999 , the books have gained significant popularity , critical acclaim , and commercial success worldwide , spawning a film , a video game , assorted merchandise and a television series on Netflix . The main thirteen books in the series have collectively sold more than 60 million copies and have been translated into 41 languages . Several companion books set in the same universe of the series have also been released , including Lemony Snicket : The Unauthorized Autobiography , The Beatrice Letters and the noir prequel tetralogy All the Wrong Questions , which chronicles Snicket 's childhood .",

As a child , he was kidnapped and inducted as a neophyte into VFD , where he was trained in rhetoric and sent on seemingly pointless missions , while all connections were severed from his former life , apart from his siblings Jacques and Kit ( who were also kidnapped and inducted ) . In the organization , he met and fell in love with a peer named Beatrice , to whom he got engaged . He was falsely accused of murder and arson ; eventually , the fallacies grew so much that The Daily Punctilio reported his death . Beatrice later moved on and married Bertrand Baudelaire , becoming the mother of Violet , Klaus , and Sunny Baudelaire , the protagonists of A Series of Unfortunate Events . Fourteen years thereafter , Beatrice and Bertrand were supposedly murdered in a house fire , leaving the Baudelaire children orphaned and then pursued by Snicket 's former associate , Count Olaf . Snicket feels indebted to his former fianc\u00e9e and embarks on a quest to chronicle the lives of the Baudelaire children until they become old enough to face the troubles of the world on their own .
