  "/wiki/Boyer\u2013Moore_string_search_algorithm": "In computer science , the Boyer-Moore string-search algorithm is an efficient string-searching algorithm that is the standard benchmark for practical string-search literature . It was developed by Robert S. Boyer and J Strother Moore in 1977 . The algorithm preprocesses the string being searched for ( the pattern ) , but not the string being searched in ( the text ) . It is thus well-suited for applications in which the pattern is much shorter than the text or where it persists across multiple searches . The Boyer-Moore algorithm uses information gathered during the preprocess step to skip sections of the text , resulting in a lower constant factor than many other string search algorithms . In general , the algorithm runs faster as the pattern length increases . The key features of the algorithm are to match on the tail of the pattern rather than the head , and to skip along the text in jumps of multiple characters rather than searching every single character in the text .",

A theoretical physicist by training , he worked as a programmer at the Mathematisch Centrum ( Amsterdam ) from 1952 to 1962 . A university professor for much of his life , Dijkstra held the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in Computer Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin from 1984 until his retirement in 1999 . He was a professor of mathematics at the Eindhoven University of Technology ( 1962-1984 ) and a research fellow at the Burroughs Corporation ( 1973-1984 ) . One of the most influential figures of computing science 's founding generation , Dijkstra helped shape the new discipline from both an engineering and a theoretical perspective . His fundamental contributions cover diverse areas of computing science , including compiler construction , operating systems , distributed systems , sequential and concurrent programming , programming paradigm and methodology , programming language research , program design , program development , program verification , software engineering principles , graph algorithms , and philosophical foundations of computer programming and computer science . Many of his papers are the source of new research areas . Several concepts and problems that are now standard in computer science were first identified by Dijkstra and/or bear names coined by him . As a foremost opponent of the mechanizing view of computing science , he refuted the use of the concepts of 'computer science ' and 'software engineering ' as umbrella terms for academic disciplines . Until the mid-1960s computer programming was considered more an art ( or a craft ) than a scientific discipline . In Harlan Mills 's words ( 1986 ) , programming [ before the 1970s ] was regarded as a private , puzzle-solving activity of writing computer instructions to work as a program . In the late 1960s , computer programming was in a state of crisis .",

  "/wiki/Model_checking": "In computer science , model checking or property checking is a method for checking whether a finite-state model of a system meets a given specification ( a.k.a . correctness ) . This is typically associated with hardware or software systems , where the specification contains liveness requirements ( such as avoidance of livelock ) as well as safety requirements ( such as avoidance of states representing a system crash ) . In order to solve such a problem algorithmically , both the model of the system and its specification are formulated in some precise mathematical language . To this end , the problem is formulated as a task in logic , namely to check whether a structure satisfies a given logical formula . This general concept applies to many kinds of logic as well as suitable structures . A simple model-checking problem consists of verifying whether a formula in the propositional logic is satisfied by a given structure .",

It is named after Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel ( 1802-1829 ) and directly modeled after the Nobel Prizes . It comes with a monetary award of 7.5 million Norwegian Kroner ( NOK ) . The Abel Prize 's history dates back to 1899 , when its establishment was proposed by the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie when he learned that Alfred Nobel 's plans for annual prizes would not include a prize in mathematics . In 1902 , King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway indicated his willingness to finance a mathematics prize to complement the Nobel Prizes , but the establishment of the prize was prevented by the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905 . It took almost a century before the prize was finally established by the Government of Norway in 2001 , and it was specifically intended to give the mathematicians their own equivalent of a Nobel Prize . The laureates are selected by the Abel Committee , the members of which are appointed by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters .
