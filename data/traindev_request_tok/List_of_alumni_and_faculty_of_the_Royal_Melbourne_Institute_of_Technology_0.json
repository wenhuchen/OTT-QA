  "/wiki/United_Nations_Headquarters": "The United Nations is headquartered in New York City , in a complex designed by a board of architects led by Wallace Harrison , and built by the architectural firm Harrison & Abramovitz . The complex has served as the official headquarters of the United Nations since its completion in 1952 . It is located in the Turtle Bay neighborhood of Manhattan , on 17 to 18 acres ( 6.9 to 7.3 ha ) of grounds overlooking the East River . Its borders are First Avenue on the west , East 42nd Street to the south , East 48th Street on the north and the East River to the east . The term Turtle Bay is occasionally used as a metonym for the UN headquarters or for the United Nations as a whole . The headquarters holds the seats of the principal organs of the UN , including the General Assembly and the Security Council , but excluding the International Court of Justice , which is seated in the Hague . The United Nations has three additional , subsidiary , regional headquarters , or headquarters districts . These were opened in Geneva ( Switzerland ) in 1946 , Vienna ( Austria ) in 1980 , and Nairobi ( Kenya ) in 1996 . These adjunct offices help represent UN interests , facilitate diplomatic activities , and enjoy certain extraterritorial privileges , but do not contain the seats of major organs . Although it is situated in New York City , the land occupied by the United Nations Headquarters and the spaces of buildings that it rents are under the sole administration of the United Nations and not the U.S. government . They are technically extraterritorial through a treaty agreement with the U.S. government .

  "/wiki/White_House": "The White House is the official residence and workplace of the president of the United States . It is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington , D.C. and has been the residence of every U.S. president since John Adams in 1800 . The term White House is often used as a metonym for the president and his advisers . The residence was designed by Irish-born architect James Hoban in the neoclassical style . Hoban modelled the building on Leinster House in Dublin , a building which today houses the Oireachtas , the Irish legislature . Construction took place between 1792 and 1800 using Aquia Creek sandstone painted white . When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801 , he ( with architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe ) added low colonnades on each wing that concealed stables and storage . In 1814 , during the War of 1812 , the mansion was set ablaze by the British Army in the Burning of Washington , destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior . Reconstruction began almost immediately , and President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed Executive Residence in October 1817 . Exterior construction continued with the addition of the semi-circular South portico in 1824 and the North portico in 1829 . Because of crowding within the executive mansion itself , President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901 . Eight years later in 1909 , President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office , which was eventually moved as the section was expanded .",

  "/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)": "Victoria ( abbreviated as Vic ) is a state in south-eastern Australia . Victoria is Australia 's smallest mainland state and its second-most populous state ( after New South Wales ) , making it the most densely populated state . Most of its population lives concentrated in the area surrounding Port Phillip Bay , which includes the metropolitan area of its state capital and largest city , Melbourne , Australia 's second-largest city . Victoria is bordered by Bass Strait and Tasmania to the south , [ note 1 ] New South Wales to the north , the Tasman Sea ( a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean ) to the east , and South Australia to the west . The area that is now known as Victoria is the home of many Aboriginal people groups , including the Boon wurrung , the Bratauolung , the Djadjawurrung , the Gunai/Kurnai , the Gunditjmara , the Taungurong , the Wathaurong , the Wurundjeri , and the Yorta Yorta . There were more than 30 Aboriginal languages spoken in the area prior to the European settlement of Australia . The Kulin nation is an alliance of five Aboriginal nations which makes up much of the central part of the state . With Great Britain having claimed the half of the Australian continent that is east of the 135th meridian east in 1788 , Victoria formed part of the wider colony of New South Wales . The first European settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay , and much of what is now Victoria was included in 1836 in the Port Phillip District , an administrative division of New South Wales . Named in honour of Queen Victoria , who signed the division 's separation from New South Wales , the colony was officially established in 1851 and achieved self government in 1855 . The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony , and by the time of the Federation of Australia in 1901 , Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in Australasia . Melbourne served as federal capital of Australia until the construction of Canberra in 1927 , with the Federal Parliament meeting in Melbourne 's Parliament House and all principal offices of the federal government being based in Melbourne .",

  "/wiki/Windsor_Castle": "Windsor Castle is a royal residence at Windsor in the English county of Berkshire . It is notable for its long association with the English and later British royal family and for its architecture . The original castle was built in the 11th century after the Norman invasion of England by William the Conqueror . Since the time of Henry I , it has been used by the reigning monarch and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe . The castle 's lavish early 19th-century State Apartments were described by early 20th century art historian Hugh Roberts as a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste . Inside the castle walls is the 15th-century St George 's Chapel , considered by the historian John Martin Robinson to be one of the supreme achievements of English Perpendicular Gothic design . Originally designed to protect Norman dominance around the outskirts of London and oversee a strategically important part of the River Thames , Windsor Castle was built as a motte-and-bailey , with three wards surrounding a central mound . Gradually replaced with stone fortifications , the castle withstood a prolonged siege during the First Barons ' War at the start of the 13th century . Henry III built a luxurious royal palace within the castle during the middle of the century , and Edward III went further , rebuilding the palace to make an even grander set of buildings in what would become the most expensive secular building project of the entire Middle Ages in England . Edward 's core design lasted through the Tudor period , during which Henry VIII and Elizabeth I made increasing use of the castle as a royal court and centre for diplomatic entertainment . Windsor Castle survived the tumultuous period of the English Civil War , when it was used as a military headquarters by Parliamentary forces and a prison for Charles I . At the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 , Charles II rebuilt much of Windsor Castle with the help of the architect Hugh May , creating a set of extravagant Baroque interiors that are still admired .",
