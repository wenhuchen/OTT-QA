The game was also subject to widespread criticism regarding the status of its loot boxes , which could give players substantial gameplay advantages if purchased with real money . A response from EA 's community team on Reddit on the topic became the single most downvoted comment in the site 's history - and in response , EA decided to temporarily remove microtransactions from the game until a later date . In January 2018 , EA announced that the microtransactions would return in the next few months . These returning microtransactions are purely cosmetic , do not affect gameplay , and are purchased directly through in-game currency rather than through loot crates ."
