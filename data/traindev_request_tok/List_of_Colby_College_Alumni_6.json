It was created in 1924 when Ogden Mills Reid of the New-York Tribune acquired the New York Herald . It was widely regarded as a writer 's newspaper and competed with The New York Times in the daily morning market . The paper won at least nine Pulitzer Prizes during its lifetime . [ a ] A Republican paper , a Protestant paper and a paper more representative of the suburbs than the ethnic mix of the city , according to one later reporter , the Tribune generally did not match the comprehensiveness of The New York Times ' coverage . Its national , international and business coverage , however , was generally viewed as among the best in the industry , as was its overall style . At one time or another , the paper was home to such writers as Dorothy Thompson , Red Smith , Roger Kahn , Richard Watts , Jr. , Homer Bigart , Walter Kerr , Walter Lippmann , St. Clair McKelway , Judith Crist , Dick Schaap , Tom Wolfe , John Steinbeck , and Jimmy Breslin . Editorially , the newspaper was the voice for eastern Republicans , later referred to as Rockefeller Republicans , and espoused a pro-business , internationalist viewpoint . The paper , first owned by the Reid family , struggled financially for most of its life and rarely generated enough profit for growth or capital improvements ; the Reids subsidized the Herald Tribune through the paper 's early years . However , it enjoyed prosperity during World War II and by the end of the conflict had pulled close to the Times in ad revenue . A series of disastrous business decisions , combined with aggressive competition from the Times and poor leadership from the Reid family , left the Herald Tribune far behind its rival . In 1958 , the Reids sold the Herald Tribune to John Hay Whitney , a multimillionaire Wall Street investor who was serving as ambassador to the United Kingdom at the time .",
