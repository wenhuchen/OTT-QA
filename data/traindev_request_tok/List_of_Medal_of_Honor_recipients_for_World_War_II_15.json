It has the highest combined battle fleet tonnage and the world 's largest aircraft carrier fleet , with eleven in service , two new carriers under construction , and five other carriers planned . With 336,978 personnel on active duty and 101,583 in the Ready Reserve , the U.S. Navy is the third largest of the U.S. military service branches in terms of personnel . It has 290 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 operational aircraft as of June 2019 [ update ] , making it the third-largest air force in the world , after the United States Air Force and the United States Army . The U.S. Navy traces its origins to the Continental Navy , which was established during the American Revolutionary War and was effectively disbanded as a separate entity shortly thereafter . After suffering significant loss of goods and personnel at the hands of the Barbary pirates from Algiers , the U.S. Congress passed the Naval Act of 1794 for the construction of six heavy frigates , the first ships of the U.S. Navy . The U.S. Navy played a major role in the American Civil War by blockading the Confederacy and seizing control of its rivers . It played the central role in the World War II defeat of Imperial Japan . The U.S. Navy emerged from World War II as the most powerful navy in the world . The 21st century U.S. Navy maintains a sizable global presence , deploying in strength in such areas as the Western Pacific , the Mediterranean , and the Indian Ocean .

The island of Taiwan has an area of 35,808 square kilometres ( 13,826 sq mi ) , with mountain ranges dominating the eastern two-thirds and plains in the western third , where its highly urbanised population is concentrated . Taipei is the capital and largest metropolitan area . Other major cities include Kaohsiung , Taichung , Tainan and Taoyuan . With 23.7 million inhabitants , Taiwan is among the most densely populated states , and is the most populous state and largest economy that is not a member of the United Nations ( UN ) . Taiwanese indigenous peoples settled the island of Taiwan around 6,000 years ago . In the 17th century , Dutch rule opened the island to mass Han immigration . After the brief Kingdom of Tungning in parts of the southern and western areas of the island , the island was annexed in 1683 by the Qing dynasty of China , and ceded to the Empire of Japan in 1895 . Following the surrender of Japan in 1945 , the Republic of China , which had overthrown and succeeded the Qing in 1911 , took control of Taiwan on behalf of the World War II Allies . The resumption of the Chinese Civil War led to the loss of the mainland to the Communist Party of China and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949 . Although the ROC government continued to claim to be the legitimate representative of China , since 1950 its effective jurisdiction has been limited to Taiwan and numerous smaller islands .",

KIAs include those killed by friendly fire in the midst of combat , but not from incidents such as accidental vehicle crashes , murder and other non-hostile events or terrorism . KIA can be applied both to front-line combat troops and to naval , air and support troops . Someone who is killed in action during a particular event is denoted with a \u2020 ( dagger ) beside their name to signify their death in that event or events .

After the Revolutionary War , the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784 to replace the disbanded Continental Army . The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army , and considers its institutional inception to be the origin of that armed force in 1775 . As a uniformed military service , the U.S. Army is part of the Department of the Army , which is one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense . The U.S. Army is headed by a civilian senior appointed civil servant , the secretary of the Army ( SECARMY ) and by a chief military officer , the chief of staff of the Army ( CSA ) who is also a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .

Its most prominent landmark is Mount Etna , the tallest active volcano in Europe , and one of the most active in the world , currently 3,329 m ( 10,922 ft ) high . The island has a typical Mediterranean climate . The earliest archaeological evidence of human activity on the island dates from as early as 12,000 BC . By around 750 BC , Sicily had three Phoenician and a dozen Greek colonies and it was later the site of the Sicilian Wars and the Punic Wars . After the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD , Sicily was ruled during the Early Middle Ages by the Vandals , the Ostrogoths , the Byzantine Empire , and the Emirate of Sicily . The Norman conquest of southern Italy led to the creation of the Kingdom of Sicily , which was subsequently ruled by the Hohenstaufen , the Capetian House of Anjou , Spain , and the House of Habsburg . It was unified under the House of Bourbon with the Kingdom of Naples as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies . It became part of Italy in 1860 following the Expedition of the Thousand , a revolt led by Giuseppe Garibaldi during the Italian unification , and a plebiscite .

The United States Congress first authorized the Coast Guard to use the promotion to chief petty officer on 18 May 1920 . Chief petty officer is also the final cadet grade in the U.S . Naval Sea Cadet Corps . Prior to 1958 , chief petty officer was the highest enlisted grade in both the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard . This changed on 20 May 1958 with the passage Pub.L . 85-422 , the Military Pay Act of 1958 , which established two new pay grades of E-8 and E-9 in all five branches of the U.S. Armed Forces . In the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard , the new E-8 paygrade was called senior chief petty officer ( SCPO ) and the new E-9 paygrade master chief petty officer ( MCPO ) , with the first selectees promoting to their respective grades in 1959 and 1960 . Prior to establishment of the E-8 and E-9 grades , chief petty officers could typically serve in uniform for 30 or more years . Shortly following establishment of the E-8 and E-9 grades , service limits currently known as high year tenure ( HYT ) were established by pay grade . Although these limits periodically flex based on Fleet manpower requirements , current HYT limits restrict chief petty officers not selected for promotion to senior chief petty officer to 24 years of service , after which they face mandatory retirement .",

They were armed with a battery of twelve 14-inch ( 360 mm ) guns in four three-gun turrets . California served as the flagship of the Battle Fleet in the Pacific Ocean for duration of her peacetime career . She spent the 1920s and 1930s participating in routine fleet training exercises , including the annual Fleet Problems , and cruises around the Americas and further abroad , such as a goodwill visit to Australia and New Zealand in 1925 . California was moored in Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 when the Japanese attacked the port , bringing the United States into World War II . The ship was moderately damaged by a pair of torpedoes and a bomb , but a fire disabled the ship 's electrical system , preventing the pumps from being used to keep the ship afloat . California slowly filled with water over the following three days and eventually sank . Her crew suffered heavy casualties in the attack and four men were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during the attack . She was raised in April 1942 , repaired and heavily rebuilt , and returned to service in January 1944 . The ship thereafter supported the amphibious operations conducted during the Pacific War , including the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign ( though she was damaged in a collision with Tennessee and thus missed the Battle of Peleliu ) and the Philippines campaign , during which she took part in the Battle of Surigao Strait .

  "/wiki/Utah_Beach": "Utah , commonly known as Utah Beach , was the code name for one of the five sectors of the Allied invasion of German-occupied France in the Normandy landings on June 6 , 1944 ( D-Day ) , during World War II . The westernmost of the five code-named landing beaches in Normandy , Utah is on the Cotentin Peninsula , west of the mouths of the Douve and Vire rivers . Amphibious landings at Utah were undertaken by United States Army troops , with sea transport , mine sweeping , and a naval bombardment force provided by the United States Navy and Coast Guard as well as elements from the British , Dutch and other Allied navies . The objective at Utah was to secure a beachhead on the Cotentin Peninsula , the location of important port facilities at Cherbourg . The amphibious assault , primarily by the US 4th Infantry Division and 70th Tank Battalion , was supported by airborne landings of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Division . The intention was to rapidly seal off the Cotentin Peninsula , prevent the Germans from reinforcing Cherbourg , and capture the port as quickly as possible . Utah , along with Sword on the eastern flank , was added to the invasion plan in December 1943 . These changes doubled the frontage of the invasion and necessitated a month-long delay so that additional landing craft and personnel could be assembled in England . Allied forces attacking Utah faced two battalions of the 919th Grenadier Regiment , part of the 709th Static Infantry Division . While improvements to fortifications had been undertaken under the leadership of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel beginning in October 1943 , the troops assigned to defend the area were mostly poorly equipped non-German conscripts . D-Day at Utah began at 01:30 , when the first of the airborne units arrived , tasked with securing the key crossroads at Sainte-M\u00e8re-\u00c9glise and controlling the causeways through the flooded farmland behind Utah so the infantry could advance inland . While some airborne objectives were quickly met , many paratroopers landed far from their drop zones and were unable to fulfill their objectives on the first day .",
  "/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt": "Theodore Roosevelt Jr. ( /\u02c8ro\u028az\u0259v\u025blt/ ROH-z\u0259-velt ; [ b ] October 27 , 1858 - January 6 , 1919 ) was an American statesman , politician , conservationist , naturalist , and writer who served as the 26th president of the United States from 1901 to 1909 . He served as the 25th vice president from March to September 1901 and as the 33rd governor of New York from 1899 to 1900 . Roosevelt emerged as a leader of the Republican Party and became a driving force for the anti-trust policy while supporting Progressive Era policies in the United States in the early 20th century . His face is depicted on Mount Rushmore alongside George Washington , Thomas Jefferson , and Abraham Lincoln . He is generally ranked in polls of historians and political scientists as one of the five best presidents . Roosevelt was a sickly child with debilitating asthma , but he overcame his health problems by embracing a strenuous lifestyle , as well as growing out of his asthma naturally in his young adult years . He integrated his exuberant personality , vast range of interests , and world-famous achievements into a cowboy persona defined by robust masculinity . He was home-schooled , and he began a lifelong naturalist avocation before attending Harvard College . His book The Naval War of 1812 ( 1882 ) established his reputation as a learned historian and as a popular writer . Upon entering politics , he became the leader of the reform faction of Republicans in New York 's state legislature . His wife and his mother both died in rapid succession , and he escaped to a cattle ranch in the Dakotas . He served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under President William McKinley , but he resigned from that post to lead the Rough Riders during the Spanish-American War , returning a war hero .",

  "/wiki/Warrant_Officer_(United_States)": "In the United States Armed Forces , the ranks of warrant officer ( grades W - 1 to W - 5 ; see NATO : WO1-WO5 ) are rated as officers above all non-commissioned officers , candidates , cadets , and midshipmen , but subordinate to the lowest officer grade of O - 1 ( NATO : OF - 1 ) . This application differs from the Commonwealth of Nations and other militaries , where warrant officers are the most senior of the other ranks ( NATO : OR - 8 and OR - 9 ) , equivalent to the US Armed Forces grades of E - 8 and E - 9 . Warrant officers are highly skilled , single-track specialty officers , and while the ranks are authorized by Congress , each branch of the uniformed services selects , manages , and uses warrant officers in slightly different ways . For appointment to the rank of warrant officer one ( W - 1 ) , normally a warrant is approved by the secretary of the respective service . However , appointment to this rank can come via commission by the service secretary , the department secretary , or by the President , but this is more uncommon . For the chief warrant officer ranks ( CW - 2 to CW - 5 ) , these warrant officers are commissioned by the President . Both warrant officers and chief warrant officers take the same oath as regular commissioned officers ( O - 1 to O - 10 ) . Warrant officers can and do command detachments , units , activities , vessels , aircraft , and armored vehicles , as well as lead , coach , train , and counsel subordinates . However , the warrant officer 's primary task as a leader is to serve as a technical expert , providing valuable skills , guidance , and expertise to commanders and organizations in their particular field .",
  "/wiki/USS_Nevada_(BB-36)": "USS Nevada ( BB-36 ) , the second United States Navy ship to be named after the 36th state , was the lead ship of the two Nevada-class battleships . Launched in 1914 , Nevada was a leap forward in dreadnought technology ; four of her new features would be included on almost every subsequent US battleship : triple gun turrets , [ c ] oil in place of coal for fuel , geared steam turbines for greater range , and the all or nothing armor principle . These features made Nevada , alongside its sister ship Oklahoma , the first US Navy standard-type battleships . Her only disadvantage against her continental contemporaries was her slower speed , however , her superior armor , firepower , and secondaries meant she was vastly superior . Nevada served in both World Wars . During the last few months of World War I , Nevada was based in Bantry Bay , Ireland , to protect supply convoys that were sailing to and from Great Britain . In World War II , it was one of the battleships trapped when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor . Nevada was the only battleship to get underway during the attack , making the ship the only bright spot in an otherwise dismal and depressing morning for the United States . Still , it was hit by one torpedo and at least six bombs while steaming away from Battleship Row , forcing the crew to beach the stricken ship on a coral ledge . The ship continued to flood and eventually slid off the ledge and sank to the harbor floor . Nevada was subsequently salvaged and modernized at Puget Sound Navy Yard , allowing it to serve as a convoy escort in the Atlantic and as a fire-support ship in five amphibious assaults ( the invasions of Attu , Normandy , Southern France , Iwo Jima , and Okinawa ) . At the end of World War II , the Navy decided that Nevada was too old to be retained , so they assigned it to be a target ship in the atomic experiments at Bikini Atoll in July 1946 ( Operation Crossroads ) .",
