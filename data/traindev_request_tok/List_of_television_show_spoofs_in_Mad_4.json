  "/wiki/In_Living_Color": "In Living Color is an American sketch comedy television series that originally ran on Fox from April 15 , 1990 to May 19 , 1994 . Keenen Ivory Wayans created , wrote and starred in the program . The show was produced by Ivory Way Productions in association with 20th Century Fox Television and was taped at stage 7 at the Fox Television Center on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood , California . The title of the series was inspired by the NBC announcement of broadcasts being presented in living color during the 1960s , prior to mainstream color television . It also refers to the fact that most of the show 's cast was black , unlike other sketch comedy shows such as Saturday Night Live , whose casts are mostly white . It was controversial due to the Wayans ' decision to portray black humor from the ghetto in a time when mainstream American tastes regarding black comedy had been set by more upscale shows such as The Cosby Show , causing an eventual feud for control between Fox executives and the Wayans . Other members of the Wayans family - Damon , Kim , Shawn , and Marlon - had regular roles , while brother Dwayne frequently appeared as an extra . The show also starred several previously unknown comedians and actors , including Jamie Foxx , Jim Carrey , Tommy Davidson , David Alan Grier , and T'Keyah Crystal Keym\u00e1h . The show introduced Jennifer Lopez and Carrie Ann Inaba as members of In Living Color 's dance troupe The Fly Girls , with actress Rosie Perez serving as choreographer . The show was immensely popular in its first two seasons , capturing more than a 10-point Nielsen rating ; in the third and fourth seasons , ratings faltered as the Wayans brothers fell out with Fox network leadership over creative control and rights . The series won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety , Music or Comedy Series in 1990 . The series gained international prominence for its bold move and its all-time high ratings gained by airing a live , special episode as a counterprogram for the halftime show of U.S. leader CBS 's live telecast of Super Bowl XXVI , prompting the National Football League to book A-list acts for future game entertainment , starting with Michael Jackson the following year ."
