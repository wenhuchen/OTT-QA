  "/wiki/Caliber": "In guns , particularly firearms , caliber ( or calibre in British English ) is the specified nominal internal diameter of the gun barrel bore regardless of how or where the bore is measured and whether or not the finished bore matches that specification . It is measured in inches to an accuracy of hundredths or thousandths of an inch or in millimeters . For example , a .45 caliber firearm has a barrel diameter of roughly 0.45 inches ( 11 mm ) . Barrel diameters can also be expressed using metric dimensions . For example , a 9 mm pistol has a barrel diameter of about 9 millimeters . Due to the inaccuracy and imprecision of imperial dimensions converted to metric units , metric designations are typically far out of specifications published in decimal inches . True caliber specifications require imperial measure , and even when cartridge designations ( often mistakenly referred to as caliber ) only specify caliber to even tenths or hundredths of an inch , actual barrel/chamber/projectile dimensions are published to at least thousandths of an inch and frequently tolerances extend into ten-thousandths of an inch . In a rifled barrel , the distance is measured between opposing lands or between opposing grooves ; groove measurements are common in cartridge designations originating in the United States , while land measurements are more common elsewhere in the world . Measurements across the grooves are used for maximum precision because rifling and the specific caliber so-measured is the result of final machining process which cuts grooves into the rough bore leaving the lands behind . Good performance requires a concentric , straight bore that accurately centers the projectile within , in preference to a tight fit which can be achieved even with off-center , crooked bores that cause excessive friction , fouling and an out-of-balance , wobbling projectile in flight . While modern firearms are generally referred to by the name of the cartridge the gun is chambered for , they are still categorized together based on bore diameter . For example , a firearm might be described as a 30 caliber rifle , which could be any of a wide range of cartridges using a roughly 0.30 inches ( 7.6 mm ) projectile ; or a 22 rimfire , referring to any rimfire firearms firing cartridges with a .22 caliber projectile .",
  "/wiki/M6_Gun_Motor_Carriage": "The 37 mm Gun Motor Carriage M6 , also known as M6 Fargo , and under the manufacturer ( Dodge ) 's designation WC55 , was a modified Dodge WC52 light truck mounting a light anti-tank gun . It was used by the United States Army for infantry support and as a mobile anti-tank gun . It operated from late 1942 to January 1945 in the Mediterranean , European , and Pacific theaters of World War II . The M6 saw limited use during the war , and was poorly suited to modern warfare as it was unarmored and was armed with a too small caliber gun . Being required to back into firing positions rather than forward firing proved to be a deficiency .",

European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

  "/wiki/Nazi_Germany": "Nazi Germany is the common English name for Germany between 1933 and 1945 , when Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party ( NSDAP ) controlled the country through a dictatorship . Under Hitler 's rule , Germany became a totalitarian state where nearly all aspects of life were controlled by the government . The official name of the state was Deutsches Reich ( German Reich ) until 1943 and Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich ( Greater German Reich ) from 1943 to 1945 . Nazi Germany is also known as the Third Reich ( Drittes Reich ) , meaning Third Realm or Third Empire , the first two being the Holy Roman Empire ( 800-1806 ) and the German Empire ( 1871-1918 ) . The Nazi regime ended after the Allies defeated Germany in May 1945 , ending World War II in Europe . Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by the President of the Weimar Republic , Paul von Hindenburg , on 30 January 1933 . The NSDAP then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power . Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the offices and powers of the Chancellery and Presidency . A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole F\u00fchrer ( leader ) of Germany . All power was centralised in Hitler 's person and his word became the highest law . The government was not a coordinated , co-operating body , but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler 's favour . In the midst of the Great Depression , the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a mixed economy .",
  "/wiki/Semovente_47/32": "The Semovente L. 40 da 47/32 was an Italian self-propelled gun built during World War II . It was created by mounting a Cannone da 47/32 anti-tank gun in an open-topped , box-like superstructure on a L 6/40 light tank chassis . Some were built as command tanks with a radio installed instead of the main gun . An 8 mm machine gun disguised as the 47 mm main gun was used on these versions to make them look like a regular Semovente 47/32s . About 300 Semoventi da 47/32 were built from 1941 onward . The Semovente da 47/32 was the most heavily armed Italian armoured fighting vehicle used on the Eastern Front . While the 47 mm gun was adequate for 1941 , by the time the Semovente reached the field it was already outdated and ineffective against enemy medium tanks , and therefore the vehicle was not particularly successful . After the Italian armistice in September 1943 , the German Army took all Semovente 47/32s they could get hold of for their own use . The German designation was StuG L6 47/32 630 ( i ) . Some of these were provided to Germany 's Croatian puppet state and the Slovene Home Guard .",

The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino . Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed .

  "/wiki/Hetzer": "The Jagdpanzer 38 ( Sd.Kfz . 138/2 ) , was a German light tank destroyer of the Second World War based on a modified Czechoslovakian Panzer 38 ( t ) chassis . German armored forces in World War II created a variety of vehicles by mounting anti-tank guns on obsolete tank chassis . These machines performed even better than expected , yet were still vulnerable due to high vehicle profiles and open-topped turrets . Allied bombings took a heavy toll on German production facilities , and further increased the need for an easily produced yet effective light tank destroyer to replace vehicles like the StuG III and Marder series . Prototypes of the Jagdpanzer 38 were ready by 1944 and mass production began in April of that year . The Jagdpanzer 38 was covered entirely with sloped armor , and possessed a compact form and low silhouette , giving it much improved defensive ability over other self-propelled guns . Armament consisted of a 7.5 cm Pak 39 L/48 gun in fixed mounting as well as a remote-controlled MG 34 . It featured a wide body to accommodate the four-man crew , as well as strengthened lower hull with enlarged wheels , guide rollers and tracks . Jagdpanzer 38s first entered service in July 1944 , and would eventually be assigned to a number of units , including infantry , Panzerj\u00e4ger and Volksgrenadier divisions . BMM and \u0160koda continually modified and improved the Jagdpanzer 38 during production of the more than 2,800 vehicles built .

From 1859 to 1877 , Romania evolved from a personal union of two vassal principalities ( Moldavia and Wallachia ) under a single prince to an autonomous principality with a Hohenzollern monarchy . The country gained its independence from the Ottoman Empire during the 1877-1878 Russo-Turkish War ( known locally as the Romanian War of Independence ) , when it also received Northern Dobruja in exchange for the southern part of Bessarabia .

After observing the new and often decisive , uses of armored vehicles on both sides during the French campaign of 1940 , the US Army decided that it required a 75 mm self-propelled gun , based on the chassis of the M3 Half-track . This was initially known as the T12 . However , after the addition of features such as the gun shield from the M2A3 ( a carriage for the M1897A4 ) , the new vehicle entered production under the name M3 Gun Motor Carriage ( or M3 GMC ) . Because the number of M2A3 gun shields available was insufficient for the M3 GMC order , a new gun shield was designed . Variants featuring the new shield were designated M3A1 GMC . The T12/M3 first served in the Philippines Campaign in 1942 with the Provisional Field Artillery Brigade in the anti-tank and the fire-support role . It then served in North Africa in tank destroyer battalions . It was used ineffectively in the Battle of Kasserine Pass and several other engagements , but was used with success in the Battle of El Guettar . It also served in the Allied invasion of Sicily , but was eventually superseded by the M10 tank destroyer . A total of 2,203 were produced , of which 1,361 were converted back into M3A1 half-tracks .
