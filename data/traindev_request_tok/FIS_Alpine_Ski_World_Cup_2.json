  "/wiki/1975_Alpine_Skiing_World_Cup": "The 9th World Cup season began in December 1974 in France and concluded in March 1975 in Italy . Gustav Th\u00f6ni of Italy would regain the overall title , his fourth overall title in five seasons . Annemarie Moser-Pr\u00f6ll of Austria won the women 's overall title , her fifth consecutive . Three major changes took place on the World Cup circuit this season . First , Alpine combined races were recognized as World Cup events for the first time ; both the men 's and women 's seasons included three combined races , all of which were won by the overall winners ( Th\u00f6ni and Moser-Pr\u00f6ll ) ; in fact , Th\u00f6ni 's three combined wins were directly responsible for his edging out Ingemar Stenmark for the title . Second , a parallel slalom race was held at the end of the season , as parallel slalom had become popular on the professional skiing tour due to the visible head-to-head competition . Although parallel slalom skiing was used a few more times in World Cup competition , beginning in 1976 it became a permanent part of the season-ending Nations Cup events . Third , and more importantly , the new head of the International Olympic Committee , Lord Killanin , reached a compromise to preserve the amateur status of skiers receiving endorsements , manufacturer 's fees , and other payments , as long as the payments were made to the skier 's national association or Olympic committee and not directly to the skier , that also eliminated the prohibition on year-round training and competition in a sport . While further criticism of this rule , known as Olympics Rule 26 , would continue and would lead to future problems , such as the banning of World Cup champions Stenmark and Hanni Wenzel from the 1984 Winter Olympics , the immediate impact of this change was to check the steady migration of World Cup skiers to the professional circuit . Partially as a result , World Cup races this season took place in Europe , North America , and Asia .",
  "/wiki/1984_Alpine_Skiing_World_Cup": "The 18th World Cup season began in December 1983 in Kranjska Gora , Yugoslavia ( now Slovenia ) , and concluded in March 1984 in Oslo , Norway . The overall champions were Pirmin Zurbriggen ( his first ) and Erika Hess ( her second ) , both of Switzerland . A break in the schedule in February was for the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo , Yugoslavia ( now Bosnia ) . The debate over amateur and professional status of world-class skiers came to a head this year over the issue of the Olympic eligibility of the holders of FIS Class B licenses , which were approved in 1981 to permit skiers to accept sponsorship money directly instead of through their national ski federations or Olympic committees . After protests by some of the other top skiers ( including twin brothers Phil and Steve Mahre ) , the International Ski Federation ( FIS ) ruled in the summer of 1983 that the two holders of such licenses , Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden and Hanni Wenzel of Liechtenstein , would be ineligible to compete in the Olympics unless they surrendered those licenses and transferred the money received under them to the appropriate national ski or Olympic committees . Although Wenzel was willing to transfer her money as requested , Stenmark , who had moved his tax residence to Monaco and had received an amount estimated at over $ 5 million in payments during those three years , was not , because repatriating the money to Sweden would subject him to millions of dollars in Swedish income tax . Despite the different reactions of the two , FIS decided to treat Stenmark and Wenzel identically and ban them both from Olympic competition in 1984 , while permitting both to continue to compete in World Cup competitions . After the Olympics , Hanni Wenzel , who had won two overall World Cup titles and finished second or third overall six more times , retired , and several of the other top skiers , such as the Mahre twins and Norway 's Jarle Halsnes , turned professional and left the World Cup circuit . The backlash over this series of events , combined with the increasing television revenues from the Olympic Games , led to the end of the ban on professional athletes in the Olympics before the end of the decade . In another ruling regarding Olympic eligibility , FIS denied rising all-event skier Marc Girardelli , who was a citizen of Austria but who competed for Luxembourg on the World Cup circuit , the ability to compete in the Olympics for Austria , ruling that he could only compete for the country that he represented on the World Cup circuit . As a result , Girardelli was not able to compete in the Olympics until after his Luxembourg citizenship was granted in the mid-1980s .",
