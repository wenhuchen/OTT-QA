It was established by the Parliament of Canada through the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act of 1875 . Since 1949 , the Court has been the final court of appeal in the Canadian justice system . Originally composed of six justices ( the Chief Justice of Canada and five puisne justices ) , the Court was expanded to seven justices by the creation of an additional puisne justice position in 1927 , and then to nine justices by the creation of two more puisne justice positions in 1949 . The justices are appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister . When a chief justice leaves office , the vacancy is traditionally filled by elevating an incumbent puisne justice to the position , which requires a separate appointment process . The first six justices of the Court were all appointed in 1875 by Governor General the Earl of Dufferin , on the advice of Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie . Of the nine justices , three positions are required by law to be held by judges who are either judges of the superior courts of Quebec , or members of the Bar of Quebec , at the time of their appointment . Traditionally , three of the remaining judges are appointed from Ontario , two from the four western provinces , and one from the Atlantic provinces . The judges from these provinces , other than Quebec , must have been a judge of a superior court , or a member of the bar of one of those provinces for ten or more years prior to the appointment . Since the Supreme Court was created in 1875 , 88 persons have served on the Court .
