  "/wiki/K-pop": "K-pop ( abbreviation of Korean pop ; Korean : \ucf00\uc774\ud31d ) is a genre of popular music originating in South Korea . While the modern form of K-pop can be traced back to the early 90s , the term itself has been popularized since the 2000s , replacing the term Gayo ( \uac00\uc694 ) , which also refers to domestic pop music in South Korea . Although it generally indicates popular music within South Korea , the term is often used in a narrower sense to describe a modern form of South Korean pop that is influenced by styles and genres from around the world , such as experimental , rock , jazz , gospel , hip hop , R & B , reggae , electronic dance , folk , country , and classical on top of its traditional Korean music roots . The more modern form of the genre emerged with the formation of one of the earliest K-pop groups , Seo Taiji and Boys , in 1992 . Their experimentation with different styles and genres of music and integration of foreign musical elements helped reshape and modernize South Korea 's contemporary music scene . Modern K-pop idol culture began with the boy band H.O.T . in 1996 , as K-pop grew into a subculture that amassed enormous fandoms of teenagers and young adults . After a slump in early K-pop , from 2003 TVXQ and BoA started a new generation of K-pop idols that broke the music genre into the neighboring Japanese market and continue to popularize K-pop internationally today .

In late March 2015 , shortly after the death of the first Prime Minister of Singapore , Lee Kuan Yew , Yee uploaded a video on YouTube criticizing Lee . In the video , Yee compared Lee to Jesus , and cast both in what was considered an obscene and disrespectful light . Yee also uploaded to his blog an image depicting Lee and Margaret Thatcher engaged in anal sex . Altogether , 32 police reports were made against Yee and he was arrested in Singapore and charged with intention of wounding the religious feelings of Christians , obscenity , and threatening , abusive or insulting communication . Yee 's trial drew significant public interest and the court found him guilty in May 2015 , meting a jail sentence of four weeks which was backdated to include 53 days served in remand , freeing Yee immediately following the trial . Yee appealed against both the court conviction and sentence . Yee 's imprisonment drew criticism from human rights organisations , including Amnesty International , which considered Yee to be a prisoner of conscience . In December 2016 , Yee fled to the United States just before his call-up for National Service , immediately seeking political asylum . It was granted in March 2017 by the Chicago immigration court , despite being opposed by the U.S. government , which appealed the decision , causing Yee to be held in detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the appeal process . Following an immigration appeals court 's decision to uphold his bid for asylum , Yee was released in September 2017 . In November 2017 , received death threats for allegedly supporting pedophilia in videos and blog posts .",

Lee is recognised as the nation 's founding father , with the country described as transitioning from a third world country to first world country in a single generation under his leadership . After attending the London School of Economics , Lee graduated from Fitzwilliam College , Cambridge , with double starred-first-class honours in law . He became a barrister of the Middle Temple in 1950 and practised law until 1959 . Lee co-founded the People 's Action Party ( PAP ) in 1954 and was its first secretary-general until 1992 , leading the party to eight consecutive victories . After Lee chose to step down as Prime Minister in 1990 , he served as Senior Minister under his successor Goh Chok Tong until 2004 , then as Minister Mentor ( an advisory post ) until 2011 , under his own son Lee Hsien Loong . In total , Lee held successive ministerial positions for 56 years . He continued to serve his Tanjong Pagar constituency for nearly 60 years as a member of parliament until his death in 2015 . From 1991 , he helmed the five-member Tanjong Pagar Group Representation Constituency and remained unopposed for a record five elections . Lee campaigned for Britain to relinquish its colonial rule , and eventually attained through a national referendum a merger with other former British territories to form Malaysia in 1963 . However , racial strife and ideological differences led to its separation to become a sovereign city-state two years later . With overwhelming parliamentary control at every election , Lee oversaw Singapore 's transformation from a British crown colony with a natural deep harbour to a developed country with a high-income economy .",
