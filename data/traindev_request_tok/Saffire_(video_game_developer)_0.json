  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

Collectively , MS-DOS , its rebranding as IBM PC DOS , and some operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS-DOS , are sometimes referred to as DOS ( which is also the generic acronym for disk operating system ) . MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s , from which point it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface ( GUI ) , in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system . IBM licensed and re-released it in 1981 , as PC DOS 1.0 for use in its PCs . Although MS-DOS and PC DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM , the two products diverged after twelve years , in 1993 , with recognizable differences in compatibility , syntax , and capabilities . During its lifetime , several competing products were released for the x86 platform , and MS-DOS went through eight versions , until development ceased in 2000 . Initially , MS-DOS was targeted at Intel 8086 processors running on computer hardware using floppy disks to store and access not only the operating system , but application software and user data as well . Progressive version releases delivered support for other mass storage media in ever greater sizes and formats , along with added feature support for newer processors and rapidly evolving computer architectures . Ultimately , it was the key product in Microsoft 's development from a programming language company to a diverse software development firm , providing the company with essential revenue and marketing resources . It was also the underlying basic operating system on which early versions of Windows ran as a GUI . It is a flexible operating system , and consumes negligible installation space .",

  "/wiki/The_Mask_of_Zorro_(video_game)": "Zorro ( Spanish for Fox ) is a fictional character created in 1919 by American pulp writer Johnston McCulley , and appearing in works set in the Pueblo of Los Angeles during the era of Spanish California ( 1769-1821 ) . He is typically portrayed as a dashing masked vigilante who defends the commoners and indigenous peoples of California against corrupt and tyrannical officials and other villains . His signature all-black costume includes a cape , a hat known as a sombrero cordob\u00e9s , and a mask covering the upper half of his face . In the stories , Zorro has a high bounty on his head , but is too skilled and cunning for the bumbling authorities to catch , and he also delights in publicly humiliating them . Zorro is an acrobat and an expert in various weapons , but the one he employs most frequently is his rapier , which he uses often to carve the initial Z on his defeated foes , and other objects . He is also an accomplished rider , his trusty steed being a black horse called Tornado . Zorro is the secret identity of Don Diego de la Vega ( originally Don Diego Vega ) , a young man who is the only son of Don Alejandro de la Vega ( originally Don Alejandro Vega ) , the richest landowner in California , while Diego 's mother is dead . In most versions , Diego learned his swordsmanship while at university in Spain , and created his masked alter ego after he was unexpectedly summoned home by his father because California had fallen into the hands of an oppressive dictator . Diego is usually shown living with his father in a huge hacienda , which contains a number of secret passages and tunnels , leading to a secret cave that serves as headquarters for Zorro 's operations and as Tornado 's hiding place . In order to divert suspicion about his identity , Diego hides his fighting abilities while also pretending to be a coward and a fop . Zorro made his debut in the 1919 novel The Curse of Capistrano , originally meant as a stand-alone story . However , the success of the 1920 film adaptation The Mark of Zorro starring Douglas Fairbanks convinced McCulley to write more Zorro stories for about four decades : the character was featured in a total of five serialized stories and 57 short stories , the last one appearing in print posthumously in 1959 , the year after his death .",

  "/wiki/Dreamcast": "The Dreamcast [ a ] is a home video game console released by Sega on November 27 , 1998 in Japan , September 9 , 1999 in North America , and October 14 , 1999 in Europe . It was the first in the sixth generation of video game consoles , preceding Sony 's PlayStation 2 , Nintendo 's GameCube and Microsoft 's Xbox . The Dreamcast was Sega 's final home console , marking the end of the company 's 18 years in the console market . In contrast to the expensive hardware of the unsuccessful Sega Saturn , the Dreamcast was designed to reduce costs with off-the-shelf components , including a Hitachi SH-4 CPU and an NEC PowerVR2 GPU . Released in Japan to a subdued reception , the Dreamcast enjoyed a successful U.S. launch backed by a large marketing campaign , but interest in the system steadily declined as Sony built hype for the upcoming PlayStation 2 . Sales did not meet Sega 's expectations despite several price cuts , and the company continued to incur significant financial losses . After a change in leadership , Sega discontinued the Dreamcast on March 31 , 2001 , withdrawing from the console business and restructuring itself as a third-party publisher . 9.13 million Dreamcast units were sold worldwide . Although the Dreamcast had a short lifespan and limited third-party support , reviewers have considered the console ahead of its time . Its library contains many games considered creative and innovative , including Crazy Taxi , Jet Set Radio and Shenmue , as well as high-quality ports from Sega 's NAOMI arcade system board . The Dreamcast was also the first console to include a built-in modem for internet support and online play .",
