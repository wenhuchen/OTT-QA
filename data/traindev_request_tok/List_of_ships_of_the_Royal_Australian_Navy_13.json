  "/wiki/HMAS_Labuan_(L-3501)": "HMAS Labuan ( L3501 ) ( formerly HMA LST 3501 ) was a Mark III Tank Landing Ship that served in the Royal Navy ( as HMS LST 3501 ) during World War II , and with the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) from 1946 until 1951 . In RAN service , the landing ship was primarily used in support of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition ( ANARE ) . The vessel transported ANARE personnel and equipment two and from Heard Island and Macquarie Island . While returning from Heard Island in 1951 , Labuan broke down and had to be towed to the mainland . The ship was paid off , and disposed of in 1955 .",
  "/wiki/Landing_Ship,_Tank": "Landing Ship , Tank ( LST ) , or tank landing ship , is the naval designation for ships first developed during World War II ( 1939-1945 ) to support amphibious operations by carrying tanks , vehicles , cargo , and landing troops directly onto shore with no docks or piers . This enabled amphibious assaults on almost any beach . The bow of the LST had a large door that would open with a ramp for unloading the vehicles . The LST had a special flat keel that allowed the ship to be beached and stay upright . The twin propellers and rudders had protection from grounding . The LSTs served across the globe during World War II including in the Pacific War and in the European theatre . The first tank-landing ships were built to British requirements by converting existing ships ; the UK and the US then collaborated upon a joint design . Over 1,000 LSTs were laid down in the United States during World War II for use by the Allies ; the United Kingdom and Canada produced eighty more .",
  "/wiki/Royal_Navy": "The Royal Navy ( RN ) is the United Kingdom 's naval warfare force . Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels .",

  "/wiki/Balikpapan-class_landing_craft_heavy": "The Balikpapan class is a ship class of eight heavy landing craft ( officially Landing Craft , Heavy or LCH ) . All eight were originally laid down by Walkers Limited for the Australian Army in the early 1970s . A reorganisation of watercraft responsibilities in the Australian military meant the landing craft were to be operated by the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , with seven commissioned directly into RAN service during 1973 and 1974 , and lead ship Balikpapan transferred from the army to the navy . During the leadup to the independence of Papua New Guinea in 1975 , two of the vessels ( Salamaua and Buna ) were transferred to the new Papua New Guinea Defence Force ( PNGDF ) . During their careers , the Australian vessels have operated in support of Operation Navy Help Darwin in 1974-75 , Operation Bel Isi from 1997 to 2003 , INTERFET operations in 1999 and 2000 , and RAMSI operations from 2003 . The six remaining RAN vessels were paid off in the 2010s : Balikpapan , Betano , and Wewak in 2012 ; Brunei , Labuan , and Tarakan in 2014 . They are yet to be replaced in RAN service . As of 2013 , the two PNGDF vessels were active , and in 2014 , the former Labuan was transferred to Papua New Guinea as the training ship Lakekamu . Brunei and Tarakan were refitted and donated to the Philippine Navy in 2015 , commissioning as Ivatan and Batak . Three additional units of the class - decommissioned units former HMAS Balikpapan , HMAS Wewak and HMAS Betano - were loaded on a transport ship in March 2016 for transport to the Philippine Navy .",
  "/wiki/HMAS_Lachlan_(K364)": "HMAS Lachlan ( K364/F364 ) ( later HMNZS Lachlan ( F364 ) ) was a River-class frigate that served the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) from 1945 to 1949 . Lachlan was laid down by Morts Dock and Engineering Company at Balmain , New South Wales on 22 March 1943 and launched on 25 March 1944 by Sarah McNamara Scullin , wife of former Australian Prime Minister James Scullin . The ship was named for the Lachlan River in New South Wales , and commissioned into the RAN on 14 February 1945 . During 1945 , Lachlan was used during the opening of the Captain Cook Graving Dock ; her bow was used to cut the ribbon across the drydock 's mouth . Lachlan paid off on 5 October 1949 . She was transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy , renamed HMNZS Lachlan , and served as a survey and Antarctic supply vessel until February 1975 . She was used as a Refit Barge with many workshops onboard until the late 1980s when she was sold to Chile to continue work as floating workshops for ships being refitted",
  "/wiki/River-class_frigate": "The River class was a class of 151 frigates launched between 1941 and 1944 for use as anti-submarine convoy escorts in the North Atlantic . The majority served with the Royal Navy ( RN ) and Royal Canadian Navy ( RCN ) , with some serving in the other Allied navies : the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , the Free French Navy ( FFN ) , the Royal Netherlands Navy and , post-war , the South African Navy ( SAN ) . The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 , and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom , giving name to the class . In Canada , they were named for towns and cities , though they kept the same designation . Originally called a twin-screw corvette , the name frigate was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy . Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941 . The design was too big for the locks on the Lachine Canal so it was not built by the shipyards on the Great Lakes and therefore all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the West Coast or along the St. Lawrence River below Montreal . In all , Canada ordered the construction of 70 frigates , including ten for the Royal Navy , which transferred two to the United States Navy . Twelve were built in Australia for the RAN ( four to a modified design ) . After World War II , they found employment in many other navies the world over ; several RCN ships were sunk as breakwaters . One , HMCS Stormont , was purchased by Aristotle Onassis and converted into the luxury yacht Christina O .",

Sixty Bathurst-class corvettes were built in eight Australian shipyards to an Australian design . 36 were constructed for the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , 20 were built on British Admiralty orders but manned and commissioned by the RAN , and 4 served in the Royal Indian Navy . Three more were ordered for construction in India , but were cancelled . Although designed for the anti-submarine and anti-mine role , the Bathursts operated as maids-of-all-work during the war ; serving as troop and supply transports , supporting amphibious landings , providing air defence for convoys and disabled ships , participating in shore bombardments , and undertaking hydrographic surveys . Three ships were lost during the war - one to Japanese air attack and two to collisions with friendly merchant ships - while a fourth struck a friendly mine while sweeping the Great Barrier Reef in 1947 and sank . After the war , the Admiralty ships were sold to the Turkish Navy , Royal Netherlands Navy , and civilian operators , while several RAN-owned vessels were transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy , temporarily reactivated to facilitate National Service Training , or sold to civilians .
