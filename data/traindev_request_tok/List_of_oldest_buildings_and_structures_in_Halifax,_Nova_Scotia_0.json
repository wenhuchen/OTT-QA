  "/wiki/Palladian": "Palladian architecture is a European style of architecture derived from and inspired by the designs of the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio ( 1508-1580 ) . What is recognised as Palladian architecture today is an evolution of his original concepts . Palladio 's work was strongly based on the symmetry , perspective , and values of the formal classical temple architecture of the Ancient Greeks and Romans . From the 17th century Palladio 's interpretation of this classical architecture was adapted as the style known as Palladianism . It continued to develop until the end of the 18th century . In Britain , Palladianism was briefly in vogue during the 17th century , but its flowering was cut short by the onset of the English Civil War and the imposition of austerity which followed . In the early 18th century it returned to fashion , not only in England but also , directly influenced from Britain , in Prussia . Count Francesco Algarotti may have written to Lord Burlington from Berlin that he was recommending to Frederick the Great the adoption in Prussia of the architectural style Burlington had introduced in England , but Knobelsdorff 's opera house on the Unter den Linden boulevard , based on Campbell 's Wanstead House , had been constructed from 1741 . Later in the century , when the style was falling from favour in Europe , it had a surge in popularity throughout the British colonies in North America , highlighted by examples such as Drayton Hall in South Carolina , the Redwood Library in Newport , Rhode Island , the Morris-Jumel Mansion in New York City , the Hammond-Harwood House in Annapolis , Maryland and Thomas Jefferson 's Monticello and Poplar Forest in Virginia . The style continued to be utilized in Europe throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries , where it was frequently employed in the design of public and municipal buildings . From the latter half of the 19th century it was rivalled by the Gothic revival in the English-speaking world , whose champions such as Augustus Pugin , remembering the origins of Palladianism in ancient temples , deemed it too pagan for Anglican and Anglo-Catholic worship . However , as an architectural style it has continued to be popular and to evolve ; its pediments , symmetry and proportions are clearly evident in the design of many modern buildings today .",

The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire .

  "/wiki/Martello_Tower": "Martello towers , sometimes known simply as Martellos , are small defensive forts that were built across the British Empire during the 19th century , from the time of the French Revolutionary Wars onwards . Most were coastal forts . They stand up to 40 feet ( 12 m ) high ( with two floors ) and typically had a garrison of one officer and 15-25 men . Their round structure and thick walls of solid masonry made them resistant to cannon fire , while their height made them an ideal platform for a single heavy artillery piece , mounted on the flat roof and able to traverse , and hence fire , over a complete 360\u00b0 circle . A few towers had moats or other batteries and works attached for extra defence . The Martello towers were used during the first half of the 19th century , but became obsolete with the introduction of powerful rifled artillery . Many have survived to the present day , often preserved as historic monuments . In the second half of the 19th century , during the premiership of Lord Palmerston , there was another spate of tower and fort building . The Palmerston Forts are also circular in design and resemble Martello towers .",
  "/wiki/North_America": "North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere . It is also considered by some [ quantify ] to be a northern subcontinent of the Americas . It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean , to the east by the Atlantic Ocean , to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean , and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea . North America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers ( 9,540,000 square miles ) , about 16.5% of the earth 's land area and about 4.8% of its total surface . North America is the third largest continent by area , following Asia and Africa , and the fourth by population after Asia , Africa , and Europe . In 2013 , its population was estimated at nearly 579 million people in 23 independent states , or about 7.5% of the world 's population , if nearby islands ( most notably around the Caribbean ) are included . North America was reached by its first human populations during the last glacial period , via crossing the Bering land bridge approximately 40,000 to 17,000 years ago . The so-called Paleo-Indian period is taken to have lasted until about 10,000 years ago ( the beginning of the Archaic or Meso-Indian period ) . The Classic stage spans roughly the 6th to 13th centuries . The Pre-Columbian era ended in 1492 , with the beginning of the transatlantic migrations - the arrival of European settlers during the Age of Discovery and the Early Modern period . Present-day cultural and ethnic patterns reflect interactions between European colonists , indigenous peoples , African slaves and their descendants . Owing to Europe 's colonization of the Americas , most North Americans speak European languages such as English , Spanish or French , and their states ' cultures commonly reflect Western traditions ."
