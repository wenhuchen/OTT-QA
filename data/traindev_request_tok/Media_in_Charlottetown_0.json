Owned and operated by the ( government-owned ) Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ( French : Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada ) , it broadcasts on 88.1 MHz using a directional antenna with an average effective radiated power of 33,500 watts and a peak effective radiated power of 94,200 watts ( class C ) . The station has an ad-free news/talk format and is part of the Ici Radio-Canada Premi\u00e8re network , which operates across Canada . Like all Premi\u00e8re stations , but unlike most FM stations , it broadcasts in mono . The station signed on sometime in the late 1970s as a rebroadcaster of CBAF in Moncton . On October 3 , 1983 , a first radio show was produced for the Island from Moncton ( La mar\u00e9e de l'\u00cele , hosted by Maurice Arsenault ) . In 1994 , it officially became a separate station , though it still has rebroadcaster-like calls . The station has its own morning drive show , produced in Charlottetown since September 1 , 1996 . Denis Duchesne is the host of Le R\u00e9veil , Monday to Friday from 6 to 9 a.m . The rest of its programming is a simulcast of CBAF-FM-5 from Halifax , Nova Scotia . On November 21 , 2005 , the CRTC granted CBAF-FM-15 to operate rebroadcasters in St. Edward and Urbainville to serve areas on the fringe of the primary transmitter 's signal . CBAF-FM-15 was originally identified as CBAF-29-FM ; the call sign change took effect on September 1 , 1989 , as the old 1300 kHz AM signal of CBAF was shut down .",

  "/wiki/News": "News is information about current events . This may be provided through many different media : word of mouth , printing , postal systems , broadcasting , electronic communication , or through the testimony of observers and witnesses to events . Common topics for news reports include war , government , politics , education , health , the environment , economy , business , fashion , and entertainment , as well as athletic events , quirky or unusual events . Government proclamations , concerning royal ceremonies , laws , taxes , public health , and criminals , have been dubbed news since ancient times . Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news , which they satisfy by talking to each other and sharing information . Technological and social developments , often driven by government communication and espionage networks , have increased the speed with which news can spread , as well as influenced its content . The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the newspaper , which originated in China as a court bulletin and spread , with paper and printing press , to Europe .",
  "/wiki/Talk_radio": "Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues and consisting entirely or almost entirely of original spoken word content rather than outside music . Most shows are regularly hosted by a single individual , and often feature interviews with a number of different guests . Talk radio typically includes an element of listener participation , usually by broadcasting live conversations between the host and listeners who call in ( usually via telephone ) to the show . Listener contributions are usually screened by a show 's producers in order to maximize audience interest and , in the case of commercial talk radio , to attract advertisers . Generally , the shows are organized into segments , each separated by a pause for advertisements ; however , in public or non-commercial radio , music is sometimes played in place of commercials to separate the program segments . Variations of talk radio include conservative talk , hot talk , liberal talk ( increasingly known as progressive talk ) and sports talk . While talk radio has historically been associated with broadcast radio , starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of live Internet website streaming and podcasts . Now , it is possible for an individual to use a variety of services to host an Internet-based talk-radio show without carriage by a traditional radio station . In addition , TV programming from talk and news outlets such as BBC , CNN , Bloomberg and Fox is now often available expanding the world of talk radio further . Talk radio listening is enjoyed not only on radios , but a wide variety of other devices and services including PCs using iTunes , station directories such as TuneIn , show directory smartphones with apps such as Stitcher and time-shifting services like DAR.fm .",

CBC/Radio-Canada offers programming in English , French and eight aboriginal languages on its domestic radio service , and in five languages on its web-based international radio service , Radio Canada International ( RCI ) .

  "/wiki/Public_broadcasting": "Public broadcasting involves radio , television and other electronic-media outlets whose primary mission is public service . In many countries of the world , funding comes from governments , especially via annual fees charged on receivers . In the United States , public broadcasters may receive some funding from both federal and state sources , but generally most of their financial support comes from underwriting by foundations and businesses ( ranging from small shops to corporations ) , along with audience contributions via pledge drives . The great majority operate as private not-for-profit corporations . [ citation needed ] Public broadcasting may be nationally or locally operated , depending on the country and the station . In some countries a single organization runs public broadcasting . Other countries have multiple public-broadcasting organizations operating regionally or in different languages . Historically , public broadcasting was once the dominant or only form of broadcasting in many countries ( with the notable exception of the United States ) . Commercial broadcasting now also exists in most of these countries ; the number of countries with only public broadcasting declined substantially during the latter part of the 20th century .

  "/wiki/CIMN-FM": "CIMN-FM was a Canadian campus radio station at the University of Prince Edward Island in Charlottetown , Prince Edward Island . The station began as a very low power broadcast station , known as Radio UPEI and operated from the top floor of the administrative building in 1970 . The transmitters were home-made and of solid state design . In 1972 , the UPEI Student Union funded upgrades to a carrier current system operating on 700 kHz using the callsign CSUR . This conflicted with international callsign allocations ( the ITU prefix CS is assigned to Portugal , not Canada ) , so a new application was made for the callsign CIMN ( Campus Information Music & News ) . A series of transmitters , using the electrical wiring of buildings as the antenna system , were located in the various residences . A set of control rooms and production studios located on the 4th floor of Main Building remained in operation for a number of years . At that time , the station had a station manager , and a news director , paid by the Student Union . The station also began to simulcast audio via the local cable television system into homes in the area . In 1982 , the studios were moved to the Barn , which housed student union offices and student activity areas on campus . The station received a full FM license in 1995 to broadcast at 90.3 FM , and at this point , legal problems began . CIMN became the first Canadian station without a full-time staff person to be granted a broadcast licence by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) .",
  "/wiki/Campus_radio": "Campus radio ( also known as college radio , university radio or student radio ) is a type of radio station that is run by the students of a college , university or other educational institution . Programming may be exclusively by students , or may include programmers from the wider community in which the radio station is based . Sometimes campus radio stations are operated for the purpose of training professional radio personnel , sometimes with the aim of broadcasting educational programming , while other radio stations exist to provide alternative to commercial broadcasting or government broadcasters . Campus radio stations are generally licensed and regulated by national governments , and have very different characteristics from one country to the next . One commonality between many radio stations regardless of their physical location is a willingness - or , in some countries , even a licensing requirement - to broadcast musical selections that are not categorized as commercial hits . Because of this , campus radio has come to be associated with emerging musical trends , including genres such as punk and new wave , alternative rock , indie rock and hip hop , long before those genres become part of the musical mainstream . Campus radio stations also often provide airplay and promotional exposure to new and emerging local artists . Campus radio supported U2 and REM Many campus radio stations carry a variety of programming including news ( often local ) , sports ( often relating to the campus ) , and spoken word programming as well as general music . Often the radio format is best described as a freeform , with a lot of creativity and individualism among the disc jockeys and show hosts . A number of these radio stations have gained critical acclaim for their programming and are considered by the community in which they are embedded to be an essential media outlet . Although the term campus radio implies full-power AM or FM transmission over the air , many radio stations experiment with low-power broadcasting , closed circuit or carrier current systems , often to on-campus listeners only . Some radio stations are distributed through the cable television system on cable FM or the second audio program of a TV radio station .",

  "/wiki/Classic_rock": "Classic rock is a radio format which developed from the album-oriented rock ( AOR ) format in the early 1980s . In the United States , the classic rock format features rock music ranging generally from the mid-1960s to the 1980s , primarily focusing on commercially successful blues rock and hard rock popularized in the 1970s AOR format . The radio format became increasingly popular with the baby boomer demographic by the end of the 1990s . Although classic rock has mostly appealed to adult listeners , music associated with this format received more exposure with younger generations of listeners with the presence of the Internet and digital downloading . Some classic rock stations also play a limited number of current releases which are stylistically consistent with the station 's sound , or by heritage acts that are still active and producing new music . Conceptually , classic rock has been analyzed by academics as an effort by critics , media , and music establishments to canonize rock music and commodify 1960s Western culture for audiences living in a post-baby boomer economy . The music predominantly selected for the format has been identified as commercially successful songs by white male acts from the Anglosphere , expressing values of Romanticism , self-aggrandizement , and politically undemanding ideologies .",

  "/wiki/Country_music": "Country music , also known as country and western ( or simply country ) , and hillbilly music , is a genre of popular music that takes its roots from genres such as American folk music ( especially Appalachian and Western music ) and blues . Its popularized roots originate in the Southern United States of the early 1920s . Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms , folk lyrics , and harmonies mostly accompanied by string instruments such as banjos , electric and acoustic guitars , steel guitars ( such as pedal steels and dobros ) , and fiddles as well as harmonicas . Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history . According to Lindsey Starnes , the term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music ; it came to encompass Western music , which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots , in the mid-20th century . In 2009 in the United States , country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute , and second most popular in the morning commute . The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres . The origins of country music are found in the folk music of working class Americans and/or blue-collar American life , who blended popular songs , Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes , traditional English ballads , cowboy songs , and the musical traditions of various groups of European immigrants .",

The station was launched on December 25 , 1974 , originally broadcasting at 1190 AM before moving to 720 which was approved in 1987 to eliminate the nighttime interference from WOWO 1190 AM , out of Fort Wayne , Indiana , U.S.A . In the early 1990s , Newcap entered into a shared-facilities partnership with Maritime Broadcasting System Ltd , the owner of the competing CFCY and CHLQ-FM . Part of the agreement with MBS saw CHTN move to exclusively offer a popular oldies format . CHTN consolidated its broadcasting facilities with MBS for several years on Kent St. , and later on the Charlottetown waterfront , until 2005 when the federal regulator , the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) , ordered the broadcasters to operate separately . This precipitated a move by Newcap to surrender its AM licence and apply for its current FM frequency of 100.3 , as well as open a new sister station , CKQK-FM . CHTN officially moved to its current frequency and format on July 5 , 2006 at 8:05 a.m . It was simulcast on its AM frequency for three months before the AM transmitter was shut down .

Music that was popularized by MTV in the early 1980s and the nostalgia behind it is a major driver to the format . It is considered the successor to the oldies format , a collection of top 40 songs from the late 1950s through the late 1970s that was once extremely popular in the United States . The term is sometimes incorrectly used as a synonym for the adult hits format , which uses a slightly newer music library stretching from all decades to the present with a major focus on 1990s and 2000s rock and alternative songs . In addition , adult hits stations tend to have larger playlists , playing a given song only a few times per week , compared to the tighter libraries on classic hits stations . For example , KRTH , a classic hits station in Los Angeles , plays power songs up to 30 times a week , which is another differentiator compared to other formats that share songs with classic hits libraries . The classic hits format has become extremely popular in the last few years with stations like KRTH , WCBS-FM in New York , and WLS-FM in Chicago having successful ratings with this model . Classic hits was named format of the summer of 2018 by Nielsen Audio 's research team emphasizing the huge popularity of the format . In addition , the Millennial generation is listening to this format in record numbers , according to a Nielsen report .

  "/wiki/Contemporary_hit_radio": "Contemporary hit radio ( also known as CHR , contemporary hits , hit list , current hits , hit music , top 40 , or pop radio ) is a radio format that is common in the United States , Brazil , United Kingdom , Ireland , Canada , New Zealand , Australia , the Philippines , Indonesia , Malaysia , Singapore , China , Hong Kong , Taiwan , Japan , South Korea , Trinidad and Tobago , and South Africa , that focuses on playing current and recurrent popular music as determined by the top 40 music charts . There are several subcategories , dominantly focusing on rock , pop , or urban music . Used alone , CHR most often refers to the CHR-pop format . The term contemporary hit radio was coined in the early 1980s by Radio & Records magazine to designate top 40 stations which continued to play hits from all musical genres as pop music splintered into adult contemporary , urban contemporary and other formats . The term top 40 is also used to refer to the actual list of hit songs , and , by extension , to refer to pop music in general . The term has also been modified to describe top 50 ; top 30 ; top 20 ; top 10 ; hot 100 ( each with its number of songs ) and hot hits radio formats , but carrying more or less the same meaning and having the same creative point of origin with Todd Storz as further refined by Gordon McLendon as well as Bill Drake . The format became especially popular in the mid-sixties as radio stations constrained disc jockeys to numbered play lists in the wake of the payola scandal ."
