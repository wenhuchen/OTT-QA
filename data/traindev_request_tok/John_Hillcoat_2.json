  "/wiki/Australian_Film_Institute": "The Australian Film Institute ( AFI ) was founded in 1958 as a non-profit organisation devoted to developing an active film culture in Australia and fostering engagement between the general public and the Australian film industry . It is responsible for producing Australia 's premier annual film and television awards , as of 2011 known as AACTA Awards ( previously the AFI Awards ) . The work of the institute is supported by government funding , corporate sponsors and approximately 10,000 members nationally . As Australia 's foremost motion picture industry association , AFI promotes the Australian film and television industry and plays a central role in the way in which the Australian film industry is known and understood , both locally and internationally . In the 1970s , the AFI played a prominent part in reviving the Australian film industry and in convincing the government to invest in the creation of the Experimental Film Fund , a film school , and a corporation for advancing feature film production . The year 1976 marked the first time that the AFI Awards , which had been given since 1958 , were televised . Ten years later , television categories were added to the awards . A recent focus of the organisation has been on helping to develop the careers of Australian film artists , through the AFI Fellowship and AFI Documentary Trailbrazer programs , as well as with the AFI Young Film Actor Award . The AFI is affiliated with the Los Angeles Australian Film & Television Association . In August 2011 , AFI formed a subsidiary professional organisation , the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts .",
