  "/wiki/Environmental_Performance_Index": "The Environmental Performance Index ( EPI ) is a method of quantifying and numerically marking the environmental performance of a state 's policies . This index was developed from the Pilot Environmental Performance Index , first published in 2002 , and designed to supplement the environmental targets set forth in the United Nations Millennium Development Goals . The EPI was preceded by the Environmental Sustainability Index ( ESI ) , published between 1999 and 2005 . Both indices were developed by Yale University ( Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy ) and Columbia University ( Center for International Earth Science Information Network ) in collaboration with the World Economic Forum and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission . The ESI was developed to evaluate environmental sustainability relative to the paths of other countries . Due to a shift in focus by the teams developing the ESI , the EPI uses outcome-oriented indicators , then working as a benchmark index that can be more easily used by policy makers , environmental scientists , advocates and the general public . Other leading indices like the Global Green Economy Index ( GGEI ) provide an integrated measure of the environmental , social and economic dynamics of national economies . The GGEI utilizes EPI data for the environmental dimension of the index while also providing a performance assessment of efficiency sectors ( e.g . transport , buildings , energy ) , investment , green innovation and national leadership around climate change . In January 2012 four EPI reports have been released - the Pilot 2006 Environmental Performance Index , and the 2008 , 2010 , and 2012 Environmental Performance Index . For the 2012 report , a new Pilot Trend EPI was developed to rank countries based on the environmental performance changes occurred during the last decade , allowing to establish which countries are improving and which are declining . In the 2014 EPI ranking , the top five countries were Switzerland , Luxembourg , Australia , Singapore , and the Czech Republic .",
  "/wiki/Yale_University": "Yale University is a private Ivy League research university in New Haven , Connecticut . Founded in 1701 , it is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine Colonial Colleges chartered before the American Revolution . Chartered by Connecticut Colony , the Collegiate School was established in 1701 by clergy to educate Congregational ministers . It moved to New Haven in 1716 and shortly after was renamed Yale College in recognition of a gift from British East India Company governor Elihu Yale . Originally restricted to theology and sacred languages , the curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences by the time of the American Revolution . In the 19th century , the college expanded into graduate and professional instruction , awarding the first Ph.D. in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887 . Its faculty and student populations grew after 1890 with rapid expansion of the physical campus and scientific research . Yale is organized into fourteen constituent schools : the original undergraduate college , the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and twelve professional schools . While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation , each school 's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs . In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven , the university owns athletic facilities in western New Haven , a campus in West Haven , Connecticut and forest and nature preserves throughout New England . The university 's assets include an endowment valued at $ 30.3 billion as of September 2019 , the second largest endowment of any educational institution in North America . The Yale University Library , serving all constituent schools , holds more than 15 million volumes and is the third-largest academic library in the United States .",

  "/wiki/Carbon_dioxide": "Carbon dioxide ( chemical formula CO2 ) is a colorless gas with a density about 60% higher than that of dry air . Carbon dioxide consists of a carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms . It occurs naturally in Earth 's atmosphere as a trace gas . The current concentration is about 0.04% ( 410 ppm ) by volume , having risen from pre-industrial levels of 280 ppm . Natural sources include volcanoes , hot springs and geysers , and it is freed from carbonate rocks by dissolution in water and acids . Because carbon dioxide is soluble in water , it occurs naturally in groundwater , rivers and lakes , ice caps , glaciers and seawater . It is present in deposits of petroleum and natural gas . Carbon dioxide is odorless at normally encountered concentrations , but at high concentrations , it has a sharp and acidic odor . At such concentrations it generates the taste of soda water in the mouth . As the source of available carbon in the carbon cycle , atmospheric carbon dioxide is the primary carbon source for life on Earth and its concentration in Earth 's pre-industrial atmosphere since late in the Precambrian has been regulated by photosynthetic organisms and geological phenomena . Plants , algae and cyanobacteria use light energy to photosynthesize carbohydrate from carbon dioxide and water , with oxygen produced as a waste product . CO2 is produced by all aerobic organisms when they metabolize carbohydrates and lipids to produce energy by respiration .",
  "/wiki/Methane": "Methane ( US : /\u02c8m\u025b\u03b8e\u026an/ or UK : /\u02c8mi\u02d0\u03b8e\u026an/ ) is a chemical compound with the chemical formula CH4 ( one atom of carbon and four atoms of hydrogen ) . It is a group-14 hydride and the simplest alkane , and is the main constituent of natural gas . The relative abundance of methane on Earth makes it an attractive fuel , although capturing and storing it poses challenges due to its gaseous state under normal conditions for temperature and pressure . Naturally occurring methane is found both below ground and under the seafloor , and is formed by both geological and biological processes . The largest reservoir of methane is under the seafloor in the form of methane clathrates . When methane reaches the surface and the atmosphere , it is known as atmospheric methane . The Earth 's atmospheric methane concentration has increased by about 150% since 1750 , and it accounts for 20% of the total radiative forcing from all of the long-lived and globally mixed greenhouse gases . Methane has also been detected on other planets , including Mars , which has implications for astrobiology research .",
  "/wiki/Nitrous_oxide": "Nitrous oxide , commonly known as laughing gas or nitrous , is a chemical compound , an oxide of nitrogen with the formula N2O . At room temperature , it is a colourless non-flammable gas , with a slight metallic scent and taste . At elevated temperatures , nitrous oxide is a powerful oxidizer similar to molecular oxygen . It is soluble in water . Nitrous oxide has significant medical uses , especially in surgery and dentistry , for its anaesthetic and pain reducing effects . Its colloquial name laughing gas , coined by Humphry Davy , is due to the euphoric effects upon inhaling it , a property that has led to its recreational use as a dissociative anaesthetic . It is on the World Health Organization 's List of Essential Medicines , the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system . It is also used as an oxidiser in rocket propellants , and in motor racing to increase the power output of engines . Nitrous oxide occurs in small amounts in the atmosphere , but has been found to be a major scavenger of stratospheric ozone , with an impact comparable to that of CFCs . It is estimated that 30% of the N2O in the atmosphere is the result of human activity , chiefly agriculture . Being the third most important long-lived greenhouse gas , nitrous oxide substantially contributes to global warming .",
  "/wiki/Fluorocarbon": "Fluorocarbons , sometimes referred to as perfluorocarbons or PFCs , are , strictly speaking , organofluorine compounds with the formula CxFy , i.e . they contain only carbon and fluorine , though the terminology is not strictly followed . Compounds with the prefix perfluoro- are hydrocarbons , including those with heteroatoms , wherein all C-H bonds have been replaced by C-F bonds . Fluorocarbons can be perfluoroalkanes , fluoroalkenes and fluoroalkynes and perfluoroaromatic compounds . Fluorocarbons and their derivatives ( perfluorinated compounds ) are used as fluoropolymers , refrigerants , solvents , and anesthetics .",
  "/wiki/Hydrofluorocarbon": "Hydrofluorocarbons ( HFCs ) are organic compounds that contain fluorine and hydrogen atoms , and are the most common type of organofluorine compounds . They are frequently used in air conditioning and as refrigerants in place of the older chlorofluorocarbons such as R-12 and hydrochlorofluorocarbons such as R-21 . They do not harm the ozone layer as much as the compounds they replace , but they do contribute to global warming , with thousands of times the warming potential of carbon dioxide . Their atmospheric concentrations and contribution to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are rapidly increasing , causing international concern about their radiative forcing . Fluorocarbons with few C-F bonds behave similarly to the parent hydrocarbons , but their reactivity can be altered significantly . For example , both uracil and 5-fluorouracil are colourless , high-melting crystalline solids , but the latter is a potent anti-cancer drug . The use of the C-F bond in pharmaceuticals is predicated on this altered reactivity . Several drugs and agrochemicals contain only one fluorine center or one trifluoromethyl group . Unlike other greenhouse gases in the Paris Agreement , hydrofluorocarbons are included in other international negotiations . In September 2016 , the New York Declaration on Forests urged a global reduction in the use of HFCs . On 15 October 2016 , due to these chemicals ' contribution to climate change , negotiators from 197 nations meeting at the summit of the United Nations Environment Programme in Kigali , Rwanda reached a legally-binding accord to phase out hydrofluorocarbons ( HFCs ) in an amendment to the Montreal Protocol . The US has yet to ratify the Kigali Agreement .",

SF6 has an octahedral geometry , consisting of six fluorine atoms attached to a central sulfur atom . It is a hypervalent molecule . Typical for a nonpolar gas , it is poorly soluble in water but quite soluble in nonpolar organic solvents . It is generally transported as a liquefied compressed gas . It has a density of 6.12 g/L at sea level conditions , considerably higher than the density of air ( 1.225 g/L ) .",
  "/wiki/Land_use,_land-use_change,_and_forestry": "Land use , land-use change , and forestry ( LULUCF ) , also referred to as Forestry and other land use ( FOLU ) , is defined by the United Nations Climate Change Secretariat as a greenhouse gas inventory sector that covers emissions and removals of greenhouse gases resulting from direct human-induced land use such as settlements and commercial uses , land-use change , and forestry activities . LULUCF has impacts on the global carbon cycle and as such , these activities can add or remove carbon dioxide ( or , more generally , carbon ) from the atmosphere , influencing climate . LULUCF has been the subject of two major reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) . Additionally , land use is of critical importance for biodiversity .",
  "/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_equivalent": "Carbon dioxide equivalent ( CDE ) and equivalent carbon dioxide ( CO2e and CO2eq ) are two related but distinct measures for estimating how much global warming a given type and amount of greenhouse gas may cause , using the functionally equivalent amount or concentration of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) as the reference . CO2e calculations depend on the time-scale chosen , typically 100 years but occasionally 20 years or less . They also depend on assumptions about the amount of time a given pollutant will remain in the atmosphere , which rely on other assumptions such as the amount of carbon sequestration that will occur in the future .",
  "/wiki/United_Nations": "The United Nations ( UN ) is an intergovernmental organization that aims to maintain international peace and security , develop friendly relations among nations , achieve international cooperation , and be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations . It is the largest , most familiar , most internationally represented and most powerful intergovernmental organization in the world . The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City ; other main offices are in Geneva , Nairobi , Vienna and The Hague . The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars , succeeding the ineffective League of Nations . On 25 April 1945 , 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter , which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945 , when the UN began operations . Pursuant to the Charter , the organization 's objectives include maintaining international peace and security , protecting human rights , delivering humanitarian aid , promoting sustainable development , and upholding international law . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; this number grew to 193 in 2011 , representing the vast majority of the world 's sovereign states . The organization 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies . Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring , reporting and confidence-building roles . UN membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s . Since then , 80 former colonies have gained independence , including 11 trust territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council . By the 1970s , the UN 's budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping .",
  "/wiki/IUCN_Red_List": "The ( IUCN ) Red List of Threatened Species ( also known as the ( IUCN ) Red List or Red Data List ) , founded in 1964 , is the world 's most comprehensive inventory of the global conservation status of biological species . It uses a set of criteria to evaluate the extinction risk of thousands of species and subspecies . These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world . With its strong scientific base , the IUCN Red List is recognized as the most authoritative guide to the status of biological diversity . A series of Regional Red Lists are produced by countries or organizations , which assess the risk of extinction to species within a political management unit . The IUCN Red List is set upon precise criteria to evaluate the extinction risk of thousands of species and subspecies . These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world . The aim is to convey the urgency of conservation issues to the public and policy makers , as well as help the international community to try to reduce species extinction . According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) ( 1996 ) , the formally stated goals of the Red List are to provide scientifically based information on the status of species and subspecies at a global level , to draw attention to the magnitude and importance of threatened biodiversity , to influence national and international policy and decision-making , and to provide information to guide actions to conserve biological diversity . Major species assessors include BirdLife International , the Institute of Zoology ( the research division of the Zoological Society of London ) , the World Conservation Monitoring Centre , and many Specialist Groups within the IUCN Species Survival Commission ( SSC ) . Collectively , assessments by these organizations and groups account for nearly half the species on the Red List . The IUCN aims to have the category of every species re-evaluated every five years if possible , or at least every ten years .",
  "/wiki/Happy_Planet_Index": "The Happy Planet Index ( HPI ) is an index of human well-being and environmental impact that was introduced by the New Economics Foundation ( NEF ) in July 2006 . The index is weighted to give progressively higher scores to nations with lower ecological footprints . The index is designed to challenge well-established indices of countries development , such as the gross domestic product ( GDP ) and the Human Development Index ( HDI ) , which are seen as not taking sustainability into account . In particular , GDP is seen as inappropriate , as the usual ultimate aim of most people is not to be rich , but to be happy and healthy . Furthermore , it is believed that the notion of sustainable development requires a measure of the environmental costs of pursuing those goals . Out of the 178 countries surveyed in 2006 , the best scoring countries were Vanuatu , Colombia , Costa Rica , Dominica , and Panama . In 2009 , Costa Rica was the best scoring country among the 143 analyzed , followed by the Dominican Republic , Jamaica , Guatemala and Vietnam .

  "/wiki/Overconsumption": "Overconsumption is a situation where resource use has outpaced the sustainable capacity of the ecosystem . A prolonged pattern of overconsumption leads to environmental degradation and the eventual loss of resource bases . Generally , the discussion of overconsumption parallels that of human overpopulation ; that is the more people , the more consumption of raw materials takes place to sustain their lives . However , humanity 's overall impact on the planet is affected by many factors besides the raw number of people . Their lifestyle ( including overall affluence and resource utilization ) and the pollution they generate ( including carbon footprint ) are equally important . Currently , the inhabitants of the developed nations of the world consume resources at a rate almost 32 times greater than those of the developing world , who make up the majority of the human population ( 7.4 billion people ) . However , the developing world is a growing market for consumption . These nations are quickly gaining more purchasing power and it is expected that the Global South , which includes cities in Asia , America and Africa , will account for 56% of consumption growth by 2030 . This means that consumption rates will plateau for the developed nations and shift more into these developing countries . The theory of overpopulation reflects issues of carrying capacity without taking into account per capita consumption , by which developing nations are evaluated to consume more than their land can support . The United Nations estimate that world population will reach 9.8 billion in the year 2050 and 11.2 in 2100 . This growth will be highly concentrated in the developing nations which also poses issues with inequality of consumption .",

Peak water was defined in a 2010 peer-reviewed article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Peter Gleick and Meena Palaniappan . They distinguish between peak renewable , peak non-renewable , and peak ecological water in order to demonstrate the fact that although there is a vast amount of water on the planet , sustainably managed water is becoming scarce . Lester R. Brown , president of the Earth Policy Institute , wrote in 2013 that although there was extensive literature on peak oil , it was peak water that is the real threat to our future . An assessment was published in August 2011 in the Stockholm International Water Institute 's journal . Much of the world 's water in underground aquifers and in lakes can be depleted and thus resembles a finite resource . The phrase peak water sparks debates similar to those about peak oil . In 2010 , New York Times chose peak water as one of its 33 Words of the Year . There are concerns about impending peak water in several areas around the world :",
  "/wiki/Surface_runoff": "Surface runoff ( also known as overland flow ) is the flow of water that occurs when excess stormwater , meltwater , or other sources flow over the Earth 's surface . This can occur when the soil is saturated to full capacity , and rain arrives more quickly than soil can absorb it . Surface runoff often occurs because impervious areas ( such as roofs and pavement ) do not allow water to soak into the ground . Surface runoff is a major component of the water cycle . It is the primary agent of soil erosion by water . The land area producing runoff that drains to a common point is called a drainage basin . Runoff that occurs on the ground surface before reaching a channel can be a nonpoint source of pollution , as it can carry man-made contaminants or natural forms of pollution ( such as rotting leaves ) . Man-made contaminants in runoff include petroleum , pesticides , fertilizers and others . In addition to causing water erosion and pollution , surface runoff in urban areas is a primary cause of urban flooding , which can result in property damage , damp and mold in basements , and street flooding .",

  "/wiki/Coral_reef": "A coral reef is an underwater ecosystem characterized by reef-building corals . Reefs are formed of colonies of coral polyps held together by calcium carbonate . Most coral reefs are built from stony corals , whose polyps cluster in groups . Coral belongs to the class Anthozoa in the animal phylum Cnidaria , which includes sea anemones and jellyfish . Unlike sea anemones , corals secrete hard carbonate exoskeletons that support and protect the coral . Most reefs grow best in warm , shallow , clear , sunny and agitated water . Coral reefs first appeared 485 million years ago , at the dawn of the Early Ordovician , displacing the microbial and sponge reefs of the Cambrian . Sometimes called rainforests of the sea , shallow coral reefs form some of Earth 's most diverse ecosystems . They occupy less than 0.1% of the world 's ocean area , about half the area of France , yet they provide a home for at least 25% of all marine species , including fish , mollusks , worms , crustaceans , echinoderms , sponges , tunicates and other cnidarians . Coral reefs flourish in ocean waters that provide few nutrients . They are most commonly found at shallow depths in tropical waters , but deep water and cold water coral reefs exist on smaller scales in other areas .

The first section is devoted to emissions based on the production of goods and services within each country ( also known as territorial-based emissions ) . It provides data regarding carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and cement manufacture but not emissions from land-use , land-use change and forestry ( which includes deforestation ) . Emissions from international shipping or bunker fuels are also not included in national figures , which can make a significant difference for small countries with important ports . The second section provides data regarding emissions based on consumption of goods and services in each country . In addition to the emissions from goods and services produced locally , consumption-based accounting also includes the emissions from the consumption of goods and services produced abroad , i.e . imports , while it excludes emissions from the production of goods and services consumed abroad , i.e . exports . As it takes into account the emissions embodied in international trade , it is thus also known as trade-adjusted emissions accounting . Carbon dioxide is the most important , though not the only anthropogenic greenhouse gas . For a more complete idea of how a country influences climate change , gases such as methane and nitrous oxide should be taken into account . This is particularly so in agricultural economies .",
  "/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions": "This is a list of sovereign states and territories by carbon dioxide emissions due to certain forms of human activity , based on the EDGAR database created by European Commission and Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency released in 2018 . The following table lists the 1990 , 2005 and 2017 annual CO2 emissions estimates ( in Megatonnes of CO2 per year ) along with a list of calculated emissions per km\u00b2 ( in tonnes of CO2 per year ) and emissions per capita ( in tonnes of CO2 per year ) . The data only consider carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and cement manufacture , but not emissions from land use , land-use change and forestry . Emissions from international shipping or bunker fuels are also not included in national figures , which can make a large difference for small countries with important ports . When carbon dioxide emissions from land-use change are factored in , the majority of carbon emissions since 1905 occurred in Asia , Central and Southern America , reflecting the fact that developed nations cleared their forests in earlier centuries . [ citation needed ] Land-use factors have contributed nearly a third of total cumulative anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide since 1850 , and until as recently as 1965 was actually a greater source of emissions than the combustion of fossil fuels and production of cement . The methodology for the calculations is public . The top 10 largest emitter countries account for 67.6% of the world total . Since 2006 , China has been emitting more CO2 than any other country , which is due to its heavy use of coal . When looking at CO2 emissions per person , China 's levels are less than half those of the United States ( the next largest source of CO2 emissions ) and about one eighth of Palau ( the biggest CO2 emitter per person ) . China and India 's emissions have been growing rapidly as emissions from Western countries are on the decline . Territorial-based emissions do not account for global trade , where emissions may be imported or exported in the form of traded goods .",

Types of places listed include the entire planet , continents , regions , countries , provinces , states , and territories . Percentage data was calculated using information from the CIA 's World Factbook 2011 .",
  "/wiki/Forest": "A forest is a large area dominated by trees . Hundreds of more precise definitions of forest are used throughout the world , incorporating factors such as tree density , tree height , land use , legal standing and ecological function . According to the widely used Food and Agriculture Organization definition , forests covered 4 billion hectares ( 9.9\u00d7109 acres ) ( 15 million square miles ) or approximately 30 percent of the world 's land area in 2006 . Forests are the dominant terrestrial ecosystem of Earth , and are distributed around the globe . Forests account for 75% of the gross primary production of the Earth 's biosphere , and contain 80% of the Earth 's plant biomass . Net primary production is estimated at 21.9 gigatonnes carbon per year for tropical forests , 8.1 for temperate forests , and 2.6 for boreal forests . Forests at different latitudes and elevations form distinctly different ecozones : boreal forests around the poles , tropical forests around the Equator , and temperate forests at the middle latitudes . Higher elevation areas tend to support forests similar to those at higher latitudes , and amount of precipitation also affects forest composition . Human society and forests influence each other in both positive and negative ways . Forests provide ecosystem services to humans and serve as tourist attractions . Forests can also affect people 's health . Human activities , including harvesting forest resources , can negatively affect forest ecosystems .",

  "/wiki/World_Bank": "The World Bank ( French : Banque mondiale ) is an international financial institution that provides loans and grants to the governments of poorer countries for the purpose of pursuing capital projects . It comprises of two institutions : the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( IBRD ) , and the International Development Association ( IDA ) . The World Bank is a component of the World Bank Group . The World Bank 's most recent stated goal is the reduction of poverty . As of November 2018 , the largest recipients of World Bank loans were India ( $ 859 million in 2018 ) and China ( $ 370 million in 2018 ) , through loans from IBRD .",
  "/wiki/Biochemical_oxygen_demand": "Biochemical oxygen demand ( BOD ) is the amount of dissolved oxygen needed ( i.e . demanded ) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period . The BOD value is most commonly expressed in milligrams of oxygen consumed per litre of sample during 5 days of incubation at 20 \u00b0C and is often used as a surrogate of the degree of organic pollution of water . BOD reduction is used as a gauge of the effectiveness of wastewater treatment plants . BOD of wastewater effluents is used to indicate the short term impact on the oxygen levels of the receiving water . BOD analysis is similar in function to chemical oxygen demand ( COD ) analysis , in that both measure the amount of organic compounds in water . However , COD analysis is less specific , since it measures everything that can be chemically oxidized , rather than just levels of biologically oxidized organic matter ."
