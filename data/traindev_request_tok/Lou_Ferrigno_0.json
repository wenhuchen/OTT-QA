  "/wiki/Pumping_Iron": "Pumping Iron is a 1977 American docudrama about the world of professional bodybuilding , with a focus on the 1975 IFBB Mr. Universe and 1975 Mr. Olympia competitions . Directed by George Butler and Robert Fiore and edited by Geof Bartz and Larry Silk , it is inspired by a book of the same name by Butler and Charles Gaines , and nominally centers on the competition between Arnold Schwarzenegger and one of his primary competitors for the title of Mr. Olympia , Lou Ferrigno . The film also features segments on bodybuilders Franco Columbu and Mike Katz , in addition to appearances by Ken Waller , Ed Corney , Serge Nubret , and other famous bodybuilders of the era . Shot during the 100 days leading up to the Mr. Universe and Mr. Olympia competitions and during the competitions themselves , the filmmakers ran out of funds to finish production and it stalled for two years . Ultimately , Schwarzenegger and other bodybuilders featured in the film helped raise funds to complete production , and it was released in 1977 . The film became a box office success , making Schwarzenegger a household name . The film also served to popularize the culture of bodybuilding , which was somewhat niche at the time , and helped inspire the fitness craze of the 1980s ; following the film 's release , there was a marked increase in the number of commercial gyms in the U.S . The film was released on CED and VHS , and then re-released on DVD in 2003 for the 25th anniversary of the theatrical debut . The film inspired three sequels : George Butler 's Pumping Iron II : The Women ( 1985 ) , a documentary about the world of female bodybuilding ; David and Scott McVeigh 's Raw Iron ( 2002 ) , a documentary about the making of Pumping Iron and how the film affected the lives of those who appeared in it ; and Vlad Yudin 's Generation Iron ( 2013 ) , a documentary on which Pumping Iron producer Jerome Gary served as executive producer .",
