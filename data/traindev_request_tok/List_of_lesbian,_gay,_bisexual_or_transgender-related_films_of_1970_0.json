The Sins of Dorian Gray is a 1970 movie adaptation of Oscar Wilde 's novel The Picture of Dorian Gray starring Helmut Berger . The Italian title translates as A God Called Dorian . Directed by Massimo Dallamano and produced by Harry Alan Towers , the film stresses the decadence and eroticism of the story and changes the setting to early 1970s London . The sexual liberation of the late 1960s and early 1970s provides a fitting backdrop for Dorian 's escapades in this version , and also the general clothing and fashion style of the era is extrapolated into a 1970s version of the aesthetic , decadent world of the 1890s novel . Critical opinion of the film is decidedly mixed . On the one hand , some consider the film trash and sexploitation , while others point out that the film was shot at a unique time in the 20th century when a new openness about sexuality and its depiction on film allowed showing scenes only vaguely hinted at in the novel and earlier ( and also later ) movie adaptations . A marked difference between this version and the novel is the final scene . Instead of Dorian slicing the painting with the knife ( thereby inadvertently killing himself ) , he is seen committing suicide with the knife deliberately .",

  "/wiki/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray": "The Picture of Dorian Gray is a Gothic and philosophical novel by Oscar Wilde , first published complete in the July 1890 issue of Lippincott 's Monthly Magazine . Fearing the story was indecent , the magazine 's editor deleted roughly five hundred words before publication without Wilde 's knowledge . Despite that censorship , The Picture of Dorian Gray offended the moral sensibilities of British book reviewers , some of whom said that Oscar Wilde merited prosecution for violating the laws guarding public morality . In response , Wilde aggressively defended his novel and art in correspondence with the British press , although he personally made excisions of some of the most controversial material when revising and lengthening the story for book publication the following year . The longer and revised version of The Picture of Dorian Gray published in book form in 1891 featured an aphoristic preface - a defence of the artist 's rights and of art for art 's sake - based in part on his press defences of the novel the previous year . The content , style , and presentation of the preface made it famous in its own right , as a literary and artistic manifesto . In April 1891 , the publishing firm of Ward , Lock and Company , who had distributed the shorter , more inflammatory , magazine version in England the previous year , published the revised version of The Picture of Dorian Gray . The Picture of Dorian Gray is the only novel written by Wilde . It exists in several versions : the 1890 magazine edition ( in 13 chapters ) , with important material deleted before publication by the magazine 's editor , J. M. Stoddart ; the uncensored version submitted to Lippincott 's Monthly Magazine for publication ( also in 13 chapters ) , with all of Wilde 's original material intact , first published in 2011 by Harvard University Press ; and the 1891 book edition ( in 20 chapters ) .

After writing in different forms throughout the 1880s , the early 1890s saw him become one of the most popular playwrights in London . He is best remembered for his epigrams and plays , his novel The Picture of Dorian Gray , and the circumstances of his criminal conviction for gross indecency , imprisonment , and early death at age 46 . Wilde 's parents were successful Anglo-Irish intellectuals in Dublin . A young Wilde learned to speak fluent French and German . At university , Wilde read Greats ; he demonstrated himself to be an exceptional classicist , first at Trinity College Dublin , then at Oxford . He became associated with the emerging philosophy of aestheticism , led by two of his tutors , Walter Pater and John Ruskin . After university , Wilde moved to London into fashionable cultural and social circles . As a spokesman for aestheticism , he tried his hand at various literary activities : he published a book of poems , lectured in the United States and Canada on the new English Renaissance in Art and interior decoration , and then returned to London where he worked prolifically as a journalist . Known for his biting wit , flamboyant dress and glittering conversational skill , Wilde became one of the best-known personalities of his day . At the turn of the 1890s , he refined his ideas about the supremacy of art in a series of dialogues and essays , and incorporated themes of decadence , duplicity , and beauty into what would be his only novel , The Picture of Dorian Gray ( 1890 ) . The opportunity to construct aesthetic details precisely , and combine them with larger social themes , drew Wilde to write drama .",

  "/wiki/Myra_Breckenridge": "Myra Breckinridge is a 1968 satirical novel by Gore Vidal written in the form of a diary . Described by the critic Dennis Altman as part of a major cultural assault on the assumed norms of gender and sexuality which swept the western world in the late 1960s and early 1970s , the book 's major themes are feminism , transsexuality , American expressions of machismo and patriarchy , and deviant sexual practices , as filtered through an aggressively camp sensibility . The controversial book is also the first instance of a novel in which the main character undergoes a clinical sex-change . Set in Hollywood in the 1960s , the novel also contains candid and irreverent glimpses into the machinations within the film industry . Myra Breckinridge was dismissed by some of the era 's more conservative critics as pornographic at the time of its first publication in February 1968 ; nevertheless , the novel immediately became a worldwide bestseller and has since come to be considered a classic in some circles . It is tempting to argue that Vidal said more to subvert the dominant rules of sex and gender in Myra than is contained in a shelf of queer theory treatises , wrote Dennis Altman . Critic Harold Bloom cites the novel as a canonical work in his book The Western Canon . Vidal called Myra the favorite of his books , and published a sequel , Myron , in 1974 . The novel was adapted into a 1970 film of the same name , which was universally panned . Vidal disowned the film , calling it an awful joke . In his 1995 memoir Palimpsest , Vidal said the voice of Myra may have been inspired by the megalomania of Ana\u00efs Nin 's diaries .",

Vidal was born into a political family ; his maternal grandfather , Thomas Pryor Gore , served as United States senator from Oklahoma ( 1907-1921 and 1931-1937 ) . Vidal himself twice sought office - unsuccessfully - as a Democratic Party candidate , first in 1960 to the United States House of Representatives ( for New York ) , and later in 1982 to the U.S. Senate ( for California ) . :439 As a political commentator and essayist , Vidal 's primary focus was the history and society of the United States , especially how a militaristic foreign policy reduced the country to a decadent empire . His political and cultural essays were published in The Nation , the New Statesman , the New York Review of Books , and Esquire magazines . As a public intellectual , Gore Vidal 's topical debates on sex , politics , and religion with other intellectuals and writers occasionally turned into quarrels with the likes of William F. Buckley Jr. and Norman Mailer . Vidal thought all men and women are potentially bisexual . As a novelist , Vidal explored the nature of corruption in public and private life . His polished and erudite style of narration readily evoked the time and place of his stories , and perceptively delineated the psychology of his characters . His third novel , The City and the Pillar ( 1948 ) , offended the literary , political , and moral sensibilities of conservative book reviewers , the plot being about a dispassionately presented male homosexual relationship . In the historical novel genre , Vidal recreated the imperial world of Julian the Apostate ( r. AD 361-63 ) in Julian ( 1964 ) . Julian was the Roman emperor who used religious tolerance to re-establish pagan polytheism to counter the political subversion of Christian monotheism .",
