He played in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) for the Philadelphia Phillies , Philadelphia Athletics ( twice ) , and Cleveland Naps between 1896 and 1916 . He managed the Naps from 1905 through 1909 . Lajoie was signed to the National League 's ( NL ) Phillies in 1896 . By the beginning of the twentieth century , however , the upstart American League ( AL ) was looking to rival the supremacy of the NL and in 1901 , Lajoie and dozens of former National League players joined the American League . National League clubs contested the legality of contracts signed by players who jumped to the other league but eventually , Lajoie was allowed to play for Connie Mack 's Athletics . During the season , Lajoie set the all-time American League single-season mark for the highest batting average ( .426 ) . : p.76 : p.88 One year later , Lajoie went to the Cleveland Bronchos where he would play until the 1915 season when he returned to play for Mack and the Athletics . While with Cleveland , Lajoie 's popularity led to locals electing to change the club 's team name from Bronchos to Napoleons ( Naps for short ) , which remained until after Lajoie departed Cleveland and the name was changed to Indians ( the team 's present-day name ) . Lajoie led the AL in batting average five times in his career and four times recorded the highest number of hits . During several of those years with the Naps he and Ty Cobb dominated AL hitting categories and traded batting titles with each other , most notably coming in 1910 , when the league 's batting champion was not decided until well after the last game of the season and after an investigation by American League President Ban Johnson . Lajoie in 1914 joined Cap Anson and Honus Wagner as the only major league players to record 3,000 career hits .",

As a professional baseball player , his MLB career spanned from 1899 to 1914 in which he played mainly in the National League for seven teams over 12 seasons . His most notable time was with the New York Giants , where he starred in the outfield for John McGraw 's 1904 pennant winners and 1905 World Series champions . One of the finest hitters of the dead-ball era , his .333 career batting average ranks 28th all time and he finished in the top three in batting five times . In each of those same seasons , he also finished in the top ten in the league in on-base percentage , slugging percentage , and home runs . A controversial character - Donlin , also known as Turkey Mike for his unique strut - his entertaining personality , flamboyant style of dress , and prodigious talent as a hitter caused him to be lionized as the baseball idol of Manhattan . However , alcoholism led to friction with club officials and incarceration . Donlin attempted to leverage his popularity as an athlete to launch a career in Broadway theatre where he met and married Vaudeville comedian Mabel Hite in 1906 . Together , they performed in the baseball-themed play Stealing Home for about three years . Between the waning popularity of the play in 1911 and Hite 's death the following year , Donlin attempted short-lived comebacks with the Giants , Boston Rustlers , and Pittsburgh Pirates . His forays into acting cut short an undeniable talent that could have been a much more successful major league career ; he reached 100 games in just five of his MLB seasons . After convincing McGraw to sign him for the last time in 1914 , Donlin endured a disappointing 35-game cameo with the Giants , leading him to devote his efforts to launch his acting career .",
