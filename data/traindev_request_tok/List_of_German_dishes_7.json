They are traditionally served with bread , mustard , horseradish and/or potato salad .",
  "/wiki/United_States": "The United States of America ( USA ) , commonly known as the United States ( U.S. or US ) or America , is a country consisting of 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . [ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

The hot dog became closely associated with baseball and American culture . Although particularly connected with New York City and its cuisine , the hot dog eventually became ubiquitous throughout the US during the 20th century , and emerged as an important part of other regional cuisines , including Chicago street cuisine .",
  "/wiki/Apfelwein": "Apfelwein ( [ \u0294apfl\u0329\u02c8va\u026an ] Germany , apple wine ) , or Viez ( [ fi\u02d0ts ] Moselfranken , Saarland , Trier , vice ) or Most ( [ m\u0254st ] Austria , Switzerland , South Germany , must ) are German words for cider . It is made from a mix of sour tasting apples , such as Bohnapfel or Speierling , respectively . [ citation needed ] It has an alcohol content of 4.8-7.0% and a tart , sour taste . Apfelwein is also regionally known as Ebbelwoi , \u00c4ppler , St\u00f6ffsche , Apfelmost ( apple must ) , Viez ( from Latin vice , the second or substitute wine ) , and saurer Most ( sour must , S\u00fc\u00dfmost or sweet must is essentially apple juice ) . Instead of the name \u00c4ppler , restaurants and smaller manufacturers may instead call the beverage Schoppen or Schoppe , which actually refers to the measure of the glass . In the Frankfurt area , berries from the service tree ( Sorbus domestica ) may be added in small quantities to increase astringency , in which case the specific type of Apfelwein is called Speierling . In modern times , the term Speierling is often also used to refer to any more sour variety of Apfelwein , even if it lacks any juice of the service tree .",

Aside from the UK and its former colonies , cider is popular in other European countries including Portugal ( mainly in Minho and Madeira ) , France ( particularly Brittany and Normandy ) , northern Italy ( Piedmont and Friuli ) , and northern Spain ( especially the Principality of Asturias and the Basque Country ) . Central Europe also has its own types of cider with Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse producing a particularly tart version known as Apfelwein .

  "/wiki/Schorle": "Schorle is a German beverage made by diluting juice or wine with carbonated water or lemonade ( lemon-lime soda ) . The most common variety is Apfelschorle ( made from apple juice and sparkling mineral water ) . Large bottles of Schorle can be found at most grocers , stores , supermarkets and anywhere else where carbonated drinks are sold , next to the soda . Due to its dilution it is less sweet or alcoholic than the original beverage , making it better suited as a refreshment on hot summer days or as an alternative to beer at the biergarten or weinstube [ de ] . Typical proportions are half seltzer in a high glass and half juice or wine . In the Palatinate , in Germany , a wine schorle may consist of considerably less than 1/2 water if it is ordered 'fett ' ( German for 'fat ' ) .",
  "/wiki/Handk\u00e4se": "Handk\u00e4se ( pronounced [ \u02c8hantk\u025b\u02d0z\u0259 ] ; literally : hand cheese ) is a German regional sour milk cheese ( similar to Harzer ) and is a culinary speciality of Frankfurt am Main , Offenbach am Main , Darmstadt , Langen , and other parts of southern Hesse . It gets its name from the traditional way of producing it : forming it with one 's own hands . It is a small , translucent , yellow cheese with a pungent aroma that some people may find unpleasant . It is sometimes square , but more often round in shape . Often served as an appetizer or as a snack with Apfelwein ( Ebbelwoi or cider ) , it is traditionally topped with chopped onions , locally known as Handk\u00e4se mit Musik ( literally : hand cheese with music ) . It is usually eaten with caraway on it , but since many people in Germany do not like this spice , in many areas it is served on the side . Some Hessians say that it is a sign of the quality of the establishment when caraway is in a separate dispenser . As a sign of this , many restaurants have , in addition to the salt and pepper , a little pot for caraway seeds . Strangers to this custom probably ask where the Musik is . They most likely are told , Die Musik kommt sp\u00e4ter , i.e . the music comes later . This is a euphemism for the flatulence that the raw onions usually provide .",
  "/wiki/Harzer": "Harzer cheese is a German sour milk cheese made from low fat curd cheese , which contains only about one percent fat and originates in the Harz mountain region south of Braunschweig .

Frequently , the small and round variety is sold in a cylindrical package , which is then called Harzer Roller . Harzer cheese is typically flavoured with caraway . Some varieties are white mold cheeses , others red mold cheeses . The latter type generally has a stronger flavour , and both types develop a strong aroma after maturing for a few days or weeks . Harzer has a distinctive strong smell and overpowering flavour . Harzer contains very little fat ( less than 1% ) but extremely high protein ( usually around 30% ) and therefore is often used for special diets and sport nutrition .",
