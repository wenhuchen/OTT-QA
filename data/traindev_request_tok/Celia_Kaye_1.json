Howard , a pulp-fiction writer of the 1930s , about the adventures of the eponymous character in a fictional world of dark magic and savagery .

Buzz Feitshans and Raffaella De Laurentiis produced the film for her father Dino De Laurentiis , with Edward R. Pressman as an executive producer . Basil Poledouris composed the music . Ideas for a Conan film were proposed as early as 1970 ; Pressman and associate producer Edward Summer began a concerted effort to get the film made in 1975 . It took them two years to obtain the film rights , after which they recruited Schwarzenegger for the lead role and Oliver Stone to draft a script . Pressman lacked capital for the endeavor , and in 1979 , after having his proposals for investments rejected by the major studios , he sold the project to Dino De Laurentiis . Milius was appointed as director and he rewrote Stone 's script . The final screenplay integrated scenes from Howard 's stories and from films such as Kwaidan and Seven Samurai . Filming took place in Spain over five months in the regions around Madrid and Almer\u00eda . The sets , designed by Ron Cobb , were based on Dark Age cultures and Frank Frazetta 's paintings of Conan ."
