One of the events that greatly contributed to the city 's development was the Polish-Lithuanian Union of Krewo in 1385 . Lublin thrived as a centre of trade and commerce due to its strategic location on the route between Vilnius and Krak\u00f3w ; the inhabitants had the privilege of free trade in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania . The Lublin Parliament session of 1569 led to the creation of a real union between the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania , thus creating the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth . Lublin witnessed the early stages of Reformation in the 16th century . A Calvinist congregation was founded and groups of radical Arians appeared in the city , making it an important global centre of Arianism . At the turn of the century , Lublin was recognized for hosting a number of outstanding poets , writers , and historians of the epoch . Until the partitions at the end of the 18th century , Lublin was a royal city of the Crown Kingdom of Poland . Its delegates and nobles had the right to participate in the royal election . In 1578 , Lublin was chosen as the seat of the Crown Tribunal , the highest appeal court in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , and for centuries , the city has been flourishing as a centre of culture and higher learning , with Krak\u00f3w , Warsaw , Pozna\u0144 , and Lw\u00f3w .",

With the population of 294,510 ( as of 2018 ) , it is the eleventh-largest city in Poland . The wider Katowice urban area has the population of approximately 2 to 3 million people . Throughout the mid-18th century , Katowice had developed into a village upon the discovery of rich coal reserves in the area .

Subsequently , from the second half of the 18th century , many German or Prussian craftsmen , merchants and artists began to settle in the region , which had been inhabited mostly by Poles over the past hundreds of years . Simultaneously Silesia experienced the influx of the first Jewish settlers . In the first half of the 19th century , intensive industrialization transformed local mills and farms into industrial steelworks , mines , foundries and artisan workshops . This also contributed to the establishment of companies and eventual rapid growth of the city . At the same time , Katowice became linked to the railway system with the first train arriving at the main station in 1847 .

It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel , the Irish Sea , and St George 's Channel . Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles , the third-largest in Europe , and the twentieth-largest on Earth . Geopolitically , Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland ( officially named Ireland ) , which covers five-sixths of the island , and Northern Ireland , which is part of the United Kingdom . In 2011 , the population of Ireland was about 6.6 million , ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain . As of 2016 , 4.8 million live in the Republic of Ireland , and 1.8 million live in Northern Ireland . The geography of Ireland comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain , with several navigable rivers extending inland . Its lush vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature . Much of Ireland was woodland until the end of the Middle Ages . Today , woodland makes up about 10% of the island , compared with a European average of over 33% , and most of it is non-native conifer plantations . There are twenty-six extant land mammal species native to Ireland . The Irish climate is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and thus very moderate , and winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area , although summers are cooler than those in continental Europe .",

A general Warsaw Uprising between August and October 1944 led to even greater devastation and systematic razing by the Germans in advance of the Vistula-Oder Offensive .
