  "/wiki/Bituminous_coal": "Bituminous coal or black coal is a relatively soft coal containing a tarlike substance called bitumen or asphalt . It is of higher quality than lignite coal but of poorer quality than anthracite . Formation is usually the result of high pressure being exerted on lignite . Its coloration can be black or sometimes dark brown ; often there are well-defined bands of bright and dull material within the seams . These distinctive sequences , which are classified according to either dull , bright-banded or bright , dull-banded , is how bituminous coals are stratigraphically identified . Bituminous coal is an organic sedimentary rock formed by diagenetic and sub metamorphic compression of peat bog material . Its primary constituents are macerals : vitrinite , and liptinite . The carbon content of bituminous coal is around 60-80% ; the rest is composed of water , air , hydrogen , and sulfur , which have not been driven off from the macerals . Bank density is approximately 1346 kg/m\u00b3 ( 84 lb/ft\u00b3 ) . Bulk density typically runs to 833 kg/m\u00b3 ( 52 lb/ft\u00b3 ) . The heat content of bituminous coal ranges from 24 to 35 MJ/kg ( 21 million to 30 million BTU per short ton ) on a moist , mineral-matter-free basis . Within the coal mining industry , this type of coal is known for releasing the largest amounts of firedamp , a dangerous mixture of gases that can cause underground explosions .",

  "/wiki/Hydroelectric": "Hydroelectricity is electricity produced from hydropower . In 2015 , hydropower generated 16.6% of the world 's total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity , and was expected to increase by about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years . Hydropower is produced in 150 countries , with the Asia-Pacific region generating 33 percent of global hydropower in 2013 . China is the largest hydroelectricity producer , with 920 TWh of production in 2013 , representing 16.9% of domestic electricity use . The cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low , making it a competitive source of renewable electricity . The hydro station consumes no water , unlike coal or gas plants . The typical cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt hour . With a dam and reservoir it is also a flexible source of electricity , since the amount produced by the station can be varied up or down very rapidly ( as little as a few seconds ) to adapt to changing energy demands . Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed , the project produces no direct waste , and it generally has a considerably lower output level of greenhouse gases than photovoltaic power plants and certainly fossil fuel powered energy plants ( see also Life-cycle_greenhouse-gas_emissions_of_energy_sources ) . However , when constructed in lowland rainforest areas , where inundation of a part of the forest is necessary , they actually emit up to 3 to 4 times more greenhouse gases [ clarification needed ] ( see also Environmental_impact_of_reservoirs # Greenhouse_gases ) .",

  "/wiki/Wind_power": "Wind power or wind energy is the use of wind to provide the mechanical power through wind turbines to turn electric generators and traditionally to do other work , like milling or pumping . Wind power is a sustainable and renewable energy , and has a much smaller impact on the environment compared to burning fossil fuels . Wind farms consist of many individual wind turbines , which are connected to the electric power transmission network . Onshore wind is an inexpensive source of electric power , competitive with or in many places cheaper than coal or gas plants . Onshore wind farms also have an impact on the landscape , as typically they need to be spread over more land than other power stations and need to be built in wild and rural areas , which can lead to industrialization of the countryside and habitat loss . Offshore wind is steadier and stronger than on land and offshore farms have less visual impact , but construction and maintenance costs are higher . Small onshore wind farms can feed some energy into the grid or provide electric power to isolated off-grid locations . Wind is an intermittent energy source , which can not make electricity nor be dispatched on demand . It also gives variable power , which is consistent from year to year but varies greatly over shorter time scales . Therefore , it must be used together with other electric power sources or storage to give a reliable supply . As the proportion of wind power in a region increases , more conventional power sources are needed to back it up ( such as fossil fuel power and nuclear power ) , and the grid may need to be upgraded . Power-management techniques such as having dispatchable power sources , enough hydroelectric power , excess capacity , geographically distributed turbines , exporting and importing power to neighboring areas , energy storage , or reducing demand when wind production is low , can in many cases overcome these problems .",

  "/wiki/Natural_gas": "Natural gas ( also called fossil gas ) is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane , but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes , and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide , nitrogen , hydrogen sulfide , or helium . It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years . The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas . Natural gas is a non-renewable hydrocarbon used as a source of energy for heating , cooking , and electricity generation . It is also used as a fuel for vehicles and as a chemical feedstock in the manufacture of plastics and other commercially important organic chemicals . Natural gas has a complicated effect on climate change ; it itself is a greenhouse gas , and it releases carbon dioxide when burned . However , natural gas use often supplants coal use , which is far more environmentally damaging , leading to lower net carbon dioxide emissions in countries such as the United States . Natural gas is found in deep underground rock formations or associated with other hydrocarbon reservoirs in coal beds and as methane clathrates . Petroleum is another resource and fossil fuel found close to and with natural gas . Most natural gas was created over time by two mechanisms : biogenic and thermogenic . Biogenic gas is created by methanogenic organisms in marshes , bogs , landfills , and shallow sediments . Deeper in the earth , at greater temperature and pressure , thermogenic gas is created from buried organic material .",
