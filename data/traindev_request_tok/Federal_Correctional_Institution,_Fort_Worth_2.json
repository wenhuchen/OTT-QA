  "/wiki/Commutation_of_sentence": "In law , a commutation is the substitution of a lesser penalty for that given after a conviction for a crime . The penalty can be lessened in severity , in duration , or both . Unlike most pardons by government and overturnings by the court ( a full overturning is equal to an acquittal ) , a commutation does not affect the status of a defendant 's underlying criminal conviction . Although the concept of commutation may be used to broadly describe the substitution of a lesser criminal penalty for the original sentence , some jurisdictions have historically used the term only for the substitution of a sentence of a different character than was originally imposed by the court . For example , the substitution of a sentence of parole for the original sentence of incarceration . A jurisdiction that uses that definition of commutation would use another term , such as a remission , to describe a reduction of a penalty that does not change its character . A commutation does not reverse a conviction and the recipient of a commutation remains guilty in accordance with the original conviction . For example , someone convicted of capital murder may have their sentence of death commuted to life imprisonment , a lessening of the punishment that does not affect the underlying criminal conviction , as may occur on a discretionary basis or following upon a change in the law or judicial ruling that limits or eliminates the death penalty . In some jurisdictions a commutation of sentence may be conditional , meaning that the convicted person may be required to abide by specified conditions or may lose the benefit of the commutation . The conditions must be lawful and reasonable , and will typically expire when the convicted completes any remaining portion of his or her sentence . For example , the pardon may be conditioned upon the person 's being a law-abiding citizen , such that if the beneficiary of the commutation commits a new crime before the condition expires the original sentence may be restored .",

  "/wiki/Extortion": "Extortion ( also called shakedown , and , in a legal sense incorrectly , exaction ) is obtaining benefit through coercion . In most jurisdictions it is likely to constitute a criminal offense ; the bulk of this article deals with such cases . Extortion is sometimes called the protection racket since the racketeers often phrase their demands as payment for protection from ( real or hypothetical ) threats from unspecified other parties ; though often , and almost always , such protection is simply abstinence of harm from the same party , and such is implied in the protection offer . Extortion is commonly practiced by organized crime . In some jurisdictions , actually obtaining the benefit is not required to commit the offense , and making a threat of violence which refers to a requirement of a payment of money or property to halt future violence is sufficient to commit the offense . Exaction refers not only to extortion or the demanding and obtaining of something through force , but additionally , in its formal definition , means the infliction of something such as pain and suffering or making somebody endure something unpleasant . The term extortion is often used metaphorically to refer to usury or to price-gouging , though neither is legally considered extortion . It is also often used loosely to refer to everyday situations where one person feels indebted against their will , to another , in order to receive an essential service or avoid legal consequences . Neither extortion nor blackmail requires a threat of a criminal act , such as violence , merely a threat used to elicit actions , money , or property from the object of the extortion . Such threats include the filing of reports ( true or not ) of criminal behavior to the police , revelation of damaging facts ( such as pictures of the object of the extortion in a compromising position ) , etc . In law extortion can refer to political corruption , such as selling one 's office or influence peddling , [ citation needed ] but in general vocabulary the word usually first brings to mind blackmail or protection rackets . The logical connection between the corruption sense of the word and the other senses is that to demand bribes in one 's official capacity is blackmail or racketeering in essence ( that is , you need access to this resource , the government restricts access to it through my office , and I will charge you unfairly and unlawfully for such access ) .",
  "/wiki/Racketeering": "A racket , according to the current common and most general definition , is an organized criminal act in which the criminal act is some form of substantial business , or a way to earn illegal money either regularly , or briefly but repeatedly . A racket is therefore generally a repeated or continuous organized criminal operation . However , according to the more specific definition , racketeering constitutes extortion or criminal coercion . Originally and often still specifically , a racket referred to a criminal act in which the perpetrator or perpetrators fraudulently offer a service that will not be put into effect , a service to solve a nonexistent problem , or to solve a problem that would not exist without the racket . Conducting a racket is racketeering . Particularly , the potential problem may be caused by the same party that offers to solve it , but that fact may be concealed , with the specific intent to engender continual patronage for this party . The most common example of a racket is the protection racket , which promises to protect the target business or person from dangerous individuals in the neighborhood and then either collects the money or causes damage to the business until the owner pays . The racket exists as both the problem and its solution , and it is used as a method of extortion . However , the term racket has expanded in definition and may now be used less strictly to refer to any continuous or repeated illegal organized crime operation , including those that do not necessarily involve fraudulent practices . For example , racket may be used to refer to the numbers racket or the drug racket , neither of which generally involve fraud or deception with regard to the intended clientele . Racketeering is most often associated with organized crime , and the term was coined by the Employers ' Association of Chicago in June 1927 in a statement about the influence of organized crime in the Teamsters union .",

  "/wiki/Whitewater_controversy": "The Whitewater controversy , Whitewater scandal , or simply Whitewater , was an American political controversy during the 1990s . It began with an investigation into the real estate investments of Bill and Hillary Clinton and their associates , Jim McDougal and Susan McDougal , in the Whitewater Development Corporation . This failed business venture was incorporated in 1979 with the purpose of developing vacation properties on land along the White River near Flippin , Arkansas . A March 1992 New York Times article published during the 1992 U.S. presidential campaign reported that the Clintons , then governor and first lady of Arkansas , had invested and lost money in the Whitewater Development Corporation . The article stimulated the interest of L. Jean Lewis , a Resolution Trust Corporation investigator who was looking into the failure of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan , also owned by Jim and Susan McDougal . Lewis looked for connections between the savings and loan company and the Clintons , and on September 2 , 1992 , she submitted a criminal referral to the FBI naming Bill and Hillary Clinton as witnesses in the Madison Guaranty case . Little Rock U.S. Attorney Charles A . Banks and the FBI determined that the referral lacked merit , but Lewis continued to pursue the case . From 1992 to 1994 , Lewis issued several additional referrals against the Clintons and repeatedly called the U.S. Attorney 's Office in Little Rock and the Justice Department regarding the case . Her referrals eventually became public knowledge , and she testified before the Senate Whitewater Committee in 1995 . David Hale , the source of criminal allegations against the Clintons , claimed in November 1993 that Bill Clinton had pressured him into providing an illegal $ 300,000 loan to Susan McDougal , the Clintons ' partner in the Whitewater land deal . The allegations were regarded as questionable because Hale had not mentioned Clinton in reference to this loan during the original FBI investigation of Madison Guaranty in 1989 ; only after coming under indictment himself in 1993 , did Hale make allegations against the Clintons .",
  "/wiki/Fraud": "In law , fraud is intentional deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain , or to deprive a victim of a legal right . Fraud can violate civil law ( i.e. , a fraud victim may sue the fraud perpetrator to avoid the fraud or recover monetary compensation ) , a criminal law ( i.e. , a fraud perpetrator may be prosecuted and imprisoned by governmental authorities ) , or it may cause no loss of money , property or legal right but still be an element of another civil or criminal wrong . The purpose of fraud may be monetary gain or other benefits , for example by obtaining a passport , travel document , or driver 's license , or mortgage fraud , where the perpetrator may attempt to qualify for a mortgage by way of false statements . A hoax is a distinct concept that involves deliberate deception without the intention of gain or of materially damaging or depriving a victim .",
  "/wiki/Conspiracy_(crime)": "In criminal law , a conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime at some time in the future . Criminal law in some countries or for some conspiracies may require that at least one overt act be undertaken in furtherance of that agreement , to constitute an offense . There is no limit on the number participating in the conspiracy and , in most countries , no requirement that any steps have been taken to put the plan into effect ( compare attempts which require proximity to the full offense ) . For the purposes of concurrence , the actus reus is a continuing one and parties may join the plot later and incur joint liability and conspiracy can be charged where the co-conspirators have been acquitted or can not be traced . Finally , repentance by one or more parties does not affect liability ( unless , in some cases , it occurs before the parties have committed overt acts ) but may reduce their sentence . An unindicted co-conspirator , or unindicted conspirator , is a person or entity that is alleged in an indictment to have engaged in conspiracy , but who is not charged in the same indictment . Prosecutors choose to name persons as unindicted co-conspirators for a variety of reasons including grants of immunity , pragmatic considerations , and evidentiary concerns .",
