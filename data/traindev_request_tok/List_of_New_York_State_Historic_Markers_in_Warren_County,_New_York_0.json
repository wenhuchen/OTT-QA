It is the site of notorious atrocities committed by the Huron tribes against the surrendered British and provincial troops following a successful French siege in 1757 . That event was portrayed in James Fenimore Cooper 's novel The Last of the Mohicans . The fort 's construction was ordered by Sir William Johnson in September 1755 , during the French and Indian War , as a staging ground for attacks against the French fort at Crown Point called Fort St. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric . It was part of a chain of British and French forts along the important inland waterway from New York City to Montreal , and occupied a key forward location on the frontier between New York and New France . It was named for both Prince William , the Duke of Cumberland , the younger son of King George II , and Prince William Henry , Duke of Gloucester , a grandson of King George II and a younger brother of the future King George III . Following the 1757 siege , the French destroyed the fort and withdrew . While other forts were built nearby in later years , the site of Fort William Henry lay abandoned . In the 19th century , it was a destination for tourists . In the 1950s interest in the history of the site revived , and a replica of the fort was constructed .

  "/wiki/Weber_Furlong": "Wilhelmina Weber Furlong ( 1878-1962 ) was a German American artist and teacher . Among America 's earliest avant-garde elite modernist painters , Weber Furlong was a major American artist who pioneered modern impressionistic and modern expressionistic still life painting at the turn of the twentieth century 's American modernist movement . She has been called the first female modernist painter in American Modernism .
