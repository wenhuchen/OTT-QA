The Lewiston area traces its roots to 1669 with the early presence of the Androscoggin tribe ( the namesake of the county in which the city resides ) . In the late 18th century , the area ( then a part of Massachusetts ) slowly became populated by Quebec families and was incorporated as Lewistown in 1795 . The presence of the Androscoggin River and Lewistown Falls made the town an attractive area for manufacturing and hydro-power businesses . The rise of Boston rail and textile tycoon Benjamin Bates saw rapid economic growth rivaling that of Cambridge , Worcester , and Concord . The increase in economic stimulus prompted thousands of Quebecers to migrate , causing a population boom ; the populace rose from 1,801 in 1840 to 21,701 in 1890 . In 1855 , local preacher Oren Burbank Cheney founded the Maine State Seminary , the first coeducational university in New England and one of the first universities to admit black students before the Emancipation Proclamation .",
