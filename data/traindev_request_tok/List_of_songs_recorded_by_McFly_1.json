  "/wiki/Jellyfish_(band)": "Jellyfish was an American rock band formed in San Francisco in 1989 . Led by songwriters Andy Sturmer ( drums , vocals ) and Roger Manning ( keyboards , vocals ) , the group was known for their blend of 1970s classic rock and XTC-style power pop . They released two albums , Bellybutton ( 1990 ) and Spilt Milk ( 1993 ) , that proved highly influential to artists in a similar vein . Sturmer and Manning met in high school and shared an admiration for jazz , post-punk , and British pop music . Following a stint as members of Beatnik Beatch , they quit the group to continue songwriting with one another and formed Jellyfish with guitarist Jason Falkner , who left after the tour for Bellybutton . The group viewed Spilt Milk as their masterpiece and the fulfillment of their original grandiose vision for the band , emphasizing high-energy moods , vocal harmonies , and studio artifice . Jellyfish broke up in 1994 due to poor record sales , Sturmer 's discomfort with his role as frontman , and artistic conflicts between the two songwriters . Manning subsequently formed Imperial Drag and pursued careers as a solo artist and session musician . Sturmer worked with the Japanese pop duo Puffy AmiYumi and has kept a low public profile , but continues working as a songwriter and composer for various cartoons . In 2020 , Manning , bassist Tim Smith , and guitarist Eric Dover reunited as the Lickerish Quartet . During their five-year existence , Jellyfish attracted critical acclaim and a devoted cult following , but were out of step with the prevailing rock trends of the time ( hair metal and grunge ) . Their only charting single on the Billboard Hot 100 was Baby 's Coming Back .",
