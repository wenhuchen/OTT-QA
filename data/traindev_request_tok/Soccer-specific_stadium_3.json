  "/wiki/Al_Lang_Stadium": "Al Lang Stadium is a 7,500-seat sports stadium in downtown St. Petersburg , Florida that is the current home field of the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the USL Championship . It was used almost exclusively as a baseball park for over 60 years . However , since the Rowdies moved to the facility in 2011 , it has been reconfigured to better host soccer . Al Lang Stadium was built in 1947 at the site of an older facility known as St. Petersburg Athletic Park . It is named in honor of Al Lang , a former mayor of St. Petersburg who was instrumental in bringing minor league and spring training baseball to the city in the early 20th century . The ballpark was reconstructed in 1976 and was extensively renovated before the Tampa Bay Devil Rays began using it as their first spring training venue in 1998 . The Devil Rays / Rays were the last of a long series of Major League Baseball clubs to conduct spring training and host an affiliated minor league team at Al Lang Stadium and St. Petersburg 's previous ballparks . Before the Rays , tenants included the New York Yankees , St. Louis Cardinals , New York Mets , and the Baltimore Orioles , amongst others . The stadium hosted its last spring training game in March 2008 and was the site of occasional amateur and exhibition baseball for the next several years . The Tampa Bay Rowdies became the primary tenant in 2011 , and Al Lang Stadium was incrementally modified into a better soccer venue over each of the following off-seasons . Since October 2014 , an agreement between the club and the city of St. Petersburg has made the stadium a soccer-only facility , and the Rowdies ' ownership conducted an extensive renovation in early 2015 . In 2016 , Rowdies ' majority owner Bill Edwards proposed greatly expanding the stadium 's capacity to 18,000 seats as part of a bid to move his club into Major League Soccer ( MLS ) .",
  "/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rowdies": "The Tampa Bay Rowdies are an American professional soccer team based in St. Petersburg , Florida . The club was founded in 2008 and first took the pitch in 2010 . Since 2017 , the Rowdies have been members of the USL Championship in the second tier of the American soccer pyramid . They formerly played in the North American Soccer League ( NASL ) ( from 2011 to 2016 ) and USSF Division 2 ( in 2010 ) , which were also second-tier leagues . The Rowdies play their home games at Al Lang Stadium on St. Petersburg 's downtown waterfront . The current club shares its name , logo , and some of its club culture with the original Tampa Bay Rowdies , who were active from 1975 until 1993 , most notably in the original North American Soccer League . The owners of the current club announced their intention to use the old Rowdies ' trademarks at its introductory press conference in 2008 . However , licensing issues forced the club to use the name FC Tampa Bay until December 2011 , when it gained full rights to the Rowdies name and other intellectual property . The current Rowdies have always used the same green and yellow color scheme and hoops as the original team , even when they could not yet use the Rowdies name . The Rowdies captured the NASL championship in Soccer Bowl 2012 , and their team shield includes two stars : one for their 2012 win and one for the 1975 Soccer Bowl championship won by the original Rowdies . The club has had a long-standing rivalry with the Fort Lauderdale Strikers , with whom they have contested the Florida Derby since the original Rowdies and Strikers first met in 1977 . In October 2018 , the Tampa Bay Rays , the area 's Major League Baseball franchise , announced plans to purchase the Rowdies and assume control of Al Lang Stadium .",

[ d ] It is one of two cities in Kentucky designated as first-class , the other being Lexington , the state 's second-largest city . [ e ] Louisville is the historical seat and , since 2003 , the nominal seat of Jefferson County , on the Indiana border . Named after King Louis XVI of France , Louisville was founded in 1778 by George Rogers Clark , making it one of the oldest cities west of the Appalachians . With nearby Falls of the Ohio as the only major obstruction to river traffic between the upper Ohio River and the Gulf of Mexico , the settlement first grew as a portage site . It was the founding city of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad , which grew into a 6,000-mile ( 9,700 km ) system across 13 states . Today , the city is known as the home of legendary boxer Muhammad Ali , the Kentucky Derby , Kentucky Fried Chicken ( KFC ) , the University of Louisville and its Cardinals , Louisville Slugger baseball bats , and three of Kentucky 's six Fortune 500 companies : Humana , Kindred Healthcare , and Yum ! Brands . Muhammad Ali International Airport , Louisville 's main commercial airport , hosts UPS 's worldwide hub . Since 2003 , Louisville 's borders have been the same as those of Jefferson County , after a city-county merger . The official name of this consolidated city-county government is the Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Government , abbreviated to Louisville Metro . Despite the merger and renaming , the term Jefferson County continues to be used in some contexts in reference to Louisville Metro , particularly including the incorporated cities outside the balance which make up Louisville proper .",
