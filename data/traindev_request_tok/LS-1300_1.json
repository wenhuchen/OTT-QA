  "/wiki/Echostar_6": "EchoStar VI or EchoStar 6 is a former American communications satellite which was operated by private EchoStar company and then was transferred to Bermuda as BermudaSat 1 . It was constructed by Space Systems Loral and is based on the LS-1300 satellite bus . Its launch was contracted by International Launch Services , using an Atlas IIAS carrier rocket . The launch occurred at 05:21 GMT on 14 July 2000 from Space Launch Complex 36B at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station . It was originally built as Sky 1B or MCI-2 for MCI Communications . This was later cancelled and the satellite was rebuilt as Echostar VI . Following its launch and on-orbit testing , it was placed in geostationary orbit at 73\u00b0 West , from where it provides broadcast and communications services to Europe using wide-band feeds . It carries thirty two transponders , and has an expected on-orbit lifespan of 12 years . In March and August 2010 , the satellite experienced solar-array anomalies resulting in the loss of 24 ( of an initial 108 ) solar cell strings . Although the anomalies did not reduce the estimated useful life , the power reduction limits it to operating 24 DBS transponders ( of the initial 32 ) at approximately 125 watts per channel , or 12 DBS transponders ( of an original 16 ) at approximately 250 watts per channel . After that in April 2013 the satellite was moved to Bermuda 's owned another geostationary point at 96,2\u00b0 West , leased to Bermuda 's telecommunication company and renamed",
  "/wiki/Estrela_do_Sul_1": "Telstar 14 or Estrela do Sul 1 ( Southern Star 1 ) is a commercial communications satellite in the Telstar series built by Space Systems/Loral ( SS/L ) for Telesat to provide Ku-band communications to South America and the Southern United States . Estrela do Sul 1 was launched by Sea Launch using a Zenit-3SL carrier rocket on 11 Jan 2004 for geosynchronous orbit at 63 degrees west . The North solar array failed to open after launch , limiting the mission effectiveness . The president of SS/L later said images of the satellite in orbit showed massive damage to the affected array , indicating that an explosion had occurred during launch . The satellite entered service with reduced capacity ( 17 transponders ) and reduced life span of 7 years with the jammed panel . Estrela do Sul 1 / Telstar 14 and Estrela do Sul 2 / Telstar 14R are built around the Loral 1300 satellite bus , and have launch mass of around 5000 kg .",

  "/wiki/PanAmSat": "The former PanAmSat Corporation founded in 1984 by Reynold ( Rene ) Anselmo , was a satellite service provider headquartered in Greenwich , Connecticut . It operated a fleet of communications satellites used by the entertainment industry , news agencies , internet service providers , government agencies , and telecommunication companies . Anselmo got the idea for PanAmSat from Norm Leventhal , a communications lawyer in Washington , D.C. , to whom he had turned to for advice regarding difficulties he was encountering in getting reasonably priced satellite transmission for his Spanish International Network ( SIN ) , the current-day Univision . Anselmo financed the entire project himself and Leventhal 's law firm , hiring Martin Rothblatt for special satellite technical advice , filed for approval from the Federal Communications Commission and lining up an initial satellite from RCA Astro-Electronics and a heavily discounted launch from Arianespace . PanAmSat effectively broke the monopoly on international satellite communications which was held by Intelsat , an international treaty-based organization founded and owned by several countries including the United States . PanAmSat , led by Anselmo , successfully lobbied the United States Congress to permit it to operate globally , competing against Intelsat . Univision would also gain a nationwide cable audience through PanAmSat 's efforts , gaining a head start in Spanish-language television in the United States and remaining the # 1 Spanish network to this day . Following the death of Rene Anselmo in 1995 , his widow Mary Anselmo controlled the company for a time . PanAmSat was sold to Hughes Electronics , a division of General Motors , in a $ 3 billion cash and stock deal . The satellite operations continued to be under PanAmSat with Hughes being the majority shareholder . In May 1997 , Hughes Communication Galaxy merged with PanAmSat , adding 9 more satellites to its fleet . In 2003 , News Corporation purchased Hughes Electronic 's PanAmSat division and on April 24 , 2004 sold PanAmSat to a consortium of private equity firms in a leveraged buyout including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. ( KKR ) , Carlyle Group and Providence Equity Partners for $ 4.3 billion .",
