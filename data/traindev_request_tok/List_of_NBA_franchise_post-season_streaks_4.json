The Eastern and Western conference champions play a best-of-seven game series to determine the league champion . The winners of the Finals are awarded the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy , which replaced the Walter A . Brown Trophy in 1983 . The series was initially known as the BAA Finals prior to the 1949-50 season when the Basketball Association of America ( BAA ) merged with the National Basketball League ( NBL ) to form the NBA . The competition oversaw further name changes to NBA World Championship Series from 1950 to 1985 , as well as a brief stint as the Showdown , before settling on NBA Finals in 1986 . Since 2018 , it has been officially known as the NBA Finals presented by YouTube TV for sponsorship reasons . The NBA Finals was initially structured in a 2-2-1-1-1 format . In 1985 , to ease the amount of cross-country travel , it was changed to a 2-3-2 format , where the first two and last two games of the series were played at the arena of the team who earned home-court advantage by having the better record during the regular season . In 2014 , the 2-2-1-1-1 format was restored . The first two games are played the higher-seeded team 's home , the following two at the home of the lower-seeded team , and the remaining three are played at each team 's home arena alternately . A total of 19 franchises have won the NBA Finals , with the Toronto Raptors winning in 2019 .",

Laker coach Fred Schaus privately fumed that Red 's hiring had taken away all of the accolades his Lakers should have received following their tremendous Game 1 win . The Celtics won the next three games and looked ready to close out L.A. in Game 5 . However , the Lakers won the next two games , setting the stage for another classic Game 7 in the Boston Garden .
