Grey is known for his plunger mute technique ( comparable to Tricky Sam Nanton , Bob Hunt and Wycliffe Gordon ) , and also wrote an instructional book called Plunger Techniques . As states Scott Yanow in his artist biography on Allmusic , Al Grey 's trademark phrases and often humorous use of the plunger mute long made him quite distinctive . After getting out of the service , he was with the orchestras of Benny Carter ( 1945-1946 ) , Jimmie Lunceford ( 1946-1947 ) , Lucky Millinder , and Lionel Hampton ( off and on during 1948-1953 ) . Grey was a well-featured soloist with the classic Dizzy Gillespie globetrotting orchestra during 1956-1957 ( taking an exciting solo at the 1957 Newport Jazz Festival on a blazing version of Cool Breeze ) . He was with Count Basie 's orchestra on three separate occasions ( 1957-1961 , 1964-1966 , and 1971-1977 ) , led a band with Billy Mitchell in the early '60s , and had a group with Jimmy Forrest after leaving Basie in 1977 . In later years , Grey performed and recorded often with Clark Terry , made a CD with the Statesmen of Jazz , and for a time led a quintet that featured his son Mike Grey on second trombone . Al Grey recorded as a leader for Argo ( 1959-1964 ) , Tangerine , Black & Blue , Stash , Chiaroscuro , and Capri , and co-led an excellent Pablo date in 1983 with J.J. Johnson . He died of complications from diabetes on March 24 , 2000 .",

  "/wiki/Jaki_Byard": "John Arthur Jaki Byard ( June 15 , 1922 - February 11 , 1999 ) was an American jazz multi-instrumentalist , composer and arranger . Mainly a pianist , he also played tenor and alto saxophones , among several other instruments . He was known for his eclectic style , incorporating everything from ragtime and stride to free jazz . Byard played with trumpeter Maynard Ferguson in the late 1950s and early 1960s , and was a member of bands led by bassist Charles Mingus for several years , including on several studio and concert recordings . The first of his recordings as a leader was in 1960 , but , despite being praised by critics , his albums and performances did not gain him much wider attention . In his 60-year career , Byard recorded at least 35 albums as leader , and more than 50 as a sideman . Byard 's influence on the music comes from his combining of musical styles during performance , and his parallel career in teaching . From 1969 Byard was heavily involved in jazz education : he began teaching at the New England Conservatory of Music and went on to work at several other music institutions , as well as having private students . He continued performing and recording , mainly in solo and small group settings , but he also led two big bands - one made up of some of his students , and the other of professional musicians . His death , from a single gunshot while in his home , remains an unsolved mystery .",
