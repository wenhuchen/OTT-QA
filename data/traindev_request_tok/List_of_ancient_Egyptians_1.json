  "/wiki/Bakenranef": "Bakenranef , known by the ancient Greeks as Bocchoris , was briefly a king of the Twenty-fourth dynasty of Egypt . Based at Sais in the western Delta , he ruled Lower Egypt from c. 725 to 720 BC . Though the Ptolemaic period Egyptian historian Manetho considers him the sole member of the Twenty-fourth dynasty , modern scholars include his father Tefnakht in that dynasty . Although Sextus Julius Africanus quotes Manetho as stating that Bocchoris ruled for six years , some modern scholars again differ and assign him a shorter reign of only five years , based on evidence from an Apis Bull burial stela . It establishes that Bakenranef 's reign ended only at the start of his 6th regnal year which , under the Egyptian dating system , means he had a reign of 5 full years . Bakenranef 's prenomen or royal name , Wahkare , means Constant is the Spirit of Re in Egyptian . Manetho is the source for two events from Bakenranef 's reign . The first is the story that a lamb uttered the prophecy that Egypt would be conquered by the Assyrians , a story later repeated by such classical authors as Claudius Aelianus ( De Natura Animalis 12.3 ) . The second was that Bakenranef was captured by Shebitqo , a king of the Twenty-fifth dynasty , who executed Bakenrenef by having him burned alive . A Kushite king , Shebitqo extended his rule over the whole of Egypt , which had been split since the Twenty-first dynasty . Diodorus Siculus , writing about three centuries after Manetho , adds some different details . Diodorus states that although Bakenranef was contemptible in appearance , he was wiser than his predecessors ( 1.65 ) .",

Khufu succeeded his father Sneferu as king . He is generally accepted as having commissioned the Great Pyramid of Giza , one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World , but many other aspects of his reign are poorly documented .

He was generally identified with Irsu ( alt . Arsu , Iarsu , Yarsu ) mentioned in the Great Harris Papyrus , although no contemporary source connects Bay with Irsu . Bay 's importance is emphasized by the fact that he was given permission , possibly by Seti II but more probably by Siptah , to construct his own tomb in Egypt 's Valley of the Kings ( KV13 ) . His tomb was clearly constructed as part of a triad of tombs , including that of the Pharaoh Siptah and Queen Twosret . This was an unprecedented privilege , the likes of which were rarely accorded to a commoner , let alone a foreigner ( though previous exceptions , such as that of Yuya , have occurred ) . It is possible that Bay was accorded this tomb because he was a relation of Siptah 's mother , a Canaanite concubine of Seti II , or perhaps even of Amenmesse .

His throne name , Neferkare ( Nefer-ka-Re ) , means Beautiful is the Ka of Re . He succeeded to the throne at age six , after the death of Merenre I . He was traditionally thought to be the son of Pepi I and Queen Ankhesenpepi II but the South Saqqara Stone annals record that Merenre had a minimum reign of 11 years . Several 6th dynasty royal seals and stone blocks - the latter of which were found within the funerary temple of Queen Ankhesenpepi II , the known mother of Pepi II - were discovered in the 1999/2000 excavation season at Saqqara which demonstrate that she also married Merenre after Pepi I 's death and became this king 's chief wife . Inscriptions on these stone blocks give Ankhesenpepi II the royal titles of : King 's Wife of the Pyramid of Pepy I , King 's Wife of the Pyramid of Merenre , King 's Mother of the Pyramid of Pepy II . Therefore , today , many Egyptologists believe that Pepi II was likely Merenre 's own son . Pepi II would , therefore , be Pepi I 's grandson while Merenre was , most likely , Pepi II 's father since he is known to have married Pepi II 's known mother , Queen Ankhesenpepi II . This would also conform well with the evidence from the South Saqqara Stone which shows no coregency between the reigns of Pepi I and Merenre thus making it far more likely that Pepi II was Merenre 's own son . Pepi II 's reign marked a sharp decline of the Old Kingdom . As the power of the nomarchs grew , the power of the pharaoh declined . With no dominant central power , local nobles began raiding each other 's territories and the Old Kingdom came to an end within mere decades after the close of Pepi II 's reign .",
  "/wiki/Bek_(sculptor)": "Bek or Bak ( Egyptian for Servant ) was the first chief royal sculptor during the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaten . His father Men held the same position under Akhenaten 's father Amenhotep III ; his mother Roi was a woman from Heliopolis . Bek grew up in Heliopolis , an important cult centre of the sun god Ra . The young prince Amenhotep ( who became the pharaoh Akhenaten ) had a palace here , and it is likely that his religious views were formed in part by the Heliopolitan teachings . Bek followed his lord to Akhet-Aten , the city founded by Akhenaten . He oversaw the construction of the great temple statues of the king and the opening of the Aswan and Gebel es-Silsila stone quarries , from where the stone was transported . A stela found in Aswan , made around the 9th regnal year of Akhenaten shows Men and his son Bek with the pharaohs they serve . On the right side Men stands before the statue of Amenhotep III . The statue is very likely to be one of the colossi of the pharaoh that was made by Men . This side of the stela reflects the traditional artistic style of the 18th dynasty , and the only indication of the Amarna period is that the name Amenhotep is left out , instead of it the pharaoh 's throne name Nebmaatre is repeated , in order to avoid having to mention the god Amun whose cult was forbidden . On the left side of the stela Bek is shown before Akhenaten , who makes offerings to his god Aten ; according to the inscription the depicted scene is set in the Great Temple of the Aten .

He is noted for abandoning traditional Egyptian polytheism and introducing worship centered on the Aten ( notably instead of Amun , the temples of which he destroyed , the name of whom he rubbed off and the priests of whom he left without resources ) , which is sometimes described as monolatristic , henotheistic , or even quasi-monotheistic . An early inscription likens the Aten to the sun as compared to stars , and later official language avoids calling the Aten a god , giving the solar deity a status above mere gods . Akhenaten tried to shift his culture from Egypt 's traditional religion , but the shifts were not widely accepted . After his death , his monuments were dismantled and hidden , his statues were destroyed , and his name excluded from the king lists . Traditional religious practice was gradually restored , and when some dozen years later rulers without clear rights of succession from the 18th Dynasty founded a new dynasty , they discredited Akhenaten and his immediate successors , referring to Akhenaten himself as the enemy or that criminal in archival records . The stele of Merneptah values Amun who is represented giving the cemetery of victory to him , and is written on the back of a stele of Akhenaten stolen from one of his temples in Karnak . He was all but lost from history until the discovery during the 19th century of the site of Akhetaten , the city he built and designed for the worship of Aten , at Amarna . Early excavations at Amarna by Flinders Petrie sparked interest in the enigmatic pharaoh , and a mummy found in the tomb KV55 , which was unearthed in 1907 in a dig led by Edward R. Ayrton , is likely that of Akhenaten . DNA analysis has determined that the man buried in KV55 is the father of King Tutankhamun , but its identification as Akhenaten has been questioned . Modern interest in Akhenaten and his queen Nefertiti comes partly from his connection with Tutankhamun ( even though Tutankhamun 's mother was not Nefertiti , but a woman named by archaeologists The Younger Lady ) , partly from the unique style and high quality of the pictorial arts he patronized , and partly from ongoing interest in the religion he attempted to establish .",
