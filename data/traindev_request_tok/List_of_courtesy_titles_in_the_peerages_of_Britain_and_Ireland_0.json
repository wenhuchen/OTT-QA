The Duke of Norfolk is , moreover , the Earl Marshal and Hereditary Marshal of England . The seat of the Duke of Norfolk is Arundel Castle in Sussex , although the title refers to the county of Norfolk . The current duke is Edward Fitzalan-Howard , 18th Duke of Norfolk . The dukes have historically been Catholic , a state of affairs known as recusancy in England . All past and present dukes have been descended from Edward I ( see Dukes of Norfolk family tree ) . The son of Thomas Howard , 3rd Duke of Norfolk , was Henry Howard , Earl of Surrey ; the earl was descended from both Edward I and Edward III .",
  "/wiki/Earl_of_Arundel": "Earl of Arundel is a title of nobility in England , and the oldest extant in the English peerage . It is currently held by the Duke of Norfolk , and is used ( along with the Earldom of Surrey ) by his heir apparent as a courtesy title . The earldom was created in 1138 or 1139 for the Norman baron William d'Aubigny . Its origin was the earlier grant by Henry I to his second wife Adeliza of the forfeited honour of Arundel , which included the castle and a large portion of Sussex . After his death she married William , who thus became master of the lands , and who from about the year 1141 is variously styled earl of Sussex , of Chichester , or of Arundel . His first known appearance as earl is at Christmas 1141 . Until the mid-13th century , the earls were also frequently known as Earl of Sussex , until this title fell into disuse . At about the same time , the earldom fell to the originally Breton FitzAlan Family , a younger branch of which went on to become the Stuart Family , which later ruled Scotland and England . A tradition arose that the holder of Arundel Castle should automatically be Earl of Arundel , and this was formally confirmed by King Henry VI . An Act of Parliament in 1627 confirmed this designation , and retrospectively applied the earldom to the Lords of Arundel , some authorities holding that the earldom stretched back to the reign of Richard I ( specifically 1189 ) . However , this designation was not always followed . Some of the Lords of Arundel were never addressed as earl during their lifetime , but nevertheless are counted and numbered as earls here .",
  "/wiki/Baron_Maltravers": "The title Baron Maltravers or Mautravers was created in the Peerage of England on 25 January and 23 October 1330 when John Maltravers was summoned to Parliament by writs directed Iohanni Mautravers Iuniori . The barony fell into abeyance among his granddaughters and coheirs , Joan and Eleanor , at his death on 16 February 1364 . At the death of Joan without issue , Eleanor became , according to modern doctrine , de jure Baroness Maltravers . The barony later became a subsidiary title of the Earl of Arundel and subsequently the Duke of Norfolk .",
  "/wiki/Duke_of_Somerset": "Duke of Somerset , from the county of Somerset , is a title that has been created five times in the peerage of England . It is particularly associated with two families : the Beauforts , who held the title from the creation of 1448 , and the Seymours , from the creation of 1547 , in whose name the title is still held . The present dukedom is unique , in that the first holder of the title created it for himself in his capacity of Lord Protector of the Kingdom of England , using a power granted in the will of his nephew King Edward VI . The only subsidiary title of the duke of Somerset is Baron Seymour , which is used as a courtesy title by the eldest son and heir of the duke . This courtesy title is the lowest in rank of all heirs to dukedoms in the peerages of the British Isles , yet the holder 's precedence is higher than his title suggests , by virtue of the seniority of the Dukedom of Somerset ( the only more senior non-royal duke is the Duke of Norfolk ) . Several other titles have been held by the dukes of Somerset , but have become extinct . These include : Earl of Kendal ( created 1443 , extinct 1444 ) , Earl of Somerset ( created 1397 , forfeit 1461 ) , Marquess of Dorset ( created 1397 , degraded 1399 ; created 1442 , forfeit 1461 ) , Marquess of Somerset ( created 1397 , degraded 1399 ) , Earl of Dorset ( created 1441 , forfeit 1461 ) , Viscount Rochester ( created 1611 , extinct 1645 ) , Viscount Beauchamp of Hache ( created 1536 , forfeit 1552 ) , Earl of Hertford ( created 1537 , forfeit 1552 ; and created 1559 , extinct 1750 ) , Marquess of Hertford ( created 1640 , extinct 1675 ) , Baron Seymour of Trowbridge ( created 1641 , extinct 1750 ) , Baron Percy ( created 1722 , separated 1750 ) , Baron Cockermouth ( created 1749 , separated 1750 ) , Earl of Egremont ( created 1749 , separated 1750 ) , and Earl St. Maur ( created 1863 , extinct 1885 ) .

On 2 July 1784 , the 4th Duke was created Earl of Norwich , in the County of Norfolk , and Baron Gordon , of Huntley in the County of Gloucester , in the Peerage of Great Britain . The principal family seat was Gordon Castle . The Dukedom became extinct in 1836 , along with all the titles created in 1684 and 1784 . Most of the Gordon estates passed to the son of the 5th Duke 's eldest sister , the 5th Duke of Richmond , whose main seat was Goodwood House in Sussex . In 1876 his son , the 6th Duke of Richmond and Lennox , was created Duke of Gordon , of Gordon Castle in Scotland , and Earl of Kinrara , in the County of Inverness . Thus , the Duke holds four dukedoms ( including the titular Aubigny-sur-N\u00e8re ; see Duke of Aubigny ) , more than any other person in the realm . Aubigny is in the defunct Peerage of France and the central arms of the Duke are based on the original Jacobean ones for the Union of the Crowns , with the inherited but inactive English claims to the French throne also represented prominently .",
  "/wiki/Earl_of_March": "Earl of March is a title that has been created several times in the Peerage of Scotland and the Peerage of England . The title derived from the marches or borderlands between England and either Wales ( Welsh Marches ) or Scotland ( Scottish Marches ) , and it was held by several great feudal families which owned lands in those districts . Later , however , the title came to be granted as an honorary dignity , and ceased to carry any associated power in the marches . The Scottish earldom is extant in its own right , and it is held by James Charteris , 13th Earl of Wemyss and 9th Earl of March . The English earldom is today the main non-ducal subsidiary title of the Duke of Richmond . The current duke 's eldest son , named Charles like his father , enjoys it as a courtesy title .",
  "/wiki/Duke_of_Grafton": "Duke of Grafton is a title in the Peerage of England . It was created in 1675 by Charles II of England for Henry FitzRoy , his second illegitimate son by the Duchess of Cleveland . The most famous duke was probably Augustus FitzRoy , 3rd Duke of Grafton , who served as prime minister in the 1760s . The duke of Grafton holds three subsidiary titles , all created in 1675 in the peerage of England : Earl of Euston , Viscount Ipswich , and Baron Sudbury . Between 1723 and 1936 the dukes , being descended from the 1st Duke 's wife Isabella FitzRoy , 2nd Countess of Arlington , also held the titles Earl of Arlington , Viscount Thetford and Baron Arlington . Those titles fell into abeyance between the 9th Duke 's sisters , with the abeyance of the barony of Arlington being ended in 1999 . The title of the dukedom refers to the Honour of Grafton in the southeast of Northamptonshire , the titular village now being called Grafton Regis .

  "/wiki/Duke_of_Beaufort": "Duke of Beaufort , a title in the Peerage of England , was created by Charles II in 1682 for Henry Somerset , 3rd Marquess of Worcester , a descendant of Charles Somerset , 1st Earl of Worcester , legitimized son of Henry Beaufort , 3rd Duke of Somerset , a Lancastrian leader in the Wars of the Roses . The name Beaufort refers to a castle in Champagne , France ( now Montmorency-Beaufort ) . It is the only current dukedom to take its name from a place outside the British Isles . [ citation needed ] The Dukes of Beaufort descend in the male line from the House of Plantagenet through John of Gaunt , son of Edward III . This statement was challenged after the analysis of the Y chromosomal DNA of the remains of Richard III . Most living male heirs of the 5th Duke of Beaufort were found to carry a relatively common Y chromosome type , which is different from the rare lineage found in Richard III 's remains . The instance of false paternity could have occurred anywhere in the numerous generations separating Richard III from the 5th Duke of Beaufort . The break also could have occurred with Richard III 's grandfather Richard of Conisburgh , whose paternity has been called into question although he was acknowledged by his father . The Beaufort Castle was in possession of John of Gaunt , and the surname Beaufort was given to Gaunt 's four legitimised children by his mistress and third wife , Katherine Swynford . This was the foundation of the House of Beaufort , Dukes of Somerset . A descendant of the Beauforts through his mother was Henry VII of England . Charles Somerset , 1st Earl of Worcester , KG ( c. 1460 - 15 March 1526 ) , was the bastard son of Henry Beaufort , 3rd Duke of Somerset by his mistress Joan Hill .",

In 1810 , the 3rd Duke of Buccleuch inherited the Dukedom of Queensberry , also in the Peerage of Scotland , thus separating that title from the Marquessate of Queensberry .
