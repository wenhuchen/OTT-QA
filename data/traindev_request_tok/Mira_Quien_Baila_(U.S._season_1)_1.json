  "/wiki/Puerto_Rico": "Puerto Rico [ a ] ( Spanish for Rich Port ; abbreviated PR ) , officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ( Spanish : Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico , lit . Free Associated State of Puerto Rico ) [ b ] and briefly called Porto Rico , [ c ] is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea , approximately 1,000 miles ( 1,600 km ) southeast of Miami , Florida . An archipelago among the Greater Antilles , located between the Dominican Republic and the US Virgin Islands , Puerto Rico includes the eponymous main island and several smaller islands , such as Mona , Culebra , and Vieques . The capital and most populous city is San Juan . The territory 's total population is approximately 3.4 million , more than 21 U.S. states . Spanish and English are the official languages of the executive branch of government , though Spanish predominates . Originally populated by the indigenous Ta\u00edno people , Puerto Rico was colonized by Spain following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493 . It was contested by the French , Dutch , and British , but remained a Spanish possession for the next four centuries . The island 's cultural and demographic landscapes were shaped by the displacement and assimilation of the native population , the forced migration of African slaves , and settlement from the Canary Islands and Andalusia . In the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategic role compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain . Spain 's distant administrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century , producing a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined indigenous , African , and European elements . On September 23 , 1868 , Ram\u00f3n Emeterio Betances unleashed a revolt against Spanish rule , declaring for the first time the idea of Puerto Ricans as a distinct people , with right to sovereignty .",

Known for his quickness in the ring and flamboyant style , Camacho competed professionally from 1980 to 2010 , and was a world champion in three weight classes . He held the WBC super featherweight title from 1983 to 1984 , the WBC lightweight title from 1985 to 1987 , and the WBO junior welterweight title twice between 1989 and 1992 . In a storied amateur career , Camacho won three New York Golden Gloves tournaments , beginning with the Sub-Novice 112 lbs championship in 1978 . During his professional career , Camacho had many notable fights against some of the biggest names in boxing , defeating Roberto Dur\u00e1n twice late in Duran 's career , and knocking out Sugar Ray Leonard to send him into permanent retirement . He also fought Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez , F\u00e9lix Trinidad , and Oscar De La Hoya , among others . During his later years , Camacho expanded his popular role and appeared on a variety of Spanish-language reality television shows including Univision 's ' dancing show Mira Quien Baila and a weekly segment on the popular show El Gordo y La Flaca , named Macho News . However , he also had much-publicized troubles with drug abuse and criminal charges . In 2005 , Camacho was arrested for burglary , a charge to which he would later plead guilty . In 2011 he was shot at three times by would-be carjackers in San Juan , but was uninjured . In late 2012 , Camacho was awaiting trial in Florida on charges of physical abuse of one of his sons . On November 20 , 2012 , Camacho was shot and seriously wounded while sitting in a car outside a bar in his native Bayam\u00f3n ; the driver , a childhood friend , was killed in the shooting .",
  "/wiki/Boxing": "Boxing is a combat sport in which two people , usually wearing protective gloves , throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring . Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a standard fixture in most international games - it also has its own World Championships . Boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds . A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing , disqualification of an opponent , or resignation of an opponent . When the fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing , the judges ' scorecards determine the victor . In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges , professional bouts are considered a draw . In Olympic boxing , because a winner must be declared , judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria . While humans have fought in hand-to-hand combat since the dawn of human history , the earliest evidence of fist-fighting sporting contests date back to the ancient Near East in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC . The earliest evidence of boxing rules date back to Ancient Greece , where boxing was established as an Olympic game in 688 BC . Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights , largely in Great Britain , to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules .",

Pre-Columbian Mexico dates to about 8000 BC and is identified as one of six cradles of civilization and was home to many advanced Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Olmec , Toltec , Teotihuacan , Zapotec , Maya , and Aztec before first contact with Europeans . In 1521 , the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the territory from its politically powerful base in Mexico-Tenochtitlan ( part of Mexico City ) , which was administered as the viceroyalty of New Spain . The Roman Catholic Church played a powerful role in governing the country as millions were converted to the faith , although King Charles III expelled the Jesuits in the 1770s . The territory became a nation state following its recognition in 1821 after the Mexican War of Independence . The post-independence period was tumultuous , characterized by economic inequality and many contrasting political changes .",

Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea , Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean meet . It is east of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula ( Mexico ) , south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas , west of Haiti and north of both Jamaica and the Cayman Islands .

The territory that is now Cuba was inhabited by the Ciboney Ta\u00edno people from the 4th millennium BC until Spanish colonization in the 15th century . From the 15th century , it was a colony of Spain until the Spanish-American War of 1898 , when Cuba was occupied by the United States and gained nominal independence as a de facto United States protectorate in 1902 . As a fragile republic , in 1940 Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system , but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in a coup and subsequent dictatorship under Fulgencio Batista in 1952 . Open corruption and oppression under Batista 's rule led to his ousting in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement , which afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro . Since 1965 , the state has been governed by the Communist Party of Cuba . The country was a point of contention during the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States , and a nuclear war nearly broke out during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 .",

  "/wiki/Domestic_violence": "Domestic violence ( also named domestic abuse or family violence ) is violence or other abuse in a domestic setting , such as in marriage or cohabitation . Domestic violence may be used as a synonym for intimate partner violence , which is committed by a spouse or partner in an intimate relationship against the other spouse or partner , and can take place in heterosexual or same-sex relationships , or between former spouses or partners . In the broadest sense , domestic violence can also involve violence against children , parents , or the elderly . It takes a number of forms , including physical , verbal , emotional , economic , religious , reproductive , and sexual abuse , which can range from subtle , coercive forms to marital rape and to violent physical abuse such as choking , beating , female genital mutilation , and acid throwing that results in disfigurement or death . Domestic murders include stoning , bride burning , honor killings , and dowry deaths ( which sometimes involve non-cohabitating family members ) . Globally , the victims of domestic violence are overwhelmingly women , and women tend to experience more severe forms of violence . They are also likelier than men to use intimate partner violence in self-defense . In some countries , domestic violence is often seen as justified , particularly in cases of actual or suspected infidelity on the part of the woman , and is legally permitted . Research has established that there exists a direct and significant correlation between a country 's level of gender equality and rates of domestic violence , where countries with less gender equality experience higher rates of domestic violence . Domestic violence is among the most underreported crimes worldwide for both men and women . Due to social stigmas regarding male victimization , men who are victims of domestic violence face an increased likelihood of being overlooked by healthcare providers . Domestic violence often occurs when the abuser believes that abuse is an entitlement , acceptable , justified , or unlikely to be reported .",

Montevideo was founded as a military stronghold by the Spanish in the early 18th century , signifying the competing claims over the region . Uruguay won its independence between 1811 and 1828 , following a four-way struggle between Portugal and Spain , and later Argentina and Brazil . It remained subject to foreign influence and intervention throughout the 19th century , with the military playing a recurring role in domestic politics . A series of economic crises put an end to a democratic period that had begun in the early 20th century , culminating in a 1973 coup , which established a civic-military dictatorship . The military government persecuted leftists , socialists , and political opponents , resulting in several deaths and numerous instances of torture by the military ; the military relinquished power to a civilian government in 1985 . Uruguay is today a democratic constitutional republic , with a president who serves as both head of state and head of government . Uruguay is ranked first in Latin America in democracy , peace , low perception of corruption , e-government , and is first in South America when it comes to press freedom , size of the middle class and prosperity .",
