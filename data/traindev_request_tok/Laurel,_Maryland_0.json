  "/wiki/Avondale_Mill": "The Avondale Mill was a large gable-front stone structure , three stories in height , and 10 bays long by three wide . It was located on the bank of the Patuxent River in the city of Laurel , Prince George 's County , Maryland . It was constructed in 1844-1845 for Captain William Mason & Son of Baltimore . It was complemented by the neighboring Laurel Mill built in 1811 S.D . Heath 's machine shop and Richard Israel 's flouring mill . At that time it was provided with the machinery for the manufacture of fine cloth , running as many as 1,500 cotton spindles with 150 employees . In 1845 , industrialist Peter Gorman was responsible for the first macadamized ( paved ) road in Laurel , Avondale Street next to the new Mill . The mill was sold for $ 10,000 with a $ 13,000 ground rent in 1850 to S.P . Heath and James Arthur ( Webb Heath & Co. ) . In the mid-1850s , it was converted to a gristmill . The waters of the Patuxent provided an 8-9 foot fall and gave the mill 60-70 horsepower to use , along with steam power fueled by coal from Cumberland as early as 1854 . George William Brown purchased the 21.7 acre property and outbuildings from Benjamin F. Crabbs , but sold his holdings in a mortgage auction on 20 October 1897 .",
  "/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places": "The National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) is the United States federal government 's official list of districts , sites , buildings , structures and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their historical significance . A property listed in the National Register , or located within a National Register Historic District , may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred in preserving the property . The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act ( NHPA ) in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it . Of the more than one million properties on the National Register , 80,000 are listed individually . The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts . For most of its history , the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service ( NPS ) , an agency within the United States Department of the Interior . Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups , such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation , as well as coordinate , identify and protect historic sites in the United States . While National Register listings are mostly symbolic , their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties . Protection of the property is not guaranteed . During the nomination process , the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places . The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation , as well as the public and politicians . Occasionally , historic sites outside the country proper , but associated with the United States ( such as the American Embassy in Tangiers ) are also listed .",
  "/wiki/Duvall_Bridge_(Laurel,_Maryland)": "Duvall Bridge is an historic single-lane bridge over the Patuxent River near Laurel , Maryland . A bridge has been located on this site since the mid-18th century although the current bridge is estimated to have been constructed circa 1907 .

The Duvall family had arrived in Anne Arundel County with arrival of Mareen Duvall in 1650 . Mareen Duvall 's Middle Plantation is downriver on the same path , now called Davidsonville Road . The Steel bridge was constructed in 1907 . The bridge provided water crossing for the main Baltimore-Washington telegraph lines following telegraph road . In 1936 , the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center was created on the land , and the bridge was transferred to the federal government in 1941 . A plaque was installed in 1966 by the Duvall society . The bridge was condemned in 1977 after flooding . The bridge was rehabilitated in 2012 and serves as a connection between the central tract and north tract of Patuxent Research Refuge . Although a common bridge type , Duvall Bridge is one of only two surviving truss bridges in Prince George 's County , along with Governor 's Bridge .",

  "/wiki/Pratt_truss": "A truss bridge is a bridge whose load-bearing superstructure is composed of a truss , a structure of connected elements usually forming triangular units . The connected elements ( typically straight ) may be stressed from tension , compression , or sometimes both in response to dynamic loads . The basic types of truss bridges shown in this article have simple designs which could be easily analyzed by 19th and early 20th-century engineers . A truss bridge is economical to construct because it uses materials efficiently .",

  "/wiki/Baltimore_and_Ohio_Railroad": "The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ( reporting marks B & O , BO ) was the first common carrier railroad and the oldest railroad in the United States , with its first section opening in 1830 . Merchants from the city of Baltimore , which had benefitted to some extent from the construction of the National Road early in the century , wanted to continue to compete for trade with trans-Appalachian settlers with the newly constructed Erie Canal ( which served New York City ) , another canal being proposed by Pennsylvania ( which would have connected Philadelphia and Pittsburgh ) , the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal ( which connected to the nation 's capital , Washington , D.C. ) , and the James River Canal , which directed traffic toward Richmond and Norfolk , Virginia . At first the B & O was located entirely in the state of Maryland , its original line extending from the port of Baltimore west to Sandy Hook . Because of competition with the C & O canal for trade with coal fields in western Maryland , it could not use the C & O right of way . Thus , to continue westward while minimizing high-cost track through the Appalachian Mountains , the B & O chose to cross the Potomac River into Virginia ( now West Virginia ) , near the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers . From there track continued through Virginia from Harpers Ferry to a point just west of the junction of Patterson Creek and the North Branch Potomac River , where it crossed back into Maryland to reach Cumberland , the terminus of the National Road . From there the B & O extended to the Ohio River at Wheeling and a few years later also to Parkersburg , West Virginia ( below rapids which made navigation difficult during parts of the year ) . It proved crucial to Union success during the American Civil War , although the conflict also caused considerable damage ( and repair costs ) . After the war 's end , the B & O consolidated several feeder lines in Virginia and West Virginia , as well as expanded westward into Ohio ( including a junction at Portsmouth ) , Indiana and Illinois . B & O advertising later carried the motto : Linking 13 Great States with the Nation . After several mergers , the B & O became part of the CSX Transportation ( CSX ) network . The B & O also includes the Leiper Railroad , the first permanent horse-drawn railroad in the U.S. At the end of 1970 , the B & O operated 5,552 miles of road and 10,449 miles of track , not including the Staten Island Rapid Transit ( SIRT ) or the Reading and its subsidiaries .",
