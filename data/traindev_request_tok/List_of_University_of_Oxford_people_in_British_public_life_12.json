He is one of only three people to be awarded a Victoria Cross twice . The Battle of Guillemont was to see acts of heroism by Captain Chavasse , the only man to be awarded the Victoria Cross twice during the First World War . In 1916 , Chavasse was hit by shell splinters while rescuing men in no-man 's land . It is said he got as close as 25 yards to the German line , where he found three men and continued throughout the night under a constant rain of sniper bullets and bombing . He performed similar heroics in the early stages of the offensive at Passchendaele in August 1917 to gain a second VC and become the most highly decorated British officer of the First World War . Although operated upon , he was to die of his wounds two days later in 1917 .",
  "/wiki/Victoria_Cross": "The Victoria Cross ( VC ) is the highest and most prestigious award of the British honours system . It is awarded for valour in the presence of the enemy to members of the British Armed Forces . It may be awarded posthumously . It was previously awarded to Commonwealth countries , most of which have established their own honours systems and no longer recommend British honours . It may be awarded to a person of any military rank in any service and to civilians under military command although no civilian has received the award since 1879 . Since the first awards were presented by Queen Victoria in 1857 , two-thirds of all awards have been personally presented by the British monarch . These investitures are usually held at Buckingham Palace . The VC was introduced on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to honour acts of valour during the Crimean War . Since then , the medal has been awarded 1,358 times to 1,355 individual recipients . Only 15 medals , of which 11 were to members of the British Army and four were to members of the Australian Army , have been awarded since the Second World War . The traditional explanation of the source of the metal from which the medals are struck is that it derives from Russian cannon captured at the Siege of Sevastopol . However , research has suggested another origin for the material .",
  "/wiki/Medal_bar": "A medal bar or medal clasp is a thin metal bar attached to the ribbon of a military decoration , civil decoration , or other medal . It most commonly indicates the campaign or operation the recipient received the award for , and multiple bars on the same medal are used to indicate that the recipient has met the criteria for receiving the medal in multiple theatres . When used in conjunction with decorations for exceptional service , such as gallantry medals , the term and bar means that the award has been bestowed multiple times . In the example , Group Captain Leonard Cheshire , VC , OM , DSO and two bars , DFC , DSO and two bars means that the Distinguished Service Order was awarded on three separate occasions . A British convention is to indicate bars by the use of asterisks ; thus , DSO** would denote a DSO and two bars . Bars are also used on long-service medals to indicate the length of service rendered . The two terms are used because terms bar and clasp both refer to two parts of the medal ; the indicator discussed in this article , and the part of the medal connected to the ribbon .",

  "/wiki/World_War_I": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",
  "/wiki/Olympic_Games": "The modern Olympic Games or Olympics ( French : Jeux olympiques ) are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions . The Olympic Games are considered the world 's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating . The Olympic Games are held every four years , with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart . Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games ( Ancient Greek : \u1f48\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u1f08\u03b3\u1ff6\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 ) , which were held in Olympia , Greece , from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD . Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) in 1894 , leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896 . The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement , with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority . The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games . Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports , the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability , the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18 , the five Continental games ( Pan American , African , Asian , European , and Pacific ) , and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games . The Deaflympics and Special Olympics are also endorsed by the IOC . The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic , political , and technological advancements . The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism , as envisioned by Coubertin , to allowing participation of professional athletes . The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games .",
  "/wiki/Medical_Doctor": "A physician ( American English ) , medical practitioner ( Commonwealth English ) , medical doctor , or simply doctor , is a professional who practises medicine , which is concerned with promoting , maintaining , or restoring health through the study , diagnosis , prognosis and treatment of disease , injury , and other physical and mental impairments . Physicians may focus their practice on certain disease categories , types of patients , and methods of treatment - known as specialities - or they may assume responsibility for the provision of continuing and comprehensive medical care to individuals , families , and communities - known as general practice . Medical practice properly requires both a detailed knowledge of the academic disciplines , such as anatomy and physiology , underlying diseases and their treatment - the science of medicine - and also a decent competence in its applied practice - the art or craft of medicine . Both the role of the physician and the meaning of the word itself vary around the world . Degrees and other qualifications vary widely , but there are some common elements , such as medical ethics requiring that physicians show consideration , compassion , and benevolence for their patients .",

  "/wiki/Merton_College,_Oxford": "Merton College ( in full : The House or College of Scholars of Merton in the University of Oxford ) is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in England . Its foundation can be traced back to the 1260s when Walter de Merton , chancellor to Henry III and later to Edward I , first drew up statutes for an independent academic community and established endowments to support it . An important feature of Walter 's foundation was that this college was to be self-governing and the endowments were directly vested in the Warden and Fellows . By 1274 , when Walter retired from royal service and made his final revisions to the college statutes , the community was consolidated at its present site in the south east corner of the city of Oxford , and a rapid programme of building commenced . The hall and the chapel and the rest of the front quad were complete before the end of the 13th century . Mob Quad , one of Merton 's quadrangles , was constructed between 1288 and 1378 , and is claimed to be the oldest quadrangle in Oxford , while Merton College Library , located in Mob Quad and dating from 1373 , is the oldest continuously functioning library for university academics and students in the world . Like many of Oxford 's colleges , Merton admitted its first mixed-sex cohort in 1979 , after over seven centuries as an institution for men only . Notable alumni and academics past and present include four Nobel laureates and writer J. R. R. Tolkien who was Merton Professor of English Language and Literature from 1945 to 1959 .
