  "/wiki/Babas\u00f3nicos": "Babas\u00f3nicos is an Argentine rock band , formed in the early 1990s along with others such as Peligrosos Gorriones and Los Brujos . After emerging in the wave of Argentine New Rock bands of the late 1980s and early 1990s , Babasonicos became one of the banner groups of the sonic underground rock movement in Argentina in the late 1990s . The band name refers partly to Sai Baba , the Indian guru , and partly to The Jetsons , whose Spanish version is called Los Supers\u00f3nicos . The lead singer Adri\u00e1n D\u00e1rgelos Rodr\u00edguez and the keyboardist Diego Uma-T Tu\u00f1\u00f3n initially decided to create a new wave style , which would n't follow the established Argentine music . The other official band members are : Diego Uma Rodr\u00edguez ( guitarist and lead singer ) , Diego Panza Castellano ( drummer ) , Mariano Roger Dom\u00ednguez ( guitarist ) , and recently deceased Gabriel Gabo Manelli ( bassist ) . For their second album , Trance Zomba ( 1994 ) , they incorporated a guest DJ , DJ Peggyn who would eventually remain as a band member until after releasing Miami ( 1999 ) . This same year the band saw the departure of their longtime manager Cosme . In 1999 , they collaborated with Ian Brown on a song that bears their name on his album Golden Greats . Although the band has never been afraid to experiment with various diverse styles throughout their career , since they recorded Jessico ( 2001 ) their songs have become simpler and more in tune with current trends in music . Some believe this to be a contradiction with their original tenets , and that Babasonicos has turned into a mainstream marketable band . Their following records , Infame ( 2003 ) , Anoche ( 2005 ) , Mucho ( 2008 ) , and A Prop\u00f3sito ( 2011 ) are proof that they have reached a broader audience . Babasonicos also composed the soundtrack for Vera Fogwill 's movie Las Mantenidas Sin Sue\u00f1os ( Kept and Dreamless ) , which was released in 2007 .",
