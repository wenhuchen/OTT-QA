  "/wiki/Millers_Dale_railway_station": "Millers Dale railway station was situated in Millers Dale in the Peak District . It was built in 1863 by the Midland Railway on its extension of the Manchester , Buxton , Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway from Rowsley . It served an important junction where passengers for Buxton joined or left the trains between London and Manchester . It was originally to be called Blackwell Mill but , in the end , was named Millers Dale for Tideswell . For such a rural location , it was unusually large ; indeed , it was one of the largest stations on the line , and was one of the few stations in England to have a post office on the platform . Millers Dale also sent dairy , agricultural and quarried products from the surrounding areas to the major cities . While also serving local towns and villages - notably Tideswell , Taddington and Wormhill - much of its activity was concerned with the connecting service to and from Buxton . Traffic for Buxton actually followed the main line north for nearly two miles , before diverging at Millers Dale Junction , beside Blackwell Mill Halt . Changing at Millers Dale often involved a wait , and the High Peak News of November 1900 referred to the station as Patience Junction . The station was later immortalised in the 1964 song Slow Train by Flanders and Swann . The station closed in 1967 but trains continued to pass through the station until 1968 when the line was closed .",

  "/wiki/North_Staffordshire_Railway": "The North Staffordshire Railway ( NSR ) was a British railway company formed in 1845 to promote a number of lines in the Staffordshire Potteries and surrounding areas in Staffordshire , Cheshire , Derbyshire and Shropshire . The company was based in Stoke-on-Trent and was nicknamed The Knotty ; its lines were built to the standard gauge of 4 ft 8 1\u20442 in ( 1,435 mm ) . The main routes were constructed between 1846 and 1852 and ran from Macclesfield to Norton Bridge , just north of Stafford , and from Crewe to Egginton Junction , west of Derby . Within these main connections with other railway companies , most notably the London and North Western Railway ( LNWR ) , the company operated a network of smaller lines although the total route mileage of the company never exceeded 221 miles ( 355.7 km ) . The majority of the passenger traffic was local although a number of LNWR services from Manchester to London were operated via Stoke . Freight traffic was mostly coal and other minerals but the line also carried the vast majority of china and other pottery goods manufactured in England . As the NSR was surrounded by other larger railway companies , there were in the 19th century several attempts emanating from other companies or proposals from NSR shareholders to amalgamate with one or more of the other companies that adjoined it . None of these came to fruition and the NSR remained an independent company up to 1923 when it became part of the London , Midland and Scottish Railway Company .",

It also had many routes connecting towns in Hampshire and Berkshire , including Portsmouth and Reading . In the grouping of railways in 1923 the LSWR amalgamated with other railways to create the Southern Railway . Among significant achievements of the LSWR were the electrification of suburban lines , the introduction of power signalling , the development of Southampton Docks , the rebuilding of London Waterloo station as one of the great stations of the world , and the handling of the massive traffic involved in the First World War . Spreading car ownership led to a rapid decline of passenger traffic in Devon and Cornwall from about 1960 to the end of that decade so short mid-distance-from-London branches and the remote peninsular sections of route closed under the Beeching Report , except the line to Penzance from Exeter which had since the very outset been the main preserve of the Great Western Railway , chiefly due to that company 's initial laying of track there and doing so on broad gauge and encouraging Devon and Cornish companies to do so under the 'Gauge War ' .",

  "/wiki/Great_Northern_Railway_(Great_Britain)": "The Great Northern Railway ( GNR ) was a British railway company incorporated in 1846 with the object of building a line from London to York .

In doing so it overextended itself financially . Nevertheless , it succeeded in reaching into the coalfields of Nottinghamshire , Derbyshire and Yorkshire , as well as establishing dominance in Lincolnshire and North London . Bringing coal south to London was dominant , but general agricultural business and short and long distance passenger traffic were important activities . Its fast passenger express trains captured the public imagination , and its Chief Mechanical Engineer Nigel Gresley became a celebrity . Anglo-Scottish travel on the East Coast Main Line became commercially important ; the GNR controlled the line from London to Doncaster and allied itself with the North Eastern Railway and the North British Railway so as to offer seamless travel facilities . The main line railways of Great Britain were grouped following the Railways Act 1921 into one or other of four new larger concerns . The Great Northern Railway was a constituent of the London and North Eastern Railway , which took control at the beginning of 1923 .

The GWR was the only company to keep its identity through the Railways Act 1921 , which amalgamated it with the remaining independent railways within its territory , and it was finally merged at the end of 1947 when it was nationalised and became the Western Region of British Railways . The GWR was called by some God 's Wonderful Railway and by others the Great Way Round but it was famed as the Holiday Line , taking many people to English and Bristol Channel resorts in the West Country as well as the far southwest of England such as Torquay in Devon , Minehead in Somerset , and Newquay and St Ives in Cornwall .
