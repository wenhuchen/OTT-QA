Founded in the first century by Saints Peter and Paul , by virtue of Petrine and papal primacy according to Catholic tradition , it is the focal point of full communion for Catholic Christians around the world . As a sovereign entity , the Holy See is headquartered in , operates from , and exercises exclusive dominion over the independent Vatican City State enclave in Rome , of which the pope is sovereign . It is organized into polities of the Latin Church and the 23 Eastern Catholic Churches , and their dioceses and religious institutes . The Holy See is administered by the Roman Curia ( Latin for Roman Court ) , which is the central government of the Catholic Church . The Roman Curia includes various dicasteries , comparable to ministries and executive departments , with the Cardinal Secretary of State as its chief administrator . Papal elections are carried out by the College of Cardinals . Although the Holy See is sometimes metonymically referred to as the Vatican , the Vatican City State was distinctively established with the Lateran Treaty of 1929 , between the Holy See and Italy , to ensure the temporal , diplomatic , and spiritual independence of the papacy . [ citation needed ] As such , papal nuncios , who are papal diplomats to states and international organizations , are recognized as representing the Holy See not the Vatican City State , as prescribed in the Canon law of the Catholic Church ; and therefore the integrity of the Catholic Church along with its 1.3 billion members .

[ A ] In the United States , the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJIA ) fell exactly 508 points ( 22.6% ) . This was the largest one-day percentage drop in history .

The S & P 500 and Wilshire 5000 indices each declined more than 18 percent , and the S & P 500 futures contract declined 29 percent . Total trading volume was so large that the computer and communications systems in place at the time were overwhelmed , leaving orders unfilled for an hour or more . Large funds transfers were delayed for hours and the Fedwire and NYSE DOT systems shut down for extended periods of time , further compounding traders ' confusion .

Parody may be found in art or culture , including literature , music ( although parody in music has an earlier , somewhat different meaning than for other art forms ) , animation , gaming , and film . The writer and critic John Gross observes in his Oxford Book of Parodies , that parody seems to flourish on territory somewhere between pastiche ( a composition in another artist 's manner , without satirical intent ) and burlesque ( which fools around with the material of high literature and adapts it to low ends ) . Meanwhile , the Encyclop\u00e9die of Denis Diderot distinguishes between the parody and the burlesque , A good parody is a fine amusement , capable of amusing and instructing the most sensible and polished minds ; the burlesque is a miserable buffoonery which can only please the populace . Historically , when a formula grows tired , as in the case of the moralistic melodramas in the 1910s , it retains value only as a parody , as demonstrated by the Buster Keaton shorts that mocked that genre .",

  "/wiki/Basketball": "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams , most commonly of five players each , opposing one another on a rectangular court , compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball ( approximately 9.4 inches ( 24 cm ) in diameter ) through the defender 's hoop ( a basket 18 inches ( 46 cm ) in diameter mounted 10 feet ( 3.048 m ) high to a backboard at each end of the court ) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop . A field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three-point line , when it is worth three . After a foul , timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws . The team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated . Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running ( dribbling ) or by passing it to a teammate , both of which require considerable skill . On offense , players may use a variety of shots - the lay-up , the jump shot , or a dunk ; on defense , they may steal the ball from a dribbler , intercept passes , or block shots ; either offense or defense may collect a rebound , that is , a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard . It is a violation to lift or drag one 's pivot foot without dribbling the ball , to carry it , or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling . The five players on each side at a time fall into five playing positions the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach 's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) . Informally , players may play three-on-three , two-on-two , and one-on-one .

  "/wiki/Vegetables": "Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food . The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter , including the flowers , fruits , stems , leaves , roots , and seeds . The alternate definition of the term vegetable is applied somewhat arbitrarily , often by culinary and cultural tradition . It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits , flowers , nuts , and cereal grains , but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes , flowers such as broccoli , and seeds such as pulses . Originally , vegetables were collected from the wild by hunter-gatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world , probably during the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC , when a new agricultural way of life developed . At first , plants which grew locally would have been cultivated , but as time went on , trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types . Nowadays , most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits , and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations . China is the largest producer of vegetables , and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries . The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food , to agribusinesses with vast acreages of single-product crops . Depending on the type of vegetable concerned , harvesting the crop is followed by grading , storing , processing , and marketing . Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition , being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates , but high in vitamins , minerals and dietary fiber . Many nutritionists encourage people to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables , five or more portions a day often being recommended .",
  "/wiki/Squid": "Squid are cephalopods in the superorder Decapodiformes with elongated bodies , large eyes , eight arms and two tentacles . Like all other cephalopods , squid have a distinct head , bilateral symmetry , and a mantle . They are mainly soft-bodied , like octopuses , but have a small internal skeleton in the form of a rod-like gladius or pen , made of chitin . Squid diverged from other cephalopods during the Jurassic and occupy a similar role to teleost fish as open water predators of similar size and behaviour . They play an important role in the open water food web . The two long tentacles are used to grab prey and the eight arms to hold and control it . The beak then cuts the food into suitable size chunks for swallowing . Squid are rapid swimmers , moving by jet propulsion , and largely locate their prey by sight . They are among the most intelligent of invertebrates , with groups of Humboldt squid having been observed hunting cooperatively . They are preyed on by sharks , other fish , sea birds , seals and cetaceans , particularly sperm whales . Squid can change colour for camouflage and signalling . Some species are bioluminescent , using their light for counter-illumination camouflage , while many species can eject a cloud of ink to distract predators .",

The objective of the defensive team ( fielding team ) is to prevent batters from becoming runners , and to prevent runners ' advance around the bases . A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate ( the place where the player started as a batter ) . The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner . The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely . A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called out can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner , either immediately or during teammates ' turns batting . The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners out , which forces them out of the field of play . Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team 's players out . The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding ; the batting team 's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs .

Following the culmination of Star Trek : Deep Space Nine and with Star Trek : Voyager scheduled to end , UPN asked Braga and Berman to devise a new series to continue the franchise . Rather than setting it in the 24th century alongside Deep Space Nine and Voyager , the duo decided to set Enterprise in an earlier period , allowing them to explore new parts of the Star Trek fictional universe . Wanting a more basic , relatable , and character-driven series , Berman and Braga concentrated the episodes around a core trio of characters : Captain Jonathan Archer ( Scott Bakula ) , Commander Charles Trip Tucker III ( Connor Trinneer ) and Sub-commander T'Pol ( Jolene Blalock ) . The show broke with Star Trek convention in several respects : in addition to dropping the Star Trek prefix , Enterprise used the pop-influenced song Where My Heart Will Take Me ( performed by Russell Watson ) as its theme .

  "/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina": "Hurricane Katrina was the most destructive tropical cyclone on record , tied with Hurricane Harvey in 2017 , causing $ 125 billion in damage , particularly in the city of New Orleans and the surrounding areas , and over 1,200 deaths . The storm was the third major hurricane of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season , and the fourth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record to make landfall in the contiguous United States , behind only the 1935 Labor Day hurricane , Hurricane Camille in 1969 , and Hurricane Michael in 2018 . Katrina originated on August 23 , 2005 as a tropical depression from the merger of a tropical wave and the remnants of Tropical Depression Ten . Early the following day , the depression intensified into a tropical storm as it headed generally westward toward Florida , strengthening into a hurricane two hours before making landfall at Hallandale Beach on August 25 . After briefly weakening to tropical storm strength over southern Florida , Katrina emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on August 26 and began to rapidly intensify . The storm strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico before weakening to Category 3 strength at its second landfall on August 29 over southeast Louisiana and Mississippi . Over fifty breaches in surge protection levees surrounding the city of New Orleans , Louisiana caused of the majority of the death and destruction during Katrina . Eventually , 80% of the city , as well as large tracts of neighboring parishes , were inundated for weeks . The flooding also destroyed most of New Orleans ' transportation and communication facilities , leaving tens of thousands of people who had not evacuated the city prior to landfall stranded with little access to food , shelter or basic necessities . The scale of the disaster in New Orleans provoked massive national and international response efforts ; federal , local and private rescue operations evacuated displaced persons out of the city over the following weeks . Multiple investigations in the aftermath of the storm concluded that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , which had designed and built the region 's levees decades earlier , was responsible for the failure of the flood-control systems , though federal courts later ruled that the Corps could not be held financially liable because of sovereign immunity in the Flood Control Act of 1928 . The emergency response from federal , state and local governments was widely criticized , resulting in the resignations of Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) director Michael D. Brown and New Orleans Police Department ( NOPD ) Superintendent Eddie Compass .",

  "/wiki/Animal_welfare": "Animal welfare is the well-being of nonhuman animals . The standards of good animal welfare vary considerably between different contexts . These standards are under constant review and are debated , created and revised by animal welfare groups , legislators , and academics worldwide . Animal welfare science uses various measures , such as longevity , disease , immunosuppression , behavior , physiology , and reproduction , although there is debate about which of these indicators provide the best information . Respect for animal welfare is often based on the belief that nonhuman animals are sentient and that consideration should be given to their well-being or suffering , especially when they are under the care of humans . These concerns can include how animals are slaughtered for food , how they are used in scientific research , how they are kept ( as pets , in zoos , farms , circuses , etc . ) , and how human activities affect the welfare and survival of wild species . There are two forms of criticism of the concept of animal welfare , coming from diametrically opposite positions . One view , held by some thinkers in history , holds that humans have no duties of any kind to animals . The other view is based on the animal rights position that animals should not be regarded as property and any use of animals by humans is unacceptable . Accordingly , some animal rights proponents argue that the perception of better animal welfare facilitates continued and increased exploitation of animals . Some authorities therefore treat animal welfare and animal rights as two opposing positions .",

Critics chastised Stewart for not conducting sufficiently hard-hitting interviews with his political guests , some of whom he may have lampooned in previous segments .

  "/wiki/Nuclear_weapons": "A nuclear weapon ( also called an atom bomb , nuke , atomic bomb , nuclear warhead , A-bomb , or nuclear bomb ) is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions , either fission ( fission bomb ) or from a combination of fission and fusion reactions ( thermonuclear bomb ) . Both bomb types release large quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter . The first test of a fission ( atomic ) bomb released an amount of energy approximately equal to 20,000 tons of TNT ( 84 TJ ) . The first thermonuclear ( hydrogen ) bomb test released energy approximately equal to 10 million tons of TNT ( 42 PJ ) . A thermonuclear weapon weighing little more than 2,400 pounds ( 1,100 kg ) can release energy equal to more than 1.2 million tons of TNT ( 5.0 PJ ) . A nuclear device no larger than traditional bombs can devastate an entire city by blast , fire , and radiation . Since they are weapons of mass destruction , the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a focus of international relations policy . Nuclear weapons have been used twice in war , both times by the United States against Japan near the end of World War II . On August 6 , 1945 , the U.S. Army Air Forces detonated a uranium gun-type fission bomb nicknamed Little Boy over the Japanese city of Hiroshima ; three days later , on August 9 , the U.S. Army Air Forces detonated a plutonium implosion-type fission bomb nicknamed Fat Man over the Japanese city of Nagasaki . These bombings caused injuries that resulted in the deaths of approximately 200,000 civilians and military personnel . The ethics of these bombings and their role in Japan 's surrender are subjects of debate . Since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , nuclear weapons have been detonated over two thousand times for testing and demonstration .",

( or CNN Domestic ) to distinguish the U.S. channel from its international sister network , CNN International . The network is known for its dramatic live coverage of breaking news , some of which has drawn criticism as overly sensationalistic , and for its efforts to be nonpartisan , which have led to accusations of false balance . As of September 2018 , CNN has 90.1 million television households as subscribers ( 97.7% of households with cable ) in the United States .

  "/wiki/Television": "Television ( TV ) , sometimes shortened to tele or telly , is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome ( black and white ) , or in colour , and in two or three dimensions and sound . The term can refer to a television set , a television program ( TV show ) , or the medium of television transmission . Television is a mass medium for advertising , entertainment and news . Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s , but it would still be several years before the new technology would be marketed to consumers . After World War II , an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain , and television sets became commonplace in homes , businesses , and institutions . During the 1950s , television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion . In the mid-1960s , color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries . The availability of multiple types of archival storage media such as Betamax and VHS tapes , high-capacity hard disk drives , DVDs , flash drives , high-definition Blu-ray Discs , and cloud digital video recorders has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material - such as movies - at home on their own time schedule . For many reasons , especially the convenience of remote retrieval , the storage of television and video programming now occurs on the cloud . At the end of the first decade of the 2000s , digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity . Another development was the move from standard-definition television ( SDTV ) ( 576i , with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i ) to high-definition television ( HDTV ) , which provides a resolution that is substantially higher . HDTV may be transmitted in various formats : 1080p , 1080i and 720p .",

  "/wiki/Earth": "Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life . According to radiometric dating and other evidence , Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago . Earth 's gravity interacts with other objects in space , especially the Sun and the Moon , which is Earth 's only natural satellite . Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.256 days , a period known as an Earth sidereal year . During this time , Earth rotates about its axis about 366.256 times . [ n 6 ] Earth 's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane , producing seasons on Earth . The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides , stabilizes Earth 's orientation on its axis , and gradually slows its rotation . Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets . Earth 's outer layer ( lithosphere ) is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years . About 71% of Earth 's surface is covered with water , mostly by oceans . The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together contain many lakes , rivers and other fresh water , which , together with the oceans , constitute the hydrosphere . The majority of Earth 's polar regions are covered in ice , including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack .",
  "/wiki/Habitat_destruction": "Habitat destruction ( also termed habitat loss and habitat reduction ) is the process by which a natural habitat becomes incapable of supporting its native species . The organisms that previously inhabited the site are displaced or die , thereby reducing biodiversity and species abundance . Habitat destruction through human activity is mainly for the purpose of harvesting natural resources for industrial production and urbanization . Clearing habitats for agriculture is the principal cause of habitat destruction . Other important causes of habitat destruction include mining , logging , trawling , and urban sprawl . Habitat destruction is currently ranked as the primary cause of species extinction worldwide . The distructive environmental changes include more indirect factors like geological processes , and climate change , introduction of invasive species , ecosystem nutrient depletion , water and noise pollution and others . Loss of habitat can be preceded by an initial habitat fragmentation .",
  "/wiki/DVD": "DVD ( an abbreviation of digital versatile disc ) is a digital optical disc storage format invented and developed in 1995 and released in late 1996 . The medium can store any kind of digital data and is widely used for software and other computer files as well as video programs watched using DVD players . DVDs offer higher storage capacity than compact discs while having the same dimensions . Prerecorded DVDs are mass-produced using molding machines that physically stamp data onto the DVD . Such discs are a form of DVD-ROM because data can only be read and not written or erased . Blank recordable DVD discs ( DVD-R and DVD+R ) can be recorded once using a DVD recorder and then function as a DVD-ROM . Rewritable DVDs ( DVD-RW , DVD+RW , and DVD-RAM ) can be recorded and erased many times . DVDs are used in DVD-Video consumer digital video format and in DVD-Audio consumer digital audio format as well as for authoring DVD discs written in a special AVCHD format to hold high definition material ( often in conjunction with AVCHD format camcorders ) . DVDs containing other types of information may be referred to as DVD data discs .",
