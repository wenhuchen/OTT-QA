It is within the Royal Borough of Greenwich , to which it lends its name . Historically it was in the county of Kent for hundreds of years , then the County of London from 1889 to 1965 . Greenwich is notable for its maritime history and for giving its name to the Greenwich Meridian ( 0\u00b0 longitude ) and Greenwich Mean Time . The town became the site of a royal palace , the Palace of Placentia from the 15th century , and was the birthplace of many Tudors , including Henry VIII and Elizabeth I . The palace fell into disrepair during the English Civil War and was demolished to be replaced by the Royal Naval Hospital for Sailors , designed by Sir Christopher Wren and his assistant Nicholas Hawksmoor . These buildings became the Royal Naval College in 1873 , and they remained a military education establishment until 1998 when they passed into the hands of the Greenwich Foundation . The historic rooms within these buildings remain open to the public ; other buildings are used by University of Greenwich and Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance . The town became a popular resort in the 18th century and many grand houses were built there , such as Vanbrugh Castle ( 1717 ) established on Maze Hill , next to the park . From the Georgian period estates of houses were constructed above the town centre . The maritime connections of Greenwich were celebrated in the 20th century , with the siting of the Cutty Sark and Gipsy Moth IV next to the river front , and the National Maritime Museum in the former buildings of the Royal Hospital School in 1934 .",

Born into an upper-middle-class household , Potter was educated by governesses and grew up isolated from other children . She had numerous pets and spent holidays in Scotland and the Lake District , developing a love of landscape , flora , and fauna , all of which she closely observed and painted . Potters study and watercolours of fungi led to her being widely respected in the field of mycology . In her thirties , Potter self-published the highly successful children 's book The Tale of Peter Rabbit . Following this , Potter began writing and illustrating children 's books full-time . In all , Potter wrote thirty books ; the best known being her twenty-three children 's tales . With the proceeds from the books and a legacy from an aunt , in 1905 Potter bought Hill Top Farm in Near Sawrey , a village in the Lake District which at that time was in Lancashire . Over the following decades , she purchased additional farms to preserve the unique hill country landscape . In 1913 , at the age of 47 , she married William Heelis , a respected local solicitor from Hawkshead . Potter was also a prize-winning breeder of Herdwick sheep and a prosperous farmer keenly interested in land preservation .
