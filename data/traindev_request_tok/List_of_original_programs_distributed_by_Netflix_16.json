The word anime is the Japanese term for animation , which means all forms of animated media . Outside Japan , anime refers specifically to animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics , vibrant characters and fantastical themes . The culturally abstract approach to the word 's meaning may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan . Many Westerners strictly view anime as a Japanese animation product . Some scholars suggest defining anime as specifically or quintessentially Japanese may be related to a new form of Orientalism . The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917 , and Japanese anime production has since continued to increase steadily . The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century , developing a large domestic and international audience . Anime is distributed theatrically , by way of television broadcasts , directly to home media , and over the Internet . It is classified into numerous genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences . Anime is a diverse art form with distinctive production methods and techniques that have been adapted over time in response to emergent technologies . It combines graphic art , characterization , cinematography , and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques .",

Outside Turkey , significant smaller groups of speakers exist in Germany , Austria , Bulgaria , North Macedonia , Northern Cyprus , Greece , the Caucasus , and other parts of Europe and Central Asia . Cyprus has requested that the European Union add Turkish as an official language , even though Turkey is not a member state . To the west , the influence of Ottoman Turkish - the variety of the Turkish language that was used as the administrative and literary language of the Ottoman Empire - spread as the Ottoman Empire expanded . In 1928 , as one of Atat\u00fcrk 's Reforms in the early years of the Republic of Turkey , the Ottoman Turkish alphabet was replaced with a Latin alphabet . The distinctive characteristics of the Turkish language are vowel harmony and extensive agglutination . The basic word order of Turkish is subject-object-verb . Turkish has no noun classes or grammatical gender . The language makes usage of honorifics and has a strong T-V distinction which distinguishes varying levels of politeness , social distance , age , courtesy or familiarity toward the addressee . The plural second-person pronoun and verb forms are used referring to a single person out of respect .",
  "/wiki/Dark_comedy": "Black comedy , also known as black humor , dark comedy , dark humor or gallows humor , is a comic style that makes light of subject matter that is generally considered taboo , particularly subjects that are normally considered serious or painful to discuss . Writers and comedians often use it as a tool for exploring vulgar issues , by provoking discomfort and serious thought as well as amusement in their audience . Thus , in fiction , for example , the term black comedy can also refer to a genre in which dark humor is a core component . Popular themes of the genre include death and violence , discrimination , disease , and human sexuality . Black comedy differs from both blue comedy - which focuses more on crude topics such as nudity , sex , and bodily fluids - and from straightforward obscenity . An archetypal example of black comedy in the form of self-mutilation appears in the English novel Tristram Shandy ; Tristram , five years old at the time , starts to urinate out of an open window for lack of a chamber pot . The sash falls and circumcises him ; his family reacts with both hysteria and philosophical acceptance . Whereas the term black comedy is a relatively broad term covering humor relating to many serious subjects , gallows humor tends to be used more specifically in relation to death , or situations that are reminiscent of dying . Black humor can occasionally be related to the grotesque genre . Literary critics have associated black comedy and black humor with authors as early as the ancient Greeks with Aristophanes .",

  "/wiki/Japanese_language": "Japanese ( \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e , Nihongo [ \u0272iho\u014b\u0261o ] ( listen ) ) is an East Asian language spoken by about 128 million people , primarily in Japan , where it is the national language . It is a member of the Japonic ( or Japanese-Ryukyuan ) language family , and its relation to other languages , such as Korean , is debated . Japanese has been grouped with language families such as Ainu , Austroasiatic , and the now-discredited Altaic , but none of these proposals has gained widespread acceptance . Little is known of the language 's prehistory , or when it first appeared in Japan . Chinese documents from the 3rd century recorded a few Japanese words , but substantial texts did not appear until the 8th century . During the Heian period ( 794-1185 ) , Chinese had considerable influence on the vocabulary and phonology of Old Japanese . Late Middle Japanese ( 1185-1600 ) included changes in features that brought it closer to the modern language , and the first appearance of European loanwords . The standard dialect moved from the Kansai region to the Edo ( modern Tokyo ) region in the Early Modern Japanese period ( early 17th century-mid-19th century ) . Following the end of Japan 's self-imposed isolation in 1853 , the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly . English loanwords , in particular , have become frequent , and Japanese words from English roots have proliferated . Japanese is an agglutinative , mora-timed language with simple phonotactics , a pure vowel system , phonemic vowel and consonant length , and a lexically significant pitch-accent . Word order is normally subject-object-verb with particles marking the grammatical function of words , and sentence structure is topic-comment .",

It is a global language , the world 's second-most spoken native language , after Mandarin Chinese , and the world 's fourth-most spoken language , after Mandarin Chinese , English and Hindi . Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages , which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century . The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century , and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo , a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile , in the 13th century . Beginning in 1492 , the Spanish language was taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire , most notably to the Americas , as well as territories in Africa , Oceania and the Philippines . A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist Mario Pei , analyzing the degree of difference from a language 's parent ( Latin , in the case of Romance languages ) by comparing phonology , inflection , syntax , vocabulary , and intonation , indicated the following percentages ( the higher the percentage , the greater the distance from Latin ) : In the case of Spanish , it is one of the closest Romance languages to Latin ( 20% distance ) , only behind Sardinian ( 8% distance ) and Italian ( 12% distance ) . Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin , including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek . Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date , having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula . With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin , this language makes up the second greatest vocabulary source after Latin itself . It has also been influenced by Basque , Iberian , Celtiberian , Visigothic , and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages . Additionally , it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages , particularly other Romance languages - French , Italian , Andalusi Romance , Portuguese , Galician , Catalan , Occitan , and Sardinian - as well as from Quechua , Nahuatl , and other indigenous languages of the Americas . Spanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations .",

It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire , as did all Romance languages . French evolved from Gallo-Romance , the spoken Latin in Gaul , and more specifically in Northern Gaul . Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders . Today , owing to France 's past overseas expansion , there are numerous French-based creole languages , most notably Haitian Creole . A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French . French is an official language in 29 countries across multiple continents , most of which are members of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie ( OIF ) , the community of 84 countries which share the official use or teaching of French .

  "/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)": "In film and television , drama is a genre of narrative fiction ( or semi-fiction ) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone . Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre , such as police crime drama , political drama , legal drama , historical period drama , domestic drama , teen drama or comedy-drama . These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods . All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters . In this broader sense , drama is a mode distinct from novels , short stories , and narrative poetry or songs . In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted . Radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance , it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio .",

  "/wiki/Comedy": "In a modern sense , comedy ( from the Greek : \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 , k\u014dm\u014did\u00eda ) is a genre of fiction that refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter , especially in theatre , television , film , stand-up comedy , books and novels or any other medium of entertainment . The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece . In the Athenian democracy , the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters . The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict . Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a Society of Youth and a Society of the Old . A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes . In this struggle , the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority , and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter . Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt , thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor . Parody subverts popular genres and forms , critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them . Other forms of comedy include screwball comedy , which derives its humor largely from bizarre , surprising ( and improbable ) situations or characters , and black comedy , which is characterized by a form of humor that includes darker aspects of human behavior or human nature . Similarly scatological humor , sexual humor , and race humor create comedy by violating social conventions or taboos in comic ways . A comedy of manners typically takes as its subject a particular part of society ( usually upper-class society ) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members .",
