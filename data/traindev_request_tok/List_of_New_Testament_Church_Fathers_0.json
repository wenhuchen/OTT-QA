With a population of 5,170 , it is the only Israeli locality managed by a private organization , the Caesarea Development Corporation , and also one of the most populous localities not recognized as a local council . The ancient city of Caesarea Maritima was built by Herod the Great about 25-13 BCE as a major port . It served as an administrative center of Judaea Province of the Roman Empire , and later as the capital of the Byzantine Palaestina Prima province . During the Muslim conquest in the 7th century , it was the last city of the Holy Land to fall to the Arabs . The city degraded to a small village after the provincial capital was moved from here to Ramleh and had an Arab majority until Crusader conquest . Under the Crusaders it became once again a major port and a fortified city . It was diminished after the Mamluk conquest . In 1884 , Bosniak immigrants settled there establishing a small fishing village . In 1940 , kibbutz Sdot Yam was established next to the Bosniak village . In February 1948 , the Bosniak village was conquered by a Palmach unit commanded by Yitzhak Rabin , its people already having fled following an earlier attack by the Lehi paramilitary group .",

With a population of 5,200,000 , Alexandria is the largest city on the Mediterranean , the sixth-largest city in the Arab world and the ninth-largest in Africa . The city extends about 40 km ( 25 mi ) at the northern coast of Egypt along the Mediterranean Sea . Alexandria is a popular tourist destination , and also an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez . Alexandria was founded in c. 331 BC by Alexander the Great , king of Macedon and leader of the Greek League of Corinth , during his conquest of the Achaemenid Empire . An Egyptian village named Rhacotis existed at the location and grew into the Egyptian quarter of Alexandria . Alexandria grew rapidly to become an important center of Hellenistic civilization and remained the capital of Ptolemaic Egypt and Roman and Byzantine Egypt for almost 1,000 years , until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in AD 641 , when a new capital was founded at Fustat ( later absorbed into Cairo ) . Hellenistic Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria ( Pharos ) , one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World ; its Great Library ( the largest in the ancient world ) ; and the Necropolis , one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages . Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural center of the ancient Mediterranean world for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity . It was at one time the largest city in the ancient world before being eventually overtaken by Rome . The city was a major center of early Christianity and was the center of the Patriarchate of Alexandria , which was one of the major centers of Christianity in the Eastern Roman Empire . In the modern world , the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage .",

  "/wiki/Jerusalem": "Jerusalem [ note 2 ] is a city in the Middle East , located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea . It is one of the oldest cities in the world , and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions - Judaism , Christianity , and Islam . Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority claim Jerusalem as their capital , as Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there and the State of Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power ; however , neither claim is widely recognized internationally . [ note 3 ] During its long history , Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice , besieged 23 times , captured and recaptured 44 times , and attacked 52 times . The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE , in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds . Jerusalem was named as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets , probably meaning City of Shalem after a Canaanite deity , during the Canaanite period ( 14th century BCE ) . During the Israelite period , significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE ( Iron Age II ) , and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah . In 1538 , the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent . Today those walls define the Old City , which has been traditionally divided into four quarters - known since the early 19th century as the Armenian , Christian , Jewish , and Muslim Quarters . The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981 , and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger . Since 1860 Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City 's boundaries .

Administratively , the vast majority of the area of the Sinai Peninsula is divided into two governorates : the South Sinai Governorate and the North Sinai Governorate . Three other governorates span the Suez Canal , crossing into African Egypt : Suez Governorate on the southern end of the Suez Canal , Ismailia Governorate in the center , and Port Said Governorate in the north . The peninsula acquired the name Sinai in modern times due to the assumption that a mountain near Saint Catherine 's Monastery is the Biblical Mount Sinai . Mount Sinai is one of the most religiously significant places in the Abrahamic faiths . The Sinai Peninsula has been a part of Egypt from the First Dynasty of ancient Egypt ( c. 3100 BC ) .

The identification of Antiochus with the contemporary Antiochus Strategos , author of a narrative on the Sasanian conquest of Jerusalem in 614 , is disputed . The Greek original of the latter text is lost ; the work is preserved in Georgian and Arabic versions . Antiochus is believed to have been born near Ancyra ( now Ankara , Turkey ) .

He witnessed the Persian invasion of Palestine in 614 , and the massacre of forty-four of his companions by the Bedouins . In 619 , five years after the conquest of the Holy Land by Chosroes , Ancyra was taken and destroyed by the Persians , which compelled the monks of the neighbouring monastery of Attaline to leave their home , and to move from place to place . As they were , naturally , unable to carry many books with them , the Abbot Eustathius asked his friend Antiochus to compile an abridgment of Holy Scripture for their use , and also a short account of the martyrdom of the forty-four monks of St. Sabbas . In compliance with this request he wrote a work known as the Pandects of Holy Scripture ( in 130 chapters , mistaken by the Latin translator for as many homilies ) . It is a collection of moral sentences , drawn from Scripture and from early ecclesiastical writers . He also wrote an Exomologesis or prayer , in which he relates the miseries that had befallen Jerusalem since the Persian invasion , and begs the divine mercy to heal the Holy City 's many ills .

All his known works , the Demonstrations , come from later on in his life . He was an ascetic and celibate , and was almost definitely a son of the covenant ( an early Syriac form of communal monasticism ) . He may have been a bishop , and later Syriac tradition places him at the head of Mar Mattai monastery near Mosul in what is now Iraqi Kurdistan . He was a near contemporary to the slightly younger Ephrem the Syrian , but the latter lived within the sphere of the Roman Empire .

  "/wiki/Assyria": "Assyria ( /\u0259\u02c8s\u026a\u0259ri\u0259/ ) , also called the Assyrian Empire , was a Mesopotamian kingdom and empire of the ancient Near East and the Levant that existed as a state from perhaps as early as the 25th century BC ( in the form of the Assur city-state ) until its collapse between 612 BC and 609 BC - spanning the periods of the Early to Middle Bronze Age through to the late Iron Age . From the end of the seventh century BC ( when the Neo-Assyrian state fell ) to the mid-seventh century AD , it survived as a geopolitical entity , for the most part ruled by foreign powers such as the Parthian and early Sasanian Empires between the mid-second century BC and late third century AD , the final part of which period saw Mesopotamia become a major centre of Syriac Christianity and the birthplace of the Church of the East . A largely Semitic-speaking realm , Assyria was centred on the Tigris in Upper Mesopotamia . The Assyrians came to rule powerful empires in several periods . Making up a substantial part of the greater Mesopotamian cradle of civilization , which included Sumer , the Akkadian Empire , and Babylonia , Assyria reached the height of technological , scientific and cultural achievements for its time . At its peak , the Neo-Assyrian Empire of 911 to 609 BC stretched from eastern Libya and Cyprus in the East Mediterranean to Iran , and from present-day Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Transcaucasia to the Arabian Peninsula . The name Assyria originates with the Assyrian state 's original capital , the ancient city of A\u0161\u0161ur , which dates to c. 2600 BC - originally one of a number of Akkadian-speaking city-states in Mesopotamia . In the 25th and 24th centuries BC , Assyrian kings were pastoral leaders . From the late 24th century BC , the Assyrians became subject to Sargon of Akkad , who united all the Akkadian- and Sumerian-speaking peoples of Mesopotamia under the Akkadian Empire , which lasted from c. 2334 BC to 2154 BC . After the Assyrian Empire fell from power , the greater remaining part of Assyria formed a geopolitical region and province of other empires , although between the mid-2nd century BC and late 3rd century AD a patchwork of small independent Assyrian kingdoms arose in the form of Assur , Adiabene , Osroene , Beth Nuhadra , Beth Garmai and Hatra . The region of Assyria fell under the successive control of the Median Empire of 678 to 549 BC , the Achaemenid Empire of 550 to 330 BC , the Macedonian Empire ( late 4th century BC ) , the Seleucid Empire of 312 to 63 BC , the Parthian Empire of 247 BC to 224 AD , the Roman Empire ( from 116 to 118 AD ) and the Sasanian Empire of 224 to 651 AD . The Arab Islamic conquest of the area in the mid-seventh century finally dissolved Assyria ( Assuristan ) as a single entity , after which the remnants of the Assyrian people ( by now Christians ) gradually became an ethnic , linguistic , cultural and religious minority in the Assyrian homeland , surviving there to this day as an indigenous people of the region .",
  "/wiki/Syriac_language": "Syriac ( /\u02c8s\u026ari\u00e6k/ ; \u0720\u072b\u0722\u0710 \u0723\u0718\u072a\u071d\u071d\u0710 [ a ] Le\u0161\u0161\u0101n\u0101 Sury\u0101y\u0101 ) , also known as Syrian/Syriac Aramaic , Syro-Aramaic or Classical Syriac , is a dialect of Middle Aramaic of the Northwest Semitic languages of the Afroasiatic family that is written in the Syriac alphabet , a derivation of the Aramaic alphabet . Having first appeared in the early first century CE in Edessa , classical Syriac became a major literary language throughout the Middle East from the 4th to the 8th centuries , preserved in a large body of Syriac literature . Indeed , Syriac literature comprises roughly 90% of the extant Aramaic literature . Syriac was once spoken across much of the Near East as well as Anatolia and Eastern Arabia . Syriac originated in Mesopotamia and eventually spread west of Iraq in which it became the lingua franca of the region during the Mesopotamian Neo-Assyrian period . The Old Aramaic language was adopted by the Neo-Assyrian Empire ( 911-609 BC ) when the Assyrians conquered the various Syro-Hittite states to its west . The Achaemenid Empire ( 546-332 BC ) , which rose after the fall of the Assyrian Empire , also retained Old Aramaic as its official language , and Old Aramaic remained the lingua franca of the region . During the course of the third and fourth centuries AD , the inhabitants of the region began to embrace Christianity . Because of theological differences , Syriac-speaking Christians bifurcated during the 5th century into the Church of the East , or East Syrians under Sasanian rule , and the Syriac Orthodox , or West Syrians under the Byzantine empire . After this separation , the two groups developed distinct dialects differing primarily in the pronunciation and written symbolisation of vowels . The modern , and vastly spoken , Syriac varieties today include Assyrian Neo-Aramaic , Chaldean Neo-Aramaic and Turoyo , among others , which , in turn , have their own subdialects as well . Along with Latin and Greek , Syriac became one of the three most important Christian languages in the early centuries of the Common Era .",

Historically , it has also been known as Laodicea in Syria or Laodicea ad Mare . In addition to serving as a port , the city is a manufacturing center for surrounding agricultural towns and villages . According to the 2004 official census , the population of the city is 383,786 , Its population greatly increased as a result of the ongoing Syrian Civil War due to the influx of refugees from rebel and terrorist held areas . It is the 4th-largest city in Syria after Aleppo , Damascus and Homs , and it borders Tartus to the south , Hama to the east , and Idlib to the north while Cape Apostolos Andreas , the most north-eastern tip of Cyprus is about 68 miles ( 109 km ) away . Although the site has been inhabited since the 2nd millennium BC , the city was founded in the 4th century BC under the rule of the Seleucid empire . Latakia was subsequently ruled by the Romans , then the Ummayads and Abbasids in the 8th-10th centuries of the Christian era . Under their rule , the Byzantines frequently attacked the city , periodically recapturing it before losing it again to the Arabs , particularly the Fatimids . Afterward , Latakia was ruled successively by the Seljuk Turks , Crusaders , Ayyubids , Mamluks , and the Ottomans . Following World War I , Latakia was assigned to the French mandate of Syria , in which it served as the capital of the autonomous territory of the Alawites . This autonomous territory became the Alawite State in 1922 , proclaiming its independence a number of times until reintegrating into Syria in 1944 . [ citation needed ]",
