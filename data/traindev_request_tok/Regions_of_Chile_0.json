  "/wiki/English_language": "English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and eventually became a global lingua franca . It is named after the Angles , one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name , as England . Both names derive from Anglia , a peninsula in the Baltic Sea . The language is closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon , and its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages , particularly Norse ( a North Germanic language ) , and to a greater extent by Latin and French . English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years . The earliest forms of English , a group of West Germanic ( Ingvaeonic ) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century , are collectively called Old English . Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England ; this was a period in which the language was influenced by French . Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London , the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift . Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States . Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries , English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science , navigation and law . English is the largest language by number of speakers , and the third most-spoken native language in the world , after Standard Chinese and Spanish . It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states .",

It is a global language , the world 's second-most spoken native language , after Mandarin Chinese , and the world 's fourth-most spoken language , after Mandarin Chinese , English and Hindi . Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages , which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century . The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century , and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo , a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile , in the 13th century . Beginning in 1492 , the Spanish language was taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire , most notably to the Americas , as well as territories in Africa , Oceania and the Philippines . A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist Mario Pei , analyzing the degree of difference from a language 's parent ( Latin , in the case of Romance languages ) by comparing phonology , inflection , syntax , vocabulary , and intonation , indicated the following percentages ( the higher the percentage , the greater the distance from Latin ) : In the case of Spanish , it is one of the closest Romance languages to Latin ( 20% distance ) , only behind Sardinian ( 8% distance ) and Italian ( 12% distance ) . Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin , including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek . Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date , having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula . With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin , this language makes up the second greatest vocabulary source after Latin itself . It has also been influenced by Basque , Iberian , Celtiberian , Visigothic , and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages . Additionally , it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages , particularly other Romance languages - French , Italian , Andalusi Romance , Portuguese , Galician , Catalan , Occitan , and Sardinian - as well as from Quechua , Nahuatl , and other indigenous languages of the Americas . Spanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations .",
  "/wiki/Capital_(political)": "A capital or capital city is the municipality exercising primary status in a country , state , province , or other administrative region , usually as its seat of government . A capital is typically a city that physically encompasses the government 's offices and meeting places ; the status as capital is often designated by its law or constitution . In some jurisdictions , including several countries , the different branches of government are located in different settlements . In some cases , a distinction is made between the official ( constitutional ) capital and the seat of government , which is in another place . Capital cities that also serve as the prime economic , population , cultural , or intellectual centres of a nation or an empire are sometimes referred to as primate cities . Examples are Athens , Bangkok , Brussels , Copenhagen , Cairo , London , Mexico City , Paris , Lima , Seoul and Tokyo . News media often use the name of a capital city as an alternative name for the country of which it is the capital or of the government that is seated there , as a form of metonymy . For example , relations between Washington and London refer to relations between the United States and the United Kingdom .",

The national census of 2002 recorded the commune of Valdivia as having 140,559 inhabitants ( Valdivianos ) , of whom 127,750 were living in the city . The main economic activities of Valdivia include tourism , wood pulp manufacturing , forestry , metallurgy , and beer production . The city is also the home of the Austral University of Chile , founded in 1954 and the Centro de Estudios Cient\u00edficos . The city of Valdivia and the Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago were once the two southernmost outliers of the Spanish Empire . From 1645 to 1740 the city depended directly on the Viceroyalty of Peru , which financed the building of the Valdivian fort system that turned Valdivia into one of the most fortified cities of the New World . In the second half of the 19th century , Valdivia was the port of entry for German immigrants who settled in the city and surrounding areas . In 1960 Valdivia was severely damaged by the Great Chilean earthquake , the most powerful earthquake ever recorded at magnitude 9.5 . Debris and destroyed buildings from the earthquake can still be found in the suburban areas . In addition , land subsidence and sediments have resulted in complex navigation challenges on the local rivers and in some areas , ruins of buildings are visible from the water .",

The region contains the country 's second largest island , Chilo\u00e9 , and the second largest lake , Llanquihue . Historically , the Huilliche have called this territory between Bueno River and Reloncav\u00ed Sound Futahuillimapu , meaning great land of the south . Its capital is Puerto Montt ; other important cities include Osorno , Castro , Ancud , and Puerto Varas . The mainland portion of Los Lagos Region south of Reloncav\u00ed Sound ( Palena Province ) is considered part of Patagonia . Los Lagos Region economy is dominated by the service sector but based in fishing , salmon aquaculture , forestry and cattle farming . Tourism is economically important in Andes where ski resorts , hot springs and recreational fishing are popular offers . The region hosts Monte Verde , one of the oldest archaeological sites of the Americas . The largest indigenous group of the region are the Huilliche who lived in the area before the arrival of the Spanish . The Spanish crown settled Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago in 1567 while the rest of the region begun to be slowly colonized by non-indigenous people only in the late 18th century .

  "/wiki/Puerto_Montt": "Puerto Montt ( Mapuche : Meli Pulli ) is a port city and commune in southern Chile , located at the northern end of the Reloncav\u00ed Sound in the Llanquihue Province , Los Lagos Region , 1,055 km to the south of the capital , Santiago . The commune spans an area of 1,673 km2 ( 646 sq mi ) and has a population of 245,902 in 2017 . It is bounded by the communes of Puerto Varas to the north , Cocham\u00f3 to the east and southeast , Calbuco to the southwest and Maull\u00edn and Los Muermos to the west . Founded as late as 1853 during the German colonization of southern Chile , Puerto Montt soon outgrew older neighboring cities due to its strategic position at the southern end of the Chilean Central Valley being a gateway city into Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago , Llanquihue and Nahuel Huapi lakes and Western Patagonia . Puerto Montt has gained renown and grown significantly due to the rise of Chile as the second largest salmon producer of the world during the 1990s and 2000s . However , the Chilean salmon aquaculture crisis of the late 2000s resulted at least temporarily in severe unemployment and exposed weaknesses in the local economy . The city 's cultural heritage mixes elements of Chilo\u00e9 culture with German heritage although the city has attracted a significant number of newcomers from all over Chile in the last 30 years due to employment opportunities .",

  "/wiki/Punta_Arenas": "Punta Arenas ( Spanish pronunciation : [ \u02c8punta a\u02c8\u027eenas ] ; historically Sandy Point in English ) is the capital city of Chile 's southernmost region , Magallanes and Antartica Chilena . The city was officially renamed as Magallanes in 1927 , but in 1938 it was changed back to Punta Arenas . It is the largest city south of the 46th parallel south , and at the same time the most populous southernmost city in Chile and in the Americas , and due to its location , the coldest coastal city with more than 100,000 inhabitants in Latin America . It is also one of the most populous sites so far south in the world . As of 1977 Punta Arenas has been one of only two free ports in Chile , the other one being Iquique , in the country 's far north . ( Punta Arenas itself is not a free port : outside the city there is a zona franca where certain products can be imported into the country under a reduced-tax regimen . ) Located on the Brunswick Peninsula north of the Strait of Magellan , Punta Arenas was originally established by the Chilean government in 1848 as a tiny penal colony to assert sovereignty over the Strait . During the remainder of the 1800s , Punta Arenas grew in size and importance due to the increasing maritime traffic and trade travelling to the west coasts of South and North America . This period of growth also resulted from the waves of European immigrants , mainly from Croatia and Russia attracted to the gold rush and sheep farming boom in the 1880s and early 1900s . The largest sheep company , controlling 10,000 square kilometres in Chile and Argentina , was based in Punta Arenas , and its owners lived there . Since its founding Chile has used Punta Arenas as a base to defend its sovereignty claims in the southernmost part of South America . This led , among other things , to the Strait of Magellan being recognized as Chilean territory in the Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina ."
