Among the claimants , the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is the only one to have held classes and graduated students as a public university in the eighteenth century . The first public institution of higher education in North Carolina , the school opened its doors to students on February 12 , 1795 . Under the leadership of President Kemp Plummer Battle , in 1877 North Carolina became coeducational and began the process of desegregation in 1951 when African-American graduate students were admitted under Chancellor Robert Burton House . In 1952 , North Carolina opened its own hospital , UNC Health Care , for research and treatment , and has since specialized in cancer care . The school 's students , alumni , and sports teams are known as Tar Heels .
