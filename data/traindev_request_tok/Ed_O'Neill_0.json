  "/wiki/Cruising_(film)": "Cruising is a 1980 American erotic crime thriller film written and directed by William Friedkin and starring Al Pacino , Paul Sorvino , and Karen Allen . It is loosely based on the novel of the same name by New York Times reporter Gerald Walker about a serial killer targeting gay men , particularly those men associated with the leather scene in the late 1970s . The title is a play on words with a dual meaning because cruising can describe police officers on patrol and gay men who are cruising for sex . Poorly received by critics upon release , Cruising performed moderately at the box office . The shooting and promotion were dogged by gay rights protesters , who believed that the film stigmatized them . The film is also notable for its open-ended finale , which was criticized by Robin Wood and Bill Krohn as further complicating what they felt were the director 's incoherent changes to the rough cut and synopsis , as well as other production issues .",
