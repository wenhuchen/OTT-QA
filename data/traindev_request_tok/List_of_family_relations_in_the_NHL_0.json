  "/wiki/Canada": "Canada is a country in the northern part of North America . Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean , covering 9.98 million square kilometres ( 3.85 million square miles ) , making it the world 's second-largest country by total area . Its southern border with the United States , stretching some 8,891 kilometres ( 5,525 mi ) , is the world 's longest bi-national land border . Canada 's capital is Ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . As a whole , Canada is sparsely populated , with most of its land area dominated by forest and tundra . Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",
  "/wiki/National_Hockey_League": "The National Hockey League ( NHL ; French : Ligue nationale de hockey - LNH ) is a professional ice hockey league in North America , currently comprising 31 teams : 24 in the United States and 7 in Canada . The NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world , and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada . The Stanley Cup , the oldest professional sports trophy in North America , is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season . The National Hockey League was organized on November 26 , 1917 , at the Windsor Hotel in Montreal after the suspension of operations of its predecessor organization , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) , which had been founded in 1909 in Renfrew , Ontario . The NHL immediately took the NHA 's place as one of the leagues that contested for the Stanley Cup in an annual interleague competition before a series of league mergers and foldings left the NHL as the only league left competing for the Stanley Cup in 1926 . At its inception , the NHL had four teams - all in Canada , thus the adjective National in the league 's name . The league expanded to the United States in 1924 , when the Boston Bruins joined , and has since consisted of American and Canadian teams . From 1942 to 1967 , the league had only six teams , collectively ( if not contemporaneously ) nicknamed the Original Six . The NHL added six new teams to double its size at the 1967 NHL expansion . The league then increased to 18 teams by 1974 and 21 teams in 1979 . Between 1991 and 2000 , the NHL further expanded to 30 teams .

The Blackhawks are one of the Original Six NHL teams along with the Detroit Red Wings , Montreal Canadiens , Toronto Maple Leafs , Boston Bruins and New York Rangers . Since 1994 , the club 's home rink is the United Center , which they share with the National Basketball Association 's Chicago Bulls . The club had previously played for 65 years at Chicago Stadium . The club 's original owner was Frederic McLaughlin , who owned the club until his death in 1944 . Under McLaughlin , a hands-on owner who fired many coaches during his ownership , the club won two Stanley Cup titles . The club was then owned by the Norris family , who as owners of the Chicago Stadium were the club 's landlord , and owned stakes in several of the NHL teams . At first , the Norris ownership was as part of a syndicate fronted by long-time executive Bill Tobin , and the team languished in favor of the Norris-owned Detroit Red Wings . After the senior James E. Norris died in 1952 , the Norris assets were spread among family members and James D. Norris became owner . Norris Jr. took an active interest in the team and under his ownership , the club won one Stanley Cup title in 1961 .",

  "/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers": "The Edmonton Oilers are a professional ice hockey team based in Edmonton . They compete in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference . The Oilers were officially founded in 1971 by W. D. Wild Bill Hunter and Dr. Chuck Allard . The team played its first season in 1972 , as one of the twelve founding franchises of the major professional World Hockey Association ( WHA ) . They were originally intended to be one of two WHA Alberta teams , along with the Calgary Broncos . However , when the Broncos relocated to Cleveland , Ohio , before the WHA 's first season began , the Oilers were renamed the Alberta Oilers . They returned to their current name in the following year , and subsequently joined the NHL in 1979 as one of four franchises absorbed through the NHL merger with the WHA . After joining the NHL , the Oilers went on to win the Stanley Cup on five occasions : 1983-84 , 1984-85 , 1986-87 , 1987-88 and 1989-90 . Along with the Pittsburgh Penguins , they are tied for the most championships won by any team since the NHL-WHA merger and also the most won by any team that joined the league in or after 1967 . Among all NHL teams , only the Montreal Canadiens have won the Stanley Cup more times since the League 's 1967 expansion . For their success in the 1980s , the Oilers team of this era has been honoured with dynasty status by the Hockey Hall of Fame . However , the Oilers began to struggle greatly shortly after the 2004-05 NHL lockout , having missed the playoffs every year since 2006 , with the exception of 2016-17 .",
  "/wiki/World_Hockey_Association": "The World Hockey Association ( French : Association mondiale de hockey ) was a professional ice hockey major league that operated in North America from 1972 to 1979 . It was the first major league to compete with the National Hockey League ( NHL ) since the collapse of the Western Hockey League in 1926 . Although the WHA was not the first league since that time to attempt to challenge the NHL 's supremacy , it was by far the most successful in the modern era . The WHA tried to capitalize on the lack of hockey teams in a number of major American cities and mid-level Canadian cities , and also hoped to attract the best players by paying more than NHL owners would . The WHA successfully challenged the NHL 's reserve clause , which bound players to their NHL teams even without a valid contract , allowing players in both leagues greater freedom of movement . Sixty-seven players jumped from the NHL to the WHA in the first year , led by star forward Bobby Hull , whose ten-year , $ 2.75 million contract was a record at the time . The WHA also took the initiative to sign European players . The WHA had an acrimonious relationship with the NHL , resulting in numerous legal battles , as well as competition for control of players and markets . In spite of this , merger talks began almost immediately , as the WHA was constantly unstable , with franchises occasionally relocating or folding in the middle of the season . NHL owners voted down a 1977 plan to merge six WHA teams ( the Edmonton Oilers , New England Whalers , Quebec Nordiques , Cincinnati Stingers , Houston Aeros , and Winnipeg Jets ) into the NHL before a 1979 merger was approved . As a result , the WHA ceased operations , and four teams joined the NHL for the 1979-80 season : the Edmonton Oilers , New England Whalers , Quebec Nordiques , and Winnipeg Jets . Of these four teams , two of the three Canadian teams - the Nordiques and Jets - eventually moved south to Denver and Phoenix , respectively , although the NHL would return to Winnipeg with the 2011 relocation of the Atlanta Thrashers , who would rename themselves the Winnipeg Jets upon their relocation .",
