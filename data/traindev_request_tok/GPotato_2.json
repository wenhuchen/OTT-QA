  "/wiki/Game_client": "A Game client is a network client that connects an individual user to the main game server , used mainly in multiplayer video games . It collects data such as score , player status , position and movement from a single player and send it to the game server , which allows the server to collect each individual 's data and show every player in game , whether it is an arena game on a smaller scale or a massive game with thousands of players on the same map . Even though the game server displays each player 's information for every player in a game , players still have their own unique perspective from the information collected by the game client , so that every player 's perspective of the game is different , even though the world for every player is the same . The game client also allows the information sharing among users . An example would be item exchange in many MMORPG games where a player exchange an item he/she does n't want for an item he/she wants , the game clients interconnect with each other and allows the sharing of information , in this exchanging items . Since many games requires a centralized space for players to gather and a way for users to exchange their information , many game clients are a hybrid of client-server and peer-to-peer application structures .",
