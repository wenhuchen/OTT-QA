The format of Sesame Street consists of a combination of commercial television production elements and techniques which have evolved to reflect the changes in American culture and the audience 's viewing habits . With the creation of Sesame Street , producers and writers of a children 's television show used , for the first time , educational goals and a curriculum to shape its content . It was also the first time a show 's educational effects were formally studied . The show , therefore , has undergone significant changes in its history as adjustments to the format and content have been made to reflect change sources to the curriculum . Shortly after creating Sesame Street , its producers developed what came to be called the CTW model ( after the production company 's previous name ) , a system of television show planning , production , and evaluation based on collaborations between producers , writers , educators , and researchers . The show was initially funded by government and private foundations but has become somewhat self-supporting due to revenues from licensing arrangements , international sales , and other media .

After two pilot episodes , the show originally aired on NBC from 1971 to 1978 as one of the rotating programs of The NBC Mystery Movie . Columbo then aired less frequently on ABC from 1989 to 2003 . The character and show , created by Richard Levinson and William Link , popularized the inverted detective story format , which begins by showing the commission of the crime and its perpetrator ; the plot therefore usually has no whodunit element , and instead revolves around how a perpetrator known to the audience will finally be caught and exposed ( sometimes referred to as a howcatchem ) . Columbo is a shrewd but inelegant blue-collar homicide detective whose trademarks include his rumpled beige raincoat , unassuming demeanor , frequent cigar smoking , old Peugeot 403 , unseen wife ( whom he mentions regularly ) , and catchphrase Just one more thing . His suspects are often affluent members of high society who try to carefully cover their tracks . Initially dismissive of Columbo 's circumstantial speech and apparent ineptitude , they become increasingly unsettled as his pestering behavior leads him to tease out incriminating evidence . His relentless approach often leads to self-incrimination or an outright confession by the suspect . Episodes of Columbo are between 70 and 98 minutes long , and have been broadcast in 44 countries . The 1971 episode Murder by the Book , directed by Steven Spielberg , was ranked No . 16 on TV Guide 's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time and in 1999 , the magazine ranked Lt.
