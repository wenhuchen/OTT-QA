However , this rich industrial history left the area with renowned museums , medical centers , parks , research centers , and a diverse cultural district .

The flagship of the University of North Carolina system , it is considered a Public Ivy , or a public institution which offers an academic experience equivalent to an Ivy League university . After being chartered in 1789 , the university first began enrolling students in 1795 , which also allows it to be one of three schools to claim the title of the oldest public university in the United States . Among the claimants , the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is the only one to have held classes and graduated students as a public university in the eighteenth century . The first public institution of higher education in North Carolina , the school opened its doors to students on February 12 , 1795 . Under the leadership of President Kemp Plummer Battle , in 1877 North Carolina became coeducational and began the process of desegregation in 1951 when African-American graduate students were admitted under Chancellor Robert Burton House . In 1952 , North Carolina opened its own hospital , UNC Health Care , for research and treatment , and has since specialized in cancer care . The school 's students , alumni , and sports teams are known as Tar Heels . The university offers degrees in over 70 courses of study and is administratively divided into 13 separate professional schools and a primary unit , the College of Arts & Sciences . Five of the schools have been named : the UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School , the UNC Hussman School of Journalism and Media , the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health , the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy , and the UNC Adams School of Dentistry . All undergraduates receive a liberal arts education and have the option to pursue a major within the professional schools of the university or within the College of Arts and Sciences from the time they obtain junior status . UNC 's faculty and alumni include 9 Nobel Prize laureates , 23 Pulitzer Prize winners , and 49 Rhodes Scholars .",
  "/wiki/Salzburg": "Salzburg ( German : [ \u02c8zaltsb\u028a\u0281k ] ( listen ) ; [ note 1 ] literally Salt Fortress ) is the capital city of the State of Salzburg and with 154,211 inhabitants the fourth-largest city in Austria . The town is located on the site of the former Roman settlement of Iuvavum . Salzburg was founded as an episcopal see in 696 and became a seat of the archbishop in 798 . Its main sources of income were salt extraction and trade and , at times , gold mining . The fortress of Hohensalzburg , one of the largest medieval fortresses in Europe , dates from the 11th century . In the 17th century , Salzburg became a centre of the Counter-Reformation , where monasteries and numerous Baroque churches were built . Salzburg 's historic centre ( German : Altstadt ) is thus renowned for its Baroque architecture and is one of the best-preserved city centres north of the Alps , with 27 churches . It was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996 . The city has three universities and a large population of students . Tourists also visit Salzburg to tour the historic centre and the scenic Alpine surroundings . Salzburg was the birthplace of the 18th-century composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart . Because of its history , culture , and attractions , Salzburg has been labeled Austria 's most inspiring city .",
  "/wiki/Silicon_Fen": "Silicon Fen ( sometimes known as the Cambridge Cluster ) is the name given to the region around Cambridge , England , which is home to a large cluster of high-tech businesses focusing on software , electronics and biotechnology . Many of these businesses have connections with the University of Cambridge , and the area is now one of the most important technology centres in Europe . It is called Silicon Fen by analogy with Silicon Valley in California , because it lies at the southern tip of the English Fenland . The interest in technology in the area started with Sinclair Research and Acorn Computers .",
  "/wiki/Silicon_Valley": "Silicon Valley is a region in the southern part of the San Francisco Bay Area in Northern California that serves as a global center for high technology , innovation , and social media . It corresponds roughly to the geographical Santa Clara Valley , although its boundaries have increased in recent decades . San Jose is the Valley 's largest city , the third-largest in California , and the tenth-largest in the United States . Other major Silicon Valley cities include Palo Alto , Menlo Park , Redwood City , Cupertino , Santa Clara , Mountain View , and Sunnyvale . The San Jose Metropolitan Area has the third-highest GDP per capita in the world ( after Zurich , Switzerland and Oslo , Norway ) , according to the Brookings Institution . The word silicon in the name originally referred to the large number of innovators and manufacturers in the region specializing in silicon-based MOS transistors and integrated circuit chips . The area is now home to many of the world 's largest high-tech corporations , including the headquarters of more than 30 businesses in the Fortune 1000 , and thousands of startup companies . Silicon Valley also accounts for one-third of all of the venture capital investment in the United States , which has helped it to become a leading hub and startup ecosystem for high-tech innovation and scientific development . It was in Silicon Valley that the silicon-based integrated circuit , the microprocessor , and the microcomputer , among other technologies , were developed . As of 2013 , the region employed about a quarter of a million information technology workers . As more high-tech companies were established across San Jose and the Santa Clara Valley , and then north towards the Bay Area 's two other major cities , San Francisco and Oakland , the term Silicon Valley has come to have two definitions : a geographic one , referring to Santa Clara County , and a metonymical one , referring to all high-tech businesses in the Bay Area . The term is often used as a synecdoche for the American high-technology economic sector .",
  "/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area": "The San Francisco Bay Area , popularly referred to as the Bay Area or simply the Bay , is a populous region surrounding the San Francisco , San Pablo , and Suisun Bay estuaries in Northern California . Although the exact boundaries of the region vary depending on the source , the Bay Area is defined by the Association of Bay Area Governments to include the nine counties that border the aforementioned estuaries : Alameda , Contra Costa , Marin , Napa , San Mateo , Santa Clara , Solano , Sonoma , and San Francisco . Other sources may exclude parts of or even entire counties , or expand the definition to include neighboring counties that do not border the bay such as San Benito , San Joaquin , and Santa Cruz . Home to approximately 7.75 million people , Northern California 's nine-county Bay Area contains many cities , towns , airports , and associated regional , state , and national parks , connected by a complex multimodal transportation network . The larger combined statistical area of the region , which includes fourteen counties , is the second-largest in California ( after the Greater Los Angeles area ) , the fifth-largest in the United States , and the 41st-largest urban area in the world with 9.67 million people . The Bay Area 's population is ethnically diverse : for example , roughly half of the region 's residents are Hispanic , Asian , African American , or Pacific Islander , all of whom have a significant presence throughout the region . The earliest archaeological evidence of human settlements in the Bay Area dates back to 8000-10,000 BC ( from shell mounds in the Coyote Hills ) . In 1769 , the Bay Area was inhabited by the Ohlone people when a Spanish exploration party led by Gaspar de Portol\u00e0 entered the Bay - the first documented European visit to the Bay Area . After Mexico established independence from Spain in 1821 , the region was briefly controlled by the Mexican government until the United States purchased the territory in 1846 during the Mexican-American War . Soon after , discovery of gold in California attracted a flood of treasure seekers , many using ports in the Bay Area as an entry point . During the early years of California 's statehood , state legislative business rotated between three locations in the Bay Area before a permanent state capital was established in Sacramento . A major earthquake leveled the city of San Francisco and environs in 1906 , but the region quickly rebuilt in time to host the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition ."
