  "/wiki/U.S._Route_61": "U.S. Route 61 or U.S. Highway 61 ( US 61 ) is a major United States highway which extends 1,400 miles ( 2,300 km ) between New Orleans , Louisiana and the city of Wyoming , Minnesota . The highway generally follows the course of the Mississippi River , and is designated the Great River Road for much of its route . As of 2004 , the highway 's northern terminus in Wyoming , Minnesota , is at an intersection with Interstate 35 ( I-35 ) . Until 1991 , the highway extended north on what is now Minnesota State Highway 61 ( MN 61 ) through Duluth and across the Canada-U.S. border , near Grand Portage . Its southern terminus in New Orleans is at an intersection with U.S. Route 90 ( US 90 ) . The highway is often called the Blues Highway because it connects Saint Paul , Minnesota ; St. Louis , Missouri ; Memphis , Tennessee ; the Mississippi Delta , and New Orleans . The route was an important south-north connection in the days before the interstate highway system . Many southerners traveled north along US 61 while going to St. Louis and Saint Paul . The highway has a long musical history , being the supposed location where singer-songwriter Robert Johnson made a deal with the Devil for his successes . The road later gave its name to Minnesota native Bob Dylan 's album Highway 61 Revisited and to the song of the same name , which imagines all sorts of fantastical events ( including World War III ) occurring alongside it . Other notable songs named for the highway include a blues song recorded in 1957 by Sunnyland Slim ; one in 1962 by Johnny Young ; and a 1981 song , 61 Highway , by bluesman James Son Thomas . To denote US 61 's significance in blues music history , there are two markers on the route which are part of the Mississippi Blues Trail : 61 Highway in Vicksburg , Mississippi and Highway 61 Blues in Tunica , Mississippi .",
