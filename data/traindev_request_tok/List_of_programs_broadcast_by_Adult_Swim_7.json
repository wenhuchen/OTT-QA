It is unusual among features other than anthology films in using a series of disparate visual styles to tell one continuous story . As Yuasa commented in a Japan Times interview , Instead of telling it serious and straight , I went for a look that was a bit wild and patchy . I think that Japanese animation fans today do n't necessarily demand something that 's so polished . You can throw different styles at them and they can still usually enjoy it . The film received a cult audience and was well received , winning multiple awards worldwide , and has been praised by directors Satoshi Kon and Bill Plympton .

The film centers on a melodramatic love triangle between amiable banker Johnny ( Wiseau ) , his deceptive fianc\u00e9e Lisa ( Danielle ) , and his conflicted best friend Mark ( Sestero ) . A significant portion of the film is dedicated to a series of unrelated subplots , most of which involve at least one supporting character and are left unresolved due to the film 's inconsistent narrative structure . The work was reportedly intended to be semi-autobiographical in nature ; according to Wiseau , the title alludes to the potential of a room to be the site of both good and bad events . The stage play from which the film is derived was so-called due to its events taking place in a single room . A number of publications have labeled The Room as one of the worst films ever made . An assistant professor of film studies was the first to describe The Room as the Citizen Kane of bad movies . Originally shown only in a limited number of California theaters , The Room quickly became a cult film due to its bizarre and unconventional storytelling , technical and narrative flaws , and Wiseau 's off-kilter performance . Although Wiseau has retrospectively described the film as a black comedy , audiences have generally viewed it as a poorly made drama , an opinion shared by some of the cast . The Disaster Artist , Sestero 's memoir of the making of The Room , was co-written with Tom Bissell and published in 2013 . A film of the same name based on the book , directed by and starring James Franco , was released on December 1 , 2017 ; the book and film received widespread acclaim and numerous award nominations .

The world of Gaea has a more Asian design than the heavily European influenced television series . The film was licensed for Region 1 release by Bandai Entertainment , which gave the film a theatrical release on January 25 , 2002 . A soundtrack and two drama CDs have also been released in Japan by Victor Entertainment in relation to the series ."
