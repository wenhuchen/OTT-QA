Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos , and designed album covers . He is considered one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse rock musicians of his era . As a self-taught composer and performer , Zappa 's diverse musical influences led him to create music that was sometimes difficult to categorize . While in his teens , he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical modernism , African-American rhythm and blues , and doo-wop music . He began writing classical music in high school , while at the same time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands , later switching to electric guitar . His 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention , Freak Out ! , combined songs in conventional rock and roll format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound collages . He continued this eclectic and experimental approach , irrespective of whether the fundamental format was rock , jazz or classical . Zappa 's output is unified by a conceptual continuity he termed Project/Object , with numerous musical phrases , ideas , and characters reappearing across his albums . His lyrics reflected his iconoclastic views of established social and political processes , structures and movements , often humorously so , and he has been described as the godfather of comedy rock .",

The score is generally considered to be one of Sondheim 's most ambitious and sophisticated efforts .

To revert into his true human form , the Beast must first learn to love a bright , beautiful young woman whom he has imprisoned in his enchanted castle before it is too late . Critics , who hailed it as one of the year 's finest musicals , immediately noted the film 's Broadway musical potential when it was first released in 1991 , encouraging Disney CEO Michael Eisner to venture into Broadway . All eight songs from the animated film were reused in the musical , including a resurrected musical number which had been cut from the motion picture . Original songwriter Menken composed six new songs for the production alongside lyricist Rice , replacing Ashman who had died during production of the film . Woolverton , who had written the film 's screenplay , adapted her own work into the musical 's libretto , and specifically expanded upon the characterization of the Beast . Woolverton also expanded the storylines of the castle staff from servants who had already been transformed into household objects into humans who were gradually turning into inanimate objects . Costumes were designed by Ann Hould-Ward , who based her creations on both the animators ' original designs as well as the Rococo art movement after researching how clothing and household objects looked during the 18th century . After completing tryouts in Houston , Beauty and the Beast premiered on Broadway on April 18 , 1994 , starring Susan Egan and Terrence Mann as the eponymous Belle and Beast , respectively . The musical opened to mixed reviews from theatre critics , but was a massive commercial success and well received by audiences .
