This was Russia 's sixth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics as an independent nation . On 18 July 2016 , an independent investigation commissioned by World Anti-Doping Agency concluded that it was shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the RUSADA , the Ministry of Sport , the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) and the Centre of Sports Preparation of the National Teams of Russia had operated for the protection of doped Russian athletes within a state-directed failsafe system using the disappearing positive [ test ] methodology . According to the McLaren Report , the Disappearing Positive Methodology operated from at least late 2011 to August 2015 . It was used on 643 positive samples , a number that the authors consider only a minimum due to limited access to Russian records . Based on these findings the International Olympic Committee called for an emergency meeting to consider banning Russia from the Summer Olympics . On 24 July , the IOC rejected WADA 's recommendation to ban Russia from the Summer Olympics and announced that a decision would be made by each sport federation . With each positive decision having to be approved by a CAS arbitrator . On 7 August 2016 , the IOC cleared 278 athletes , while 111 were removed because of the scandal . On 7 August 2016 , the International Paralympic Committee announced that it had voted unanimously to ban the entire Russian Paralympic team from competing at the 2016 Summer Paralympics , in the wake of a larger scandal that exposed the participation of Russian Olympic and Paralympic athletes in a state-sponsored doping program .

The Bulgarian Olympic Committee fielded a team of 51 athletes , 29 men and 22 women , across 14 sports at the Games . It was the nation 's smallest delegation sent to the Olympics since 1956 , due to the absence of the men 's volleyball squad and the ban of 11 weightlifters over a widespread doping offense . Track and field and wrestling accounted for the largest number of athletes on the Bulgarian squad with 11 entries , nearly half of the nation 's full roster size . There was only a single competitor each in road cycling , fencing , and modern pentathlon ( the country 's return to the sport at the Olympic Games after 16 years ) .

Low levels of EPO ( around 10 mU/mL ) are constantly secreted sufficient to compensate for normal red blood cell turnover . Common causes of cellular hypoxia resulting in elevated levels of EPO ( up to 10 000 mU/mL ) include any anemia , and hypoxemia due to chronic lung disease . Erythropoietin is produced by interstitial fibroblasts in the kidney in close association with the peritubular capillary and proximal convoluted tubule . It is also produced in perisinusoidal cells in the liver . Liver production predominates in the fetal and perinatal period ; renal production predominates in adulthood . It is homologous with thrombopoietin . Exogenous erythropoietin , recombinant human erythropoietin ( rhEPO ) , is produced by recombinant DNA technology in cell culture and are collectively called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESA ) : two examples are epoetin alfa and epoetin beta . ESAs are used in the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease , anemia in myelodysplasia , and in anemia from cancer chemotherapy . Risks of therapy include death , myocardial infarction , stroke , venous thromboembolism , and tumor recurrence . Risk increases when EPO treatment raises hemoglobin levels over 11 g/dL to 12 g/dL : this is to be avoided . rhEPO has been used illicitly as a performance-enhancing drug .",
