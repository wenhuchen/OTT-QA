The plant , also known as Manila hemp , has great economic importance , being harvested for its fiber , also called Manila hemp , extracted from the leaf-stems . The plant grows to 13-22 feet ( 4.0-6.7 m ) , and averages about 12 feet ( 3.7 m ) . The fiber was originally used for making twines and ropes ; now most is pulped and used in a variety of specialized paper products including tea bags , filter paper and banknotes . It is classified as a hard fiber , along with coir , henequin and sisal .",
  "/wiki/Bagyo": "Approximately twenty tropical cyclones enter the Philippine area of responsibility yearly , an area which incorporates parts of the Pacific Ocean , South China Sea and the Philippine Archipelago ( with the exception of Tawi-Tawi province ) . Among these cyclones , ten will be typhoons , with five having the potential to be destructive ones . The Philippines is the most exposed country in the world to tropical storms according to a Time Magazine article in 2013 . In the Philippine languages , tropical cyclones are generally called bagyo . Typhoons can hit the Philippines any time of year , with the months of June to September being most active , with August being the most active individual month and May the least active . Typhoons move east to west across the country , heading north as they go . Storms most frequently make landfall on the islands of Eastern Visayas , Bicol region , and northern Luzon whereas the southern island and region of Mindanao is largely free of typhoons . Climate change is likely to worsen the situation with the extreme weather events including typhoons posing various risks and threats to the Philippines . The deadliest overall tropical cyclone to affect the Philippines is believed to have been the Haiphong typhoon which is estimated to have killed up to 20,000 people as it passed over the country in September 1881 . In modern meteorological records , the deadliest storm was Typhoon Yolanda ( international name Haiyan ) , which became the strongest landfalling tropical cyclone ever recorded as it crossed the Visayas in central Philippines on November 7-8 , 2013 . The wettest known tropical cyclone to impact the archipelago was the July 14-18 , 1911 cyclone which dropped over 2,210 millimetres ( 87 in ) of rainfall within a 3-day , 15-hour period in Baguio . Tropical cyclones usually account for at least 30 percent of the annual rainfall in the northern Philippines while being responsible for less than 10 percent of the annual rainfall in the southern islands .",
  "/wiki/Typhoon": "A typhoon is a mature tropical cyclone that develops between 180\u00b0 and 100\u00b0E in the Northern Hemisphere . This region is referred to as the Northwestern Pacific Basin , and is the most active tropical cyclone basin on Earth , accounting for almost one-third of the world 's annual tropical cyclones . For organizational purposes , the northern Pacific Ocean is divided into three regions : the eastern ( North America to 140\u00b0W ) , central ( 140\u00b0W to 180\u00b0 ) , and western ( 180\u00b0 to 100\u00b0E ) . The Regional Specialized Meteorological Center ( RSMC ) for tropical cyclone forecasts is in Japan , with other tropical cyclone warning centers for the northwest Pacific in Hawaii ( the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ) , the Philippines and Hong Kong . While the RSMC names each system , the main name list itself is coordinated among 18 countries that have territories threatened by typhoons each year . Within the northwestern Pacific , there are no official typhoon seasons as tropical cyclones form throughout the year . Like any tropical cyclone , there are few main requirements for typhoon formation and development : ( 1 ) sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures , ( 2 ) atmospheric instability , ( 3 ) high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere , ( 4 ) enough Coriolis effect to develop a low pressure center , ( 5 ) a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance , and ( 6 ) a low vertical wind shear . While the majority of storms form between June and November , a few storms do occur between December and May ( although tropical cyclone formation is at a minimum during that time ) . On average , the northwestern Pacific features the most numerous and intense tropical cyclones globally . Like other basins , they are steered by the subtropical ridge towards the west or northwest , with some systems recurving near and east of Japan . The Philippines receive the brunt of the landfalls , with China and Japan being impacted slightly less . Some of the deadliest typhoons in history have struck China .",
  "/wiki/Hurricane": "A tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by a low-pressure center , a closed low-level atmospheric circulation , strong winds , and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain or squalls . Depending on its location and strength , a tropical cyclone is referred to by different names , including hurricane ( /\u02c8h\u028cr\u026ak\u0259n , -ke\u026an/ ) , typhoon ( /ta\u026a\u02c8fu\u02d0n/ ) , tropical storm , cyclonic storm , tropical depression , and simply cyclone . A hurricane is a tropical cyclone that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean , and a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean ; in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean , comparable storms are referred to simply as tropical cyclones or severe cyclonic storms . Tropical refers to the geographical origin of these systems , which form almost exclusively over tropical seas . Cyclone refers to their winds moving in a circle , whirling round their central clear eye , with their winds blowing counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere . The opposite direction of circulation is due to the Coriolis effect . Tropical cyclones typically form over large bodies of relatively warm water . They derive their energy through the evaporation of water from the ocean surface , which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when moist air rises and cools to saturation . This energy source differs from that of mid-latitude cyclonic storms , such as nor'easters and European windstorms , which are fueled primarily by horizontal temperature contrasts . Tropical cyclones are typically between 100 and 2,000 km ( 62 and 1,243 mi ) in diameter . The strong rotating winds of a tropical cyclone are a result of the conservation of angular momentum imparted by the Earth 's rotation as air flows inwards toward the axis of rotation . As a result , they rarely form within 5\u00b0 of the equator .",
  "/wiki/Barangay": "A barangay ( /b\u0251\u02d0r\u0251\u02d0\u014b\u02c8\u0261a\u026a/ ( abbreviated as Brgy . or Bgy. , may also be as Bo . ) , sometimes referred to as barrio , is the smallest administrative division in the Philippines and is the native Filipino term for a village , district or ward . In metropolitan areas , the term often refers to an inner city neighbourhood , a suburb or a suburban neighborhood . The word barangay originated from balangay , a kind of boat used by a group of Austronesian peoples when they migrated to the Philippines . Municipalities and cities in the Philippines are subdivided into barangays , with the exception of the municipalities of Adams in Ilocos Norte and Kalayaan , Palawan which each contain only one barangay . The barangay itself is sometimes informally subdivided into smaller areas called purok ( English : zone ) , barangay zones consisting of a cluster of houses , and sitios , which are territorial enclaves - usually rural - far from the barangay center . As of May 2019 [ update ] , there were 42,045 barangays throughout the Philippines .",

It is used particularly in the Philippines , the jungles of Indonesia , Malaysia and Brunei , as well as in the sugar fields of Cuba . The primary use for the bolo is clearing vegetation , whether for agriculture or during trail blazing . The bolo is also used in Filipino martial arts or Arnis as part of training .",
  "/wiki/Visayan_languages": "The Bisayan languages or the Visayan languages are a subgroup of the Austronesian languages spoken in the Philippines . They are most closely related to Tagalog and the Bikol languages , all of which are part of the Central Philippine languages . Most Bisayan languages are spoken in the whole Visayas section of the country , but they are also spoken in the southern part of the Bicol Region ( particularly in Masbate ) , islands south of Luzon , such as those that make up Romblon , most of the areas of Mindanao and the province of Sulu located southwest of Mindanao . Some residents of Metro Manila also speak one of the Bisayan languages . Over 30 languages constitute the Bisayan language family . The Bisayan language with the most speakers is Cebuano , spoken by 20 million people as a native language in Central Visayas , parts of Eastern Visayas , and most of Mindanao . Two other well-known and widespread Bisayan languages are Hiligaynon ( Ilonggo ) , spoken by 10 million in most of Western Visayas and SOCCSKSARGEN ; and Waray-Waray , spoken by 3 million in Eastern Visayas . Prior to colonization , the script and calligraphy of most of the Visayan peoples was the badlit , distinct from the Tagalog baybayin .",

  "/wiki/Old_Malay_language": "Malay is a major language of the Austronesian language family . Over a period of two millennia , from a form that probably consisted of only 157 original words , [ clarification needed ] Malay has undergone various stages of development that derived from different layers of foreign influences through international trade , religious expansion , colonisation and developments of new socio-political trends . The oldest form of Malay is descended from the Proto-Malayo-Polynesian language spoken by the earliest Austronesian settlers in Southeast Asia . This form would later evolved into Old Malay when Indian cultures and religions began penetrating the region . Old Malay contained some terms that exist today , but are unintelligible to modern speakers , while the modern language is already largely recognisable in written Classical Malay of 1303 CE . Malay evolved extensively into Classical Malay through the gradual influx of numerous Arabic and Persian vocabulary , when Islam made its way to the region . Initially , Classical Malay was a diverse group of dialects , reflecting the varied origins of the Malay kingdoms of Southeast Asia . One of these dialects that was developed in the literary tradition of Melaka in the 15th century , eventually became predominant . The strong influence of Melaka in international trade in the region resulted in Malay as a lingua franca in commerce and diplomacy , a status that it maintained throughout the age of the succeeding Malay sultanates , the European colonial era and the modern times . From 19th to 20th century , Malay evolved progressively through a significant grammatical improvements and lexical enrichment into a modern language with more than 800,000 phrases in various disciplines .",
  "/wiki/Kora_Kora": "A kora-kora or kora kora or coracora is a traditional canoe from the Maluku ( Moluccas ) Islands , Indonesia . It is approximately ten metres long and very narrow , quite open , very low , and weighs about four tons . It had outriggers of bamboo about five feet off each side , which supported a bamboo platform extending the whole length of the vessel . On the extreme outside of this sit the twenty rowers ( overall it needs 40 paddlers ) , while within was a convenient passage fore and aft . The middle portion of the boat is covered with a thatch-house , in which baggage and passengers are stowed . The gunwale is not more than a foot above water , and suffer the great top and side weight . According to Robert Dick-Read , every leader in the Maluku region has its own ship , the leader 's status depends on the number of slaves , who come from a distant island , which he captures and collects . Each ship is rowed by 300 rowers , supported by men armed with spears , blowgun , arrows , and swords in a higher fighting platform called 'balai ' . The vessel has two steering wheels on the side , a tall pole in the stern and bow that decorated with ribbons . In the past , these poles were adorned with conquered enemy heads .",

  "/wiki/Fan_(implement)": "A handheld fan , or simply hand fan , may be any broad , flat surface that is waved back-and-forth to create an airflow . Generally , purpose-made handheld fans are folding fans , which are shaped like a sector of a circle and made of a thin material ( such as paper or feathers ) mounted on slats which revolve around a pivot so that it can be closed when not in use . On human skin , the airflow from handfans increases evaporation which has a cooling effect due to the latent heat of evaporation of water . It also increases heat convection by displacing the warmer air produced by body heat that surrounds the skin , which has an additional cooling effect , provided that the ambient air temperature is lower than the skin temperature - which is typically about 33 \u00b0C ( 91 \u00b0F ) . Fans are convenient to carry around , especially folding fans . Next to the folding fan , the rigid hand screen fan was also a highly decorative and desired object among the higher classes . Its purpose is different since they are more cumbersome to carry around . They were mostly used to shield the lady 's face against the glare of the sun or the fire .",

  "/wiki/Pier": "A pier is a raised structure in a body of water , typically supported by piles or pillars . Bridges , buildings , and walkways may all be supported by piers . Their open structure allows tides and currents to flow relatively unhindered , whereas the more solid foundations of a quay or the closely spaced piles of a wharf can act as a breakwater , and are consequently more liable to silting . Piers can range in size and complexity from a simple lightweight wooden structure to major structures extended over 1,600 m ( 5,200 ft ) . In American English , a pier may be synonymous with a dock . Piers have been built for several purposes , and because these different purposes have distinct regional variances , the term pier tends to have different nuances of meaning in different parts of the world . Thus in North America and Australia , where many ports were , until recently , built on the multiple pier model , the term tends to imply a current or former cargo-handling facility . In Europe in contrast , where ports more often use basins and river-side quays than piers , the term is principally associated with the image of a Victorian cast iron pleasure pier . However , the earliest piers pre-date the Victorian age .",
  "/wiki/Pirate_ship": "Piracy is an act of robbery or criminal violence by ship or boat-borne attackers upon another ship or a coastal area , typically with the goal of stealing cargo and other valuable items or properties . Those who engage in acts of piracy are called pirates . The earliest documented instances of piracy were in the 14th century BC , when the Sea Peoples , a group of ocean raiders , attacked the ships of the Aegean and Mediterranean civilizations . Narrow channels which funnel shipping into predictable routes have long created opportunities for piracy , as well as for privateering and commerce raiding . Historic examples include the waters of Gibraltar , the Strait of Malacca , Madagascar , the Gulf of Aden , and the English Channel , whose geographic structures facilitated pirate attacks . A land-based parallel is the ambushing of travelers by bandits and brigands in highways and mountain passes . Privateering uses similar methods to piracy , but the captain acts under orders of the state authorizing the capture of merchant ships belonging to an enemy nation , making it a legitimate form of war-like activity by non-state actors . While the term can include acts committed in the air , on land ( especially across national borders or in connection with taking over and robbing a car or train ) , or in other major bodies of water or on a shore , in cyberspace , as well as the fictional possibility of space piracy , it generally refers to maritime piracy . It does not normally include crimes committed against people traveling on the same vessel as the perpetrator ( e.g . one passenger stealing from others on the same vessel ) . Piracy or pirating is the name of a specific crime under customary international law and also the name of a number of crimes under the municipal law of a number of states . In the early 21st century , seaborne piracy against transport vessels remains a significant issue ( with estimated worldwide losses of US $ 16 billion per year in 2004 ) , particularly in the waters between the Red Sea and Indian Ocean , off the Somali coast , and also in the Strait of Malacca and Singapore .",

  "/wiki/Bamboo": "Bamboos /b\u00e6m\u02c8bu\u02d0/ ( listen ) are evergreen perennial flowering plants in the subfamily Bambusoideae of the grass family Poaceae . The word bamboo comes from the Dutch or Portuguese languages , which probably borrowed it from Malay . In bamboo , as in other grasses , the internodal regions of the stem are usually hollow and the vascular bundles in the cross-section are scattered throughout the stem instead of in a cylindrical arrangement . The dicotyledonous woody xylem is also absent . The absence of secondary growth wood causes the stems of monocots , including the palms and large bamboos , to be columnar rather than tapering . Bamboos include some of the fastest-growing plants in the world , due to a unique rhizome-dependent system . Certain species of bamboo can grow 910 mm ( 36 in ) within a 24-hour period , at a rate of almost 40 mm ( 1.6 in ) an hour ( a growth around 1 mm every 90 seconds , or 1 inch every 40 minutes ) . Giant bamboos are the largest members of the grass family . Bamboos are of notable economic and cultural significance in South Asia , Southeast Asia and East Asia , being used for building materials , as a food source , and as a versatile raw product . Bamboo , like wood , is a natural composite material with a high strength-to-weight ratio useful for structures . Bamboo 's strength-to-weight ratio is similar to timber , and its strength is generally similar to a strong softwood or hardwood timber .",

  "/wiki/Old_Chinese": "Old Chinese , also called Archaic Chinese in older works , is the oldest attested stage of Chinese , and the ancestor of all modern varieties of Chinese . [ a ] The earliest examples of Chinese are divinatory inscriptions on oracle bones from around 1250 BC , in the late Shang dynasty . Bronze inscriptions became plentiful during the following Zhou dynasty . The latter part of the Zhou period saw a flowering of literature , including classical works such as the Analects , the Mencius , and the Zuo zhuan . These works served as models for Literary Chinese ( or Classical Chinese ) , which remained the written standard until the early twentieth century , thus preserving the vocabulary and grammar of late Old Chinese . Old Chinese was written with several early forms of Chinese characters , including Oracle Bone , Bronze , and Seal scripts . Throughout the Old Chinese period , there was a close correspondence between a character and a monosyllabic and monomorphemic word . Although the script is not alphabetic , the majority of characters were created based on phonetic considerations . At first , words that were difficult to represent visually were written using a borrowed character for a similar-sounding word ( rebus principle ) . Later on , to reduce ambiguity , new characters were created for these phonetic borrowings by appending a radical that conveys a broad semantic category , resulting in compound xingsheng ( phono-semantic ) characters . For the earliest attested stage of Old Chinese of the late Shang dynasty , the phonetic information implicit in these xingsheng characters which are grouped into phonetic series , known as the xiesheng series , represents the only direct source of phonological data for reconstructing the language . The corpus of xingsheng characters was greatly expanded in the following Zhou dynasty .",
