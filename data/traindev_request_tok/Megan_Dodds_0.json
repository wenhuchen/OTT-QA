The novel is an example of a country house mystery and was the first of her novels in four years to feature Christie 's Belgian detective Hercule Poirot - one of the longest gaps in the entire series . Christie , who often admitted that she did not like Poirot ( a fact parodied by her recurring novelist character Ariadne Oliver ) , particularly disliked his appearance in this novel . His late arrival , jarring , given the established atmosphere , led Christie to claim in her Autobiography that she ruined the novel by the introduction of Poirot . Agatha Christie 's successful career foresaw the use of her eight owned houses as settings for her novels , which were Taken at the Flood , Dead Man 's Folly , Five Little Pigs , A Pocket Full of Rye , and Crooked House . However , the setting for The Hollow was inspired by Francis L. Sullivan 's house . Francis Loftus Sullivan was an English film and stage actor who portrayed Hercule Poirot in the plays Black Coffee ( 1930 ) and Peril at End House ( 1932 ) and also played the lead in The Witness for the Prosecution ( 1953 ) , for which he won a Tony Award in 1955 .",
