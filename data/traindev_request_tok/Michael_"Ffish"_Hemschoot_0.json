The visual scenes may be dynamic or static and may be two-dimensional ( 2D ) , though the term CGI is most commonly used to refer to 3D computer graphics used for creating scenes or special effects in films and television . Additionally , the use of 2D CGI is often mistakenly referred to as traditional animation , most often in the case when dedicated animation software such as Adobe Flash or Toon Boom is not used or the CGI is hand drawn using a tablet and mouse . The term 'CGI animation ' refers to dynamic CGI rendered as a movie . The term virtual world refers to agent-based , interactive environments . Computer graphics software is used to make computer-generated imagery for films , etc . Availability of CGI software and increased computer speeds have allowed individual artists and small companies to produce professional-grade films , games , and fine art from their home computers . This has brought about an Internet subculture with its own set of global celebrities , clich\u00e9s , and technical vocabulary .

  "/wiki/Animator": "An animator is an artist who creates multiple images , known as frames , which give an illusion of movement called animation when displayed in rapid sequence . Animators can work in a variety of fields including film , television , and video games . Animation is closely related to filmmaking and like filmmaking is extremely labor-intensive , which means that most significant works require the collaboration of several animators . The methods of creating the images or frames for an animation piece depend on the animators ' artistic styles and their field . Other artists who contribute to animated cartoons , but who are not animators , include layout artists ( who design the backgrounds , lighting , and camera angles ) , storyboard artists ( who draw panels of the action from the script ) , and background artists ( who paint the scenery ) . Animated films share some film crew positions with regular live action films , such as director , producer , sound engineer , and editor , but differ radically in that for most of the history of animation , they did not need most of the crew positions seen on a physical set . In hand-drawn Japanese animation productions , such as in Hayao Miyazaki 's films , the key animator handles both layout and key animation . Some animators in Japan such as Mitsuo Iso take full responsibility for their scenes , making them become more than just the key animator .",

  "/wiki/Down_with_Love": "Down with Love is a 2003 American romantic comedy film directed by Peyton Reed and written by Eve Ahlert and Dennis Drake .

Time film critic Richard Corliss , estimating conservatively , wrote that Down with Love is so clogged with specific references to a half-dozen Rock-and-Doris-type comedies that it serves as definitive distillation of the genre . Randall himself plays a small role in Down with Love , bestowing his sly , patriarchal blessing on the film that also stars David Hyde Pierce ( in the neurotic best friend role often played by Randall or Gig Young ) , Sarah Paulson , Rachel Dratch , Jeri Ryan , and Jack Plotnick , who spoofs the kind of role Chet Stratton played in Lover Come Back . Typical of the genre the film tells the story of a woman who advocates female independence in combat with a lothario , the plot reflects the attitudes and behaviour of the early pre-sexual revolution 1960s but has an anachronistic conclusion driven by more modern , post-feminist ideas and attitudes .",
