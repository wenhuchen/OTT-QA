  "/wiki/Real-time_strategy": "Real-time strategy ( RTS ) is a sub-genre of strategy video games in which the game does not progress incrementally in turns . This is distinguished from turn-based strategy ( TBS ) , in which all players take turns when playing . In an RTS , the participants position and maneuver units and structures under their control to secure areas of the map and/or destroy their opponents ' assets . In a typical RTS , it is possible to create additional units and structures during the course of a game . This is generally limited by a requirement to expend accumulated resources . These resources are in turn garnered by controlling special points on the map and/or possessing certain types of units and structures devoted to this purpose . More specifically , the typical game of the RTS genre features resource gathering , base building , in-game technological development and indirect control of units . The term real-time strategy was coined by Brett Sperry to market Dune II in the early 1990s . The tasks a player must perform to succeed at an RTS can be very demanding , and complex user interfaces have evolved to cope with the challenge . Some features have been borrowed from desktop environments ; for example , the technique of clicking and dragging to select all units under a given area . Though some game genres share conceptual and gameplay similarities with the RTS template , recognized genres are generally not subsumed as RTS games . For instance , city-building games , construction and management simulations , and games of the real-time tactics variety are generally not considered to be real-time strategy .",

  "/wiki/Activision": "Activision Publishing , Inc. is an American video game publisher based in Santa Monica , California . It currently serves as the publishing business for its parent company , Activision Blizzard , and consists of several subsidiary studios . Activision is one of the largest third-party video game publishers in the world and was the top United States publisher in 2016 . The company was founded as Activision , Inc. in October 1979 in Sunnyvale , California , by former Atari game developers , upset at how they were treated at Atari , to develop their own games for the popular Atari 2600 home video game console . Activision was the first independent , third-party , console video game developer . The 1983 video game crash , in part created by too many new companies trying to follow in Activision 's footsteps without the expertise of Activision 's founders , hurt Activision 's position in console games , forcing them to diversify into games for home computers , including the acquisition of Infocom . After a management shift , with CEO Jim Levy replaced by Bruce Davis , the company renamed itself as Mediagenic and branched out into business software applications . Mediagenic quickly fell into debt , and the company was bought for around US $ 500,000 by Bobby Kotick and a small group of investors around 1991 . Kotick instituted a full rework of the company to cover its debts : dismissing most of its staff , moving the company to Los Angeles , and reverting to the Activision name . Building on existing assets , the Kotick-led Activision pursued more publishing opportunities and , after recovering from the former debt , started acquiring numerous studios and intellectual properties over the 1990s and 2000s , among these being the Call of Duty and Guitar Hero series . A holding company was formed as Activision 's parent company to manage the internal and acquired studios . In 2008 , this holding merged with Vivendi Games ( the parent company of Blizzard Entertainment ) and formed Activision Blizzard , with Kotick as its CEO .",
  "/wiki/Music": "Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time . General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch ( which governs melody and harmony ) , rhythm ( and its associated concepts tempo , meter , and articulation ) , dynamics ( loudness and softness ) , and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture ( which are sometimes termed the color of a musical sound ) . Different styles or types of music may emphasize , de-emphasize or omit some of these elements . Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping ; there are solely instrumental pieces , solely vocal pieces ( such as songs without instrumental accompaniment ) and pieces that combine singing and instruments . The word derives from Greek \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae ( mousike ; art of the Muses ) . See glossary of musical terminology . In its most general form , the activities describing music as an art form or cultural activity include the creation of works of music ( songs , tunes , symphonies , and so on ) , the criticism of music , the study of the history of music , and the aesthetic examination of music . Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies . Common sayings such as the harmony of the spheres and it is music to my ears point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to . However , 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music , saying , for example , There is no noise , only sound . The creation , performance , significance , and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context . Indeed , throughout history , some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as not being music , including Beethoven 's Grosse Fuge string quartet in 1825 , early jazz in the beginning of the 1900s and hardcore punk in the 1980s .",

  "/wiki/Platform_game": "Platform games , or platformers , are a video game genre and subgenre of action game . In a platformer , the player controlled character must jump and climb between suspended platforms while avoiding obstacles . Environments often feature uneven terrain of varying height that must be traversed . The player often has some control over the height and distance of jumps to avoid letting their character fall to their death or miss necessary jumps . The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button , but now there are other alternatives like swiping a touchscreen . Other acrobatic maneuvers may factor into the gameplay as well , such as swinging from objects such as vines or grappling hooks , as in Ristar or Bionic Commando , or bouncing from springboards or trampolines , as in Alpha Waves . These mechanics , even in the context of other genres , are commonly called platforming , a verbification of platform . Games where jumping is automated completely , such as 3D games in The Legend of Zelda series , fall outside of the genre . Platform games originated in the early 1980s , which were often about climbing ladders as much as jumping , with 3D successors popularized in the mid-1990s . The term describes games where jumping on platforms is an integral part of the gameplay and came into use after the genre had been established , no later than 1983 . The genre is frequently combined with elements of other genres , such as the shooter elements in Contra , Beat 'em up elements of Viewtiful Joe , adventure elements of Flashback , or role-playing game elements of Castlevania : Symphony of the Night . While commonly associated with console gaming , there have been many important platform games released to video arcades , as well as for handheld game consoles and home computers .",
