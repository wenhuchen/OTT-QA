  "/wiki/Spiderwebs": "A spider web , spiderweb , spider 's web , or cobweb ( from the archaic word coppe , meaning spider ) is a structure created by a spider out of proteinaceous spider silk extruded from its spinnerets , generally meant to catch its prey . Spider webs have existed for at least 100 million years , as witnessed in a rare find of Early Cretaceous amber from Sussex , southern England . Many spiders build webs specifically to catch insects to eat . However , not all spiders catch their prey in webs , and some do not build webs at all . Spider web is typically used to refer to a web that is apparently still in use ( i.e . clean ) , whereas cobweb refers to abandoned ( i.e . dusty ) webs . However , the word cobweb is also used by biologists to describe the tangled three-dimensional web of some spiders of the Theridiidae family . While this large family is known as the cobweb spiders , they actually have a huge range of web architectures ; other names for this spider family include tangle-web spiders and comb-footed spiders .",
