  "/wiki/Commonwealth_Scientific_and_Industrial_Research_Organisation": "The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ( CSIRO ) is an Australian federal government agency responsible for scientific research . Its chief role is to improve the economic and social performance of industry for the benefit of the commonwealth . CSIRO works with leading organisations around the world . From its headquarters in Canberra , CSIRO maintains more than 50 sites across Australia and in France , Chile and the United States , employing about 5,500 people . Federally funded scientific research began in Australia 103 years ago . The Advisory Council of Science and Industry was established in 1916 but was hampered by insufficient available finance . In 1926 the research effort was reinvigorated by establishment of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research ( CSIR ) , which strengthened national science leadership and increased research funding . CSIR grew rapidly and achieved significant early successes . [ citation needed ] In 1949 further legislated changes included renaming the organisation as CSIRO . [ citation needed ] Notable developments by CSIRO have included the invention of atomic absorption spectroscopy , essential components of Wi-Fi technology , development of the first commercially successful polymer banknote , the invention of the insect repellent in Aerogard and the introduction of a series of biological controls into Australia , such as the introduction of myxomatosis and rabbit calicivirus for the control of rabbit populations .",

  "/wiki/Cybernetics": "Cybernetics is a transdisciplinary approach for exploring regulatory systems - their structures , constraints , and possibilities . Norbert Wiener defined cybernetics in 1948 as the scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine . In other words , it is the scientific study of how humans , animals and machines control and communicate with each other . Cybernetics is applicable when a system being analyzed incorporates a closed signaling loop - originally referred to as a circular causal relationship - that is , where action by the system generates some change in its environment and that change is reflected in the system in some manner ( feedback ) that triggers a system change . Cybernetics is relevant to , for example , mechanical , physical , biological , cognitive , and social systems . The essential goal of the broad field of cybernetics is to understand and define the functions and processes of systems that have goals and that participate in circular , causal chains that move from action to sensing to comparison with desired goal , and again to action . Its focus is how anything ( digital , mechanical or biological ) processes information , reacts to information , and changes or can be changed to better accomplish the first two tasks . Cybernetics includes the study of feedback , black boxes and derived concepts such as communication and control in living organisms , machines and organizations including self-organization . Concepts studied by cyberneticists include , but are not limited to : learning , cognition , adaptation , social control , emergence , convergence , communication , efficiency , efficacy , and connectivity . In cybernetics these concepts ( otherwise already objects of study in other disciplines such as biology and engineering ) are abstracted from the context of the specific organism or device . The word cybernetics comes from Greek \u03ba\u03c5\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae ( kybern\u0113tik\u1e17 ) , meaning governance , i.e. , all that are pertinent to \u03ba\u03c5\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c9 ( kybern\u00e1\u014d ) , the latter meaning to steer , navigate or govern , hence \u03ba\u03c5\u03b2\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 ( kyb\u00e9rn\u0113sis ) , meaning government , is the government while \u03ba\u03c5\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 ( kybern\u1e17t\u0113s ) is the governor or helmperson of the ship .

  "/wiki/Biochemistry": "Biochemistry , sometimes called biological chemistry , is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms . Biochemical processes give rise to the complexity of life . A sub-discipline of both biology and chemistry , biochemistry can be divided in three fields ; structural biology , enzymology and metabolism . Over the last decades of the 20th century , biochemistry has through these three disciplines become successful at explaining living processes . Almost all areas of the life sciences are being uncovered and developed by biochemical methodology and research . Biochemistry focuses on understanding the chemical basis which allows biological molecules to give rise to the processes that occur within living cells and between cells , which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of tissues , organs , and organism structure and function . Biochemistry is closely related to molecular biology , the study of the molecular mechanisms of biological phenomena . Much of biochemistry deals with the structures , functions and interactions of biological macromolecules , such as proteins , nucleic acids , carbohydrates and lipids , which provide the structure of cells and perform many of the functions associated with life . The chemistry of the cell also depends on the reactions of smaller molecules and ions . These can be inorganic , for example water and metal ions , or organic , for example the amino acids , which are used to synthesize proteins . The mechanisms by which cells harness energy from their environment via chemical reactions are known as metabolism . The findings of biochemistry are applied primarily in medicine , nutrition , and agriculture .",
  "/wiki/Glycoprotein": "Glycoproteins are proteins which contain oligosaccharide chains ( glycans ) covalently attached to amino acid side-chains . The carbohydrate is attached to the protein in a cotranslational or posttranslational modification . This process is known as glycosylation . Secreted extracellular proteins are often glycosylated . In proteins that have segments extending extracellularly , the extracellular segments are also often glycosylated . Glycoproteins are also often important integral membrane proteins , where they play a role in cell-cell interactions . It is important [ according to whom ? ] to distinguish endoplasmic reticulum-based glycosylation of the secretory system from reversible cytosolic-nuclear glycosylation . Glycoproteins of the cytosol and nucleus can be modified through the reversible addition of a single GlcNAc residue that is considered reciprocal to phosphorylation and the functions of these are likely to be additional regulatory mechanism that controls phosphorylation-based signalling . In contrast , classical secretory glycosylation can be structurally essential . For example , inhibition of asparagine-linked , i.e . N-linked , glycosylation can prevent proper glycoprotein folding and full inhibition can be toxic to an individual cell .",

The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City ; other main offices are in Geneva , Nairobi , Vienna and The Hague . The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars , succeeding the ineffective League of Nations . On 25 April 1945 , 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter , which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945 , when the UN began operations . Pursuant to the Charter , the organization 's objectives include maintaining international peace and security , protecting human rights , delivering humanitarian aid , promoting sustainable development , and upholding international law . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; this number grew to 193 in 2011 , representing the vast majority of the world 's sovereign states . The organization 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies .

  "/wiki/Astronomer": "An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who focuses their studies on a specific question or field outside the scope of Earth . They observe astronomical objects such as stars , planets , moons , comets and galaxies - in either observational ( by analyzing the data ) or theoretical astronomy . Examples of topics or fields astronomers study include planetary science , solar astronomy , the origin or evolution of stars , or the formation of galaxies . Related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology , which studies the Universe as a whole . Astronomers usually fall under either of two main types : observational and theoretical . Observational astronomers make direct observations of celestial objects and analyze the data . In contrast , theoretical astronomers create and investigate models of things that can not be observed . Because it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle , astronomers must observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form , evolve , and die . They use these data to create models or simulations to theorize how different celestial objects work . Further subcategories under these two main branches of astronomy include planetary astronomy , galactic astronomy , or physical cosmology .",
  "/wiki/Physicist": "A physicist is a scientist who specializes in the field of physics , which encompasses the interactions of matter and energy at all length and time scales in the physical universe . Physicists generally are interested in the root or ultimate causes of phenomena , and usually frame their understanding in mathematical terms . Physicists work across a wide range of research fields , spanning all length scales : from sub-atomic and particle physics , through biological physics , to cosmological length scales encompassing the universe as a whole . The field generally includes two types of physicists : experimental physicists who specialize in the observation of physical phenomena and the analysis of experiments , and theoretical physicists who specialize in mathematical modeling of physical systems to rationalize , explain and predict natural phenomena . Physicists can apply their knowledge towards solving practical problems or to developing new technologies ( also known as applied physics or engineering physics ) .",

  "/wiki/Ferrari": "Ferrari ( /f\u0259\u02c8r\u0251\u02d0ri/ ; Italian : [ fer\u02c8ra\u02d0ri ] ) is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer based in Maranello . Founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1939 out of Alfa Romeo 's race division as Auto Avio Costruzioni , the company built its first car in 1940 . However , the company 's inception as an auto manufacturer is usually recognized in 1947 , when the first Ferrari-badged car was completed . In 2014 Ferrari was rated the world 's most powerful brand by Brand Finance . In June 2018 , the 1964 250 GTO became the most expensive car in history , setting an all-time record selling price of $ 70 million . Fiat S.p.A. acquired 50% of Ferrari in 1969 and expanded its stake to 90% in 1988 . In October 2014 Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. ( FCA ) announced its intentions to separate Ferrari S.p.A. from FCA ; as of the announcement FCA owned 90% of Ferrari . The separation began in October 2015 with a restructuring that established Ferrari N.V. ( a company incorporated in the Netherlands ) as the new holding company of the Ferrari group and the subsequent sale by FCA of 10% of the shares in an IPO and concurrent listing of common shares on the New York Stock Exchange . Through the remaining steps of the separation , FCA 's interest in Ferrari 's business was distributed to shareholders of FCA , with 10% continuing to be owned by Piero Ferrari . The spin-off was completed on 3 January 2016 . Throughout its history , the company has been noted for its continued participation in racing , especially in Formula One , where it is the oldest and most successful racing team , holding the most constructors championships ( 16 ) and having produced the highest number of drivers ' championship wins ( 15 ) . Ferrari road cars are generally seen as a symbol of speed , luxury and wealth .",
  "/wiki/Formula_One": "Formula One ( also known as Formula 1 or F1 ) is the highest class of single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile ( FIA ) and owned by the Formula One Group . The World Drivers ' Championship , which became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981 , has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950 . The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants ' cars must conform . A Formula One season consists of a series of races , known as Grands Prix ( French for 'grand prizes ' or 'great prizes ' ) , which take place worldwide on purpose-built circuits and on public roads . The results of each race are evaluated using a points system to determine two annual World Championships : one for drivers , the other for constructors . Drivers must hold valid Super Licences , the highest class of racing licence issued by the FIA . The races must run on tracks graded 1 ( formerly A ) , the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA . Most events occur in rural locations on purpose-built tracks , but several events take place on city streets . Formula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world , owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce . The cars underwent major changes in 2017 , allowing wider front and rear wings , and wider tyres , resulting in peak cornering forces near 6.5 lateral g and top speeds of up to approximately 350 km/h ( 215 mph ) . As of 2019 [ update ] the hybrid engines are limited in performance to a maximum of 15,000 rpm , the cars are very dependent on electronics and aerodynamics , suspension and tyres . Traction control and other driving aids have been banned since 2008 ."
