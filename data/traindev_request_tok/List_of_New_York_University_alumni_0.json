The university is organized into eight colleges on two campuses in Lincoln with over 100 classroom buildings and research facilities . Nebraska 's athletic programs , known as the Cornhuskers , compete in NCAA Division I and are a member of the Big Ten Conference . NU 's football team has won 46 conference championships and claims five national championships , with an additional nine unclaimed . The school 's volleyball team has won five titles and appeared in the national semifinal nine other times . NU plays its home football games at Memorial Stadium and has sold out every game since 1962 .

  "/wiki/Ayn_Rand": "Ayn Rand ( /a\u026an/ ; born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum ; [ a ] February 2 [ O.S . January 20 ] 1905 - March 6 , 1982 ) was a Russian-American writer and philosopher . She is known for her two best-selling novels , The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged , and for developing a philosophical system she named Objectivism . Educated in Russia , she moved to the United States in 1926 . She had a play produced on Broadway in 1935 and 1936 . After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful , she achieved fame with her 1943 novel , The Fountainhead . In 1957 , Rand published her best-known work , the novel Atlas Shrugged . Afterward , she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy , publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982 . Rand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge and rejected faith and religion . She supported rational and ethical egoism and rejected altruism . In politics , she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism , instead supporting laissez-faire capitalism , which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights , including property rights . In art , Rand promoted romantic realism .",
  "/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)": "Objectivism is a philosophical system developed by Russian-American writer Ayn Rand . Rand first expressed Objectivism in her fiction , most notably The Fountainhead ( 1943 ) and Atlas Shrugged ( 1957 ) , and later in non-fiction essays and books . Leonard Peikoff , a professional philosopher and Rand 's designated intellectual heir , later gave it a more formal structure . Rand described Objectivism as the concept of man as a heroic being , with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life , with productive achievement as his noblest activity , and reason as his only absolute . Peikoff characterizes Objectivism as a closed system insofar as its fundamental principles were set out by Rand and are not subject to change . However , he stated that new implications , applications and integrations can always be discovered . Objectivism 's main tenets are that reality exists independently of consciousness , that human beings have direct contact with reality through sense perception ( see direct and indirect realism ) , that one can attain objective knowledge from perception through the process of concept formation and inductive logic , that the proper moral purpose of one 's life is the pursuit of one 's own happiness ( see rational egoism ) , that the only social system consistent with this morality is one that displays full respect for individual rights embodied in laissez-faire capitalism , and that the role of art in human life is to transform humans ' metaphysical ideas by selective reproduction of reality into a physical form - a work of art - that one can comprehend and to which one can respond emotionally . Academic philosophers have mostly ignored or rejected Rand 's philosophy . Nonetheless , Objectivism has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives . The Objectivist movement , which Rand founded , attempts to spread her ideas to the public and in academic settings .",
