  "/wiki/Sports_league": "A sports league is a group of sports teams that compete against each other in a specific sport . At its simplest , it may be a local group of amateur athletes who form teams among themselves and compete on weekends ; at its most complex , it can be an international professional league making large amounts of money and involving dozens of teams and thousands of players .",
  "/wiki/League_system": "A league system is a hierarchy of leagues in a sport . They are often called pyramids , due to their tendency to split into an increasing number of regional divisions further down the system . League systems of some sort are used in many sports in many countries . In association football , rugby union and rugby league , league systems are usually connected by the process of promotion and relegation , in which teams from a lower division who finish at the top of the standings in their league are promoted ( advanced to the next level of the system ) while teams who finish lowest in their division are relegated ( move down to a lower division ) . This process can be automatic each year , or can require playoffs . In North America , league systems in the most popular sports do not use promotion or relegation . Most professional sports are divided into major and minor leagues . Baseball and association football ( known as soccer in North America ) have well-defined pyramid shapes to their minor league hierarchies , each managed by a governing body ( Minor League Baseball , an organization under the authority of the Commissioner of Baseball , governs baseball leagues ; the United States Soccer Federation designates the American soccer pyramid . ) Ice hockey 's professional minor league system is linear , with one league at most of the four levels of the game ; the ice hockey league system in North America is governed by collective bargaining agreements and affiliation deals between the NHL , AHL and ECHL . Gridiron football does not operate on a league system . Different professional leagues play by very different sets of rules in different seasons ( the NFL plays 11-a-side on a 100-yard field in autumn and early winter , the CFL uses 12-a-side on a 110-yard field in summer and early fall , while arena football and the minor indoor leagues each play 8-a-side on a 50-yard field in the spring and early summer ) . There have been attempts at forming true minor leagues for the professional game ( most recently with 2019 's Alliance of American Football ) ; none so far have been able to balance the major leagues ' requests with the ability to maintain financial solvency .",
  "/wiki/Association_football": "Association football , more commonly known as football or soccer , [ a ] is a team sport played with a spherical ball between two teams of 11 players . It is played by approximately 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies , making it the world 's most popular sport . The game is played on a rectangular field called a pitch with a goal at each end . The object of the game is to score by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing goal . Football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game . The ball is 68-70 cm ( 27-28 in ) in circumference and known as the football . The two teams each compete to get the ball into the other team 's goal ( between the posts and under the bar ) , thereby scoring a goal . The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner ; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw . Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game : to represent their team in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks . Players are not allowed to touch the ball with hands or arms while it is in play , except for the goalkeepers within the penalty area . Other players mainly use their feet to strike or pass the ball , but may also use any other part of their body except the hands and the arms . The team that scores most goals by the end of the match wins .",
