  "/wiki/Mexican_free-tailed_bat": "The Mexican free-tailed bat or Brazilian free-tailed bat ( Tadarida brasiliensis ) is a medium-sized bat native to the Americas , regarded as one of the most abundant mammals in North America . Its proclivity towards roosting in huge numbers at relatively few locations makes it vulnerable to habitat destruction in spite of its abundance . The bat is considered a species of special concern in California as a result of declining populations . It has been claimed to have the fastest horizontal speed ( as opposed to stoop diving speed ) of any animal , reaching top ground speeds over 160 km/h ; its actual air speed has not been measured . The Texas Legislature designated the Mexican free-tailed bat the state mammal ( flying ) in 1995 .",
  "/wiki/Molossidae": "The Molossidae , or free-tailed bats , are a family of bats within the order Chiroptera . The Molossidae comprise the fourth-largest family of bats , containing about 110 species as of 2012 . They are generally quite robust , and consist of many strong-flying forms with relatively long and narrow wings with wrinkled lips shared through their genus . Their strong flying forms allows them to fly 60 miles per hour using tail winds and at altitudes over 10,000 feet . This makes them unique compared to any other bat as they are the only bat who withstand the elevation . They are widespread , being found on every continent except Antarctica . They are typically found in some in caves , abandoned mines , or tunnels .",

  "/wiki/Vespertilionidae": "Vespertilionidae is a family of microbats , of the order Chiroptera , flying , insect-eating mammals variously described as the common , vesper , or simple nosed bats . The vespertilionid family is the most diverse and widely distributed of bat families , specialised in many forms to occupy a range of habitats and ecological circumstances , and it is frequently observed or the subject of research . The facial features of the species are often simple , as they mainly rely on vocally emitted echolocation . The tails of the species are enclosed by the lower flight membranes between the legs . Over 300 species are distributed all over the world , on every continent except Antarctica . It owes its name to the genus Vespertilio , which takes its name from a word for bat , vespertilio , derived from the Latin term vesper meaning 'evening ' ; they are termed as evening bats and once referred to as 'evening birds ' .",
  "/wiki/Big_brown_bat": "The big brown bat ( Eptesicus fuscus ) is a species of vesper bat distributed widely throughout North America , the Caribbean , and the northern portion of South America . It was first described as a species in 1796 . Compared to other microbats , the big brown bat is relatively large , weighing 15-26 g ( 0.53-0.92 oz ) and possessing a wingspan of 32.5-35 cm ( 12.8-13.8 in ) . Big brown bats are insectivorous , consuming a diverse array of insects , particularly night-flying insects , but especially beetles . Some of the beetles it consumes are serious agricultural pests , including cucumber beetles . They are nocturnal , foraging for prey at night and roosting in sheltered areas during the day such as caves , tunnels , tree cavities , and human structures . Their breeding season is in the fall , shortly before their annual hibernation . After hibernation ends in the spring , females form maternity colonies for giving birth to young . Oftentimes only one offspring is produced per litter , though twins are common in the Eastern US . Lifespans of 6.5 years are considered average . The big brown bat occurs widely throughout the US , Canada , Central America , and the Caribbean . Its range extends into parts of South America , found as far south as Colombia and Venezuela .",

  "/wiki/Little_brown_bat": "The little brown bat ( Myotis lucifugus ) is a species of mouse-eared microbat found in North America . It has a small body size and glossy brown fur . It is similar in appearance to several other mouse-eared bats , including the Indiana bat , northern long-eared bat , and Arizona myotis , to which it is closely related . Despite its name , the little brown bat is not closely related to the big brown bat , which belongs to a different genus . Its mating system is polygynandrous , or promiscuous , and females give birth to one offspring annually . The offspring , called pups , are quickly weaned and reach adult size in some dimensions by three weeks old . The little brown bat has a mean lifespan of 6.5 years , though one individual in the wild reached 34 years old . It is nocturnal , foraging for its insect prey at night and roosting in hollow trees or buildings during the day , among less common roost types . It navigates and locates prey with echolocation . It has few natural predators , but may be killed by raptors such as owls , as well as terrestrial predators such as raccoons . Other sources of mortality include diseases such as rabies and white-nose syndrome . White-nose syndrome has been a significant cause of mortality since 2006 , killing over one million little brown bats by 2011 .",

  "/wiki/Gray_bat": "The gray bat ( Myotis grisescens ) is a species of microbat endemic to North America . The creature once flourished in caves all over the southeastern United States , but due to human disturbance , gray bat populations declined severely during the early and mid portion of the 20th century . At one cave alone , the Georgetown Cave in northwestern Alabama , populations declined from 150,000 gray bats to 10,000 by 1969 . 95% of gray bats now only roost in 9 caves . M. grisescens has been listed as federally endangered by the U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service since 1976 , and is protected under the Endangered Species Act . Gray bat populations were estimated at approximately 2 million bats around the time they were placed on the Endangered Species list . By the early 1980s populations of gray bats dropped to 1.6 million . With conservation efforts in place , in 2002 , gray bat populations were estimated to have reached 2.3 million .",

  "/wiki/Eastern_small-footed_myotis": "The eastern small-footed bat ( Myotis leibii ) is a species of vesper bat . It can be found in Ontario and Quebec in Canada and in the Eastern United States . It is among the smallest bats in eastern North America and is known for its small feet and black face-mask . Until recently all North American small-footed Myotis were considered to be Myotis leibii . The western population is now considered to be a separate species , Myotis ciliolabrum . The Eastern small footed bat is rare throughout its range , although the species may be locally abundant where suitable habitat exists . Studies suggest white-nose syndrome has caused declines in their populations . However , most occurrences of this species have only been counted within the past decade or two and are not revisited regularly , making their population status difficult to assess . Additionally , bat populations in the Eastern U.S. have typically been monitored using surveys conducted in caves and mines in the winter , but small-footed bats hibernate in places that make them unlikely to be encountered during these surveys . As a result , numbers of small-footed bats counted in winter tend to be low and relatively variable compared to other species of bats . Many biologists believe the species is stable , having declined little in recent times , but that it is vulnerable , especially in its cave hibernacula .",
  "/wiki/Indiana_bat": "The Indiana bat ( Myotis sodalis ) is a medium-sized mouse-eared bat native to North America .

It is similar in appearance to the more common little brown bat , but is distinguished by its feet size , toe hair length , pink lips , and a keel on the calcar . Indiana bats live in hardwood and hardwood-pine forests . It is common in old-growth forest and in agricultural land , mainly in forest , crop fields , and grasslands . As an insectivore , the bat eats both terrestrial and aquatic flying insects , such as moths , beetles , mosquitoes , and midges . The Indiana bat is listed as an endangered species by the U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service . It has had serious population decline , estimated to be more than 50% over the past 10 years , based on direct observation and a decline on its extent of occurrence .",

  "/wiki/Eastern_pipistrelle": "The tricolored bat ( Perimyotis subflavus ) is a species of microbat native to eastern North America . Formerly known as the eastern pipistrelle , based on the errant belief that it was closely related to European Pipistrellus species , the closest known relative of the tricolored bat is now recognized as the canyon bat . Its common name tricolored bat derives from the coloration of the hairs on its back , which have three distinct color bands . It is the smallest bat species in the eastern and midwestern US , with individuals weighing only 4.6-7.9 g ( 0.16-0.28 oz ) . This species mates in the fall before hibernation , though due to sperm storage , females do not become pregnant until the spring . Young are born helpless , though rapidly develop , flying and foraging for themselves by four weeks old . It has a relatively long lifespan , and can live nearly fifteen years . In the summer , females roost in small groups and males roost solitarily in tree foliage or beard lichen . It eats a diverse array of insects , foraging with a slow , erratic flight and navigating via echolocation . Though once considered one of the most common bat species in its range , its populations have declined rapidly since 2006 with the introduction of the fungal disease white-nose syndrome . It was listed as an endangered species in 2012 in Canada , and has been petitioned for inclusion on the US endangered species list . Along with the silver-haired bat , the tricolored bat is one of two bat species whose rabies variants have most frequently been implicated in human rabies deaths in the US , with sixteen deaths from 1958-2000 ."
