  "/wiki/\u00c4lvsborg_fortress": "\u00c4lvsborg ( also Elfsborg Fortress ) is a large sea fortress in Riv\u00f6 fjord within modern Gothenburg , Sweden . Situated at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta River , it protected medieval Sweden 's only access to the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean , along with the nearby settlement known today as Gothenburg ( formerly named L\u00f6d\u00f6se , Nya L\u00f6d\u00f6se , \u00c4lvsborg and Charles IX 's Gothenburg ) . The original Old \u00c4lvsborg Fortress ( Swedish : \u00c4lvsborgs f\u00e4stning or \u00c4lvsborgs slott ) was located on the mainland , on the southern shore of the estuary , above modern Klippan . Only few ruins are visible today in the vicinity of the Carnegie-pier . The old fortress was dismantled and relocated to one of the islands in the estuary , in the 17th century . This New \u00c4lvsborg Fortress ( Swedish : Nya Elfsborg ) is still maintained . In 1643 , a settlement in New Sweden , North America , was named Fort Nya Elfsborg ( Fort New \u00c4lvsborg ) , after the Swedish fortress . This settlement was abandoned in 1655 . Gothenburg was the main centre for Swedes emigrating to America , and the fortress would have been one of the last sights the emigrants saw on leaving the country .",

Some of the rooms are used as classrooms for pupils from Karolinska Skolan . For over 700 years , \u00d6rebro Castle has kept a watchful eye on everyone crossing the bridge on the River Svart\u00e5n . The oldest part of the castle , a defence tower , was erected in the latter half of the 13th century . This tower was added to in the 14th century to make a larger stronghold , and towards the end of the 16th century most of the impressive castle we see today was built . The name of \u00d6rebro comes from the small stones , called \u00f6r in Swedish , that a river transports . The second part of the word comes from the bridge ( bro ) that was built over this ford . Important roads passed by this strategic place because from here one could control the traffic and the trade in the inner parts of Sweden . In 1364 Albrecht von Mecklenburg captured a fortress in \u00d6rebro . That was probably a predecessor of today 's castle , which was built on the small island within the Svart\u00e5 ( Black river ) .",
