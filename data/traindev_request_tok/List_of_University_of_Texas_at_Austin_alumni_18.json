  "/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_Texas": "The lieutenant governor of Texas is the second-highest executive office in the government of Texas , a state in the U.S . It is the second most powerful post in Texas government because its occupant controls the work of the Texas Senate and controls the budgeting process as a leader of the Legislative Budget Board . Under the provisions of the Texas Constitution , the lieutenant governor is president of the Texas Senate . Unlike with most other states ' senates and the U.S. Senate , the lieutenant governor regularly exercises this function rather than delegating it to the president pro tempore or a majority leader . By the rules of the Senate , the lieutenant governor establishes all special and standing committees , appoints all chairpersons and members , and assigns all Senate legislation to the committee of his choice . The lieutenant governor decides all questions of parliamentary procedure in the Senate . He or she also has broad discretion in following Senate procedural rules . The lieutenant governor is an ex officio member of several statutory bodies . These include the Legislative Budget Board , the Legislative Council , the Legislative Audit Committee , the Legislative Board and Legislative Council , which have considerable sway over state programs , the budget and policy . The lieutenant governor is also a member of the Legislative Redistricting Board ( together with the speaker of the House , attorney general , comptroller , and land commissioner ) , which is charged with adopting a redistricting plan for the Texas House of Representatives , Texas Senate , or U.S. House of Representatives after the decennial census if the Legislature fails to do so . In the case of a vacancy in the lieutenant governor 's office , the Senate elects one of its members to act as President of the Senate until the next statewide office election , in effect becoming the lieutenant governor . A senator elected as presiding officer in this way retains his district seat and the voting privileges entailed with his Senate election .",

  "/wiki/White_House": "The White House is the official residence and workplace of the president of the United States . It is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington , D.C. and has been the residence of every U.S. president since John Adams in 1800 . The term White House is often used as a metonym for the president and his advisers . The residence was designed by Irish-born architect James Hoban in the neoclassical style . Hoban modelled the building on Leinster House in Dublin , a building which today houses the Oireachtas , the Irish legislature . Construction took place between 1792 and 1800 using Aquia Creek sandstone painted white . When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801 , he ( with architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe ) added low colonnades on each wing that concealed stables and storage . In 1814 , during the War of 1812 , the mansion was set ablaze by the British Army in the Burning of Washington , destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior . Reconstruction began almost immediately , and President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed Executive Residence in October 1817 . Exterior construction continued with the addition of the semi-circular South portico in 1824 and the North portico in 1829 . Because of crowding within the executive mansion itself , President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901 . Eight years later in 1909 , President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office , which was eventually moved as the section was expanded .",

  "/wiki/Animal_Liberation_Front": "The Animal Liberation Front ( ALF ) is an international , leaderless resistance that engages in direct action in pursuit of animal rights . Activists see themselves as a modern-day Underground Railroad , removing animals from laboratories and farms , destroying facilities , arranging safe houses , veterinary care and operating sanctuaries where the animals subsequently live . Critics have labelled them as terrorists . Active in over 40 countries , ALF cells claim to operate clandestinely , consisting of small groups of friends and sometimes just one person , which makes the movement difficult for the authorities to monitor . However despite claims of being clandestine the ALF operate a Press office with named contacts who may be held to account . Robin Webb of the British Animal Liberation Press Office has said : That is why the ALF can not be smashed , it can not be effectively infiltrated , it can not be stopped . You , each and every one of you : you are the ALF . Activists say the movement is non-violent . According to the ALF 's code , any act that furthers the cause of animal liberation , where all reasonable precautions are taken not to harm human or non-human life , may be claimed as an ALF action , including acts of vandalism causing economic damage to their victims . American activist Rod Coronado said in 2006 : One thing that I know that separates us from the people we are constantly accused of being - that is , terrorists , violent criminals - is the fact that we have harmed no one . There has nevertheless been widespread criticism that ALF spokespersons and activists have either failed to condemn acts of violence or have themselves engaged in it , either in the name of the ALF or under another banner . The criticism has been accompanied by dissent within the animal rights movement itself about the use of violence , and increasing attention from the police and intelligence communities .",

In some jurisdictions , attorneys general also have executive responsibility for law enforcement , prosecutions or even responsibility for legal affairs generally . In practice , the extent to which the attorney general personally provides legal advice to the government varies between jurisdictions , and even between individual office-holders within the same jurisdiction , often depending on the level and nature of the office-holder 's prior legal experience . Where the attorney general has ministerial responsibility for legal affairs in general ( as is the case , for example , with the United States Attorney General or the Attorney-General for Australia , and the respective attorneys general of the states in each country ) , the ministerial portfolio is largely equivalent to that of a Minister of Justice in some other countries . The term was originally used to refer to any person who holds a general power of attorney to represent a principal in all matters . In the common law tradition , anyone who represents the state , especially in criminal prosecutions , is such an attorney . Although a government may designate some official as the permanent attorney general , anyone who came to represent the state in the same way could , in the past , be referred to as such , even if only for a particular case . Today , however , in most jurisdictions , the term is largely reserved as a title of the permanently appointed attorney general of the state , sovereign or other member of the royal family . Civil law jurisdictions have similar offices , which may be variously called public prosecutor general , procurators , advocates general , public attorneys , and other titles . Many of these offices also use attorney general or attorney-general as the English translation of the title , although because of different historical provenance , the nature of such offices is usually different from that of attorneys-general in common law jurisdictions .",
