An exclave of the U.S. , it borders the Canadian province of British Columbia and territory of Yukon to the east and southeast has a maritime border with Russia 's Chukotka Autonomous Okrug to the west . To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seas of the Arctic Ocean , while the Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest . Alaska is the largest U.S. state by area and the seventh largest subnational division in the world . It is the third least populous and the most sparsely populated state , but by far the continent 's most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel , with an estimated population of 738,432 as 2015 - more than quadruple the combined populations of Northern Canada and Greenland . Approximately half of Alaska 's residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area . The state capital of Juneau is the second largest city in the United States by area , comprising more territory than the states of Rhode Island and Delaware . Alaska was occupied by various indigenous peoples for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans . The state is considered the entry point for the settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge . The Russians were the first non-native people to settle the area beginning in the 18th century , eventually establishing the colony of Alaska that spanned most of the current state . The expense and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted its sale to the U.S. in 1867 for $ 7.2 million , or approximately two cents per acre ( $ 4.74/km2 ) . The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a territory on May 11 , 1912 .",

Northern Arizona features forests of pine , Douglas fir , and spruce trees ; the Colorado Plateau ; mountain ranges ( such as the San Francisco Mountains ) ; as well as large , deep canyons , with much more moderate summer temperatures and significant winter snowfalls .

  "/wiki/Arcology": "Arcology , a portmanteau of architecture and ecology , is a field of creating architectural design principles for very densely populated , ecologically low-impact human habitats . The term was coined in 1969 by architect Paolo Soleri , who believed that a completed arcology would provide space for a variety of residential , commercial , and agricultural facilities while minimizing individual human environmental impact . These structures have been largely hypothetical , as no arcology , even one envisioned by Soleri himself , has yet been built . The concept has been popularized by various science fiction writers . Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle provided a detailed description of an arcology in their 1981 novel Oath of Fealty . More recently authors such as Peter Hamilton in Neutronium Alchemist and Paolo Bacigalupi in The Water Knife explicitly used arcologies as part of their scenarios . They are often portrayed as self-contained or economically self-sufficient .",

In 1882 , however , the tribe was forced by the federal government to abandon all but 518 acres ( 210 ha ) of its land . A silver rush and the Santa Fe Railroad in effect destroyed the fertile land . Furthermore , the inception of the Grand Canyon as a national park in 1919 pushed the Havasupai to the brink , as their land was consistently being used by the National Park Service . Throughout the 20th century , the tribe used the US judicial system to fight for the restoration of the land .

The layout was also adapted for larger subcompact designs . This distinctive two-door car was designed for BMC by Sir Alec Issigonis .

The honorific Mah\u0101tm\u0101 ( Sanskrit : great-souled , venerable ) , first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa , is now used throughout the world . Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat , western India , Gandhi was trained in law at the Inner Temple , London , and called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891 . After two uncertain years in India , where he was unable to start a successful law practice , he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit . He went on to stay for 21 years . It was in South Africa that Gandhi raised a family , and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights . In 1915 , aged 45 , he returned to India . He set about organising peasants , farmers , and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination . Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921 , Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty , expanding women 's rights , building religious and ethnic amity , ending untouchability , and above all for achieving Swaraj or self-rule . The same year Gandhi adopted the Indian loincloth , or short dhoti and , in the winter , a shawl , both woven with yarn hand-spun on a traditional Indian spinning wheel , or charkha , as a mark of identification with India 's rural poor . Thereafter , he lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community , ate simple vegetarian food , and undertook long fasts as a means of self-purification and political protest . Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians , Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km ( 250 mi ) Dandi Salt March in 1930 , and later in calling for the British to Quit India in 1942 .",

There are four east-west canals ( Carroll Canal , Linnie Canal , Howland Canal , and Sherman Canal ) and two north-south canals ( Eastern Canal and Grand Canal ) . The lit canals with gondoliers and arched bridges drew widespread publicity and helped sell lots in the development . By the 1920s already well into the age of the automobile as cars were quickly and increasingly gaining popularity the canals were viewed by many as outdated , and as a result a number of canals of the original network were filled in 1929 to make room for paved roads . By 1940 , the remaining canals had fallen into disrepair , and the sidewalks were condemned by the city . The canal district remained in poor condition for more than 40 years , as numerous proposals to renovate the canals failed due to lack of funding , environmental concerns , and disputes as to who should bear the financial responsibility .

Founded as a mining camp during the Colorado Silver Boom and later named Aspen because of the abundance of aspen trees in the area , the city boomed during the 1880s , its first decade of existence . The boom ended when the Panic of 1893 led to a collapse in the silver market , and the city began a half-century known as the quiet years during which its population steadily declined , reaching a nadir of fewer than a thousand by 1930 . Aspen 's fortunes reversed in the mid-20th century when neighboring Aspen Mountain was developed into a ski resort , and industrialist Walter Paepcke bought many properties in the city in the 1950s and redeveloped them . Today it is home to three institutions , two of which Paepcke helped found , that have international importance : the Aspen Music Festival and School , the Aspen Institute , and the Aspen Center for Physics . In the late 20th century , the city became a popular retreat for celebrities . Gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson worked out of a downtown hotel and ran unsuccessfully for county sheriff . Singer John Denver wrote two songs about Aspen after settling there . Both of them popularized Aspen among the counter-cultural youth of the 1970s as an ideal place to live , and the city continued to grow even as it gained notoriety for some of the era 's hedonistic excesses ( particularly its drug culture ) .
