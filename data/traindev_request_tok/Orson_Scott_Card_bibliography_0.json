  "/wiki/Ender's_Game": "Ender 's Game is a 1985 military science fiction novel by American author Orson Scott Card . Set at an unspecified date in Earth 's future , the novel presents an imperiled humankind after two conflicts with the Formics , an insectoid alien species they dub the buggers . In preparation for an anticipated third invasion , children , including the novel 's protagonist , Andrew Ender Wiggin , are trained from a very young age by putting them through increasingly difficult games , including some in zero gravity , where Ender 's tactical genius is revealed . The book originated as a short story of the same name , published in the August 1977 issue of Analog Science Fiction and Fact . The novel was published on January 15 , 1985 . Later , by elaborating on characters and plot lines depicted in the novel , Card was able to write additional books in the Ender 's Game series . Card also released an updated version of Ender 's Game in 1991 , changing some political facts to reflect the times more accurately ( e.g. , to include the recent collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War ) . The novel has been translated into 34 languages . Reception of the book has been mostly positive but many have criticised its politics . It has become suggested reading for many military organizations , including the United States Marine Corps . Ender 's Game was recognized as best novel by the 1985 Nebula Award and the 1986 Hugo Award in the genres of science fiction and fantasy . Its four sequels - Speaker for the Dead ( 1986 ) , Xenocide ( 1991 ) , Children of the Mind ( 1996 ) , and Ender in Exile ( 2008 ) - follow Ender 's subsequent travels to many different worlds in the galaxy .",
