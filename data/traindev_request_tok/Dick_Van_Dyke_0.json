The Guild was founded in 1933 in an effort to eliminate what were described as exploitation of Hollywood actors who were being forced into oppressive multi-year contracts with the major movie studios . Opposition to these contracts included that they did not include restrictions on work hours or minimum rest periods , and often had clauses that automatically renewed at the studios ' discretion . These contracts were notorious for allowing the studios to dictate the public and private lives of the performers who signed them , and most did not have provisions to allow the performer to end the deal .
