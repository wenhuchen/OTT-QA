Free Associated State of Puerto Rico ) [ b ] and briefly called Porto Rico , [ c ] is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea , approximately 1,000 miles ( 1,600 km ) southeast of Miami , Florida . An archipelago among the Greater Antilles , located between the Dominican Republic and the US Virgin Islands , Puerto Rico includes the eponymous main island and several smaller islands , such as Mona , Culebra , and Vieques . The capital and most populous city is San Juan . The territory 's total population is approximately 3.4 million , more than 21 U.S. states . Spanish and English are the official languages of the executive branch of government , though Spanish predominates . Originally populated by the indigenous Ta\u00edno people , Puerto Rico was colonized by Spain following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493 . It was contested by the French , Dutch , and British , but remained a Spanish possession for the next four centuries . The island 's cultural and demographic landscapes were shaped by the displacement and assimilation of the native population , the forced migration of African slaves , and settlement from the Canary Islands and Andalusia . In the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategic role compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain . Spain 's distant administrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century , producing a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined indigenous , African , and European elements . On September 23 , 1868 , Ram\u00f3n Emeterio Betances unleashed a revolt against Spanish rule , declaring for the first time the idea of Puerto Ricans as a distinct people , with right to sovereignty .",
