The city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300 . Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 reduced its influence . After being destroyed by a fire in 1624 , during the reign of King Christian IV , a new city was built closer to Akershus Fortress and named Christiania in the king 's honour . It was established as a municipality ( formannskapsdistrikt ) on 1 January 1838 . The city functioned as the capital of Norway during the 1814-1905 union between Sweden and Norway . From 1877 , the city 's name was spelled Kristiania in government usage , a spelling that was adopted by the municipal authorities only in 1897 . In 1925 the city , after incorporating the village retaining its former name , was renamed Oslo . In 1948 Oslo merged with Aker , a municipality which surrounded the capital and which was 27 times larger , thus creating the modern , vastly enlarged Oslo municipality .",
