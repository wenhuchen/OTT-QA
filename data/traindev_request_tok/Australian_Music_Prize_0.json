  "/wiki/Dystopia": "A dystopia ( from Ancient Greek \u03b4\u03c5\u03c3- bad and \u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 place ; alternatively , cacotopia , kakotopia , or simply anti-utopia ) is a community or society that is undesirable or frightening . It is translated as bad place and is an antonym of utopia , a term that was coined by Sir Thomas More and figures as the title of his best known work , published 1516 , a blueprint for an ideal society with minimal crime , violence and poverty . Dystopias are often characterized by dehumanization , tyrannical governments , environmental disaster , or other characteristics associated with a cataclysmic decline in society . Dystopian societies appear in many fictional works and artistic representations particularly in stories set in the future . Some of the most famous examples are George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty-Four , Aldous Huxley 's Brave New World and Ray Bradbury 's Fahrenheit 451 . Dystopian societies appear in many sub-genres of fiction and are often used to draw attention to society , environment , politics , economics , religion , psychology , ethics , science or technology . Some authors use the term to refer to existing societies , many of which are or have been totalitarian states or societies in an advanced state of collapse . Some scholars , such as Gregory Claeys and Lyman Tower Sargent , make certain distinctions between typical synonyms of dystopias . For example , Claeys and Sargent define literary dystopias as societies imagined as substantially worse than the society in which the author writes , whereas anti-utopias function as criticisms of attempts to implement various concepts of utopia . In his Dystopia : A Natural History ( Oxford University Press , 2017 ) Claeys offers a more nuanced and historical approach to these definitions . Here the tradition is traced from early reactions to the French Revolution . Its commonly anti-collectivist character is stressed , and the addition of other themes ( the dangers of science and technology , of social inequality , of corporate dictatorship , of nuclear war ) are also traced .",

  "/wiki/Skeleton_Tree": "Skeleton Tree is the sixteenth studio album by Australian rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds . It was released on 9 September 2016 on Bad Seed Ltd. A follow-up to the band 's critically acclaimed album Push the Sky Away ( 2013 ) , Skeleton Tree was recorded over 18 months at Retreat Recording Studios in Brighton , La Frette Studios in La Frette-sur-Seine and Air Studios in London . It was produced by Nick Cave , Warren Ellis and Nick Launay . During the sessions Cave 's 15-year-old son Arthur died from an accidental cliff fall . Most of the album had been written at the time of Cave 's son 's death , but several lyrics were amended by Cave during subsequent recording sessions and feature themes of death , loss and personal grief . Skeleton Tree 's minimal production and less polished sound incorporates elements of electronica and ambient music and , like Push the Sky Away , features extensive use of synthesizers , drum machines and loops . Several songs on the album utilise avant-garde techniques , including the use of dissonant musical elements and non-standard song structures . Cave 's allegorical and often-improvised lyrics have also been noted to be less narrative and character-based than on previous Bad Seeds albums . One More Time with Feeling , a documentary film about the aftermath of Cave 's son 's death and the recording process of Skeleton Tree , accompanied the album 's release . Directed by Andrew Dominik , the film received a limited release and was conceived by Cave to explain the context and themes of Skeleton Tree without conducting interviews with the media . Both the film and the album received widespread critical acclaim .",

So everything I was recording was in context of the world outside the studio . Sometimes Id have my headphones on , just listening to the bush , and a bird would fly up and scream into the microphone . The truth is , even in New York or LA , I was still pretty isolated . Here , there are no other people around , but I feel much more connected to the environment around me than in a big city .
