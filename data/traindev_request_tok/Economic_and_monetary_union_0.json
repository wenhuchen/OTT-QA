The crisis began in 2007 with a depreciation in the subprime mortgage market in the United States , and developed into a full-blown international banking crisis with the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers on September 15 , 2008 . Excessive risk-taking by banks such as Lehman Brothers helped to magnify the financial impact globally . Massive bail-outs of financial institutions and other palliative monetary and fiscal policies were employed to prevent a possible collapse of the world financial system . The crisis was nonetheless followed by a global economic downturn , the Great Recession . The Asian markets ( China , Hong Kong , Japan , India , etc . ) were immediately impacted and volatilized after the U.S. sub-prime crisis . The European debt crisis , a crisis in the banking system of the European countries using the euro , followed later . In 2010 , the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was enacted in the US following the crisis to promote the financial stability of the United States .

The Arab League was formed in Cairo on 22 March 1945 initially with six members : Egypt , Iraq , Transjordan ( renamed Jordan in 1949 ) , Lebanon , Saudi Arabia , and Syria . Yemen joined as a member on 5 May 1945 . Currently , the League has 22 members , but Syria 's participation has been suspended since November 2011 . The League 's main goal is to draw closer the relations between member states and co-ordinate collaboration between them , to safeguard their independence and sovereignty , and to consider in a general way the affairs and interests of the Arab countries . Through institutions , such as the Arab League Educational , Cultural and Scientific Organization ( ALECSO ) and the Economic and Social Council of the Arab League 's Council of Arab Economic Unity ( CAEU ) , the Arab League facilitates political , economic , cultural , scientific , and social programmes designed to promote the interests of the Arab world . It has served as a forum for the member states to coordinate their policy positions , to deliberate on matters of common concern , to settle some Arab disputes and to limit conflicts such as the 1958 Lebanon crisis . The League has served as a platform for the drafting and conclusion of many landmark documents promoting economic integration . One example is the Joint Arab Economic Action Charter , which outlines the principles for economic activities in the region .",

  "/wiki/Arab_Union": "The Arab Union is a proposed concept of a political union of the Arab states . The term was first used when the British Empire promised the Arabs a united independent state in return for revolting against the Ottoman Empire , with whom Britain was at war . It never came to fruition following the Sykes-Picot Agreement . Despite this , many in the Arab world have since called for the creation of a pan-Arab state . Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser made several unsuccessful attempts to unite Egypt with other Arab countries ( including Iraq , North Yemen and Syria ) . Similar attempts were made by other Arab leaders , such as Hafez al-Assad , Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr , Faisal I of Iraq , Muammar Gaddafi , Saddam Hussein , Gaafar Nimeiry and Anwar Sadat . In the 2004 Arab League summit in Cairo , Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh proposed the creation of an Arab Union replacing the Arab League for a stronger political and geographical body , capable of dealing with world issues . However , the proposal failed to reach the League 's agenda .",
