  "/wiki/Viennese_Waltz": "Viennese waltz ( German : Wiener Walzer ) is a genre of ballroom dance . At least four different meanings are recognized . In the historically first sense , the name may refer to several versions of the waltz , including the earliest waltzes done in ballroom dancing , danced to the music of Viennese waltz . What is now called the Viennese waltz is the original form of the waltz . It was the first ballroom dance performed in the closed hold or waltz position . The dance that is popularly known as the waltz is actually the English or slow waltz , danced at approximately 90 beats per minute with 3 beats to the bar ( the international standard of 30 measures per minute ) , while the Viennese waltz is danced at about 180 beats ( 58-60 measures ) per minute . To this day however , in Germany , Austria , Scandinavia , and France , the words Walzer ( German ) , vals ( Danish , Norwegian , and Swedish ) , and valse ( French ) still implicitly refer to the original dance and not the slow waltz . The Viennese waltz is a rotary dance where the dancers are constantly turning either toward the leader 's right ( natural ) or toward the leader 's left ( reverse ) , interspersed with non-rotating change steps to switch between the direction of rotation . As the waltz evolved , some of the versions that were done at about the original fast tempo came to be called specifically Viennese waltz to distinguish them from the slower waltzes . In the modern ballroom dance , two versions of Viennese waltz are recognized : International Style and American Style . Today the Viennese waltz is a ballroom and partner dance that is part of the International Standard division of contemporary ballroom dance .",

The Animals were known for their gritty , bluesy sound and deep-voiced frontman Eric Burdon , as exemplified by their signature song and transatlantic No . 1 hit single , House of the Rising Sun , as well as by hits such as We Got ta Get Out of This Place , It 's My Life , I 'm Crying and Do n't Let Me Be Misunderstood . The band balanced tough , rock-edged pop singles against rhythm and blues-orientated album material and were part of the British Invasion of the US . The Animals underwent numerous personnel changes in the mid-1960s and suffered from poor business management . Under the name Eric Burdon and the Animals , the much-changed act moved to California and achieved commercial success as a psychedelic and hard rock band with hits like San Franciscan Nights , When I Was Young and Sky Pilot , before disbanding at the end of the decade . Altogether , the group had ten Top Twenty hits in both the UK Singles Chart and the US Billboard Hot 100 . The original lineup of Burdon , Alan Price , Chas Chandler , Hilton Valentine and John Steel reunited for a one-off benefit concert in Newcastle in 1968 . They later had brief comebacks in 1975 and 1983 . There have been several partial regroupings of the original era members since then under various names .
