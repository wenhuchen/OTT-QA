  "/wiki/United_Nations": "The United Nations ( UN ) is an intergovernmental organization that aims to maintain international peace and security , develop friendly relations among nations , achieve international cooperation , and be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations . It is the largest , most familiar , most internationally represented and most powerful intergovernmental organization in the world . The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City ; other main offices are in Geneva , Nairobi , Vienna and The Hague . The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars , succeeding the ineffective League of Nations . On 25 April 1945 , 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter , which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945 , when the UN began operations . Pursuant to the Charter , the organization 's objectives include maintaining international peace and security , protecting human rights , delivering humanitarian aid , promoting sustainable development , and upholding international law . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; this number grew to 193 in 2011 , representing the vast majority of the world 's sovereign states . The organization 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies . Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring , reporting and confidence-building roles . UN membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s . Since then , 80 former colonies have gained independence , including 11 trust territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council . By the 1970s , the UN 's budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping .",

Sadat was a senior member of the Free Officers who overthrew King Farouk in the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 , and a close confidant of President Gamal Abdel Nasser , under whom he served as Vice President twice and whom he succeeded as President in 1970 . In his eleven years as president , he changed Egypt 's trajectory , departing from many of the political and economic tenets of Nasserism , re-instituting a multi-party system , and launching the Infitah economic policy . As President , he led Egypt in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 to regain Egypt 's Sinai Peninsula , which Israel had occupied since the Six-Day War of 1967 , making him a hero in Egypt and , for a time , the wider Arab World . Afterwards , he engaged in negotiations with Israel , culminating in the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty ; this won him and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin the Nobel Peace Prize , making Sadat the first Muslim Nobel laureate . Although reaction to the treaty - which resulted in the return of Sinai to Egypt - was generally favorable among Egyptians , it was rejected by the country 's Muslim Brotherhood and the left , which felt Sadat had abandoned efforts to ensure a Palestinian state . With the exception of Sudan , the Arab world and the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) strongly opposed Sadat 's efforts to make a separate peace with Israel without prior consultations with the Arab states . His refusal to reconcile with them over the Palestinian issue resulted in Egypt being suspended from the Arab League from 1979 to 1989 . The peace treaty was also one of the primary factors that led to his assassination ; on 6 October 1981 , militants led by Khalid Islambouli opened fire on Sadat with automatic rifles during the 6 October parade in Cairo , killing him .",
