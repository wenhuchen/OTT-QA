The U.S. Air Force is a military service branch organized within the Department of the Air Force , one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense . The Air Force , through the Department of the Air Force , is headed by the civilian Secretary of the Air Force , who reports to the Secretary of Defense , and is appointed by the President with Senate confirmation . The highest-ranking military officer in the Air Force is the Chief of Staff of the Air Force , who exercises supervision over Air Force units and serves as one of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . Certain Air Force components are assigned , as directed by the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of the Air Force , to unified combatant commands . Combatant commanders are delegated operational authority of the forces assigned to them , while the Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force retain administrative authority over their members . Along with conducting independent air operations , the U.S. Air Force provides air support for land and naval forces and aids in the recovery of troops in the field .

Apollo 8 was the third flight and the first crewed launch of the Saturn V rocket , and was the first human spaceflight from the Kennedy Space Center , located adjacent to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida . Originally planned as the second crewed Apollo Lunar Module and command module test , to be flown in an elliptical medium Earth orbit in early 1969 , the mission profile was changed in August 1968 to a more ambitious command-module-only lunar orbital flight to be flown in December , as the lunar module was not yet ready to make its first flight . Astronaut Jim McDivitt 's crew , who were training to fly the first lunar module flight in low Earth orbit , became the crew for the Apollo 9 mission , and Borman 's crew were moved to the Apollo 8 mission . This left Borman 's crew with two to three months ' less training and preparation time than originally planned , and replaced the planned lunar module training with translunar navigation training . Apollo 8 took 68 hours ( almost three days ) to travel the distance to the Moon . The crew orbited the Moon ten times over the course of twenty hours , during which they made a Christmas Eve television broadcast in which they read the first ten verses from the Book of Genesis .

  "/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster": "The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster was a fatal incident in the United States space program that occurred on February 1 , 2003 , when the Space Shuttle Columbia ( OV-102 ) disintegrated as it re-entered the atmosphere , killing all seven crew members . The disaster was the second fatal accident in the Space Shuttle program , after the 1986 breakup of Challenger soon after liftoff . During the launch of STS-107 , Columbia 's 28th mission , a piece of foam insulation broke off from the Space Shuttle external tank and struck the left wing of the orbiter . Similar foam shedding had occurred during previous shuttle launches , causing damage that ranged from minor to nearly catastrophic , but some engineers suspected that the damage to Columbia was more serious . Before re-entry , NASA managers had limited the investigation , reasoning that the crew could not have fixed the problem if it had been confirmed . When Columbia re-entered the atmosphere of Earth , the damage allowed hot atmospheric gases to penetrate the heat shield and destroy the internal wing structure , which caused the spacecraft to become unstable and break apart . After the disaster , Space Shuttle flight operations were suspended for more than two years , as they had been after the Challenger disaster . Construction of the International Space Station ( ISS ) was put on hold ; the station relied entirely on the Russian Roscosmos State Space Corporation for resupply for 29 months until Shuttle flights resumed with STS-114 and 41 months for crew rotation until STS-121 . NASA ultimately made several technical and organizational changes , including adding a thorough on-orbit inspection to determine how well the shuttle 's thermal protection system had endured the ascent , and keeping a designated rescue mission ready in case irreparable damage was found . Except for one final mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope , subsequent shuttle missions were flown only to the ISS so that the crew could use it as a haven if damage to the orbiter prevented safe reentry .",

He was a test pilot and major general in the US Air Force Reserves . Selected as part of NASA 's third group of fourteen astronauts in 1963 , Collins flew in space twice . His first spaceflight was on Gemini 10 in 1966 , in which he and Command Pilot John Young performed orbital rendezvous with two different spacecraft and undertook two extravehicular activities ( EVAs , also known as spacewalks ) . On the 1969 Apollo 11 mission he became one of 24 people to fly to the Moon , which he orbited thirty times . He was the fourth person ( and third American ) to perform a spacewalk , the first person to have performed more than one spacewalk , and , after Young , who flew the command module on Apollo 10 , the second person to orbit the Moon alone . Prior to becoming an astronaut , Collins graduated from the United States Military Academy with the class of 1952 . He joined the United States Air Force , and flew F-86 Sabre fighters at Chambley-Bussi\u00e8res Air Base , France . He was accepted into the U.S. Air Force Experimental Flight Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base in 1960 .

After being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V 's third stage , the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit . Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility on July 20 . The astronauts used Eagle 's ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module .

Despite a series of severe equipment failures , he managed to successfully complete the mission under manual control , guiding his spacecraft , which he named Faith 7 , to a splashdown just 4 miles ( 6.4 km ) ahead of the recovery ship . Cooper became the first astronaut to make a second orbital flight when he flew as Command Pilot of Gemini 5 in 1965 . Along with Pilot Pete Conrad , he set a new space endurance record by traveling 3,312,993 miles ( 5,331,745 km ) in 190 hours and 56 minutes - just short of eight days - showing that astronauts could survive in space for the length of time necessary to go from the Earth to the Moon and back .
