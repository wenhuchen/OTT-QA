Since its formation in 1891 , the 48th Highlanders have had a longstanding tradition of participation in the life of its parent city , Toronto . The regiment has participated in community functions for over 100 years , in addition to fulfilling its operational duties around the world . Since its inception , the men and women of the regiment have been among the first Canadians to step forward and answer their nation 's call . Members of the regiment have served on Operation Recuperation , in the Golan Heights , Korea , South Africa , Cambodia , Cyprus , Bosnia , and Afghanistan to name only a few and of course , both world wars and the Second Boer War . The regiment is allied with the British Army 's Royal Regiment of Scotland , formerly the Highlanders ( Seaforth , Gordons and Camerons ) ( formerly the Gordon Highlanders ) . The relationship with the Gordon Highlanders represents the oldest officially sanctioned regimental alliance in the Commonwealth , and small unit exchanges are conducted frequently . A memorial was erected in Mount Pleasant Cemetery , Toronto sometime after 1912 in honour of two soldiers killed returning from a training exercise in 1912 and as a monument to the 48th Highlanders of Canada 's veterans and war dead of the South African War . The regiment is nicknamed The Glamour Boys or The Four Dozen . The name The Glamour Boys was coined by the other regiments that served with the 48th Highlanders during World War II in the 1st Canadian Infantry Division , 1st Brigade . The brigade was being inspected by King George VI but there were not enough regulation khaki puttees ( leg wrappings ) for all the soldiers .",
  "/wiki/Toronto": "Toronto is the provincial capital of Ontario and the most populous city in Canada , with a population of 2,954,024 as of July 2018 . Current to 2016 , the Toronto census metropolitan area ( CMA ) , of which the majority is within the Greater Toronto Area ( GTA ) , held a population of 5,928,040 , making it Canada 's most populous CMA . The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe , an urban agglomeration of 9,245,438 people ( as of 2016 ) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario . Toronto is an international centre of business , finance , arts , and culture , and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world . People have travelled through and inhabited the Toronto area , located on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers , deep ravines , and urban forest , for more than 10,000 years . After the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase , when the Mississauga surrendered the area to the British Crown , the British established the town of York in 1793 and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada . During the War of 1812 , the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy damage by American troops . York was renamed and incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto . It was designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation . The city proper has since expanded past its original borders through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of 630.2 km2 ( 243.3 sq mi ) . The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada . More than 50 percent of residents belong to a visible minority population group , and over 200 distinct ethnic origins are represented among its inhabitants .",

The city is named after the nearby Lake Winnipeg ; the name comes from the Western Cree words for muddy water . The region was a trading centre for Indigenous peoples long before the arrival of Europeans . French traders built the first fort on the site in 1738 . A settlement was later founded by the Selkirk settlers of the Red River Colony in 1812 , the nucleus of which was incorporated as the City of Winnipeg in 1873 . As at 2016 [ update ] , Winnipeg is the seventh-most populated municipality in Canada , with a resident population of about 778,500 .

Manitoba covers 649,950 square kilometres ( 250,900 sq mi ) with a widely varied landscape , stretching from the northern oceanic coastline to the southern border with the United States . The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south . Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived on two major river systems , what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system . A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson 's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert 's Land . During the next 200 years , communities continued to grow and evolve , with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg . The assertion of M\u00e9tis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba . There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the M\u00e9tis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion . The resolution of the assertion of the right to representation led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 that created the province .

Although Indian is a term still commonly used in legal documents , the descriptors Indian and Eskimo have somewhat fallen into disuse in Canada and some consider them to be pejorative . Similarly , Aboriginal as a collective noun is a specific term of art used in some legal documents , including the Constitution Act , 1982 , though in some circles that word is also falling into disfavour . Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are some of the earliest known sites of human habitation in Canada . The Paleo-Indian Clovis , Plano and Pre-Dorset cultures pre-date current indigenous peoples of the Americas . Projectile point tools , spears , pottery , bangles , chisels and scrapers mark archaeological sites , thus distinguishing cultural periods , traditions and lithic reduction styles . The characteristics of Canadian Indigenous culture included permanent settlements , agriculture , civic and ceremonial architecture , complex societal hierarchies and trading networks . The M\u00e9tis culture of mixed blood originated in the mid-17th century when First Nation and Inuit people married Europeans . The Inuit had more limited interaction with European settlers during that early period .

Written records began with the arrival of European explorers and colonists during the Age of Discovery , beginning in the late 15th century .

  "/wiki/World_War_I": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",
  "/wiki/Old_City_Hall_Cenotaph,_Toronto": "The Old City Hall Cenotaph is a cenotaph located at the front steps of Old City Hall in Toronto , Ontario , Canada . Originally built after World War I to commemorate Torontonians who lost their lives in services for Canada , the memorial also commemorates those who died in World War II and the Korean War . It was modelled on The Cenotaph at Whitehall in London , England , constructed using granite cut from the Canadian Shield , and unveiled on November 11 , 1925 . The City of Toronto lists the artists as Ferguson/Pomphrey , which were an architectural firm located at 282 St. Clements Ave. in north Toronto . Their design was selected from among 50 designed submitted after City Council 's request to replace a temporary wooden structure that had been used each Remembrance Day since 1919 . The two Toronto architects received a fee of $ 2500 for the work ; this was 10% of the cost of the $ 25 000 project . The work was completed in budget and on time . There was some controversy before the monument was unveiled ; the only wording on the Cenotaph would be a simple four word statement TO ALL WHO SERVED . Then someone realized that this monument was in fact a cenotaph , a structure that by the very definition of that word ( from the Greek kenotaphion - kenos , empty + taphos , tomb ) signified an empty tomb . As a memorial to those who had died and are buried elsewhere , it was felt that TO ALL WHO SERVED was inappropriate in such a case . After much discussion , the original inscription was removed and replaced with the current TO OUR GLORIOUS DEAD . The memorial features a stone laid by Field Marshall Haig on July 24 , 1925 .",
  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire . War in the Balkans , the aerial Battle of Britain , the Blitz , and the long Battle of the Atlantic followed .",

The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea . At the end of World War II , the Soviet Union and the United States liberated Korea from imperial Japanese colonial control on 15 August 1945 . After the war had ended , Korea was divided at the 38th parallel into two zones of occupation , the Soviets administered the northern half and the Americans administered the southern half . With the border set at the 38th parallel in 1948 , two sovereign states were established as a result of geopolitical tensions of the Cold War ( between the Soviet Union and the United States ) . A socialist state was established in the north under the communist leadership of Kim Il-sung and a capitalist state in the south under the anti-communist leadership of Syngman Rhee . Both governments of the two new Korean states claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea , and neither accepted the border as permanent . The conflict escalated into warfare when North Korean military ( KPA ) forces - supported by the Soviet Union and China - crossed the border and advanced into South Korea on 25 June 1950 . The United Nations Security Council authorized the formation of the United Nations Command and the dispatch of forces to Korea to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion . Twenty-one countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the UN force , with the United States providing around 90% of the military personnel . After the first two months of war , South Korean Army ( ROKA ) and the US forces rapidly dispatched to Korea were on the point of defeat . As a result , the ROKA and US troops retreated to a small area behind a defensive line known as the Pusan Perimeter .",
  "/wiki/Ontario_Veterans_Memorial": "Ontario Veterans ' War Memorial is a 30-metre-long ( 98 ft ) granite wall located on the front south lawn of Queen 's Park in Toronto , Ontario , Canada . The wall was designed by Allan Harding MacKay and landscape architectural firm Phillips Farevaag Smallenberg . Besides images ( mostly photographic ) laser-etched into the granite , the wall also includes inscriptions from author Jane Urquhart and military historian Jack Granatstein on the bronze centre- and end-pieces respectively . The wall was advocated for by the Veterans Memorial Advisory Committee under the leadership of retired Lieutenant-general Richard Rohmer , former Minister of Government Services , Gerry Phillips and public art consultant Karen Mills of Public Art Management . The wall was completed in 2006 and was officially unveiled on September 16 , 2006 . It depicts scenes of the Canadian military 's role in times of peace and war since 1867 starting with the Fenian raids . The most recent conflict listed is The Campaign Against Terror .",
  "/wiki/Fenian_raids": "The Fenian raids were carried out by the Fenian Brotherhood , an Irish Republican organization based in the United States , on British Army forts , customs posts and other targets in Canada , in 1866 , and again from 1870 to 1871 . A number of separate incursions by the Fenian Brotherhood into Canada were undertaken to bring pressure on the United Kingdom to withdraw from Ireland , although none of these raids achieved their aims . In Canada , the incursions divided its Catholic Irish-Canadian population , many of whom were torn between loyalty to their new home and sympathy for the aims of the Fenians . The Protestant Irish were generally loyal to the British and fought with the anti-Catholic Orange Order against the Fenians . While authorities in the United States arrested the men and confiscated the arms of the Fenian Brotherhood , there were speculation that some in the United States government had turned a blind eye to the preparations undertaken by the Fenians ; because of anger over actions that could have been construed as British assistance to the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War .",
  "/wiki/War_on_Terror": "The war on terror , also known as the Global War on Terrorism , is an international military campaign launched by the United States government after the September 11 attacks . The targets of the campaign are primarily Sunni Islamist fundamentalist armed groups located throughout the Muslim world , with the most prominent groups being Al-Qaeda , the Islamic State , the Taliban , Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan , and the various franchise groups of the former two organizations . The naming of the campaign uses a metaphor of war to refer to a variety of actions that do not constitute a specific war as traditionally defined . U.S. president George W. Bush first used the term war on terrorism on 16 September 2001 , and then war on terror a few days later in a formal speech to Congress . In the latter speech , George Bush stated , Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them . The term was originally used with a particular focus on countries associated with al-Qaeda . The term was immediately criticised by such people as Richard B. Myers , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and more nuanced terms subsequently came to be used by the Bush administration to publicly define the international campaign led by the U.S . It was never used as a formal designation of U.S. operations in internal government documentation . There was a medal issued in the name of terrorism , however , the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal . U.S. President Barack Obama announced on 23 May 2013 that the Global War on Terror was over , saying the military and intelligence agencies will not wage war against a tactic but will instead focus on a specific group of networks determined to destroy the U.S. On 28 December 2014 , the Obama administration announced the end of the combat role of the U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan . However , the unexpected [ citation needed ] rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) terror group - also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) - led to a new operation against terror in the Middle East and South Asia , Operation Inherent Resolve . Criticism of the war on terror focused on morality , efficiency , and economics ; some , including later president Barack Obama , objected to the phrase itself as a misnomer .",

Gordon had been sent to the Sudan to help Egyptians evacuate from Sudan after Britain decided to abandon the country in the face of a rebellion led by self-proclaimed Mahdi , Mahommed Ahmed . A contingent of Canadians was recruited to help the British navigate their small boats up the Nile River . The Nile Expedition was the first overseas expedition by Canadians in a British imperial conflict , although the Nile Voyageurs were civilian employees and did not wear uniforms .",
  "/wiki/The_War_of_1812": "The War of 1812 was a conflict fought between the United States and the United Kingdom , with their respective allies , from June 1812 to February 1815 . Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars ; historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right . From the outbreak of war with Napoleonic France , Britain had enforced a naval blockade to choke off neutral trade to France , which the US contested as illegal under international law . To man the blockade , Britain pressed American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy . American sentiment grew increasingly hostile toward Britain due to incidents such as the Chesapeake-Leopard affair , which happened five years before the war . The British were in turn outraged by the Little Belt affair in 1811 , in which 11 British sailors died . Britain supplied arms to American Indians who raided American settlers on the frontier , hindering American expansion and provoking resentment . Historians debate whether the desire to annex some or all of British North America ( Canada ) contributed to the American decision to go to war . However , the Western interest was in expansion into American territories such as Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , and Wisconsin , where they were threatened by Indians supported by the British . On June 18 , 1812 , President James Madison signed into law the American declaration of war , after heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress . With most of its army in Europe fighting Napoleon , Britain adopted a defensive strategy , with offensive operations initially limited to the border and the western frontier . American prosecution of the war effort suffered from its unpopularity , especially in New England , where it was referred to as Mr. Madison 's War .",

  "/wiki/United_Nations": "The United Nations ( UN ) is an intergovernmental organization that aims to maintain international peace and security , develop friendly relations among nations , achieve international cooperation , and be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations . It is the largest , most familiar , most internationally represented and most powerful intergovernmental organization in the world . The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City ; other main offices are in Geneva , Nairobi , Vienna and The Hague . The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars , succeeding the ineffective League of Nations . On 25 April 1945 , 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter , which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945 , when the UN began operations . Pursuant to the Charter , the organization 's objectives include maintaining international peace and security , protecting human rights , delivering humanitarian aid , promoting sustainable development , and upholding international law . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; this number grew to 193 in 2011 , representing the vast majority of the world 's sovereign states . The organization 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies . Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring , reporting and confidence-building roles . UN membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s . Since then , 80 former colonies have gained independence , including 11 trust territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council . By the 1970s , the UN 's budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping .",
  "/wiki/List_of_Canadian_peacekeeping_missions": "Canada 's role in the development of peacekeeping during the 20th century led to the establishment of Canada as a prominent world power . Canada 's commitment to multilateralism has been closely related to peacekeeping efforts . Canadian Nobel Peace Prize laureate Lester B. Pearson considered to be the father of modern United Nations Peacekeeping . Prior to Canada 's role in the Suez Canal Crisis , Canada was viewed by many as insignificant in issues of the world 's traditional powers . Canada 's successful role in the conflict gave Canada credibility and established it as a nation fighting for the common good of all the world 's nations and not just their allies . Since 1995 , however , Canadian direct participation in United Nations peacekeeping efforts has greatly declined . That number decreased largely because Canada began to direct its participation to UN-sanctioned military operations through NATO , rather than through the UN . In July 2006 , for instance , Canada ranked 51st on the list of UN peacekeepers , contributing 130 peacekeepers out of a total UN deployment of over 70,000 ; whereas in November 1990 Canada had 1,002 troops out of a total UN deployment of 10,304 .",

As of the 2016 census , Regina had a city population of 215,106 , and a Metropolitan Area population of 236,481 . It is governed by Regina City Council . The city is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Sherwood No . 159 . Regina was previously the seat of government of the North-West Territories , of which the current provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta originally formed part , and of the District of Assiniboia . The site was previously called Wascana ( Buffalo Bones in Cree ) , but was renamed to Regina ( Latin for Queen ) in 1882 in honour of Queen Victoria . This decision was made by Queen Victoria 's daughter Princess Louise , who was the wife of the Governor General of Canada , the Marquess of Lorne . Unlike other planned cities in the Canadian West , on its treeless flat plain Regina has few topographical features other than the small spring run-off , Wascana Creek . Early planners took advantage of such opportunity by damming the creek to create a decorative lake to the south of the central business district with a dam a block and a half west of the later elaborate 260-metre ( 850 ft ) long Albert Street Bridge across the new lake . Regina 's importance was further secured when the new province of Saskatchewan designated the city its capital in 1906 .",
  "/wiki/War_bride": "War brides are women who married military personnel from other countries in times of war or during military occupations , a practice that occurred in great frequency during World War I and World War II . Among the largest and best documented examples of this were the marriages between American servicemen and German women which took place after World War II . By 1949 , over 20,000 German war brides had emigrated to the United States . Furthermore , it is estimated that there are . 15,000 Australian women who married American servicemen based in Australia during World War II and moved to the US to be with their husbands . Allied servicemen also married many women in other countries where they were stationed at the end of the war , including France , Italy , Luxembourg , the Philippines , Japan and China . This also occurred in Korea and Vietnam with the later wars in those countries involving U.S. troops and other anti-communist soldiers .
