  "/wiki/Linux_kernel": "The Linux kernel is a free and open-source , monolithic , Unix-like operating system kernel . The Linux family of operating systems is based on this kernel and deployed on both traditional computer systems such as personal computers and servers , usually in the form of Linux distributions , and on various embedded devices such as routers , wireless access points , PBXes , set-top boxes , FTA receivers , smart TVs , PVRs , and NAS appliances . While the adoption of the Linux kernel in desktop computer operating system is low , Linux-based operating systems dominate nearly every other segment of computing , from mobile devices to mainframes . Since November 2017 [ update ] , all of the world 's 500 most powerful supercomputers run Linux . The Android operating system for tablet computers , smartphones , and smartwatches also uses the Linux kernel . The Linux kernel was conceived and created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds for his personal computer and with no cross-platform intentions , but has since expanded to support a huge array of computer architectures , many more than other kernels do . Linux rapidly attracted developers and users who adopted it as the kernel for other free software projects , notably the GNU Operating System , which was created as a free , non-proprietary operating system , and based on UNIX as a by-product of the fallout of the Unix wars . The Linux kernel API , the application programming interface ( API ) through which user programs interact with the kernel , is meant to be very stable and to not break userspace programs ( some programs , such as those with GUIs , rely on other APIs as well ) . As part of the kernel 's functionality , device drivers control the hardware ; mainlined ( included in the kernel ) device drivers are also meant to be very stable . However , the interface between the kernel and loadable kernel modules ( LKMs ) , unlike in many other kernels and operating systems , is not meant to be very stable by design . The Linux kernel , developed by contributors worldwide , is a prominent example of free and open source software . Day-to-day development discussions take place on the Linux kernel mailing list ( LKML ) .",

  "/wiki/Python_(programming_language)": "Python is an interpreted , high-level , general-purpose programming language . Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991 , Python 's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace . Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear , logical code for small and large-scale projects . Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected . It supports multiple programming paradigms , including procedural , object-oriented , and functional programming . Python is often described as a batteries included language due to its comprehensive standard library . Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language . Python 2.0 , released in 2000 , introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of collecting reference cycles . Python 3.0 , released in 2008 , was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible , and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3 . The Python 2 language , i.e . Python 2.7.x , was officially discontinued on 1 January 2020 ( first planned for 2015 ) after which security patches and other improvements will not be released for it . With Python 2 's end-of-life , only Python 3.5.x and later are supported .",

The first version of FreeBSD was released in 1993 . In 2005 , FreeBSD was the most popular open-source BSD operating system , accounting for more than three-quarters of all installed BSD systems . FreeBSD has similarities with Linux , with two major differences in scope and licensing : FreeBSD maintains a complete system , i.e . the project delivers a kernel , device drivers , userland utilities , and documentation , as opposed to Linux only delivering a kernel and drivers , and relying on third-parties for system software ; and FreeBSD source code is generally released under a permissive BSD license , as opposed to the copyleft GPL used by Linux . The FreeBSD project includes a security team overseeing all software shipped in the base distribution . A wide range of additional third-party applications may be installed using the pkg package management system or FreeBSD Ports , or by compiling source code . Due to its licensing , much of FreeBSD 's codebase has become an integral part of other operating systems , such as Apple 's Darwin ( the basis for macOS , iOS , watchOS , and tvOS ) , FreeNAS ( an open-source NAS/SAN operating system ) , and the system software for Sony 's PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 .",
  "/wiki/Wine_(software)": "Wine ( recursive backronym for Wine Is Not an Emulator ) is a free and open-source compatibility layer that aims to allow computer programs ( application software and computer games ) developed for Microsoft Windows to run on Unix-like operating systems . Wine also provides a software library , known as Winelib , against which developers can compile Windows applications to help port them to Unix-like systems . Wine provides its own Windows runtime environment which translates Windows system calls into POSIX-compliant system calls , recreating the directory structure of Windows systems , and providing alternative implementations of Windows system libraries , system services through wineserver and various other components ( such as Internet Explorer , the Windows Registry Editor , and msiexec ) . Wine is predominantly written using black-box testing reverse-engineering , to avoid copyright issues . The selection of Wine is Not an Emulator as the name of the Wine Project was the result of a naming discussion in August 1993 and credited to David Niemi . There is some confusion caused by an early FAQ using Windows Emulator and other invalid sources that appear after the Wine Project name being set . No code emulation or virtualization occurs when running a Windows application under Wine . Emulation usually would refer to execution of compiled code intended for one processor ( such as x86 ) by interpreting/recompiling software running on a different processor ( such as PowerPC ) . While the name sometimes appears in the forms WINE and wine , the project developers have agreed to standardize on the form Wine . Wine is primarily developed for Linux and macOS , and there are , as of November 2018 [ update ] , well-maintained packages available for both platforms . In a 2007 survey by desktoplinux.com of 38,500 Linux desktop users , 31.5% of respondents reported using Wine to run Windows applications . This plurality was larger than all x86 virtualization programs combined , as well as larger than the 27.9% who reported not running Windows applications .",
  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 ; the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group . PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page , but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP : Hypertext Preprocessor . PHP code may be executed with a command line interface ( CLI ) , embedded into HTML code , or used in combination with various web template systems , web content management systems , and web frameworks . PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in a web server or as a Common Gateway Interface ( CGI ) executable . The web server outputs the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code , which may be any type of data , such as generated HTML code or binary image data . PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context , such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control . The standard PHP interpreter , powered by the Zend Engine , is free software released under the PHP License . PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform , free of charge . The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014 , with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations aimed to follow . Since 2014 , work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification . As of February 2020 [ update ] , over half of sites on the web using PHP are still on discontinued/EOLed version 5.6 or older ; and over 55% of all websites in the world run versions prior to 7.2 , that are neither officially supported by The PHP Development Team , while security support is provided by third parties , such as Debian ( up to June 2020 for PHP 5 ) .",
