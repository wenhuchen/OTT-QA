Other streets linked to Queen Victoria Street include Puddle Dock , Cannon Street , Walbrook and Poultry . The road was commissioned in 1861 to streamline the approach to the central business district , and was provided for through the Metropolitan Improvement Act . Costing over \u00a31,000,000 , it remains a flagship street within the City . The nearest London Underground stations are Blackfriars ( at its western junction with New Bridge Street ) , Mansion House ( where it crosses Cannon Street ) , and Bank ( near its eastern end ) .

  "/wiki/City_of_London": "The City of London is a city , county and a local government district [ note 1 ] that contains the historic centre and the primary central business district ( CBD ) of London . It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages , but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City 's borders . The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London , though it remains a notable part of central London . Administratively , it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London ; however , the City of London is not a London borough , a status reserved for the other 32 districts ( including London 's only other city , the City of Westminster ) . It is also a separate ceremonial county , being an enclave surrounded by Greater London , and is the smallest county in the United Kingdom . The City of London is widely referred to simply as the City ( differentiated from the phrase the city of London by capitalising City ) and is also colloquially known as the Square Mile , as it is 1.12 sq mi ( 716.80 acres ; 2.90 km2 ) in area . Both of these terms are also often used as metonyms for the United Kingdom 's trading and financial services industries , which continue a notable history of being largely based in the City . The name London is now ordinarily used for a far wider area than just the City . London most often denotes the sprawling London metropolis , or the 32 London boroughs , in addition to the City of London itself . This wider usage of London is documented as far back as 1888 , when the County of London was created . The local authority for the City , namely the City of London Corporation , is unique in the UK and has some unusual responsibilities for a local council , such as being the police authority . It is also unusual in having responsibilities and ownerships beyond its boundaries .",

  "/wiki/Holborn_Viaduct": "Holborn Viaduct is a road bridge in London and the name of the street which crosses it ( which forms part of the A40 route ) . It links Holborn , via Holborn Circus , with Newgate Street , in the City of London financial district , passing over Farringdon Street and the subterranean River Fleet . The viaduct spans the steep-sided Holborn Hill and the River Fleet valley at a length of 1,400 feet ( 430 m ) and 80 feet ( 24 m ) wide . City surveyor William Haywood was the architect and the engineer was Rowland Mason Ordish . It was built between 1863 and 1869 , as a part of the Holborn Valley Improvements , which included a public works scheme which , at a cost of over \u00a32 million ( over \u00a3186 million in 2019 ) , improved access into the City from the West End , with better traffic flow and distribution around the new Holborn Circus , the creation of Queen Victoria Street , the rebuilding of Blackfriars Bridge , the opening of the Embankment section into the City , the continuation of Farringdon Street as Farringdon Road and associated railway routes with Farringdon station and Ludgate Hill station . It was opened by Queen Victoria at the same time as the inauguration of the other thoroughfares with a formal coach drive procession on 6 November 1869 . The viaduct effected a more level approach on the crossing of this section of the Holborn/Fleet valley from east to west , across Farringdon Street . Previously this involved horse-drawn traffic having to descend from High Holborn along Charterhouse Street to the smaller Holborn Bridge , crossing the River Fleet which had been culverted between Ludgate Circus to this crossing in 1734 to ascend to the other side using Snow Hill ; it was one of the first modern flyovers in central London . Pedestrian access between the two street levels was effected via four pavilions , at each side and either end , containing staircases for access from the viaduct to Farringdon Street below ; with their parapets adorned with figurative statues to represent commerce and agriculture on the south side , both by sculptor Henry Bursill , with science and fine art on the north side , by the sculpture firm Farmer & Brindley ; there are also statues of Lord Mayors William Walworth and Henry Fitz-Ailwin . In 1941 the Blitz raids destroyed and damaged most of the area including the north side pavilions ; these were copied and reinstated with associated property developments in 2000 ( western ) and 2014 ( eastern ) , including lifts . Holborn Viaduct railway station , opened in 1874 , was at the eastern end with a low-level through route towards Farringdon , and was replaced in 1990 by St. Paul 's Thameslink railway station ( later renamed City Thameslink ) . In 1882 the viaduct became home to the world 's first coal-fired power station , the Edison Electric Light Station .",

It runs west to east from Temple Bar at the boundary with the City of Westminster to Ludgate Circus at the site of the London Wall and the River Fleet from which the street was named . Having been an important through route since Roman times , businesses were established along the road during the Middle Ages . Senior clergy lived in Fleet Street during this period where there are several churches including Temple Church and St Bride 's . Fleet Street became known for printing and publishing at the start of the 16th century and it became the dominant trade so that by the 20th century most British national newspapers operated from here . Much of the industry moved out in the 1980s after News International set up cheaper manufacturing premises in Wapping , but some former newspaper buildings are listed and have been preserved . The term Fleet Street remains a metonym for the British national press , and pubs on the street once frequented by journalists remain popular . Fleet Street has a significant number of monuments and statues along its length , including the dragon at Temple Bar and memorials to a number of figures from the British press , such as Samuel Pepys and Lord Northcliffe .
