  "/wiki/Fairchild-Dornier_728JET": "The Fairchild Dornier 728/928 family was a series of jet-powered regional airliners that was being developed by German-American aviation conglomerate Fairchild Dornier GmbH . It was a relatively ambitious bid to develop a group of aircraft that would have seated between 50 and 110 passengers , supplementing the existing 328JET series , a smaller regional jet . The 728/928 family is a monoplane design with fixed wings in low wing configuration and two engines mounted under the wings . It has a retractable undercarriage ( or landing gear ) in tricycle configuration . On 21 March 2002 , the roll-out of the first 728 took place . The company planned its maiden flight to occur during the summer of 2002 and for deliveries to commence during mid-2003 to the launch customer Lufthansa Cityline . The 728 family benefitted from a modern design while the company attracted considerable interest from various airlines upon the programme 's launch . By March 2002 , a total of eight customers had altogether placed 125 firm orders in addition to signed options for an additional 164 aircraft . However , the programme was derailed at a late stage by the insolvency of Fairchild Dornier , which occurred shortly after the official roll-out of the first 728 . Despite attempts to revive the programme , including the establishment of Fairchild Dornier Aeroindustries , customers opted to cancel their orders and no aircraft actually ever flew . The three prototypes that were completed have been sold on for other purposes .",

  "/wiki/Fairchild-Dornier_428JET": "The Fairchild Dornier 428JET was a program undertaken by Fairchild Dornier to develop a 44-seat regional jet aircraft . The program was part of a broader attempt by the company to develop a family of regional jets , comprising the 328JET , 428JET , and the 728 series . This family of aircraft was designed to compete with the Bombardier CRJ and Embraer ERJ/Embraer E-Jets families . The aircraft was announced on May 19 , 1998 . It was cancelled in August 2000 .",

  "/wiki/Fairchild-Dornier_328JET": "The Fairchild-Dornier 328JET is a commuter airliner , based upon the turboprop-powered Dornier 328 , developed by the German aircraft manufacturer Dornier Luftfahrt GmbH . It would be the last Dornier-designed aircraft to reach production before the company 's collapse during the early 2000s . The 328JET was designed by Dornier in response to negative feedback from some customers on the marketability of turboprops against the more appealing turbofan engine . It was a relatively straightforward re-reengining of the existing 328 , being originally designated as the 328-300 prior to being rebranded as the 328JET . During 1996 , early on in the programme , the financially distressed Dornier company was acquired by the American aerospace firm Fairchild Aircraft ; the resulting corporation , named Fairchild Dornier , continued development of the 328JET . On 20 January 1998 , the first 328JET prototype conducted its maiden flight . While production of the 328 family was performed in Oberpfaffenhofen , Germany , sales activity was centred in San Antonio , Texas and support for Dornier 's products was provided from both locations . At one stage , a stretched variant of the 328JET , commonly referred to as the 428JET , was under active development . However , amid intense competition in the international market for regional jets , Fairchild Dornier were unable to attain enough sales of the type to maintain production . During 2002 , the final 328JET left the production line , while support for existing aircraft continues to be provided . While a prospective revival of the programme has been mooted on multiple occasions , nothing concrete has occurred as of 2019 .",

August 1985 remains the worst single month for commercial aviation fatalities in history ; a total of 2,010 people were killed in commercial aviation accidents in 1985 ; the second highest in commercial aviation history since 1942 ; only 1972 had more fatalities ( 2,373 ) .",
  "/wiki/Fairchild_Republic_A-10_Thunderbolt_II": "The Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II is a single-seat , twin turbofan engine , straight wing jet aircraft developed by Fairchild-Republic for the United States Air Force ( USAF ) . It is commonly referred to by the nicknames Warthog or Hog , although the A-10 's official name comes from the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt , a World War II fighter-bomber effective at attacking ground targets . The A-10 was designed for close air support ( CAS ) of friendly ground troops , attacking armored vehicles and tanks , and providing quick-action support against enemy ground forces . It entered service in 1976 and is the only production-built aircraft that has served in the USAF that was designed solely for CAS . Its secondary mission is to provide forward air controller - airborne support , by directing other aircraft in attacks on ground targets . Aircraft used primarily in this role are designated OA-10 . The A-10 was intended to improve on the performance of the A-1 Skyraider and its lesser firepower . The A-10 was designed around the 30 mm GAU-8 Avenger rotary cannon . Its airframe was designed for durability , with measures such as 1,200 pounds ( 540 kg ) of titanium armor to protect the cockpit and aircraft systems , enabling it to absorb a significant amount of damage and continue flying . Its short takeoff and landing capability permits operation from airstrips close to the front lines , and its simple design enables maintenance with minimal facilities . The A-10 served in the Gulf War ( Operation Desert Storm ) , the American led intervention against Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait , where the A-10 distinguished itself . The A-10 also participated in other conflicts such as in Grenada , the Balkans , Afghanistan , Iraq , and against Islamic State in the Middle East .",

  "/wiki/Close_air_support": "In military tactics , close air support ( CAS ) is defined as air action such as air strikes by fixed or rotary-winged aircraft against hostile targets that are in proximity to friendly forces and which requires detailed integration of each air mission with fire and movement of these forces and attacks with aerial bombs , glide bombs , missiles , rockets , aircraft cannons , machine guns , and even directed-energy weapons such as lasers . The requirement for detailed integration because of proximity , fires or movement is the determining factor . CAS may need to be conducted during shaping operations with Special Operations Forces ( SOF ) if the mission requires detailed integration with the fire and movement of these forces . A closely related subset of air interdiction ( AI ) , battlefield air interdiction , denotes interdiction against units with near-term effects on friendly units , but which does not require integration with friendly troop movements . The term battlefield air interdiction is not currently used in U.S. joint doctrine . Close air support requires excellent coordination with ground forces . In advanced modern militaries , this coordination is typically handled by specialists such as Joint Fires Observers ( JFOs ) , Joint Terminal Attack Controllers ( JTACs ) , and forward air controllers ( FACs ) . Close air support proved effective in many combat operations including by the us in operation desert storm , and operation Iraqi freedom as well as by Russia in both the Chechen and Syria and by Iran and Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war .",
