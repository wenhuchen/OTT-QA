  "/wiki/Public_limited_company": "A public limited company ( legally abbreviated to PLC ) is a type of public company under United Kingdom company law , some Commonwealth jurisdictions , and the Republic of Ireland . It is a limited liability company whose shares may be freely sold and traded to the public ( although a PLC may also be privately held , often by another PLC ) , with a minimum share capital of \u00a350,000 and usually with the letters PLC after its name . Similar companies in the United States are called publicly traded companies . Public limited companies will also have a separate legal identity . A PLC can be either an unlisted or listed company on the stock exchanges . In the United Kingdom , a public limited company usually must include the words public limited company or the abbreviation PLC or plc at the end and as part of the legal company name . Welsh companies may instead choose to end their names with ccc , an abbreviation for cwmni cyfyngedig cyhoeddus . However , some public limited companies ( mostly nationalised concerns ) incorporated under special legislation are exempted from bearing any of the identifying suffixes . [ citation needed ] The term public limited company and the PLC/plc suffix were introduced in 1981 ; prior to this , all limited companies bore the suffix Limited ( Ltd. ) , which is still used by private limited companies .",

During the early 2000s the company borrowed substantially to fund mortgages , with the aim of ambitious growth , and also donated large amounts to charitable purposes and communities directly and through sponsorships . The global banking crisis beginning around 2007-08 meant that it was unable to produce income as expected from its loans , and was at risk of being unable to repay the amounts it had borrowed . The news that the bank had approached the government for support with its liquidity led within 24 hours to a public lack of confidence and concerns that savings were at risk , and the bank failed following a bank run as people rushed to withdraw their savings . It was the first British bank in 150 years to fail due to a bank run . Unable to find a commercial buyer or secure the further government support needed , it was taken into public ownership in 2008 , as an alternative to insolvency . By that point the government had extended liquidity support of tens of billions of pounds to Northern Rock . An inquiry concluded that the board had failed to properly protect the bank from the risks inherent in its strategy , or to restrain the executive directors where required , therefore although the bank had sufficient assets , it had become vulnerable . The branch operations were eventually returned to private ownership when the branches and other retail operations were acquired by Virgin Group in 2012 , being rebranded as Virgin Money the same year .

The crisis began in 2007 with a depreciation in the subprime mortgage market in the United States , and developed into a full-blown international banking crisis with the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers on September 15 , 2008 . Excessive risk-taking by banks such as Lehman Brothers helped to magnify the financial impact globally . Massive bail-outs of financial institutions and other palliative monetary and fiscal policies were employed to prevent a possible collapse of the world financial system . The crisis was nonetheless followed by a global economic downturn , the Great Recession . The Asian markets ( China , Hong Kong , Japan , India , etc . ) were immediately impacted and volatilized after the U.S. sub-prime crisis .

  "/wiki/Nationalization": "Nationalization , or nationalisation , is the process of transforming private assets into public assets by bringing them under the public ownership of a national government or state . Nationalization usually refers to private assets or assets owned by lower levels of government , such as municipalities , being transferred to the state . The opposites of nationalization are privatization and demutualization . When previously nationalized assets are privatized and subsequently returned to public ownership at a later stage , they are said to have undergone renationalization . Industries that are often subject to nationalization include telecommunications , electric power , fossil fuels , railways , airlines , iron ore , media , postal services , banks , and water . Nationalization may occur with or without compensation to the former owners . Nationalization is distinguished from property redistribution in that the government retains control of nationalized property . Some nationalizations take place when a government seizes property acquired illegally . For example , in 1945 the French government seized the car-makers Renault because its owners had collaborated with the Nazi occupiers of France . Nationalization is to be distinguished from socialization , which refers to the process of restructuring the economic framework , organizational structure , and institutions of an economy on a socialist basis . By contrast , nationalization does not necessarily imply social ownership and the restructuring of the economic system . By itself , nationalization has nothing to do with socialism , having been historically carried out for various different purposes under a wide variety of different political systems and economic systems ."
