  "/wiki/Slender_glass_lizard": "The slender glass lizard ( Ophisaurus attenuatus ) is a legless lizard in the family Anguidae . The species is endemic to the United States . Two subspecies are recognized . The lizard was originally believed to be a subspecies of the eastern glass lizard ( Ophisaurus ventralis ) . Their name comes from their easily broken tail which they can break off themselves without ever being touched . It is difficult to find a specimen with an undamaged tail . The lizard eats a variety of insects and small animals , including smaller lizards . Snakes and other animals are known to prey on the species . Humans have a part in destroying their environment and killing their food supply with insecticides . The lizard is considered to be a least-concern species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , though it is vulnerable in Iowa and endangered in Wisconsin .",
  "/wiki/Anguidae": "Anguidae refers to a large and diverse family of lizards native to the Northern Hemisphere . Common characteristics of this group include a reduced supratemporal arch , striations on the medial faces of tooth crowns , osteoderms , and a lateral fold in the skin of most taxa . The group includes the slowworms , glass lizards , and alligator lizards , among others . The family is divided into three subfamilies ( Anguinae , Diploglossinae , and Gerrhonotinae ) , and contains about 100 species in 10 genera .",

  "/wiki/Local_extinction": "Local extinction or extirpation is the condition of a species ( or other taxon ) that ceases to exist in the chosen geographic area of study , though it still exists elsewhere . Local extinctions are contrasted with global extinctions . Local extinctions may be followed by a replacement of the species taken from other locations ; wolf reintroduction is an example of this .",

  "/wiki/Indo-Pacific_gecko": "The Indo-Pacific gecko ( Hemidactylus garnotii ) also known as Garnot 's house gecko , the fox gecko , or the Assam greyish brown gecko , is a species of gecko found in India , the Philippines , Southeast Asia , Australia , and throughout Polynesia . Adults are about 4 to 5 in ( 10 to 13 cm ) in total length ( including tail ) . They are seen as dark gray or brown with light markings in daylight and a pale , translucent colour at night . The belly is orange or yellow . The head has a long , narrow snout , hence the name fox gecko . The flattened tail has a row of spiny scales on the lateral edges . The species is parthenogenic - all individuals are female and lay eggs that hatch without requiring male fertilisation . In Hawaii , the species is thought to be a long-term resident . Formerly considered a house gecko , it has been displaced to natural habitats by the more recently arrived common house gecko . In Florida and Georgia it has become established as an invasive species of concern .",
  "/wiki/Gekkonidae": "Gekkonidae ( the common geckos ) is the largest family of geckos , containing over 950 described species in 61 genera . This family comprises many of the most widespread gecko species , including house geckos ( Hemidactylus ) , tokay geckos ( Gekko ) , day geckos ( Phelsuma ) , mourning geckos ( Lepidodactylus ) and dtellas ( Gehyra ) . Gekkonid geckos occur globally and are particularly species-rich in tropical areas .",
  "/wiki/Mediterranean_house_gecko": "The Mediterranean house gecko ( Hemidactylus turcicus ) is a type of house gecko common to the Mediterranean which has spread to many parts of the world . It is commonly referred to as the Turkish gecko as represented in its Latin name and also as the moon lizard because it emerges in the evening [ citation needed ] . A study in Portugal found H. turcicus to be totally nocturnal , with the highest activity peak around 2am . They are insectivorous , rarely exceeding 15 centimetres ( 5.9 in ) in length , have large , lidless eyes with elliptical pupils , and purple - or tan-colored skin with black spots , often with stripes on the tail . Their bellies or undersides are somewhat translucent . It is currently unknown what impact the geckos have on native wildlife in the countries they have invaded . In many parts of the world the range of H. turcicus is increasing , and unlike many other reptiles , they appear to be highly resistant to pesticides . The increase may be explained as a consequence of having few predators in places where they have been introduced , and also of their tendency to take shelter in the cracks and unseen areas of human homes , for example inside walls . Reliance on human habitation has thus contributed to their proliferation , similar to rodents . In some Eastern Mediterranean countries such as Turkey and Cyprus it is a taboo to harm them due to their benign nature and they are often kept as house pets .",
  "/wiki/Carolina_anole": "Anolis carolinensis ( US : /\u0259\u02c8no\u028a.li/ ( listen ) ) is an arboreal anole lizard native to the southeastern United States ( west to Texas ) and introduced elsewhere . Other common names include the green anole , American green anole , American anole , and red-throated anole . It is also sometimes referred to as the American chameleon ( typically in the pet trade ) due to its ability to change color from several brown hues to bright green , and its somewhat similar appearance and diet preferences . However it is not a true chameleon and the nickname is misleading although it can camouflage .",
  "/wiki/Dactyloidae": "Dactyloidae are a family of lizards commonly known as anoles ( US : /\u0259\u02c8no\u028a.liz/ ( listen ) ) and native to warmer parts of the Americas , ranging from southeastern United States to Paraguay . Instead of treating it as a family , some authorities prefer to treat it as a subfamily , Dactyloinae , of the family Iguanidae . In the past they were included in the family Polychrotidae together with Polychrus ( bush anoles ) , but the latter genus is not closely related to the true anoles . Anoles are small to fairly large lizards , typically green or brownish , but their color varies depending on species and many can also change it . In most species at least the male has a dewlap , an often brightly colored flap of skin that extends from the throat/neck and is used in displays . Anoles share several characteristics with geckos , including details of the foot structure ( for climbing ) and the ability to voluntarily break off the tail ( to escape predators ) , but they are only very distantly related , anoles being part of Iguania . Anoles are active during the day and feed mostly on small animals such as insects , but some will also take fruits , flowers , and nectar . They are fiercely territorial . After mating , the female lays an egg ( occasionally two ) ; in many species she may do so every few days or weeks . The egg is typically placed on the ground , but in some species it is placed at higher levels . Anoles are widely studied in fields such as ecology , behavior , and evolution , and some species are commonly kept in captivity as pets . Anoles can function as a biological pest control by eating insects that may harm humans or plants , but represent a serious risk to small native animals and ecosystems if introduced to regions outside their home range .",
  "/wiki/Brown_anole": "The brown anole ( Anolis sagrei ) , also known commonly as the Bahaman anole or De la Sagra 's Anole , is a species of lizard in the family Dactyloidae . The species is native to Cuba and the Bahamas . It has been widely introduced elsewhere , by being sold as a pet lizard , and is now found in Florida and as far north in the United States as southern Georgia , Texas , Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , Hawaii , and Southern California . It has also been introduced to other Caribbean islands and Taiwan in Asia . This species is highly invasive . In its introduced range , it reaches exceptionally high population densities , is capable of expanding its range very quickly , and both outcompetes and consumes many species of native lizards . The brown anole 's introduction into the United States in the early 1970s has altered the behavior and negatively affected populations of the native Carolina anole ( Anolis carolinensis , also known as the green anole ) , which have generally been relegated to the treetops .",
