  "/wiki/Split_(city)": "Split ( /\u02c8spl\u026at/ , as the English word split ; Croatian pronunciation : [ spl\u00eet ] ( listen ) ; see other names ) is the second-largest city of Croatia and the largest city of the region of Dalmatia , with about 250,000 people living in its urban area . It lies on the eastern shore of the Adriatic Sea and is spread over a central peninsula and its surroundings . An intraregional transport hub and popular tourist destination , the city is linked to the Adriatic islands and the Apennine peninsula . Home to Diocletian 's Palace , built for the Roman emperor in AD 305 , the city was founded as the Greek colony of Asp\u00e1lathos ( A\u03c3\u03c0\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 ) in the 3rd or 2nd century BC . It became a prominent settlement around 650 when it succeeded the ancient capital of the Roman province of Dalmatia , Salona . After the sack of Salona by the Avars and Slavs , the fortified Palace of Diocletian was settled by Roman refugees . Split became a Byzantine city . Later it drifted into the sphere of the Republic of Venice and the Kingdom of Croatia , with the Byzantines retaining nominal suzerainty . For much of the High and Late Middle Ages , Split enjoyed autonomy as a free city of the Dalmatian city-states , caught in the middle of a struggle between Venice and Croatia ( in union with Hungary ) for control over the Dalmatian cities . Venice eventually prevailed and during the early modern period Split remained a Venetian city , a heavily fortified outpost surrounded by Ottoman territory . Its hinterland was won from the Ottomans in the Morean War of 1699 , and in 1797 , as Venice fell to Napoleon , the Treaty of Campo Formio rendered the city to the Habsburg Monarchy . In 1805 , the Peace of Pressburg added it to the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy and in 1806 it was included in the French Empire , becoming part of the Illyrian Provinces in 1809 .",

While it is referred to as a palace because of its intended use as the retirement residence of Diocletian , the term can be misleading as the structure is massive and more resembles a large fortress : about half of it was for Diocletian 's personal use , and the rest housed the military garrison . The complex was built on a peninsula six kilometers southwest from Salona , the capital of Dalmatia ( Roman province ) , one of the largest cities of the late empire with 60,000 people and the birthplace of Diocletian . The terrain around Salona slopes gently seaward and is typical karst , consisting of low limestone ridges running east to west with marl in the clefts between them . Today the remains of the palace are part of the historic core of Split , which in 1979 was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site .",
  "/wiki/Roman_emperor": "The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period ( starting in 27 BC ) . The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history . Often when a given Roman is described as becoming emperor in English , it reflects his taking of the title Augustus or Caesar . Another title often used was imperator , originally a military honorific . Early Emperors also used the title Princeps Civitatis ( 'first citizen ' ) . Emperors frequently amassed republican titles , notably princeps senatus , consul and pontifex maximus . The legitimacy of an emperor 's rule depended on his control of the army and recognition by the Senate ; an emperor would normally be proclaimed by his troops , or invested with imperial titles by the Senate , or both . The first emperors reigned alone ; later emperors would sometimes rule with co-emperors and divide administration of the empire between them . The Romans considered the office of emperor to be distinct from that of a king . The first emperor , Augustus , resolutely refused recognition as a monarch . Although Augustus could claim that his power was authentically republican , his successors , Tiberius and Nero , could not convincingly make the same claim . Nonetheless , for the first three hundred years of Roman emperors , from Augustus until Diocletian , efforts were made to portray the emperors as leaders of a republic .",

Born to a family of low status in Dalmatia , Diocletian rose through the ranks of the military to become a cavalry commander of the Emperor Carus 's army . After the deaths of Carus and his son Numerian on campaign in Persia , Diocletian was proclaimed emperor . The title was also claimed by Carus 's surviving son , Carinus , but Diocletian defeated him in the Battle of the Margus . Diocletian 's reign stabilized the empire and marks the end of the Crisis of the Third Century . He appointed fellow officer Maximian as Augustus , co-emperor , in 286 . Diocletian reigned in the Eastern Empire , and Maximian reigned in the Western Empire . Diocletian delegated further on 1 March 293 , appointing Galerius and Constantius as Caesars , junior co-emperors , under himself and Maximian respectively . Under this 'tetrarchy ' , or rule of four , each emperor would rule over a quarter-division of the empire . Diocletian secured the empire 's borders and purged it of all threats to his power . He defeated the Sarmatians and Carpi during several campaigns between 285 and 299 , the Alamanni in 288 , and usurpers in Egypt between 297 and 298 . Galerius , aided by Diocletian , campaigned successfully against Sassanid Persia , the empire 's traditional enemy .",

Together with Padua and Treviso , the city is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area ( PATREVE ) , which is considered a statistical metropolitan area , with a total population of 2.6 million . The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BC . The city was historically the capital of the Republic of Venice for a millennium and more , from 697 to 1797 .

Though the empire itself emerged from the decline of Rome and lasted until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 , the start date of the Byzantine period is rather clearer in art history than in political history , if still imprecise . Many Eastern Orthodox states in Eastern Europe , as well as to some degree the Muslim states of the eastern Mediterranean , preserved many aspects of the empire 's culture and art for centuries afterward . A number of states contemporary with the Byzantine Empire were culturally influenced by it , without actually being part of it ( the Byzantine commonwealth ) . These included the Rus , as well as some non-Orthodox states like the Republic of Venice , which separated from the Byzantine empire in the 10th century , and the Kingdom of Sicily , which had close ties to the Byzantine Empire and had also been a Byzantine possession until the 10th century with a large Greek-speaking population persisting into the 12th century . Other states having a Byzantine artistic tradition had oscillated throughout the Middle Ages between being part of the Byzantine empire and having periods of independence , such as Serbia and Bulgaria .

  "/wiki/Gothic_architecture": "Gothic architecture ( Latin : francigenum opus ) is a style that flourished in Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages . It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture . Originating in 12th-century France , it was widely used , especially for cathedrals and churches , until the 16th century . Its most prominent features included the use of the rib vault and the flying buttress , which allowed the weight of the roof to be counterbalanced by buttresses outside the building , giving greater height and more space for windows . Another important feature was the extensive use of stained glass and the rose window , to bring light and color to the interior . Another feature was the use of realistic statuary on the exterior , particularly over the portals , to illustrate biblical stories for the largely illiterate parishioners . Some key architectural features , such as the pointed arch and a decorative kind of rib vault , existed earlier outside Europe , and may have been derived from Islamic architecture . These features had both existed in Romanesque architecture , but they were used more extensively and in more innovative ways to make Gothic cathedrals higher , stronger , and filled with light . The first important example is generally considered to be the Basilica of Saint-Denis , near Paris , whose choir was reconstructed with Gothic rib vaults and large stained glass windows between 1140 and 1144 .",

The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , Italy , Montenegro and Slovenia . The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands , mostly located along the Croatian part of its eastern coast . It is divided into three basins , the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest , with a maximum depth of 1,233 metres ( 4,045 ft ) . The Otranto Sill , an underwater ridge , is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas . The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto , along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western ( Italian ) coast . Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight , although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally . The Adriatic 's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean 's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean , acting as a dilution basin . The surface water temperatures generally range from 30 \u00b0C ( 86 \u00b0F ) in summer to 12 \u00b0C ( 54 \u00b0F ) in winter , significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin 's climate .

Originally , the word was used to refer to an ancient Roman public building , where courts were held , as well as serving other official and public functions . It usually had the door at one end and a slightly raised platform and an apse at the other , where the magistrate or other officials were seated . The basilica was centrally located in every Roman town , usually adjacent to the main forum . Subsequently , the basilica was not built near a forum but adjacent to a palace and was known as a palace basilica . Secondly , as the Roman Empire adopted Christianity , the major church buildings were typically constructed with this basic architectural plan and thus it became popular throughout Europe . It continues to be used in an architectural sense to describe rectangular buildings with a central nave and aisles , and usually a raised platform at the opposite end from the door . In Europe and the Americas the basilica remained the most common architectural style for churches of all Christian denominations , though this building plan has become less dominant in new buildings since the latter 20th century . Thirdly , the term refers to an official designation of a certain kind of church in the Roman Catholic Church : a large and important place of worship that has been given special ceremonial rights by the Pope , whatever its architectural plan .

In addition to the standard periodization , proponents of a long Renaissance put its beginning in the 14th century and its end in the 17th century . The traditional view focuses more on the early modern aspects of the Renaissance and argues that it was a break from the past , but many historians today focus more on its medieval aspects and argue that it was an extension of the Middle Ages . The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was its version of humanism , derived from the concept of Roman Humanitas and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy , such as that of Protagoras , who said that Man is the measure of all things . This new thinking became manifest in art , architecture , politics , science and literature . Early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the recycled knowledge of how to make concrete . Although the invention of metal movable type sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century , the changes of the Renaissance were not uniformly experienced across Europe : the very first traces appear in Italy as early as the late 13th century , in particular with the writings of Dante and the paintings of Giotto . As a cultural movement , the Renaissance encompassed innovative flowering of Latin and vernacular literatures , beginning with the 14th-century resurgence of learning based on classical sources , which contemporaries credited to Petrarch ; the development of linear perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality in painting ; and gradual but widespread educational reform . In politics , the Renaissance contributed to the development of the customs and conventions of diplomacy , and in science to an increased reliance on observation and inductive reasoning . Although the Renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual pursuits , as well as social and political upheaval , it is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo , who inspired the term Renaissance man . The Renaissance began in the 14th century in Florence , Italy . Various theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics , focusing on a variety of factors including the social and civic peculiarities of Florence at the time : its political structure , the patronage of its dominant family , the Medici , and the migration of Greek scholars and their texts to Italy following the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks .",

Approximately 68 km ( 42.25 mi ) long , with a high east-west ridge of Mesozoic limestone and dolomite , the island of Hvar is unusual in the area for having a large fertile coastal plain , and fresh water springs . Its hillsides are covered in pine forests , with vineyards , olive groves , fruit orchards and lavender fields in the agricultural areas . The climate is characterized by mild winters , and warm summers with many hours of sunshine . The island has 11,103 residents , making it the 4th most populated of the Croatian islands . Hvar 's location at the center of the Adriatic sailing routes has long made this island an important base for commanding trade up and down the Adriatic , across to Italy and throughout the wider Mediterranean . It has been inhabited since pre-historic times , originally by a Neolithic people whose distinctive pottery gave rise to the term Hvar culture , and later by the Illyrians . The ancient Greeks founded the colony of Pharos in 384 BC on the site of today 's Stari Grad , making it one of the oldest towns in Europe . They were also responsible for setting out the agricultural field divisions of the Stari Grad Plain , now a UNESCO World Heritage Site . In medieval times , the City of Hvar rose to importance within the Venetian Empire as a major naval base . Prosperity brought culture and the arts , with one of the first public theatres in Europe , nobles palaces and many fine communal buildings . The 16th century was an unsettled time , with the Hvar Rebellion , coastal raids by pirates and the Ottoman army from the mainland , resulting in some unusual fortified buildings on the northern shore to protect the local population .",

Bonds between a colony and its metropolis remained often close , and took specific forms during the period of classical antiquity . Generally , colonies founded by the ancient Phoenicians , Carthage , Rome , Alexander the Great and his successors remained tied to their metropolis , but Greek colonies of the Archaic and Classical eras were sovereign and self-governing from their inception . While Greek colonies were often founded to solve social unrest in the mother-city , by expelling a part of the population , Hellenistic , Roman , Carthaginian , and Han Chinese colonies were used for expansion and empire-building .",

By the mid-16th century , the Ottomans annexed the entirety of modern-day Serbia ; their rule was at times interrupted by the Habsburg Empire , which began expanding towards Central Serbia from the end of the 17th century while maintaining a foothold in Vojvodina . In the early 19th century , the Serbian Revolution established the nation-state as the region 's first constitutional monarchy , which subsequently expanded its territory . Following disastrous casualties in World War I , and the subsequent unification of the former Habsburg crownland of Vojvodina ( and other lands ) with Serbia , the country co-founded Yugoslavia with other South Slavic peoples , which would exist in various political formations until the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s .
