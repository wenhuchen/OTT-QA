  "/wiki/Functional_Urban_Area": "The larger urban zone ( LUZ ) , or Functional Urban Area ( FUA ) , is a measure of the population and expanse of metropolitan areas in Europe . It consists of a city and its commuting zone . The definition was introduced in 2004 by Eurostat , the statistical agency of the European Union ( EU ) , in agreement with the national statistics offices in the member states . Eurostat data is provided on cities in the EU , its candidate countries and EFTA countries . Several cities were excluded by definition from the 2004 list of LUZs on technical , definitional grounds , such as the coincidence of the metropolitan area with the urban zone . The LUZ represents an attempt at a harmonised definition of the metropolitan area . Eurostat 's objective was to have an area from which a significant share of the residents commute into the city , a concept known as the functional urban region . To ensure a good data availability , Eurostat adjusts the LUZ boundaries to administrative boundaries that approximate the functional urban region . In 2006 LUZ definitions were changed significantly , improving the comparability of LUZ definitions across different countries , and allowing for almost all cities to be included .",
