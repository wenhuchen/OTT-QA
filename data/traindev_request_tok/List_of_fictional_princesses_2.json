  "/wiki/Aida": "Aida ( pronounced [ a\u02c8i\u02d0da ] ) is an opera in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto by Antonio Ghislanzoni . Set in the Old Kingdom of Egypt , it was commissioned by Cairo 's Khedivial Opera House and had its premi\u00e8re there on 24 December 1871 , in a performance conducted by Giovanni Bottesini . Today the work holds a central place in the operatic canon , receiving performances every year around the world ; at New York 's Metropolitan Opera alone , Aida has been sung more than 1,100 times since 1886 . Ghislanzoni 's scheme follows a scenario often attributed to the French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette , but Verdi biographer Mary Jane Phillips-Matz argues that the source is actually Temistocle Solera .",
  "/wiki/Giuseppe_Verdi": "Giuseppe Fortunino Francesco Verdi ( Italian : [ d\u0292u\u02c8z\u025bppe \u02c8verdi ] ; 9 or 10 October 1813 - 27 January 1901 ) was an Italian opera composer . He was born near Busseto to a provincial family of moderate means , and developed a musical education with the help of a local patron . Verdi came to dominate the Italian opera scene after the era of Vincenzo Bellini , Gaetano Donizetti , and Gioachino Rossini , whose works significantly influenced him . In his early operas , Verdi demonstrated a sympathy with the Risorgimento movement which sought the unification of Italy . He also participated briefly as an elected politician . The chorus Va , pensiero from his early opera Nabucco ( 1842 ) , and similar choruses in later operas , were much in the spirit of the unification movement , and the composer himself became esteemed as a representative of these ideals . An intensely private person , Verdi , however , did not seek to ingratiate himself with popular movements and as he became professionally successful was able to reduce his operatic workload and sought to establish himself as a landowner in his native region . He surprised the musical world by returning , after his success with the opera Aida ( 1871 ) , with three late masterpieces : his Requiem ( 1874 ) , and the operas Otello ( 1887 ) and Falstaff ( 1893 ) . His operas remain extremely popular , especially the three peaks of his 'middle period ' : Rigoletto , Il trovatore and La traviata , and the 2013 bicentenary of his birth was widely celebrated in broadcasts and performances .",
  "/wiki/Rock_and_roll": "Rock and roll ( often written as rock & roll , rock ' n ' roll or rock ' n roll ) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s from musical styles such as gospel , jump blues , jazz , boogie woogie , rhythm and blues , and country music . While elements of what was to become rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s , the genre did not acquire its name until 1954 . According to Greg Kot , rock and roll refers to a style of popular music originating in the U.S. in the 1950s prior to its development by the mid-1960s into the more encompassing international style known as rock music , though the latter also continued to be known as rock and roll . For the purpose of differentiation , this article deals with the first definition . In the earliest rock and roll styles , either the piano or saxophone was typically the lead instrument , but these instruments were generally replaced or supplemented by guitar in the middle to late 1950s . The beat is essentially a dance rhythm with an accentuated backbeat , which is almost always provided by a snare drum . Classic rock and roll is usually played with one or two electric guitars ( one lead , one rhythm ) , a double bass or string bass or ( after the mid-1950s ) an electric bass guitar , and a drum kit . Beyond simply a musical style , rock and roll , as seen in movies , in fan magazines , and on television , influenced lifestyles , fashion , attitudes , and language . In addition , rock and roll may have contributed to the civil rights movement because both African-American and white American teenagers enjoyed the music . It went on to spawn various genres , often without the initially characteristic backbeat , that are now more commonly called rock music or simply rock .",

Her name uses the full moon as a metaphor for female beauty , which is common in Arabic literature and throughout the Arabian Nights . When Aladdin finds a magic lamp , he discovers it contains a jinni bound to do the bidding of the person holding the lamp . With the aid of the jinn , Aladdin - an impoverished young man who , in other circumstances , could not have aspired to marry a princess - becomes rich and powerful and marries Princess Badroulbadour .

  "/wiki/Pantomime": "Pantomime ( /\u02c8p\u00e6nt\u0259ma\u026am/ ; informally panto ) is a type of musical comedy stage production designed for family entertainment . It was developed in England and is performed throughout the United Kingdom , Ireland and ( to a lesser extent ) in other English-speaking countries , especially during the Christmas and New Year season . Modern pantomime includes songs , gags , slapstick comedy and dancing . It employs gender-crossing actors and combines topical humour with a story more or less based on a well-known fairy tale , fable or folk tale . Pantomime is a participatory form of theatre , in which the audience is expected to sing along with certain parts of the music and shout out phrases to the performers . Pantomime has a long theatrical history in Western culture dating back to classical theatre . It developed partly from the 16th century commedia dell'arte tradition of Italy and other European and British stage traditions , such as 17th-century masques and music hall . An important part of the pantomime , until the late 19th century , was the harlequinade . Outside Britain , the word pantomime is often understood to mean miming , rather than the theatrical form discussed here .",

  "/wiki/Verse_drama_and_dramatic_verse": "Verse drama is any drama written as verse to be spoken ; another possible general term is poetic drama . For a very long period , verse drama was the dominant form of drama in Europe ( and was also important in non-European cultures ) . Greek tragedy and Racine 's plays are written in verse , as is almost all of Shakespeare 's drama , Ben Jonson , John Fletcher and others like Goethe 's Faust . Verse drama is particularly associated with the seriousness of tragedy , providing an artistic reason to write in this form , as well as the practical one that verse lines are easier for the actors to memorize exactly . In the second half of the twentieth century verse drama fell out of fashion with dramatists writing in English , although the plays of prominent poets , Christopher Fry and T. S. Eliot continued the tradition . Recently , there has been a resurgence in interest in the form of verse drama , particularly those plays in blank verse or iambic pentameter , which endeavor to be in conversation with Shakespeare 's writing styles . King Charles III by Mike Bartlett , written in iambic pentameter , played on the West End and Broadway , as well as being filmed with the original cast for the BBC . Likewise , La Bete by David Hirson , which endeavors to recreate Moliere 's farces in rhyming couplets , enjoyed several prominent productions on both sides of the Atlantic . David Ives , known best for his short , absurdist work , has turned to transladaptation ( his word ) in his later years : translating and updating French farces , such as The School for Lies and The Metromaniacs , both of which premiered in New York City . With the renewed interest in verse drama , theatre companies are looking for new Shakespeare plays to produce . Companies such as Red Bull Theater in New York City ( named after the historical theatre of the same name ) specializes in producing Ives ' transladaptations as well as obscure verse plays . Turn to Flesh Productions , a New York City theatre company founded by verse drama specialist , Emily C. A. Snyder , directly develops new verse plays with living playwrights , with a mission to create vibrant roles for women and those underrepresented in classical art .",

Brought up by poor yet musically talented parents on the island of Funen , he demonstrated his musical abilities at an early age . He initially played in a military band before attending the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen from 1884 until December 1886 . He premiered his Op . 1 , Suite for Strings , in 1888 , at the age of 23 . The following year , Nielsen began a 16-year stint as a second violinist in the Royal Danish Orchestra under the conductor Johan Svendsen , during which he played in Giuseppe Verdi 's Falstaff and Otello at their Danish premieres . In 1916 , he took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy and continued to work there until his death . Although his symphonies , concertos and choral music are now internationally acclaimed , Nielsen 's career and personal life were marked by many difficulties , often reflected in his music . The works he composed between 1897 and 1904 are sometimes ascribed to his psychological period , resulting mainly from a turbulent marriage with the sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen . Nielsen is especially noted for his six symphonies , his Wind Quintet and his concertos for violin , flute and clarinet . In Denmark , his opera Maskarade and many of his songs have become an integral part of the national heritage . His early music was inspired by composers such as Brahms and Grieg , but he soon developed his own style , first experimenting with progressive tonality and later diverging even more radically from the standards of composition still common at the time .",

There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education . When an opportunity for such an education arose , he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory , from which he graduated in 1865 . The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five , with whom his professional relationship was mixed . Tchaikovsky 's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood .

The baffled leading man of the troupe , Ludwig , spearheads the rebellion against the hypochondriac , miserly Grand Duke and becomes engaged to four different women before the plot is resolved .

  "/wiki/Savoy_Opera": "Savoy opera was a style of comic opera that developed in Victorian England in the late 19th century , with W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan as the original and most successful practitioners . The name is derived from the Savoy Theatre , which impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte built to house the Gilbert and Sullivan pieces , and later , those by other composer-librettist teams . The great bulk of the non-G & S Savoy Operas either failed to achieve a foothold in the standard repertory , or have faded over the years , leaving the term Savoy Opera as practically synonymous with Gilbert and Sullivan . The Savoy operas ( in both senses ) were seminal influences on the creation of the modern musical . Gilbert , Sullivan , Carte and other Victorian era British composers , librettists and producers , as well as the contemporary British press and literature , called works of this kind comic operas to distinguish their content and style from that of the often risqu\u00e9 continental European operettas that they wished to displace . Most of the published literature on Gilbert and Sullivan since that time refers to these works as Savoy Operas , comic operas , or both . However , the Penguin Opera Guides and many other general music dictionaries and encyclopedias classify the Gilbert and Sullivan works as operettas . Patience ( 1881 ) was the first opera to appear at the Savoy Theatre , and thus , in a strict sense , the first true Savoy Opera , although the term Savoy Opera has , for over a century , included the complete set of thirteen operas that Gilbert and Sullivan wrote for Richard D'Oyly Carte :",

The most famous of these include H.M.S . Pinafore , The Pirates of Penzance and one of the most frequently performed works in the history of musical theatre , The Mikado . The popularity of these works was supported for over a century by year-round performances of them , in Britain and abroad , by the repertory company that Gilbert , Sullivan and their producer Richard D'Oyly Carte founded , the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company . These Savoy operas are still frequently performed in the English-speaking world and beyond . Gilbert 's creative output included over 75 plays and libretti , and numerous short stories , poems and lyrics , both comic and serious . After brief careers as a government clerk and a lawyer , Gilbert began to focus , in the 1860s , on writing light verse , including his Bab Ballads , short stories , theatre reviews and illustrations , often for Fun magazine . He also began to write burlesques and his first comic plays , developing a unique absurdist , inverted style that would later be known as his topsy-turvy style . He also developed a realistic method of stage direction and a reputation as a strict theatre director . In the 1870s , Gilbert wrote 40 plays and libretti , including his German Reed Entertainments , several blank-verse fairy comedies , some serious plays , and his first five collaborations with Sullivan : Thespis , Trial by Jury , The Sorcerer , H.M.S .

His best-known orchestral compositions - Capriccio Espagnol , the Russian Easter Festival Overture , and the symphonic suite Scheherazade - are staples of the classical music repertoire , along with suites and excerpts from some of his 15 operas . Scheherazade is an example of his frequent use of fairy-tale and folk subjects . Rimsky-Korsakov believed in developing a nationalistic style of classical music , as did his fellow-composer Mily Balakirev and the critic Vladimir Stasov . This style employed Russian folk song and lore along with exotic harmonic , melodic and rhythmic elements in a practice known as musical orientalism , and eschewed traditional Western compositional methods . Rimsky-Korsakov appreciated Western musical techniques after he became a professor of musical composition , harmony , and orchestration at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1871 . He undertook a rigorous three-year program of self-education and became a master of Western methods , incorporating them alongside the influences of Mikhail Glinka and fellow members of The Five . Rimsky-Korsakov 's techniques of composition and orchestration were further enriched by his exposure to the works of Richard Wagner .

The oldest surviving farce may be Le Gar\u00e7on et l'aveugle ( The Boy and the Blind Man ) from after 1266 , although the earliest farces that can be dated come from between 1450 and 1550 . The best known farce is La Farce de ma\u00eetre Pathelin ( The Farce of Master Pathelin ) from c. 1460 .",
  "/wiki/Alfred_Tennyson,_1st_Baron_Tennyson": "Alfred Tennyson , 1st Baron Tennyson FRS ( 6 August 1809 - 6 October 1892 ) was a British poet . He was the Poet Laureate of Great Britain and Ireland during much of Queen Victoria 's reign and remains one of the most popular British poets . In 1829 , Tennyson was awarded the Chancellor 's Gold Medal at Cambridge for one of his first pieces , Timbuktu . He published his first solo collection of poems , Poems Chiefly Lyrical in 1830 . Claribel and Mariana , which remain some of Tennyson 's most celebrated poems , were included in this volume . Although decried by some critics as overly sentimental , his verse soon proved popular and brought Tennyson to the attention of well-known writers of the day , including Samuel Taylor Coleridge . Tennyson 's early poetry , with its medievalism and powerful visual imagery , was a major influence on the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood . Tennyson also excelled at penning short lyrics , such as Break , Break , Break , The Charge of the Light Brigade , Tears , Idle Tears , and Crossing the Bar . Much of his verse was based on classical mythological themes , such as Ulysses , although In Memoriam A.H.H . was written to commemorate his friend Arthur Hallam , a fellow poet and student at Trinity College , Cambridge , after he died of a stroke at the age of 22 . Tennyson also wrote some notable blank verse including Idylls of the King , Ulysses , and Tithonus . During his career , Tennyson attempted drama , but his plays enjoyed little success .",

  "/wiki/Princess_Ida": "Princess Ida ; or , Castle Adamant is a comic opera with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W. S. Gilbert . It was their eighth operatic collaboration of fourteen . Princess Ida opened at the Savoy Theatre on 5 January 1884 , for a run of 246 performances . The piece concerns a princess who founds a women 's university and teaches that women are superior to men and should rule in their stead . The prince to whom she had been married in infancy sneaks into the university , together with two friends , with the aim of collecting his bride . They disguise themselves as women students , but are discovered , and all soon face a literal war between the sexes . The opera satirizes feminism , women 's education and Darwinian evolution , which were controversial topics in conservative Victorian England . Princess Ida is based on a narrative poem by Alfred , Lord Tennyson called The Princess ( 1847 ) , and Gilbert had written a farcical musical play , based on the poem , in 1870 . He lifted much of the dialogue of Princess Ida directly from his 1870 farce . It is the only Gilbert and Sullivan opera in three acts and the only one with dialogue in blank verse . By Savoy Opera standards , Princess Ida was not considered a success due , in part , to a particularly hot summer in London in 1884 , and it was not revived in London until 1919 . Nevertheless , the piece is performed regularly today by both professional and amateur companies , although not as frequently as the most popular of the Savoy operas .",
  "/wiki/Comic_opera": "Comic opera is a sung dramatic work of a light or comic nature , usually with a happy ending and often including spoken dialogue . Forms of comic opera first developed in late 17th-century Italy . By the 1730s , a new operatic genre , opera buffa , emerged as an alternative to opera seria . It quickly made its way to France , where it became op\u00e9ra bouffon , and eventually , in the following century , French operetta , with Jacques Offenbach as its most accomplished practitioner . The influence of the Italian and French forms spread to other parts of Europe . Many countries developed their own genres of comic opera , incorporating the Italian and French models along with their own musical traditions . Examples include Viennese operetta , German singspiel , Spanish zarzuela , Russian comic opera , English ballad opera and Savoy Opera .",
  "/wiki/Libretto": "A libretto ( lit . booklet ) is the text used in , or intended for , an extended musical work such as an opera , operetta , masque , oratorio , cantata or musical . The term libretto is also sometimes used to refer to the text of major liturgical works , such as the Mass , requiem and sacred cantata , or the story line of a ballet . Libretto ( pronounced [ li\u02c8bretto ] ; plural libretti [ li\u02c8bretti ] ) , from Italian , is the diminutive of the word libro ( book ) . Sometimes other-language equivalents are used for libretti in that language , livret for French works and Textbuch for German . A libretto is distinct from a synopsis or scenario of the plot , in that the libretto contains all the words and stage directions , while a synopsis summarizes the plot . Some ballet historians also use the word libretto to refer to the 15-40 page books which were on sale to 19th century ballet audiences in Paris and contained a very detailed description of the ballet 's story , scene by scene . The relationship of the librettist ( that is , the writer of a libretto ) to the composer in the creation of a musical work has varied over the centuries , as have the sources and the writing techniques employed . In the context of a modern English language musical theatre piece , the libretto is often referred to as the book of the work , though this usage typically excludes sung lyrics .",
