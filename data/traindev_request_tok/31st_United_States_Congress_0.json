  "/wiki/List_of_United_States_Senators_from_Illinois": "Illinois was admitted to the Union on December 3 , 1818 , and has been represented in the United States Senate by 47 senators . Senators from Illinois are elected to Class 2 and Class 3 . The Senate twice refused to seat Frank L. Smith , in December 1926 for an appointed term and in March 1927 for an elected one , due to corruption , but he is included in this list because Smith and the Governor considered him to be a senator for approximately two years . Of the eight African Americans ever to sit in the U.S. Senate since Reconstruction , three have held Illinois 's Class 3 seat , including Barack Obama who went on to become the President of the United States . This makes Illinois the state with the most African-American senators .

  "/wiki/James_Shields_(politician,_born_1810)": "James Shields ( May 10 , 1806 [ a ] - June 1 , 1879 ) was an Irish American Democratic politician and United States Army officer , who is the only person in U.S. history to serve as a Senator for three different states . Shields represented Illinois from 1849 to 1855 , in the 31st , 32nd , and 33rd Congresses , Minnesota from 1858 to 1859 , in the 35th Congress , and Missouri in 1879 , in the 45th Congress . Born and initially educated in Ireland , Shields emigrated to the Americas in 1826 . He was briefly a sailor , and spent time in Quebec , before settling in Kaskaskia , Illinois , where he studied and practiced law . In 1836 , he was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives , and later as State Auditor . His work as auditor was criticized by a young Abraham Lincoln , who ( with his then fianc\u00e9e , Mary Todd ) published a series of inflammatory pseudonymous letters in a local paper . Shields challenged Lincoln to a duel , and the two nearly fought on September 22 , 1842 , before making peace , and eventually becoming friends . In 1845 , Shields was appointed to the Illinois Supreme Court , from which he resigned to become Commissioner of the U.S. General Land Office . At the outbreak of the Mexican-American War , he left the Land Office to take an appointment as brigadier general of volunteers . He served with distinction and was twice wounded .

  "/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)": "The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States , along with its main rival , the Republican Party . Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison 's Democratic-Republican Party , the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson , making it the world 's oldest active political party . In its early years , the Party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s , the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform . Well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings ; following the New Deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South . The New Deal Coalition of 1932-1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction - many of whom were Catholics based in the cities . After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the core bases of the two parties shifted , with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic . The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s . White evangelicals and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local levels since the 1990s . People living in urban areas , women , college graduates , sexual and gender minorities , millennials , and black , Latino , Jewish , Muslim and Asian Americans tend to support the Democratic Party . The Democratic Party 's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality , along with the welfare state . It seeks to provide government regulation in the economy .",
  "/wiki/United_States_Constitution": "The Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the United States of America . The Constitution , originally comprising seven articles , delineates the national frame of government . Its first three articles embody the doctrine of the separation of powers , whereby the federal government is divided into three branches : the legislative , consisting of the bicameral Congress ( Article One ) ; the executive , consisting of the president ( Article Two ) ; and the judicial , consisting of the Supreme Court and other federal courts ( Article Three ) . Articles Four , Five and Six embody concepts of federalism , describing the rights and responsibilities of state governments , the states in relationship to the federal government , and the shared process of constitutional amendment . Article Seven establishes the procedure subsequently used by the thirteen States to ratify it . It is regarded as the oldest written and codified national constitution in force . Since the Constitution came into force in 1789 , it has been amended 27 times , including one amendment that repealed a previous one , in order to meet the needs of a nation that has profoundly changed since the eighteenth century . In general , the first ten amendments , known collectively as the Bill of Rights , offer specific protections of individual liberty and justice and place restrictions on the powers of government . The majority of the seventeen later amendments expand individual civil rights protections . Others address issues related to federal authority or modify government processes and procedures . Amendments to the United States Constitution , unlike ones made to many constitutions worldwide , are appended to the document . All four pages of the original U.S. Constitution are written on parchment .",

  "/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)": "The Whig Party was a political party active in the middle of the 19th century in the United States of America . Alongside the Democratic Party , it was one of the two major parties in the United States during the late 1830s , the 1840s , and the early 1850s , part of the Second Party System . Four U.S. presidents were affiliated with the Whig party for at least part of their respective terms . Other influential party leaders include Henry Clay , Daniel Webster , William Seward , John J. Crittenden , and Truman Smith . The Whigs emerged in the 1830s in opposition to President Andrew Jackson , pulling together former members of the National Republican Party , the Anti-Masonic Party , and disaffected Democrats . The Whigs had some links to the defunct Federalist Party , but the Whig Party was not a direct successor to that party and many Whig leaders , including Clay , had aligned with the rival Democratic-Republican Party . In the 1836 presidential election , four different Whig candidates received electoral votes , but the party failed to defeat Jackson 's chosen successor , Martin Van Buren . Whig nominee William Henry Harrison unseated Van Buren in the 1840 presidential election , but died just one month into his term . Harrison 's successor , John Tyler , was expelled from the party in 1841 after clashing with Clay and other Whig Party leaders over economic policies such as the re-establishment of a national bank . Clay won his party 's nomination in the 1844 presidential election but was defeated by Democrat James K. Polk , who subsequently presided over the Mexican-American War . Whig nominee Zachary Taylor won the 1848 presidential election , but Taylor died in 1850 and was succeeded by Millard Fillmore . Fillmore , Clay , Daniel Webster , and Democrat Stephen A. Douglas led the passage of the Compromise of 1850 , which helped to defuse sectional tensions in the aftermath of the Mexican-American War .",
