Principal photography commenced in September 2006 with a budget of $ 75 million , and ended in December of that year ; filming took place on locations in Toronto and Hamilton , Ontario , Canada and on soundstages at Toronto 's Showline Studios . Recording sessions for the film 's songs and soundtrack took place in San Diego , California in the United States .
