In 2001 , Littleborough and its suburbs of Calderbrook , Shore and Smithy Bridge , had a population of 13,807 . Historically a part of Lancashire , Littleborough and its surroundings have provided evidence of Neolithic , Celtic , Roman and Anglo-Saxon activity in the area . During the Middle Ages , Littleborough was a hamlet in the manor of Hundersfield , parish of Rochdale and hundred of Salford . It was focussed upon the junction of two ancient routes over the Pennines - one of which may have been a Roman road - that joined to cross the River Roch . By 1472 , Littleborough consisted of a chapel , a cluster of cottages , and an inn , and its inhabitants were broadly farmers who were spurred to weave wool by merchants who passed between the markets at Rochdale and Halifax . When cotton was introduced as a base to make textiles , Littleborough experienced an influx of families , mostly from the neighbouring West Riding of Yorkshire . Affluent homes and estates were established on Littleborough 's fringes . In the late 18th century , the low-altitude Summit Gap between Littleborough and Walsden was approved as the best route over the Pennines for the Rochdale Canal and the Manchester to Leeds railway ; Hollingworth Lake was built at Littleborough 's south side as a feeder reservoir to regulate the waters of the canal . This infrastructure encouraged industrialists to modify Littleborough 's traditional handloom cloth workshops with a mechanised form of textile production . Attracted to the area 's natural resources and modern infrastructure , coal mining , engineering ventures and increasingly large textile mills contributed to Littleborough 's population growth and urbanisation , sealing its status as a mill town .",

Drums may be played individually , with the player using a single drum , and some drums such as the djembe are almost always played in this way . Others are normally played in a set of two or more , all played by the one player , such as bongo drums and timpani .

  "/wiki/Euphonium": "The euphonium is a medium-sized , 3 or 4-valve , often compensating , conical-bore , tenor-voiced brass instrument that derives its name from the Ancient Greek word \u03b5\u1f54\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 euph\u014dnos , meaning well-sounding or sweet-voiced ( \u03b5\u1f56 eu means well or good and \u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03ae ph\u014dn\u0113 means sound , hence of good sound ) . The euphonium is a valved instrument . Nearly all current models have piston valves , though some models with rotary valves do exist . The euphonium may be played in bass clef as a non-transposing instrument or in treble clef as a transposing instrument . In British brass bands , it is typically treated as a treble-clef instrument , while in American band music , parts may be written in either treble clef or bass clef , or both ."
