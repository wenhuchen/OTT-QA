  "/wiki/Earl_of_Mar": "The title Mormaer or Earl of Mar has been created several times , all in the Peerage of Scotland . Owing to a 19th-century dispute , there are currently two Earls of Mar as both the first and seventh creations are currently extant . The first creation of the earldom was originally the provincial ruler of the province of Mar in north-eastern Scotland . First attested in the year 1014 , the seat or caput eventually became Kildrummy Castle , although other sites like Doune of Invernochty were initially just as important . The title evolved into a peerage title , and was made particularly famous by John Erskine , the 23rd/6th Earl of Mar , who was an important Jacobite military leader during the 1715 Jacobite rising . Margaret of Mar , 31st Countess of Mar holds the title in the first creation , and James Erskine , 14th Earl of Mar and 16th Earl of Kellie in the seventh . The Earl of Mar and Kellie is the hereditary Clan Chief of Clan Erskine ; the Countess of Mar is the hereditary Clan Chief of Clan Mar . The Earldom of Mar , which is one of the seven original Scottish earldoms , is thought to be the oldest peerage in Great Britain , and even Europe .

  "/wiki/Lord_Somerville": "Lord Somerville is a title in the Peerage of Scotland which is subject to a number of ambiguities . The date of creation is not known with certainty but it was probably created about 1435 for Thomas Somerville , Justiciar of Scotland . The title was omitted in 1606 when an ordered list of the Scottish peerage was produced following the union of the Scottish and English crowns , and the title was not used during the 17th century . In 1723 , however , the House of Lords ratified and acknowledged the title for James Somerville the 13th Lord . The consecutive numbers ascribed to the numerous Lords differ according to which authority is consulted . The list below uses the numbers favoured by Burkes Peerage . The Somervilles claim descent from William de Somerville , given Carnwath by David I of Scotland in the 12th century . A family history was written by James Somerville , 11th Lord Somerville in 1679 . He related that William the Lion made John Somerville , his falconer , baron of Linton in Roxburghshire for killing a monstrous worm in 1174 . The Worm of Linton was three Scots yards long and coloured like an adder . After stalking the beast for several days , Sir John killed it with a long iron-clad lance with a Catherine wheel fitted near its point . From this exploit the Somervilles used a wyvern in their heraldry .",

  "/wiki/Earl_of_Atholl": "The Mormaer or Earl of Atholl was the title of the holder of a medieval comital lordship straddling the highland province of Atholl ( Ath Fodhla ) , now in northern Perthshire . Atholl is a special Mormaerdom , because a King of Atholl is reported from the Pictish period . The only other two Pictish kingdoms to be known from contemporary sources are Fortriu and Circinn . Indeed , the early 13th century document known to modern scholars as the de Situ Albanie repeats the claim that Atholl was an ancient Pictish kingdom . In the 11th century , the famous Cr\u00edn\u00e1n of Dunkeld may have performed the role of Mormaer . Royal connections continued with M\u00e1el Muire , who was the son of King Donnchad I , and the younger brother of M\u00e1el Coluim III mac Donnchada . Matad was perhaps the most famous of the Mormaers , fathering Harald Maddadsson , a notorious rebel of the Scottish King and perhaps the first Gael to rule Orkney as Earl of Orkney . The line of M\u00e1el Muire and Cr\u00edn\u00e1n came to an end when Forbhlaith , the daughter of Mormaer Henry married David de Hastings . The latter marriage produced a daughter , Ada , who married into the Strathbogie family , a semi-Normanized Gaelic family with Fife origins . The Strathbogies ruled until the Wars of Independence , when the Campells took over . It finally passed to the Stewarts .",
