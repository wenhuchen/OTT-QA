Many of his subjects opposed his policies , in particular the levying of taxes without parliamentary consent , and perceived his actions as those of a tyrannical absolute monarch . His religious policies , coupled with his marriage to a Roman Catholic , generated the antipathy and mistrust of Reformed groups such as the English Puritans and Scottish Covenanters , who thought his views were too Catholic . He supported high church Anglican ecclesiastics , such as Richard Montagu and William Laud , and failed to aid Protestant forces successfully during the Thirty Years ' War . His attempts to force the Church of Scotland to adopt high Anglican practices led to the Bishops ' Wars , strengthened the position of the English and Scottish parliaments , and helped precipitate his own downfall .

Its construction , completed in Wren 's lifetime , was part of a major rebuilding programme in the City after the Great Fire of London . [ page needed ] The cathedral building largely destroyed in the Great Fire , now often referred to as Old St Paul 's Cathedral , was a central focus for medieval and early modern London , including Paul 's walk and St Paul 's Churchyard being the site of St Paul 's Cross .

  "/wiki/List_of_founding_Fellows,_Scholars_and_Commissioners_of_Jesus_College,_Oxford": "Jesus College , Oxford , the first Protestant college at the University of Oxford , was founded by Elizabeth I in 1571 at the instigation of a Welsh clergyman , Hugh Price . The royal charter issued by Elizabeth appointed a Principal and various Fellows , Scholars and Commissioners : the Fellows to educate the Scholars and to run the college , under the overall direction of the Principal ; and the Commissioners to draw up statutes for the governance of the college , its officers and servants , and the management of the college property . The college was founded to help with the increased numbers of Welsh students at Oxford , and the founding Fellows included a number of individuals with links to Wales . The Commissioners included prominent individuals such as William Cecil , Lord Burghley , the Principal Secretary of State . The charter also gave land and buildings in Oxford to the new college . Whilst the foundation process of the college started in 1571 , it took more than fifty years and a further two charters , one in 1589 from Elizabeth and one in 1622 from her successor , James I , to complete the process . These further charters were necessary because neither the Commissioners appointed by the 1571 charter nor those appointed by the 1589 charter fulfilled their allotted task of drawing up statutes . During this time , Griffith Powell ( one of the Fellows who was pressing for statutes to be drawn up ) concluded that successive Principals were loath to have statutes , since these would limit the Principal 's powers . One Principal lost a draft copy of the statutes ; the next kept the next draft in his study for several years without taking steps to have them confirmed by the Commissioners . It was not until after the 1622 charter that statutes were approved by the Commissioners and the college was fully constituted . Despite the intention on the foundation of the college , none of the charters made special provision for Welsh students , although the students were predominantly Welsh from the outset .",

  "/wiki/English_Civil_War": "The English Civil War ( 1642-1651 ) was a series of civil wars and political machinations between Parliamentarians ( Roundheads ) and Royalists ( Cavaliers ) principally over the manner of England 's governance . The first ( 1642-1646 ) and second ( 1648-1649 ) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament , while the third ( 1649-1651 ) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament . The war ended with Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651 . The outcome of the war was threefold : the trial and execution of Charles I ( 1649 ) ; the exile of his son , Charles II ( 1651 ) ; and the replacement of English monarchy with , at first , the Commonwealth of England ( 1649-1653 ) and then the Protectorate under the personal rule of Oliver Cromwell ( 1653-1658 ) and briefly his son Richard ( 1658-1659 ) . A king had never been executed before . In England , the monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship was ended , while in Ireland the victors consolidated the established Protestant Ascendancy . Constitutionally , the wars established the precedent that an English monarch can not govern without Parliament 's consent , although the idea of Parliamentary sovereignty was only legally established as part of the Glorious Revolution in 1688 .",

  "/wiki/Oriel_College,_Oxford": "Oriel College ( /\u02c8\u0254\u02d0r\u026a\u0259l/ ) is a constituent college of the University of Oxford in Oxford , England . Located in Oriel Square , the college has the distinction of being the oldest royal foundation in Oxford ( a title formerly claimed by University College , whose claim of being founded by King Alfred is no longer promoted ) . In recognition of this royal connection , the college has also been known as King 's College and King 's Hall . The reigning monarch of the United Kingdom ( since 1952 , Elizabeth II ) is the official Visitor of the college . The original medieval foundation set up by Adam de Brome , under the patronage of Edward II , was called the House or Hall of the Blessed Mary at Oxford . The first design allowed for a provost and ten fellows , called scholars , and the college remained a small body of graduate fellows until the 16th century , when it started to admit undergraduates . During the English Civil War , Oriel played host to high-ranking members of the King 's Oxford Parliament . The main site of the college incorporates four medieval halls : Bedel Hall , St Mary Hall , St Martin Hall and Tackley 's Inn , the last being the earliest property acquired by the college and the oldest standing medieval hall in Oxford . The college has nearly 40 fellows , about 300 undergraduates and some 250 graduates . Oriel was the last of Oxford 's men 's colleges to admit women in 1985 , after more than six centuries as an all-male institution . Today , however , the student body has almost equal numbers of men and women . Oriel 's notable alumni include two Nobel laureates ; prominent fellows have included founders of the Oxford Movement .",
