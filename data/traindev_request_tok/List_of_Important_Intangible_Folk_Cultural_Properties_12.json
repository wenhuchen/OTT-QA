  "/wiki/Dengaku": "Dengaku ( \u7530\u697d ) were rustic Japanese celebrations that can be classified into two types : dengaku that developed as a musical accompaniment to rice planting observances and the dengaku dances that developed in conjunction with sangaku . The dengaku celebrated for rice planting was performed by villagers either at the New Year or during the planting season in early summer . It was only in the 14th century that these dances were brought to the cities and incorporated into Noh theater , notably by the playwright and actor Kan'ami . The instrument of dengaku is the sasara , a wooden percussive instrument clapper , though there are other instruments that can be used . In the Eiga Monogatari there is a detailed description of the rice-planting dengaku . After being brought to the aristocrats , dengaku flourished till the end of the Heian period and became the main performing art of the Kamakura and part of the Muromachi period . By the end of the Muromachi , dengaku was eclipsed by sarugaku . Today it barely survives as a folk performing art . Dengaku was closely linked with the native Japanese religion of Shinto . Ritualistic elements of this was incorporated with Sarugaku to form Noh theatre .",

Developed by Kan'ami and his son Zeami , it is the oldest major theatre art that is still regularly performed today . Although the terms Noh and n\u014dgaku are sometimes used interchangeably , n\u014dgaku encompasses both Noh and ky\u014dgen . Traditionally , a full n\u014dgaku program includes five Noh plays with comedic ky\u014dgen plays in between ; an abbreviated program of two Noh plays with one ky\u014dgen piece has become common today . Optionally , an okina play may be presented in the very beginning of n\u014dgaku presentation . Noh is often based on tales from traditional literature with a supernatural being transformed into human form as a hero narrating a story . Noh integrates masks , costumes and various props in a dance-based performance , requiring highly trained actors and musicians . Emotions are primarily conveyed by stylized conventional gestures while the iconic masks represent the roles such as ghosts , women , children , and the elderly . Written in late middle Japanese , the text vividly describes the ordinary people of the twelfth to sixteenth centuries .

  "/wiki/Sarugaku": "Sarugaku ( \u733f\u697d , monkey music ) , was a form of theatre popular in Japan during the 11th to 14th centuries . It originated from sangaku , a form of entertainment reminiscent of the modern-day circus , consisting mostly of acrobatics , juggling , and pantomime , sometimes combined with drum dancing . It came from China to Japan in the 8th century and there mingled with indigenous traditions , particularly the harvest celebrations of dengaku . In the 11th century , the form began to favor comic sketches while other elements faded away . By the late 12th century , the term sarugaku had come to include comic dialogues based on word play ( toben ) , improvised comic party dances ( ranbu ) , short plays involving several actors , and musical arrangements based on courtesan traditions . During the 13th century , there was increased standardization of words , gestures , musical arrangements , and program combinations ; as well as the adoption of the guild ( za ) system to which all present-day Noh schools can be traced . Ky\u014dgen also developed from sarugaku . Of particular significance is the development of sarugaku troupes in Yamato around Nara and Kyoto during the Kamakura and early Muromachi periods . In particular , the sarugaku Noh troupe Yuzaki , led by Kan'ami , performed in 1374 before the young sh\u014dgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu . The success of this one performance and the resultant shogunal patronage lifted the artform permanently out of the mists of its plebeian past . From then , the term sarugaku gave way to the current nomenclature , Noh . The Japanese term Sarugaku is also used in other contexts to refer to a job or profession that seems to debase the employee or to treat him or her as a source of entertainment rather than as a professional .",

  "/wiki/Kagura": "The epics Kojiki and Nihon Shoki describe a folktale origin for the dances . In these texts , there is a famous legendary tale about the sun goddess Amaterasu , who retreated into a cave , bringing darkness and cold to the world . Ame-no-Uzume , goddess of the dawn and of revelry , led the other gods in a wild dance , and persuaded Amaterasu to emerge to see what the ruckus was all about . Kagura is one of a number of rituals and arts said to derive from this event . Originally called kamukura or kamikura ( \u795e\u5ea7 ) , kagura began as sacred dances performed at the Imperial court by shrine maidens ( miko ) who were supposedly descendants of Ame-no-Uzume . Over time , however , these Mikagura ( \u5fa1\u795e\u697d ) performed within the sacred and private precincts of the Imperial courts , inspired popular ritual dances , called satokagura ( \u91cc\u795e\u697d ) , which , being popular forms , practiced in villages all around the country , were adapted into various other folk traditions and developed into a number of different forms . Among these are miko kagura , shishi kagura , and Ise-style and Izumo-style kagura dances . Many more variations have developed over the centuries , including some which are fairly new , and most of which have become highly secularized folk traditions . Kagura , in particular those forms that involve storytelling or reenactment of fables , is also one of the primary influences on the Noh theatre .",

The dance is marked by its slow , precise and regal movements . The dancers wear intricate traditional Buddhist costumes , which usually include equally beautiful masks . The music and dance pattern is often repeated several times . It is performed on a square platform , usually 6 yards by 6 yards . Gerald Jonas , in his 2008 book Dancing : The pleasure power and art of movement explains that some bugaku dances depict legendary battles , others enact encounters with divine personages or mythical beasts like the phoenix ; one famous set-piece shows two dragons frolicking ( p. 102 ) . He also discusses the ancient instruction manual that describes precisely the refined movements and postures that gagaku and bugaku performers must attain . Its descriptions often use natural metaphors to describe how their movement should be . For example , the dancers might be encouraged to be like a tree swaying in a cool breeze . Amaterasu , the sun goddess had hidden herself in a cave because she was hurt by her brother Susano-o 's unacceptable behaviour . Near the cave entrance , the goddess Ame-no-uzume , turned a tub over and started to dance on it in front of the worried assembly of gods .",
