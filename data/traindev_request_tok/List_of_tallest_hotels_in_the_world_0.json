The sovereign constitutional monarchy is a federation of seven emirates consisting of Abu Dhabi ( which serves as the capital ) , Ajman , Dubai , Fujairah , Ras Al Khaimah , Sharjah and Umm Al Quwain . Their boundaries are complex , with numerous enclaves within the various emirates . Each emirate is governed by a ruler ; together , they jointly form the Federal Supreme Council . One of the rulers serves as the President of the United Arab Emirates . In 2013 , the UAE 's population was 9.2 million , of which 1.4 million are Emirati citizens and 7.8 million are expatriates . Human occupation of the present UAE has been traced back to the emergence of anatomically modern humans from Africa some 125,000 BCE through finds at the Faya-1 site in Mleiha , Sharjah . Burial sites dating back to the Neolithic Age and the Bronze Age include the oldest known such inland site at Jebel Buhais . Known as Magan to the Sumerians , the area was home to a prosperous Bronze Age trading culture during the Umm Al Nar period , which traded between the Indus Valley , Bahrain and Mesopotamia as well as Iran , Bactria and the Levant . The ensuing Wadi Suq period and three Iron Ages saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior . The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the Sasanians and the subsequent Battle of Dibba . The UAE 's long history of trade led to the emergence of Julfar , in the present-day emirate of Ras Al Khaimah , as a major regional trading and maritime hub in the area .",

  "/wiki/Manama": "Manama ( Arabic : \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0629 al-Man\u0101ma Bahrani pronunciation : [ elm\u0250\u02c8n\u0251\u02d0m\u0250 ] ) is the capital and second largest city of Bahrain , with an approximate population of 157,000 people . Long an important trading center in the Persian Gulf , Manama is home to a very diverse population . After periods of Portuguese and Persian control and invasions from the ruling dynasties of Saudi Arabia and Oman , Bahrain established itself as an independent nation during the 19th century period of British hegemony . Although the current twin cities of Manama and Muharraq appear to have been founded simultaneously in the 1300s , Muharraq took prominence due to its defensive location and was thus the capital of Bahrain until 1337 . Manama became the mercantile capital and was the gateway to the main Bahrain Island . In the 20th century , Bahrain 's oil wealth helped spur fast growth and in the 1990s a concerted diversification effort led to expansion in other industries and helped transform Manama into an important financial hub in the Middle East . Manama was designated as the 2012 capital of Arab culture by the Arab League , and a beta global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network in 2018 .",
