He is best known for claiming to have reached the geographic North Pole with his expedition on April 6 , 1909 . Peary was born in Cresson , Pennsylvania , but following his father 's death at a young age , was raised in Portland , Maine . He went to a prominent boarding school called Loomis Chaffe . He attended Bowdoin College , then joined the National Geodetic Survey as a draftsman . Peary enlisted in the navy in 1881 , as a civil engineer . In 1885 , he was made chief of surveying for the Nicaragua Canal ( which was never built ) . Peary visited the Arctic for the first time in 1886 , making an unsuccessful attempt to cross Greenland by dogsled . He returned in 1891 much better prepared , and by reaching Independence Fjord ( in what is now known as Peary Land ) proved conclusively that Greenland was an island . He was one of the first Arctic explorers to study Inuit survival techniques . On his 1898-1902 expedition , Peary set a new Farthest North record by reaching Greenland 's northernmost point , Cape Morris Jesup . Peary made two further expeditions to the Arctic , in 1905-1906 and in 1908-1909 .",

He was one of the principal figures of the period known as the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration . Shackleton 's first experience of the polar regions was as third officer on Captain Robert Falcon Scott 's Discovery expedition of 1901-1904 , from which he was sent home early on health grounds , after he and his companions Scott and Edward Adrian Wilson set a new southern record by marching to latitude 82\u00b0S . During the Nimrod expedition of 1907-1909 , he and three companions established a new record Farthest South latitude at 88\u00b0S , only 97 geographical miles ( 112 statute miles or 180 kilometres ) from the South Pole , the largest advance to the pole in exploration history . Also , members of his team climbed Mount Erebus , the most active Antarctic volcano . For these achievements , Shackleton was knighted by King Edward VII on his return home . After the race to the South Pole ended in December 1911 , with Roald Amundsen 's conquest , Shackleton turned his attention to the crossing of Antarctica from sea to sea , via the pole . To this end , he made preparations for what became the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition , 1914-1917 . Disaster struck this expedition when its ship , Endurance , became trapped in pack ice and was slowly crushed before the shore parties could be landed . The crew escaped by camping on the sea ice until it disintegrated , then by launching the lifeboats to reach Elephant Island and ultimately South Georgia Island , a stormy ocean voyage of 720 nautical miles ( 1,330 km ; 830 mi ) and Shackleton 's most famous exploit . In 1921 , he returned to the Antarctic with the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition , but died of a heart attack while his ship was moored in South Georgia . At his wife 's request , he was buried there .",

Lindbergh covered the \u200b33 1\u20442-hour , 3,600-statute-mile ( 5,800 km ) flight alone in a purpose-built , single-engine Ryan monoplane , the Spirit of St. Louis . Although not the first non-stop transatlantic flight , this was the first solo transatlantic flight , the first transatlantic flight between two major city hubs , and the longest transatlantic flight by almost 2,000 miles , thus it is widely known as a turning point in the trajectory of aviation history and advancement . Lindbergh was an officer in the U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve , and he received the United States ' highest military decoration , the Medal of Honor , for his transatlantic flight . His achievement spurred interest in both commercial aviation and air mail , which revolutionized the aviation industry , and he devoted much time and effort to promoting such activity . Lindbergh 's historic flight and celebrity status also led to tragedy . In March 1932 , his infant son , Charles Jr. , was kidnapped and murdered in what the American media called the Crime of the Century . The case prompted the United States Congress to establish kidnapping as a federal crime once the kidnapper had crossed state lines with their victim . By late 1935 , the hysteria surrounding the case had driven the Lindbergh family into exile in Europe , from which they returned in 1939 . Before the United States entered World War II , Lindbergh was an advocate of non-interventionism and a supporter of Nazi Germany . He opposed not only the intervention of the United States , but also the granting of aid to the United Kingdom .",

The international border between Nepal ( Province No . 1 ) and China ( Tibet Autonomous Region ) runs across its summit point . The current official elevation of 8,848 m ( 29,029 ft ) , recognised by China and Nepal , was established by a 1955 Indian survey and subsequently confirmed by a Chinese survey in 1975 . In 1865 , Everest was given its official English name by the Royal Geographical Society , as recommended by Andrew Waugh , the British Surveyor General of India , who chose the name of his predecessor in the post , Sir George Everest , despite Everest 's objections . Mount Everest attracts many climbers , some of them highly experienced mountaineers . There are two main climbing routes , one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal ( known as the standard route ) and the other from the north in Tibet . While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route , Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness , weather , and wind , as well as significant hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall . As of 2019 [ update ] , over 300 people have died on Everest , many of whose bodies remain on the mountain . The first recorded efforts to reach Everest 's summit were made by British mountaineers . As Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time , the British made several attempts on the north ridge route from the Tibetan side . After the first reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921 reached 7,000 m ( 22,970 ft ) on the North Col , the 1922 expedition pushed the north ridge route up to 8,320 m ( 27,300 ft ) , marking the first time a human had climbed above 8,000 m ( 26,247 ft ) .",

  "/wiki/Space_Shuttle": "The Space Shuttle is a partially reusable low Earth orbital spacecraft system that was operated from 1981 to 2011 by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) as part of the Space Shuttle program . Its official program name was Space Transportation System ( STS ) , taken from a 1969 plan for a system of reusable spacecraft of which it was the only item funded for development . The first of four orbital test flights occurred in 1981 , leading to operational flights beginning in 1982 . In addition to the prototype whose completion was cancelled , five complete Shuttle systems were built and used on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011 , launched from the Kennedy Space Center ( KSC ) in Florida . Operational missions launched numerous satellites , interplanetary probes , and the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) ; conducted science experiments in orbit ; and participated in construction and servicing of the International Space Station . The Shuttle fleet 's total mission time was 1322 days , 19 hours , 21 minutes and 23 seconds . Shuttle components include the Orbiter Vehicle ( OV ) with three clustered Rocketdyne RS-25 main engines , a pair of recoverable solid rocket boosters ( SRBs ) , and the expendable external tank ( ET ) containing liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen . The Space Shuttle was launched vertically , like a conventional rocket , with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV 's three main engines , which were fueled from the ET . The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit , and the ET was jettisoned just before orbit insertion , which used the orbiter 's two Orbital Maneuvering System ( OMS ) engines . At the conclusion of the mission , the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and reenter the atmosphere . The orbiter then glided as a spaceplane to a runway landing , usually to the Shuttle Landing Facility at Kennedy Space Center , Florida or Rogers Dry Lake in Edwards Air Force Base , California . After landing at Edwards , the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft , a specially modified Boeing 747 .",
