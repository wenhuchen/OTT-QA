  "/wiki/Cross-country_skiing_at_the_2002_Winter_Olympics": "The cross-country skiing events at the 2002 Winter Olympics were marred by drug problems . The winners of three races were disqualified after blood tests showed that three skiers had overly high red blood cell counts indicating the use of darbepoetin , a drug used to treat anemia . At the time , the drug was not specifically listed in the International Olympic Committee 's ( IOC ) list of banned substances , but the Olympic rules generally prohibit doping of any kind , in accordance with its charter . After two years and several lawsuits in Olympic and Swiss courts , the skiers in question ( Johann M\u00fchlegg of Spain , and Larissa Lazutina and Olga Danilova of Russia ) were stripped of all their medals from the 2002 Games . See the external links below for the official IOC press releases containing detailed information of the doping cases and their resolution , including initial , intermediate , and final amended results . This article gives the final medalists as decided on by the IOC in early 2004 .",
  "/wiki/Erythropoietin": "Erythropoietin ( /\u026a\u02ccr\u026a\u03b8ro\u028a\u02c8p\u0254\u026a.\u026at\u026an , -r\u0259- , -p\u0254\u026a\u02c8\u025bt\u026an , -\u02c8i\u02d0t\u026an/ ; EPO ) , also known as haematopoietin or haemopoietin , is a glycoprotein cytokine secreted by the kidney in response to cellular hypoxia ; it stimulates red blood cell production ( erythropoiesis ) in the bone marrow . Low levels of EPO ( around 10 mU/mL ) are constantly secreted sufficient to compensate for normal red blood cell turnover . Common causes of cellular hypoxia resulting in elevated levels of EPO ( up to 10 000 mU/mL ) include any anemia , and hypoxemia due to chronic lung disease . Erythropoietin is produced by interstitial fibroblasts in the kidney in close association with the peritubular capillary and proximal convoluted tubule . It is also produced in perisinusoidal cells in the liver . Liver production predominates in the fetal and perinatal period ; renal production predominates in adulthood . It is homologous with thrombopoietin . Exogenous erythropoietin , recombinant human erythropoietin ( rhEPO ) , is produced by recombinant DNA technology in cell culture and are collectively called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESA ) : two examples are epoetin alfa and epoetin beta . ESAs are used in the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease , anemia in myelodysplasia , and in anemia from cancer chemotherapy . Risks of therapy include death , myocardial infarction , stroke , venous thromboembolism , and tumor recurrence . Risk increases when EPO treatment raises hemoglobin levels over 11 g/dL to 12 g/dL : this is to be avoided . rhEPO has been used illicitly as a performance-enhancing drug .",

He is best known for failing a drug test after finishing third in the men 's slalom of the 2002 Winter Olympics , resulting in him being controversially stripped of the bronze medal ; he would have become the first Briton to win an Olympic medal in a skiing event . The use of a nasal inhaler purchased in the US had led to the presence of a banned substance in Baxter 's urine . He was allowed to return to competition , although his appeal to have the medal reinstated failed . He competed in FIS events from 1991-2009 and became known as The Highlander . In the World Cup events , he achieved eleven top-fifteen finishes and four top-ten results .",

  "/wiki/Methamphetamine": "Methamphetamine [ note 1 ] ( contracted from N-methylamphetamine ) is a potent central nervous system ( CNS ) stimulant that is mainly used as a recreational drug and less commonly as a second-line treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obesity . Methamphetamine was discovered in 1893 and exists as two enantiomers : levo-methamphetamine and dextro-methamphetamine . [ note 2 ] Methamphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical , the racemic free base , which is an equal mixture of levomethamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine in their pure amine forms . It is rarely prescribed over concerns involving human neurotoxicity and potential for recreational use as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant , among other concerns , as well as the availability of safer substitute drugs with comparable treatment efficacy . Dextromethamphetamine is a much stronger CNS stimulant than levomethamphetamine . Both methamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine are illicitly trafficked and sold owing to their potential for recreational use . The highest prevalence of illegal methamphetamine use occurs in parts of Asia , Oceania , and in the United States , where racemic methamphetamine , levomethamphetamine , and dextromethamphetamine are classified as schedule II controlled substances . Levomethamphetamine is available as an over-the-counter ( OTC ) drug for use as an inhaled nasal decongestant in the United States . [ note 3 ] Internationally , the production , distribution , sale , and possession of methamphetamine is restricted or banned in many countries , due to its placement in schedule II of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances treaty . While dextromethamphetamine is a more potent drug , racemic methamphetamine is sometimes illicitly produced due to the relative ease of synthesis and limited availability of chemical precursors . In low to moderate doses , methamphetamine can elevate mood , increase alertness , concentration and energy in fatigued individuals , reduce appetite , and promote weight loss . At very high doses , it can induce psychosis , breakdown of skeletal muscle , seizures and bleeding in the brain .",

It has a 3-fold longer serum half-life compared to epoetin alpha and epoetin beta . It stimulates erythropoiesis ( increases red blood cell levels ) by the same mechanism as rHuEpo ( binding and activating the Epo receptor ) and is used to treat anemia , commonly associated with chronic kidney failure and cancer chemotherapy . Darbepoetin is marketed by Amgen under the trade name Aranesp . The medication was approved in September 2001 by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney failure by intravenous or subcutaneous injection . In June 2001 , it had been approved by the European Medicines Agency for this indication as well as the treatment of anemia in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy . Dr. Reddy 's Laboratories launched darbepoetin alfa in India under the brand name Cresp in August 2010 . This is the worlds first follow-on biologic of darbepoetin alfa . Darbepoetin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in modified Chinese hamster ovary cells . It differs from endogenous erythropoietin ( EPO ) by containing two more N-linked oligosaccharide chains . It is an erythropoiesis-stimulating 165-amino acid protein .",

  "/wiki/Nandrolone": "Nandrolone , also known as 19-nortestosterone , is an androgen and anabolic steroid ( AAS ) which is used in the form of esters such as nandrolone decanoate ( brand name Deca-Durabolin ) and nandrolone phenylpropionate ( brand name Durabolin ) . Nandrolone esters are used in the treatment of anemias , cachexia ( wasting syndrome ) , osteoporosis , breast cancer , and for other indications . They are not used by mouth and instead are given by injection into muscle or fat . Side effects of nandrolone esters include symptoms of masculinization like acne , increased hair growth , voice changes , and increased sexual desire . They are synthetic androgens and anabolic steroids and hence are agonists of the androgen receptor ( AR ) , the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) . Nandrolone esters have strong anabolic effects and weak androgenic effects , which give them a mild side effect profile and make them especially suitable for use in women and children . They are long-lasting prodrugs of nandrolone in the body . Nandrolone esters were first described and introduced for medical use in the late 1950s . They are among the most widely used AAS worldwide . In addition to their medical use , nandrolone esters are used to improve physique and performance , and are said to be the most widely used AAS for such purposes . The drugs are controlled substances in many countries and so non-medical use is generally illicit .",
