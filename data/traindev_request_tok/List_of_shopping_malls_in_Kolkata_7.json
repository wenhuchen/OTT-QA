  "/wiki/Central_business_district": "A central business district ( CBD ) is the commercial and business center of a city . In larger cities , it is often synonymous with the city 's financial district . Geographically , it often coincides with the city centre or downtown , but the two concepts are separate : many cities have a central business district located away from its commercial or cultural city centre or downtown , or even several CBDs at once . In London , for example , the city centre is usually regarded as encompassing the historic City of London and the mediaeval City of Westminster , whereas the City of London and the transformed Docklands area are regarded as its two CBDs . In New York City , Midtown Manhattan is the largest central business district in the city and in the world ; yet Lower Manhattan , commonly called Downtown Manhattan , represents the second largest , and second , distinct CBD in New York City and is geographically situated south of Midtown . In Chicago , the Chicago Loop is the second largest central business district in the United States and is also referred to as the core of the city 's downtown . Mexico City also has a historic city centre , the colonial-era Centro Hist\u00f3rico , along with two CBDs : the mid-late 20th century Paseo de la Reforma - Polanco , and the new Santa Fe . The shape and type of a CBD almost always closely reflect the city 's history . Cities with strong preservation laws and maximum building height restrictions to retain the character of the historic and cultural core will have a CBD quite a distance from the centre of the city . This is quite common for European cities such as Paris or Vienna . In cities in the New World that grew quickly after the invention of mechanised modes such as road or rail transport , a single central area or downtown will often contain most of the region 's tallest buildings and act both as the CBD and the commercial and cultural city center . Increasing urbanisation in the 21st century have developed megacities , particularly in Asia , that will often have multiple CBDs scattered across the urban area ."
