  "/wiki/Trinity_test": "Trinity was the code name of the first detonation of a nuclear device . It was conducted by the United States Army at 5:29 a.m. on July 16 , 1945 , as part of the Manhattan Project . The test was conducted in the Jornada del Muerto desert about 35 miles ( 56 km ) southeast of Socorro , New Mexico , on what was then the USAAF Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range , now part of White Sands Missile Range . The only structures originally in the vicinity were the McDonald Ranch House and its ancillary buildings , which scientists used as a laboratory for testing bomb components . A base camp was constructed , and there were 425 people present on the weekend of the test . The code name Trinity was assigned by J. Robert Oppenheimer , the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory , inspired by the poetry of John Donne . The test was of an implosion-design plutonium device , informally nicknamed The Gadget , of the same design as the Fat Man bomb later detonated over Nagasaki , Japan , on August 9 , 1945 . The complexity of the design required a major effort from the Los Alamos Laboratory , and concerns about whether it would work led to a decision to conduct the first nuclear test . The test was planned and directed by Kenneth Bainbridge . Fears of a fizzle led to the construction of a steel containment vessel called Jumbo that could contain the plutonium , allowing it to be recovered , but Jumbo was not used . A rehearsal was held on May 7 , 1945 , in which 108 short tons ( 96 long tons ; 98 t ) of high explosive spiked with radioactive isotopes were detonated . The Gadget 's detonation released the explosive energy of about 22 kilotons of TNT ( 92 TJ ) .",
  "/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_and_the_United_States": "The United States was the first country to manufacture nuclear weapons and is the only country to have used them in combat , with the separate bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II . Before and during the Cold War , it conducted over a thousand nuclear tests and tested many long-range nuclear weapons delivery systems . [ Note 1 ] Between 1940 and 1996 , the U.S. government spent at least $ 9.49 trillion in present-day terms on nuclear weapons , including platforms development ( aircraft , rockets and facilities ) , command and control , maintenance , waste management and administrative costs . It is estimated that , since 1945 , the United States produced more than 70,000 nuclear warheads , which is more than all other nuclear weapon states combined . The Soviet Union/Russia has produced approximately 55,000 nuclear warheads since 1949 , France built 1,110 warheads since 1960 , the United Kingdom built 835 warheads since 1952 , China built about 600 warheads since 1964 , and other nuclear powers built fewer than 500 warheads all together since they developed their first nuclear weapons . Until November 1962 , the vast majority of U.S. nuclear tests were above ground . After the acceptance of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty , all testing was relegated underground , in order to prevent the dispersion of nuclear fallout . By 1998 at least $ 759 million had been paid to the Marshall Islanders in compensation for their exposure to U.S. nuclear testing . By February 2006 over $ 1.2 billion in compensation had been paid to U.S. citizens exposed to nuclear hazards as a result of the U.S. nuclear weapons program . [ citation needed ] The U.S. and Russia possess comparable numbers of nuclear warheads ; together , these two nations possess more than 90% of the world 's nuclear warheads . As of 2019 , the U.S. has an inventory of 6,185 nuclear warheads ; of these , 2,385 are retired and awaiting dismantlement and 3,800 are part of the U.S. stockpile . Of the stockpiled warheads , the U.S. stated in its March 2019 New START declaration that 1,365 are deployed on 656 ICBMs , SLBMs , and strategic bombers .",
  "/wiki/Little_Boy": "Little Boy was the codename for the type of atomic bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 during World War II . It was the first nuclear weapon used in warfare . The bomb was dropped by the Boeing B-29 Superfortress Enola Gay piloted by Colonel Paul W. Tibbets , Jr. , commander of the 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces and Captain Robert A. Lewis . It exploded with an energy of approximately 15 kilotons of TNT ( 63 TJ ) and caused widespread death and destruction throughout the city . The Hiroshima bombing was the second man-made nuclear explosion in history , after the Trinity test . Little Boy was developed by Lieutenant Commander Francis Birch 's group at the Manhattan Project 's Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II , a development of the unsuccessful Thin Man nuclear bomb . Like Thin Man , it was a gun-type fission weapon , but it derived its explosive power from the nuclear fission of uranium-235 , whereas Thin Man was based on fission of plutonium-239 . Fission was accomplished by shooting a hollow cylinder of enriched uranium ( the bullet ) onto a solid cylinder of the same material ( the target ) by means of a charge of nitrocellulose propellant powder . It contained 64 kg ( 141 lb ) of enriched uranium , although less than a kilogram underwent nuclear fission . Its components were fabricated at three different plants so that no one would have a copy of the complete design . After the war ended , it was not expected that the inefficient Little Boy design would ever again be required , and many plans and diagrams were destroyed . However , by mid-1946 , the Hanford Site reactors began suffering badly from the Wigner effect , the dislocation of atoms in a solid caused by neutron radiation , and plutonium became scarce , so six Little Boy assemblies were produced at Sandia Base .",

The two bombings killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people , most of whom were civilians , and remain the only use of nuclear weapons in armed conflict . In the final year of World War II , the Allies prepared for a very costly invasion of the Japanese mainland . This undertaking was preceded by a conventional and firebombing campaign which devastated 67 Japanese cities . The war in Europe had concluded when Germany signed its instrument of surrender on May 8 , 1945 , and the Allies turned their full attention to the Pacific theater . The Allies called for the unconditional surrender of the Imperial Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on July 26 , 1945 , the alternative being prompt and utter destruction . Japan ignored the ultimatum and the war continued . By August 1945 , the Allies ' Manhattan Project had produced two types of atomic bombs , and the 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) was equipped with the specialized Silverplate version of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress that could deliver them from Tinian in the Mariana Islands . The Allies issued orders for atomic bombs to be used on four Japanese cities on July 25 . On August 6 , one of the modified B-29s dropped a uranium gun-type bomb ( Little Boy ) on Hiroshima . Another B-29 dropped a plutonium implosion bomb ( Fat Man ) on Nagasaki three days later . The bombs immediately devastated their targets .",

Hiroshima was founded in 1589 as a castle town on the \u014cta River delta . Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868 , Hiroshima rapidly transformed into a major urban center and industrial hub . In 1889 , Hiroshima officially gained city status . The city was a center of military activities during the imperial era , playing significant roles such as the First Sino-Japanese War , the Russo-Japanese War , and the two world wars . Towards the end of World War II , Hiroshima is best remembered as the first city targeted by a nuclear weapon , when the United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) dropped an atomic bomb on the city at 8:15 a.m. on August 6 , 1945 . Most of the city was destroyed , and by the end of the year 90,000-166,000 had died as a result of the blast and its effects .

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",

It was built by scientists and engineers at Los Alamos Laboratory using plutonium from the Hanford Site , and it was dropped from the Boeing B-29 Superfortress Bockscar piloted by Major Charles Sweeney . The name Fat Man refers to the early design of the bomb because it had a wide , round shape ; it was also known as the Mark III . Fat Man was an implosion-type nuclear weapon with a solid plutonium core . The first of that type to be detonated was the Gadget in the Trinity nuclear test less than a month earlier on 16 July at the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range in New Mexico . Two more were detonated during the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in 1946 , and some 120 were produced between 1947 and 1949 , when it was superseded by the Mark 4 nuclear bomb .

Although the Soviet scientific community discussed the possibility of an atomic bomb throughout the 1930s , going as far as making a concrete proposal to develop such a weapon in 1940 , the full-scale program was initiated during World War II . Because of the conspicuous silence of the scientific publications on the subject of nuclear fission by German , American , and British scientists , Russian physicist Georgy Flyorov suspected that the Allied powers had secretly been developing a superweapon since 1939 . Flyorov wrote a letter to Stalin urging him to start this program in 1942.:78-79 Initial efforts were slowed due to the German invasion of the Soviet Union and remained largely composed of the intelligence knowledge gained from the Soviet spy rings working in the U.S. Manhattan Project . After Stalin learned of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the program was pursued aggressively and accelerated through effective intelligence gathering about the German nuclear weapon project and the American Manhattan Project . The Soviet efforts also rounded up captured German scientists to join their program , and relied heavily on knowledge passed by spies to Soviet intelligence agencies . :242-243 On 29 August 1949 , the Soviet Union secretly conducted its first successful weapon test ( First Lightning , based on the American Fat Man design ) at the Semipalatinsk Test Site in Kazakhstan .",

During the Second World War , Britain commenced a nuclear weapons project , known as Tube Alloys , but the 1943 Quebec Agreement merged it with the American Manhattan Project . Several key British scientists worked on the Manhattan Project , but after the war the Americans ended cooperation on nuclear weapons . In January 1947 , a cabinet sub-committee decided , in response to an apprehension of American isolationism and fears of Britain losing its great power status , to resume British efforts to build nuclear weapons . The project was called High Explosive Research , and was directed by Lord Portal , with William Penney in charge of bomb design . Implicit in the decision to develop atomic bombs was the need to test them . The preferred site was the Pacific Proving Grounds in the US-controlled Marshall Islands . As a fallback , sites in Canada and Australia were considered . The Admiralty suggested that the Monte Bello Islands might be suitable , so the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , Clement Attlee , sent a request to the Prime Minister of Australia , Robert Menzies .

The British contribution to the Manhattan Project saw British scientists participate in most of its work . The British government considered nuclear weapons to be a joint discovery , but the American Atomic Energy Act of 1946 ( McMahon Act ) restricted other countries , including the UK , from access to information about nuclear weapons . Fearing the loss of Britain 's great power status , the UK resumed its own project , now codenamed High Explosive Research .

  "/wiki/People's_Republic_of_China_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction": "The People 's Republic of China has developed and possesses weapons of mass destruction , including chemical and nuclear weapons . The first of China 's nuclear weapons tests took place in 1964 , and its first hydrogen bomb test occurred in 1967 . Tests continued until 1996 , when China signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) . China has acceded to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention ( BWC ) in 1984 and ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) in 1997 . The number of nuclear warheads in China 's arsenal is a state secret . There are varying estimates of the size of China 's arsenal . China is estimated by the Federation of American Scientists to have an arsenal of about 260 total warheads as of 2015 , which would make it the second smallest nuclear arsenal amongst the five nuclear weapon states acknowledged by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons . According to some estimates , the country could more than double the number of warheads on missiles that could threaten the United States by the mid-2020 's . Early in 2011 , China published a defense white paper , which repeated its nuclear policies of maintaining a minimum deterrent with a no-first-use pledge . Yet China has yet to define what it means by a minimum deterrent posture . This , together with the fact that it is deploying four new nuclear-capable ballistic missiles , invites concern as to the scale and intention of Chinas nuclear upgrade .",

The test made France the fifth country to test a thermonuclear device after the United States , the Soviet Union , the United Kingdom and China .",
  "/wiki/Smiling_Buddha": "Smiling Buddha [ a ] ( MEA designation : Pokhran-I ) was the assigned code name of India 's first successful nuclear bomb test on 18 May 1974 . The bomb was detonated on the army base Pokhran Test Range ( PTR ) , in Rajasthan , by the Indian Army under the supervision of several key Indian generals . Pokhran-I was also the first confirmed nuclear weapons test by a nation outside the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council . Officially , the Indian Ministry of External Affairs ( MEA ) characterised this test as a peaceful nuclear explosion . A series of nuclear tests was carried out in 1998 under the name Pokhran-II .",
  "/wiki/India_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction": "India has developed and possesses weapons of mass destruction in the form of nuclear weapons . Although India has not made any official statements about the size of its nuclear arsenal , recent estimates suggest that India has 130-140 nuclear weapons and has produced enough weapons-grade plutonium for up to 150-200 nuclear weapons . In 1999 , India was estimated to have 800 kg of separated reactor-grade plutonium , with a total amount of 8,300 kg of civilian plutonium , enough for approximately 1,000 nuclear weapons . India is a member of three multilateral export control regimes - the Missile Technology Control Regime , Wassenaar Arrangement and Australia Group . It has signed and ratified the Biological Weapons Convention and the Chemical Weapons Convention . India is also a subscribing state to the Hague Code of Conduct . India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , considering both to be flawed and discriminatory . India previously possessed chemical weapons , but voluntarily destroyed its entire stockpile in 2009 - one of the seven countries to meet the OPCW extended deadline . India maintains a no first use nuclear policy and has developed a nuclear triad capability as a part of its minimum credible deterrence doctrine .",
  "/wiki/Pokhran-II": "The Pokhran-II tests were a series of five nuclear bomb test explosions conducted by India at the Indian Army 's Pokhran Test Range in May 1998 . It was the second instance of nuclear testing conducted by India ; the first test , code-named Smiling Buddha , was conducted in May 1974 . The tests achieved their main objective of giving India the capability to build fission and thermonuclear weapons with yields up to 200 Kilotons . The then Chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission described each one of the explosions of Pokhran-II to be equivalent to several tests carried out by other nuclear weapon states over decades . Subsequently , India established computer simulation capability to predict the yields of nuclear explosives whose designs are related to the designs of explosives used in this test . Pokhran-II consisted of five detonations , the first of which was a fusion bomb while the remaining four were fission bombs . The tests were initiated on 11 May 1998 , under the assigned code name Operation Shakti , with the detonation of one fusion and two fission bombs . On 13 May 1998 , two additional fission devices were detonated , and the Indian government led by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee shortly convened a press conference to declare India a full-fledged nuclear state . The tests resulted in a variety of sanctions against India by a number of major states , including Japan and the United States . Many names have been assigned to these tests ; originally these were collectively called Operation Shakti-98 , and the five nuclear bombs were designated Shakti-I through to Shakti-V. More recently , the operation as a whole has come to be known as Pokhran II , and the 1974 explosion as Pokhran-I .",

Chagai-I was Pakistan 's first public test of nuclear weapons . Its timing was a direct response to India 's second nuclear tests , on 11 and 13 May 1998 . These tests by Pakistan and India resulted in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1172 and economic sanctions on both states by a number of major powers , particularly the United States and Japan [ clarification needed ] . By testing nuclear devices , Pakistan became the seventh nation to publicly test nuclear weapons . :14-15 Pakistan 's second nuclear test , Chagai-II , followed on 30 May 1998 .",
  "/wiki/Pakistan_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction": "Pakistan is one of nine states to possess nuclear weapons . Pakistan began development of nuclear weapons in January 1972 under Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , who delegated the program to the Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission ( PAEC ) Munir Ahmad Khan with a commitment to having the bomb ready by the end of 1976 . Since PAEC , consisting of over twenty laboratories and projects under nuclear engineer Munir Ahmad Khan , was falling behind schedule and having considerable difficulty producing fissile material , Abdul Qadeer Khan was brought from Europe by Bhutto at the end of 1974 . As pointed out by Houston Wood , Professor of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , in his article on gas centrifuges , The most difficult step in building a nuclear weapon is the production of fissile material ; as such , this work in producing fissile material as head of the Kahuta Project was pivotal to Pakistan developing the capability to detonate a nuclear bomb by the end of 1984 . The Kahuta Project started under the supervision of a coordination board that oversaw the activities of KRL and PAEC . The Board consisted of A G N Kazi ( secretary general , finance ) , Ghulam Ishaq Khan ( secretary general , defence ) , and Agha Shahi ( secretary general , foreign affairs ) , and reported directly to Bhutto . Ghulam Ishaq Khan and General Tikka Khan appointed military engineer Major General Ali Nawab to the program . Eventually , the supervision passed to Lt General Zahid Ali Akbar Khan in President General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq 's Administration . Moderate uranium enrichment for the production of fissile material was achieved at KRL by April 1978 . Pakistan 's nuclear weapons development was in response to the loss of East Pakistan in 1971 's Bangladesh Liberation War . Bhutto called a meeting of senior scientists and engineers on 20 January 1972 , in Multan , which came to known as Multan meeting . Bhutto was the main architect of this programme , and it was here that Bhutto orchestrated the nuclear weapons programme and rallied Pakistan 's academic scientists to build an atomic bomb in three years for national survival ."
