  "/wiki/Tomislav_of_Croatia": "Tomislav ( pronounced [ t\u01d2misla\u028b ] , Latin : Tamisclaus ) was the first King of Croatia . He became Duke of Croatia in c. 910 , was elevated to kingship by 925 and reigned until 928 . At the time of his rule , Croatia forged an alliance with the Byzantines during their struggle with the Bulgarian Empire , with whom Croatia eventually went to war that culminated in the decisive Battle of the Bosnian Highlands in 926 . To the north there were often conflicts with the Principality of Hungary . Croatia kept its borders and to some extent expanded on the disintegrated Pannonian Duchy . Tomislav attended the Church Council of Split in 925 , convened by Pope John X to discuss the use of Slavic language in liturgy and the ecclesiastical jurisdiction over Croatia and the Byzantine Theme of Dalmatia . Although the Pope sought to prohibit Slavic liturgy , the Council did not agree , while jurisdiction was given to the Archbishop of Split instead of the Croatian Bishop Gregory of Nin . Since the historical sources about Tomislav are scarce , the exact year of his accession and his death are not known . The rule of his successors was marked by a series of civil wars in Croatia and gradual weakening of the country .",
  "/wiki/Dalmatian_Croatia": "The Duchy of Croatia ( Croatian : Kne\u017eevina Hrvatska ; also Duchy of the Croats , Kne\u017eevina Hrvata ; Dalmatian Croatia , Dalmatinska Hrvatska ; Littoral Croatia , Primorska Hrvatska ; Greek : \u03a7\u03c1\u03c9\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 ) , [ note 1 ] was a medieval Croatian duchy that was established in the former Roman province of Dalmatia . Throughout its time it had several seats - namely , Klis , Solin , Knin , Bija\u0107i and Nin . It comprised the littoral - the coastal part of today 's Croatia - , except Istria , and included a large part of the mountainous hinterland , as well . The Duchy was in the center of competition between the Carolingian Empire and the Byzantine Empire for rule over the area . Rivalry with Venice emerged in the first decades of the 9th century and was to continue for the following centuries . Croatia also waged battles with the Bulgarian Empire , with whom the relations improved greatly afterwards , and the Arabs and sought to extend its control over important coastal cities under the rule of Byzantium . Croatia experienced periods of vassalage to the Franks or Byzantines and de facto independence until 879 , when Croatian Duke Branimir received recognition from Pope John VIII as an independent realm . The ruling dynasty of Croatia was the House of Trpimirovi\u0107 , with interruptions by the House of Domagojevi\u0107 ( 864-878 and 879-c. 892 ) . The Duchy existed until around 925 when , during the rule of Duke Tomislav , Croatia became a kingdom .",
  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Croatia_(medieval)": "The Kingdom of Croatia ( Croatian : Kraljevina Hrvatska , Latin : Regnum Croatiae ) , or Croatian Kingdom ( Croatian : Hrvatsko Kraljevstvo ) , was a medieval kingdom in Central Europe comprising most of what is today Croatia ( without western Istria and some Dalmatian coastal cities ) , as well as most of the modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina . Part of the Croatian Kingdom period ruled by ethnic dynasties , the Kingdom existed as a sovereign state for nearly two centuries . Its existence was characterized by various conflicts and periods of peace or alliance with the Bulgarians , Byzantines , Hungarians , and competition with Venice for control over the eastern Adriatic coast . The goal of promoting the Croatian language in the religious service was initially brought and introduced by the 10th century bishop Gregory of Nin , which resulted in a conflict with the Pope , later to be put down by him . In the second half of the 11th century Croatia managed to secure most coastal cities of Dalmatia with the collapse of Byzantine control over them . During this time the kingdom reached its peak under the rule of kings Peter Kre\u0161imir IV ( 1058-1074 ) and Demetrius Zvonimir ( 1075-1089 ) . The state was ruled mostly by the Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasty until 1091 . At that point the realm experienced a succession crisis and after a decade of conflicts for the throne and the aftermath of the Battle of Gvozd Mountain , the crown passed to the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty with the coronation of King Coloman of Hungary as King of Croatia and Dalmatia in Biograd in 1102 , uniting the two kingdoms under one crown . The precise terms of the relationship between the two realms became a matter of dispute in the 19th century . The nature of the relationship varied through time , Croatia retained a large degree of internal autonomy overall , while the real power rested in the hands of the local nobility . Modern Croatian and Hungarian historiographies mostly view the relations between Kingdom of Croatia and Kingdom of Hungary from 1102 as a form of a personal union of two internally autonomous kingdoms united by a common king .",

He was a member of the Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasty . Michael Kre\u0161imir II was a son of Kre\u0161imir I and the younger brother of Miroslav , who preceded him as King of Croatia in 945 . Kre\u0161imir was brought to the throne by the powerful Ban Pribina , who rebelled against the former king Miroslav for having his jurisdiction restrained from some areas . The civil war eventually ended with Miroslav 's death in 949 and the reign of Mihajlo began . The Croatian kingdom reached its former glory during Michael 's reign . He ravaged the Bosnian \u017eupa 's Uskoplje , Luka and Pleva , and eventually conquered the whole region of Bosnia that was originally lost during the reign of Miroslav . The Bosnian ban fled to Hungary , after realizing he could n't fight back and , by 968 , Michael pacified the local tribes , establishing full control . Mihajlo and his wife Helen of Zadar had good relations with the Dalmatian cities . Helen built the royal family mausoleum in Solin where , at the end of the 19th century , an inscription of her grave was found and translated , bearing her title Queen .

  "/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire": "The Holy Roman Empire ( Latin : Sacrum Imperium Romanum ; German : Heiliges R\u00f6misches Reich ) , also known as Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation , was a multi-ethnic complex of territories in Western and Central Europe that developed during the Early Middle Ages and continued until its dissolution in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars . The largest territory of the empire after 962 was the Kingdom of Germany , though it also included the neighboring Kingdom of Bohemia and Kingdom of Italy , plus numerous other territories , and soon after the Kingdom of Burgundy was added . Its size gradually diminished over time , particularly from 1648 onward , and by the time of its dissolution , it largely contained only German-speaking territories ( although Switzerland and East Prussia were not included ) , plus the Kingdom of Bohemia which was bordered by the German lands on three sides . At the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 , most of the Holy Roman Empire was included in the German Confederation . On 25 December 800 , Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish king Charlemagne as Emperor , reviving the title in Western Europe , more than three centuries after the fall of the earlier ancient Western Roman Empire in 476 . The title continued in the Carolingian family until 888 and from 896 to 899 , after which it was contested by the rulers of Italy in a series of civil wars until the death of the last Italian claimant , Berengar I , in 924 . The title was revived again in 962 when Otto I was crowned emperor , fashioning himself as the successor of Charlemagne and beginning a continuous existence of the empire for over eight centuries . Some historians refer to the coronation of Charlemagne as the origin of the empire , while others prefer the coronation of Otto I as its beginning . Scholars generally concur , however , in relating an evolution of the institutions and principles constituting the empire , describing a gradual assumption of the imperial title and role . The exact term Holy Roman Empire was not used until the 13th century , but the concept of translatio imperii , [ d ] the notion that he - the sovereign ruler - held supreme power inherited from the ancient emperors of Rome , was fundamental to the prestige of the emperor . The office of Holy Roman Emperor was traditionally elective , although frequently controlled by dynasties . The mostly German prince-electors , the highest-ranking noblemen of the empire , usually elected one of their peers as King of the Romans , and he would later be crowned emperor by the Pope ; the tradition of papal coronations was discontinued in the 16th century .",

  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary": "The Kingdom of Hungary was a monarchy in Central Europe that existed from the Middle Ages into the 20th century ( 1000-1946 with the exception of 1918-1920 ) . The Principality of Hungary emerged as a Christian kingdom upon the coronation of the first king Stephen I at Esztergom around the year 1000 ; his family ( the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty ) led the monarchy for 300 years . By the 12th century , the kingdom became a European middle power within the Western world . Due to the Ottoman occupation of the central and southern territories of Hungary in the 16th century , the country was partitioned into three parts : the Habsburg Royal Hungary , Ottoman Hungary , and the semi-independent Principality of Transylvania . The House of Habsburg held the Hungarian throne after the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs until 1918 and also played a key role in the liberation wars against the Ottoman Empire . From 1867 , territories connected to the Hungarian crown were incorporated into Austria-Hungary under the name of Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen . The monarchy ended with the deposition of the last king Charles IV in 1918 , after which Hungary became a republic . The kingdom was nominally restored during the Regency of 1920-46 , ending under the Soviet occupation in 1946 . The Kingdom of Hungary was a multiethnic state from its inception until the Treaty of Trianon and it covered what is today Hungary , Slovakia , Transylvania and other parts of Romania , Carpathian Ruthenia ( now part of Ukraine ) , Vojvodina ( now part of Serbia ) , the territory of Burgenland ( now part of Austria ) , Me\u0111imurje ( now part of Croatia ) , Prekmurje ( now part of Slovenia ) and a few villages in Poland . From 1102 it also included Croatia , being in personal union with it , united under the King of Hungary . According to the demographers , about 80 percent of the population was made up of Hungarians before the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs , [ neutrality is disputed ] however in the mid 19th century out of a population of 14 million less than 6 million were Hungarian due to the resettlement policies and continuous immigration from neighboring countries . Major territorial changes made Hungary ethnically homogeneous after World War I. Nowadays , more than nine-tenths of the population is ethnically Hungarian and speaks Hungarian as the mother tongue ."
