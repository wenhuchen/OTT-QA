  "/wiki/Morgan's_Raid": "Morgan 's Raid was a diversionary incursion by Confederate cavalry into the northern ( Union ) states of Indiana , Kentucky , Ohio and , briefly , West Virginia , during the American Civil War . The raid took place from June 11-July 26 , 1863 , and is named for the commander of the Confederates , Brig . Gen. John Hunt Morgan . Although it caused temporary alarm in the North , the raid was ultimately classed as a failure . The raid covered more than 1,000 miles ( 1,600 km ) , beginning in Tennessee and ending in northern Ohio . It coincided with the Vicksburg Campaign and the Gettysburg Campaign , and it was meant to draw U.S. troops away from these fronts by frightening the North into demanding their troops return home . Despite his initial successes , Morgan was thwarted in his attempts to recross the Ohio River and eventually was forced to surrender what remained of his command in northeastern Ohio near the Pennsylvania border . Morgan and other senior officers were kept in the Ohio state penitentiary , but they tunneled their way out and took a train to Cincinnati , where they crossed the Ohio River to safety .",
