  "/wiki/Iltutmish": "Shams ud-Din Iltutmish , ( r. 1211-1236 ) was the third of the Mamluk kings who ruled the former Ghurid territories in northern India . He was the first Muslim sovereign to rule from Delhi , and is thus considered the effective founder of Delhi Sultanate . Sold into slavery as a young boy , Iltutmish spent his early life in Bukhara and Ghazni under multiple masters . In the late 1190s , the Ghurid slave-commander Qutb al-Din Aibak purchased him in Delhi , thus making him the slave of a slave . Iltutmish rose to prominence in Aibak 's service , and was granted the important iqta ' of Badaun . His military actions against the Khokhar rebels in 1205-1206 gained attention of the Ghurid Emperor Mu'izz ad-Din , who manumitted him even before his master Aibak was manumitted . After Mu'izz ad-Din 's death in 1206 , Aibak became a practically independent ruler of the Ghurid territories in India , with his headquarters at Lahore . After Aibak 's death , Iltutmish dethroned his unpopular successor Aram Shah in 1211 , and set up his capital at Delhi . He married a daughter of Aibak , subjugated several dissidents , and gained control over much of the territory that had been lost after Aibak 's death . He did not immediately claim a sovereign status , acknowledging the nominal authority of Taj al-Din Yildiz , another former slave who had gained control of the Ghurid capital Ghazni . Subsequently , a Khwarazmian invasion prompted Yildiz to move from Ghazni to India , and to demand control of the former Ghurid territories in India . Iltutmish refused to oblige , defeating and killing Yildiz at the Battle of Tarain in 1216 .",
  "/wiki/Emperor": "An emperor ( from Latin : imperator , via Old French : empereor ) is a monarch , and usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm . Empress , the female equivalent , may indicate an emperor 's wife ( empress consort ) , mother ( empress dowager ) , or a woman who rules in her own right ( empress regnant ) . Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings . In Europe , the title of Emperor has been used since the Middle Ages , considered in those times equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope due to the latter 's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of the Catholic part of Western Europe . The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as Emperor . Both emperors and kings are monarchs , but emperor and empress are considered the higher monarchical titles . Inasmuch as there is a strict definition of emperor , it is that an emperor has no relations implying the superiority of any other ruler and typically rules over more than one nation . Therefore a king might be obliged to pay tribute to another ruler , or be restrained in his actions in some unequal fashion , but an emperor should in theory be completely free of such restraints . However , monarchs heading empires have not always used the title in all contexts - the British sovereign did not assume the title Empress of the British Empire even during the incorporation of India , though she was declared Empress of India . In Western Europe , the title of Emperor was used exclusively by the Holy Roman Emperor , whose imperial authority was derived from the concept of translatio imperii , i.e . they claimed succession to the authority of the Western Roman Emperors , thus linking themselves to Roman institutions and traditions as part of state ideology . Although initially ruling much of Central Europe and northern Italy , by the 19th century the Emperor exercised little power beyond the German-speaking states .",

The grandson of the founder of the Maurya Dynasty , Chandragupta Maurya , Ashoka promoted the spread of Buddhism across ancient Asia . Considered by many to be one of India 's greatest emperors , Ashoka expanded Chandragupta 's empire to reign over a realm stretching from present-day Afghanistan in the west to Bangladesh in the east . It covered the entire Indian subcontinent except for parts of present-day Tamil Nadu , Karnataka and Kerala . The empire 's capital was Pataliputra ( in Magadha , present-day Patna ) , with provincial capitals at Taxila and Ujjain . Ashoka waged a destructive war against the state of Kalinga ( modern Odisha ) , which he conquered in about 260 BCE . In about 263 BCE , he converted to Buddhism after witnessing the mass deaths of the Kalinga War , which he had waged out of a desire for conquest and which reportedly directly resulted in more than 100,000 deaths and 150,000 deportations . He is remembered for the Ashoka pillars and edicts , for sending Buddhist monks to Sri Lanka and Central Asia , and for establishing monuments marking several significant sites in the life of Gautama Buddha . Beyond the Edicts of Ashoka , biographical information about him relies on legends written centuries later , such as the 2nd-century CE Ashokavadana ( Narrative of Ashoka , a part of the Divyavadana ) , and in the Sri Lankan text Mahavamsa ( Great Chronicle ) . The emblem of the modern Republic of India is an adaptation of the Lion Capital of Ashoka . His Sanskrit name A\u015boka means painless , without sorrow ( the a privativum and \u015boka , pain , distress ) . In his edicts , he is referred to as Dev\u0101n\u0101mpriya ( Pali Dev\u0101na\u1e43piya or the Beloved of the Gods ) , and Priyadar\u015bin ( Pali Piyadas\u012b or He who regards everyone with affection ) .",

Arcadius died in 408 , but the decoration of the column was only completed in 421 , so the monument was dedicated to his successor Theodosius II . Strongly inspired by the Column of Theodosius set up in the forum Tauri in the 380s , the column of Arcadius follows the tradition of triumphal columns such as those of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius . It was destroyed in either the 16th or the 18th century when , weakened by earthquakes , it threatened to topple and had to be taken down . Only its massive masonry base of red granite now survives , known as the Avret Tash in Turkish , located on Haseki Kad\u0131n Sokuk in the Fatih district of Istanbul .

Built in 403 , it was built in the Xerolophos area and was the last forum before reaching the Constantinian city walls and the Golden Gate in a line of forums , including the Forum of Theodosius , the Forum of Constantine , the Forum Bovis , and the Forum Amastrianum , built westward from the city center along the Mese . The forum was later converted to a bazaar by the Ottomans , referred to as the Avrat Pazar\u0131 or Women 's Bazaar , which was mistaken with the Slave Market at Tavukpazari near Nur-u Osmaniye used for the auctioning of female slaves , otherwise known as 'Cariye ' , which technically during the period had a completely different social status than regular slaves . This practice was abolished in 1847 during Reshid Pasha 's time possibly due to the British influence Slavery Abolition Act 1833 . The Column of Arcadius , located in the center of the forum , was decorated with spiral bands of sculpture in bas relief representing the triumphs of the emperor , like Trajan 's Column in Rome . At the top of the column , which was more than 50m high , there was an enormous Corinthian capital surmounted by an equestrian statue of Arcadius , placed there in 421 by his son , Theodosius II . This statue was eventually toppled from the column and destroyed during an earthquake in 704 . The column itself remained standing for another thousand years until it was deliberately demolished in 1715 , when it appeared to be in imminent danger of collapsing on the neighboring houses .

The inscription confirms that the capital was originally surmounted by a statue of Marcian , in continuation of an imperial architectural tradition initiated by the Column of Trajan and the Column of Marcus Aurelius in Rome . The basis of the column is orientated northwest/southeast , while its capital is aligned north/south , possibly so that the statue could look towards the nearby Church of the Holy Apostles .

Although initially the dynasty was of Turkic origin , it was Persianised in terms of language , culture , literature and habits .

The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror .

At the beginning of the 17th century , the empire contained 32 provinces and numerous vassal states . Some of these were later absorbed into the Ottoman Empire , while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries .
