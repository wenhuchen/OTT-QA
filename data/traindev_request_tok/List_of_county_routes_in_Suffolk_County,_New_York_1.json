It splits Westhampton Island from the peninsula extending from Southampton Village . The inlet was formed by the Great Hurricane of 1938 which killed several people when it permanently broke through the island in Hampton Bays , New York . The name comes from the Shinnecock Indian Nation . Maintenance of the inlet has been controversial . [ clarification needed ] It saves boaters in the Hamptons several miles in access to the Atlantic Ocean . The inlet is almost directly lined up with the Shinnecock Canal between Shinnecock Bay and the Peconic Bay , which allows a shortcut to the ocean for boaters on the north fork of Long Island . Consequently , management has been geared to keep the inlet dredged and open . However , the inlet has interrupted the flow of sand ( which normally flows east to west ) and consequently there has been major beach erosion on the west side of the inlet including the November 1992 Nor'easter that wiped out much of West Hampton Dunes , New York . The phenomenon is called longshore drift . Efforts to prevent erosion with groines have just pushed the problems further west resulting in serious beach erosion problems on Fire Island . West Hampton Dunes was incorporated in 1993 specifically to have legal standing in the skirmishes with Corps of Engineers regarding the practice .",

As the name suggests , the Babylon-Northport Expressway was originally intended to be a north-south expressway spanning most of the width of Long Island from Babylon to the southern edge of Northport village . However , local opposition to the expressway eventually resulted in the cancellation of the project before anything more than the existing 2 mile stretch could be constructed .",

  "/wiki/Northern_State_Parkway": "The Northern State Parkway ( also known as the Northern Parkway or Northern State ) is a 28.88-mile-long ( 46.48 km ) limited-access state parkway on Long Island in the U.S. state of New York . The western terminus is at the Queens-Nassau County line , where the parkway continues westward into New York City as the Grand Central Parkway . The eastern terminus is at New York State Route 347 ( NY 347 ) and NY 454 in Hauppauge . The parkway is designated New York State Route 908G ( NY 908G ) , an unsigned reference route . As its name implies , the parkway services communities along the northern half of the island . In western Nassau County the parkway sports six lanes , three eastbound and three westbound , narrowing to four lanes total in central Nassau at the Wantagh Parkway ( exit 33 ) and through its twelve miles ( 19 km ) or so in western Suffolk County , where it ends . It was constructed in stages throughout the 1930s and again post-World War II in the late 1940s/early 1950s until it reached its current terminus in Hauppauge in 1965 . The Northern State Parkway is an eastern extension of the Grand Central Parkway . It was part of master planner Robert Moses ' extensive road-building campaign and was built as a sister road to the Southern State Parkway . In recent years its design has quickly become dated due to an increase in commuter traffic using the roadway , and numerous improvements have been made ( including the widening from four to six lanes in Central Nassau west to the Nassau-Queens line where it becomes the Grand Central ) or are still on paper .",

Patchogue has historically been a major shopping and commerce hub of Suffolk County . Patchogue in the narrow sense is an incorporated village with narrow limits , only about a mile and a half wide . East Patchogue includes the eastern portion of Patchogue in the wider sense , as well as the area east of that but still west of the incorporated village of Bellport . This double meaning of East Patchogue is reflected in the naming of New York State Route 27A : It is called East Main Street in the western portion of East Patchogue , and Montauk Highway ( as it typically is outside of villages ) in the eastern portion . The Patchogue side of East Patchogue is in the Patchogue-Medford School District ; the Bellport side is in the South Country Central School District , and its high-school students attend Bellport High School . Some maps even refer to southwestern East Patchogue as West Bellport . The northern part of East Patchogue , which until the 1980s was less developed , has sometimes been referred to as South Medford . The area around County Road 80 in the western portion of East Patchogue was once commonly regarded as the hamlet of Hagerman .
