  "/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy": "A Doctor of Philosophy ( PhD , Ph.D. , or DPhil ; Latin philosophiae doctor or doctor philosophiae ) is the highest university degree that is conferred after a course of study by universities in most countries .

As an earned research degree , those studying for a PhD are usually required to produce original research that expands the boundaries of knowledge , normally in the form of a thesis or dissertation , and defend their work against experts in the field . The completion of a PhD is often a requirement for employment as a university professor , researcher , or scientist in many fields . Individuals who have earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree may , in many jurisdictions , use the title Doctor ( often abbreviated Dr or Dr. ) with their name , although the proper etiquette associated with this usage may also be subject to the professional ethics of their own scholarly field , culture , or society . Those who teach at universities or work in academic , educational , or research fields are usually addressed by this title professionally and socially in a salutation or conversation . Alternatively , holders may use post-nominal letters such as Ph.D. , PhD , or DPhil ( depending on the awarding institution ) . It is , however , considered incorrect to use both the title and post-nominals at the same time . The specific requirements to earn a PhD degree vary considerably according to the country , institution , and time period , from entry-level research degrees to higher doctorates . During the studies that lead to the degree , the student is called a doctoral student or PhD student ; a student who has completed all their coursework and comprehensive examinations and is working on their thesis/dissertation is sometimes known as a doctoral candidate or PhD candidate ( see : all but dissertation ) . A student attaining this level may be granted a Candidate of Philosophy degree at some institutions or may be granted a master 's degree en route to the doctoral degree . Sometimes this status is also colloquially known as PhD ABD , meaning All But Dissertation .",
