  "/wiki/Poaceae": "Poaceae ( /po\u028a\u02c8e\u026asia\u026a/ ) or Gramineae is a large and nearly ubiquitous family of monocotyledonous flowering plants known as grasses , commonly referred to collectively as grass . Poaceae includes the cereal grasses , bamboos and the grasses of natural grassland and cultivated lawns and pasture . The Poaceae are the most important source of the world 's dietary energy supply . They provide , through direct human consumption , just over one-half ( 51% ) of all dietary energy ; rice provides 20% , wheat supplies 20% , maize ( corn ) 5.5% , and other grains 6% . Grasses have stems that are hollow except at the nodes and narrow alternate leaves borne in two ranks . The lower part of each leaf encloses the stem , forming a leaf-sheath . With around 780 genera and around 12,000 species , Poaceae are the fifth-largest plant family , following the Asteraceae , Orchidaceae , Fabaceae and Rubiaceae . Grasslands such as savannah and prairie where grasses are dominant are estimated to constitute 40.5% of the land area of the Earth , excluding Greenland and Antarctica . Grasses are also an important part of the vegetation in many other habitats , including wetlands , forests and tundra . The Poaceae are the most economically important plant family , providing staple foods from domesticated cereal crops such as maize , wheat , rice , barley , and millet as well as feed for meat-producing animals . They are used as building materials ( bamboo , thatch , and straw ) . They are a source of biofuel , primarily via the conversion of maize to ethanol .",
