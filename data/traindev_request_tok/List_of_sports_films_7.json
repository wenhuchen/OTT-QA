  "/wiki/Marion_Davies": "Marion Cecilia Davies ( born Marion Cecilia Elizabeth Brooklyn Douras ; January 3 , 1897 - September 22 , 1961 ) was an American film actress , producer , screenwriter , and philanthropist . Davies appeared in several Broadway musicals and one film , Runaway Romany ( 1917 ) and then became the mistress of newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst . He then took over management of her career . Hearst financed Davies ' pictures and promoted her heavily through his newspapers and Hearst Newsreels . He founded Cosmopolitan Pictures to produce her films . Hearst preferred to see her in historical dramas , but her real talent was in comedy . Today Davies is remembered mainly as Hearst 's mistress until his death , and as the hostess of many lavish events for the Hollywood elite . In particular , her name is linked with the 1924 scandal aboard Hearst 's yacht when one of his guests , film producer Thomas Ince , died . In the film Citizen Kane ( 1941 ) , the title character 's second wife - an untalented singer whom he tries to promote - was widely assumed to be based on Davies . But many commentators , including Citizen Kane writer/director Orson Welles himself , have defended Davies ' record as a gifted actress , to whom Hearst 's patronage did more harm than good . She retired from the screen in 1937 , choosing to devote herself to Hearst and charitable work . In Hearst 's declining years , Davies provided financial as well as emotional support until his death in 1951 .",

Unlike other forms of sports betting , spread betting invariably motivates point shaving .

In exchange for a bribe , the player or players agree to ensure that their team will not cover the point spread ( the bribed player 's team may still win but not by as big a margin as that predicted by bookmakers ) . The gambler then wagers against the bribed team . Alternatively , an official ( referee ) of the game may be bribed , or even bet on his own behalf , so that one or more close calls will be called in favor of the underdog rather than the team favored to win .",

It is one of the lesser-known works in the influential group of New Hollywood films of the late 1960s and early 1970s made by independent production house Raybert Productions ( The Monkees , Easy Rider ) and its successor , BBS Productions . Based upon the 1964 novel of the same title by Jeremy Larner , the film , which stars William Tepper , is notable as the directorial debut of Jack Nicholson ( who also wrote the screenplay ) following his breakthrough as an actor in Easy Rider ( 1969 ) and Five Easy Pieces ( 1970 ) . Although it was coolly received at the time , and has subsequently faded into obscurity , the production brought together many significant Hollywood names . Director of photography Bill Butler gained renown for his later work on classic films such as Steven Spielberg 's Jaws , Francis Ford Coppola 's The Conversation , and One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest . Original music was composed by David Shire ( then married to Coppola 's sister , Talia ) and the screenplay included uncredited contributions from future director Terence Malick . It starred several of Nicholson 's friends and frequent screen collaborators in leading roles - Karen Black , Bruce Dern , Robert Towne and Henry Jaglom ( although Towne and Jaglom became better known as screenwriter and director , respectively ) . Several younger actors who became familiar TV faces in later years were also featured in small supporting roles , including David Ogden Stiers ( M*A*S*H ) , Cindy Williams ( Laverne & Shirley ) and Michael Warren ( Hill Street Blues ) , who ( like Tepper ) was also a former collegiate basketball player . It was filmed on the campus of the University of Oregon and other locations in Eugene , Oregon . The film is also notable for its then-controversial use of profanity , its depictions of sex and drug use , and for several scenes of male frontal nudity , including a locker-room shower scene , and the mental breakdown scene in which Gabriel ( Margotta ) is shown frontally nude , which led to an attempt by the censor to give the film an X rating . The title comes from the poem I Know A Man by Robert Creeley , which a character recites in the opening scene . It also serves as a cryptic reference to basketball , the movie 's dominant milieu .",
