  "/wiki/Comedy_film": "A comedy film is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humor . These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect . Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending ( black comedy being an exception ) . One of the oldest genres in film - and derived from the classical comedy in theatre - , some of the very first silent movies were comedies , as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions , without requiring sound . When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s , comedy films took another swing , as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue . Comedy , compared with other film genres , puts much more focus on individual stars , with many former stand-up comics transitioning to the film industry due to their popularity . While many comic films are lighthearted stories with no intent other than to amuse , others contain political or social commentary ( such as The King of Comedy and Wag the Dog ) .",

  "/wiki/War_film": "War film is a film genre concerned with warfare , typically about naval , air , or land battles , with combat scenes central to the drama .

Themes explored include combat , survival and escape , camaraderie between soldiers , sacrifice , the futility and inhumanity of battle , the effects of war on society , and the moral and human issues raised by war . War films are often categorized by their milieu , such as the Korean War ; the most popular subject is the Second World War . The stories told may be fiction , historical drama , or biographical . Critics have noted similarities between the Western and the war film . Nations such as China , Indonesia , Japan , and Russia have their own traditions of war film , centred on their own revolutionary wars but taking varied forms , from action and historical drama to wartime romance . Subgenres , not necessarily distinct , include anti-war , comedy , animated , propaganda , and documentary .

  "/wiki/Drama_film": "In film and television , drama is a genre of narrative fiction ( or semi-fiction ) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone . Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre , such as police crime drama , political drama , legal drama , historical period drama , domestic drama , teen drama or comedy-drama . These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods . All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters . In this broader sense , drama is a mode distinct from novels , short stories , and narrative poetry or songs . In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted . Radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance , it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio .",

Action films tend to feature a resourceful hero struggling against incredible odds , which include life-threatening situations , a villain , or a pursuit which usually concludes in victory for the hero ( though a small number of films in this genre have ended in the victory for the villain instead ) . Advancements in CGI have made it cheaper and easier to create action sequences and other visual effects that required the efforts of professional stunt crews in the past . However , reactions to action films containing significant amounts of CGI have been mixed , as films that use computer animations to create unrealistic , highly unbelievable events are often met with criticism . While action has long been a recurring component in films , the action film genre began to develop in the 1970s along with the increase of stunts and special effects . Common action scenes in films are generally , but not limited to , explosions , car chases , fistfights , and shootouts .

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece . In the Athenian democracy , the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters . The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict . Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a Society of Youth and a Society of the Old . A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes . In this struggle , the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority , and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter . Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt , thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor . Parody subverts popular genres and forms , critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them . Other forms of comedy include screwball comedy , which derives its humor largely from bizarre , surprising ( and improbable ) situations or characters , and black comedy , which is characterized by a form of humor that includes darker aspects of human behavior or human nature . Similarly scatological humor , sexual humor , and race humor create comedy by violating social conventions or taboos in comic ways . A comedy of manners typically takes as its subject a particular part of society ( usually upper-class society ) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members .",

It is given to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States with a predominantly non-English dialogue track . When the first Academy Awards ceremony was held on May 16 , 1929 , to honor films released in 1927/28 , there was no separate category for foreign language films . Between 1947 and 1955 , the Academy presented Special/Honorary Awards to the best foreign language films released in the United States . These awards , however , were not handed out on a regular basis ( no award was given in 1953 ) , and were not competitive since there were no nominees but simply one winning film per year . For the 1956 ( 29th ) Academy Awards , a competitive Academy Award of Merit , known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award , was created for non-English speaking films , and has been given annually since then . Unlike other Academy Awards , the International Feature Film award is not presented to a specific individual ( although it is accepted on-stage by its director ) , but is considered an award for the submitting country as a whole . Over the years , the Best International Feature Film Award and its predecessors have been given predominantly to European films : out of the seventy-two awards handed out by the Academy since 1947 to foreign language films , fifty-seven have gone to European films , seven to Asian films , five to films from the Americas and three to African films . Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini directed four Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award-winning motion pictures during his lifetime , a record that remains unmatched as of 2015 [ update ] ( if Special Awards are taken into account , then Fellini 's record is tied by his countryman Vittorio De Sica ) . The most awarded foreign country is Italy , with 14 awards won ( including three Special Awards ) and 28 nominations , while France is the foreign country with the largest number of nominations ( 37 for 12 wins , including three Special Awards ) . Israel is the foreign country with the largest number of nominations ( 10 ) without winning an award , while Portugal has the largest number of submissions ( 34 ) without a nomination .",

Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social issues , and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition .

The genre has existed since the early years of silent cinema , when Georges Melies ' A Trip to the Moon ( 1902 ) employed trick photography effects . The next major example in the genre was the film Metropolis ( 1927 ) . From the 1930s to the 1950s , the genre consisted mainly of low-budget B movies . After Stanley Kubrick 's landmark 2001 : A Space Odyssey ( 1968 ) , the science fiction film genre was taken more seriously .
