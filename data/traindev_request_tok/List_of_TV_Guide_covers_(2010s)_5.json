The claim of responsibility for the deadly attack on the magazine came in a video showing AQAP commander Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi , with pictures of the Kouachis in the background . However , while authorities say the video is authentic , there is not yet any proof that AQAP did indeed help to carry out the attacks .
