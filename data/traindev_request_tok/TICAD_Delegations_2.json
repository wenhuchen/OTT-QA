Sudan 's predominant religion is Islam , and its official languages are Arabic and English . The capital is Khartoum , located at the confluence of the Blue and White Nile . Since 2011 , Sudan has been the scene of an ongoing military conflict in its southern states . Sudan 's history goes back to the Pharaonic period , witnessing the kingdom of Kerma ( c. 2500 BC-1500 BC ) , the subsequent rule of the Egyptian New Kingdom ( c. 1500 BC-1070 BC ) and the rise of the kingdom of Kush ( c. 785 BC-350 AD ) , which would in turn control Egypt itself for nearly a century . After the fall of Kush , the Nubians formed the three Christian kingdoms of Nobatia , Makuria and Alodia , with the latter two lasting until around 1500 . Between the 14th and 15th centuries much of Sudan was settled by Arab nomads . From the 16th-19th centuries , central and eastern Sudan were dominated by the Funj sultanate , while Darfur ruled the west and the Ottomans the far north .

He was subsequently incarcerated , tried and convicted on multiple corruption charges . He came to power in 1989 when , as a brigadier in the Sudanese Army , he led a group of officers in a military coup that ousted the democratically elected government of prime minister Sadiq al-Mahdi after it began negotiations with rebels in the south . He was elected three times as President in elections that have been under scrutiny for electoral fraud . In 1992 , al-Bashir founded the National Congress Party , which remained the dominant political party in the country until 2019 .

In October 2005 , al-Bashir 's government negotiated an end to the Second Sudanese Civil War , leading to a referendum in the South , resulting in the separation of the south as the country of South Sudan . In the Darfur region , he oversaw the war in Darfur that has resulted in death tolls that are about 10,000 according to the Sudanese Government , but most sources suggest between 200,000 and 400,000 . During his presidency , there have been several violent struggles between the Janjaweed militia and rebel groups such as the Sudanese Liberation Army ( SLA ) and the Justice and Equality Movement ( JEM ) in the form of guerrilla warfare in the Darfur region . The civil war has displaced over 2.5 million people out of a total population of 6.2 million in Darfur and has created a crisis in the diplomatic relations between Sudan and Chad . The rebels in Darfur lost the support from Libya after the death of Muammar Gaddafi and the collapse of his regime in 2011 . In July 2008 , the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) , Luis Moreno Ocampo , accused al-Bashir of genocide , crimes against humanity , and war crimes in Darfur .",

The sovereign state is separated from the Comoros , Mayotte and Madagascar by the Mozambique Channel to the east . The capital and largest city of Mozambique is Maputo ( formerly known as Louren\u00e7o Marques from 1876 to 1976 ) . Between the first and fifth centuries AD , Bantu-speaking peoples migrated to present-day Mozambique from farther north and west . Northern Mozambique lies within the monsoon trade winds of the Indian Ocean . Between the 7th and 11th centuries , a series of Swahili port towns developed here , which contributed to the development of a distinct Swahili culture and language . In the late medieval period , these towns were frequented by traders from Somalia , Ethiopia , Egypt , Arabia , Persia , and India . The voyage of Vasco da Gama in 1498 marked the arrival of the Portuguese , who began a gradual process of colonisation and settlement in 1505 . After over four centuries of Portuguese rule , Mozambique gained independence in 1975 , becoming the People 's Republic of Mozambique shortly thereafter . After only two years of independence , the country descended into an intense and protracted civil war lasting from 1977 to 1992 .

It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere . About 80 percent of South Africans are of Bantu ancestry , divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different African languages , nine of which have official status . The remaining population consists of Africa 's largest communities of European , Asian ( Indian ) , and multiracial ( Coloured ) ancestry . South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures , languages , and religions . Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution 's recognition of 11 official languages , which is the fourth-highest number in the world . Two of these languages are of European origin : Afrikaans developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most coloured and white South Africans ; English reflects the legacy of British colonialism , and is commonly used in public and commercial life , though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language .

In 1967 , he succeeded M'ba to become the second Gabon President , upon the latter 's death . Bongo headed the single-party regime of the Gabonese Democratic Party ( PDG ) until 1990 , when , faced with public pressure , he was forced to introduce multi-party politics into Gabon . His political survival despite intense opposition to his rule in the early 1990s seemed to stem once again from consolidating power by bringing most of the major opposition leaders at the time to his side . The 1993 presidential election was extremely controversial but ended with his re-election then and the subsequent elections of 1998 and 2005 .

Located 570 kilometres ( 350 mi ) west of the Cape Verde Peninsula off the coast of Northwest Africa , the islands cover a combined area of slightly over 4,000 square kilometres ( 1,500 sq mi ) . The Cape Verde archipelago was uninhabited until the 15th century , when Portuguese explorers discovered and colonized the islands , establishing the first European settlement in the tropics . Ideally located for the Atlantic slave trade , the islands grew prosperous throughout the 16th and 17th centuries , attracting merchants , privateers , and pirates .
