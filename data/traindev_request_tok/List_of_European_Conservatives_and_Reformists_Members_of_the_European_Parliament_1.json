In 2006 , Farage officially became leader and under his direction the party adopted a wider policy platform and capitalised on concerns about rising immigration , in particular among the White British working class . This resulted in significant breakthroughs at the 2013 local elections , 2014 European elections , and 2015 general election .

Hungary 's capital and largest city is Budapest ; other major urban areas include Debrecen , Szeged , Miskolc , P\u00e9cs and Gy\u0151r . The territory of modern Hungary was for centuries inhabited by a succession of peoples , including Celts , Romans , Germanic tribes , Huns , West Slavs and the Avars . The foundations of the Hungarian state were established in the late ninth century CE by the Hungarian grand prince \u00c1rp\u00e1d following the conquest of the Carpathian Basin . His great-grandson Stephen I ascended the throne in 1000 , converting his realm to a Christian kingdom .

Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 , Hungary was partially occupied by the Ottoman Empire ( 1541-1699 ) . It came under Habsburg rule at the turn of the 18th century , and later joined Austria to form the Austro-Hungarian Empire , a major European power . The Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed after World War I , and the subsequent Treaty of Trianon established Hungary 's current borders , resulting in the loss of 71% of its territory , 58% of its population , and 32% of ethnic Hungarians .",

The party 's leading members included Angelino Alfano ( national secretary ) , Renato Schifani , Renato Brunetta , Roberto Formigoni , Maurizio Sacconi , Maurizio Gasparri , Mariastella Gelmini , Antonio Martino , Giancarlo Galan , Maurizio Lupi , Gaetano Quagliariello , Daniela Santanch\u00e8 , Sandro Bondi and Raffaele Fitto . The PdL formed Italy 's government from 2008 to 2011 in coalition with Lega Nord . After having supported Mario Monti 's technocratic government in 2011-2012 , the party was part of Enrico Letta 's government with the Democratic Party , Civic Choice and the Union of the Centre . Alfano functioned as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior . In June 2013 Berlusconi announced Forza Italia 's revival and the PdL 's transformation into a centre-right coalition . On 16 November 2013 the PdL 's national council voted to dissolve the party and start a new Forza Italia ; the assembly was deserted by a group of dissidents , led by Alfano , who had launched the New Centre-Right the day before .",
