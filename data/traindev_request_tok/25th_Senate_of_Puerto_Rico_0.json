  "/wiki/At-large": "At-large is a designation for members of a governing body who are elected or appointed to represent the whole membership of the body ( notably , a city , county , state or province , nation , club or association ) , rather than a subset of that membership . At-large voting is in contrast to voting by electoral districts . If an at-large election is called to choose a single candidate , a single-winner voting system must necessarily be used . If a group of seats must be covered , many electoral systems can be possible , from proportional representation methods ( such as party-list proportional representation , or PR-STV ) to block voting .",

  "/wiki/Popular_Democratic_Party_of_Puerto_Rico": "The Popular Democratic Party ( Spanish : Partido Popular Democr\u00e1tico , PPD ) is a political party in Puerto Rico that advocates to continue as a Commonwealth of the United States with self-government . [ a ] [ b ] The party was founded in 1938 by dissidents from the Puerto Rican Liberal Party and the Unionist Party and originally promoted policies on the center-left . [ c ] In recent years , however , its leaders have described the party as centrist . [ d ] [ e ] As one of the long-standing parties on the island , the PPD has played a significant role in the history of Puerto Rico . In the early 1950s , for example , the party held a majority in the delegation convened to draft the Constitution of Puerto Rico . Once the constitution was ratified , the document was proclaimed by the party 's leader and co-founder , Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn - who , in doing so , became the first Puerto Rican governor elected by the people of Puerto Rico . The party ruled all branches of the Puerto Rican government afterward for 36 of the past 68 years , while establishing many of the institutions that permeate Puerto Rican society today . Today , the party is one of the two major parties in Puerto Rico with significant political strength . In the executive branch , the party 's last governor was Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla who governed the island from 2013-2017 . It also holds minorities in the legislative and judicial branches by holding minorities in the Senate , in the House , and in the Supreme Court . The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court , however , is from the PPD ; a circumstance that allows the party to designate political appointees in the judicial branch since the Chief Justice is also constitutionally the chief judicial administrator . Finally , in the municipal landscape , the party holds more than half of the seats of mayors .",
