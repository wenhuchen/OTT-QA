  "/wiki/Prototype": "A prototype is an early sample , model , or release of a product built to test a concept or process . It is a term used in a variety of contexts , including semantics , design , electronics , and software programming . A prototype is generally used to evaluate a new design to enhance precision by system analysts and users . Prototyping serves to provide specifications for a real , working system rather than a theoretical one . In some design workflow models , creating a prototype ( a process sometimes called materialization ) is the step between the formalization and the evaluation of an idea . A prototype can also mean a typical example of something such as in the use of the derivation 'prototypical ' . This is a useful term in identifying objects , behaviours and concepts which are considered the accepted norm and is analogous with terms such as stereotypes and archetypes .
