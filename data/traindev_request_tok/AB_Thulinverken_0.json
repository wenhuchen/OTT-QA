The first example was used by Louis Bl\u00e9riot to make the first flight across the English Channel in a heavier-than-air aircraft , on 25 July 1909 . This is one of the most famous accomplishments of the pioneer era of aviation , and not only won Bl\u00e9riot a lasting place in history but also assured the future of his aircraft manufacturing business . The event caused a major reappraisal of the importance of aviation ; the English newspaper The Daily Express led its story of the flight with the headline Britain is no longer an Island . It was produced in both single- and two-seat versions , powered by several different engines , and was widely used for competition and training purposes . Military versions were bought by many countries , continuing in service until after the outbreak of World War I in 1914 . Two restored examples - one in the United Kingdom and one in the United States - of original Bl\u00e9riot XI aircraft are thought to be the two oldest flyable aircraft in the world .",

  "/wiki/Gnome_Omega": "The Gnome 7 Omega ( commonly called the Gnome 50 hp ) is a French seven-cylinder , air-cooled aero engine produced by Gnome et Rh\u00f4ne . It was shown at the Paris Aero Salon held in December 1908 and was first flown in 1909 . It was the world 's first aviation rotary engine produced in quantity . Its introduction revolutionized the aviation industry and it was used by many early aircraft . It produced 50 hp ( 37 kW ) from its capacity of 8 l ( 490 cu in ) . A Gnome Omega engine powers the 1912 Blackburn Monoplane , owned and operated by the Shuttleworth Collection , the oldest known airworthy British-designed aeroplane worldwide . A two-row version of the same engine was also produced , known as the Gnome 14 Omega-Omega or Gnome 100 hp . The prototype Omega engine still exists , and is on display at the United States ' National Air and Space Museum .",
  "/wiki/Thulin_B_(aircraft)": "The Morane-Saulnier G was a two-seat sport and racing monoplane produced in France before the First World War . It was a development of the racing monoplanes designed by L\u00e9on Morane and Raymond Saulnier after leaving Borel and , like its predecessors , was a wire-braced , shoulder-wing monoplane . Construction was of fabric-covered wood throughout , except for the undercarriage struts which were of steel tube . The type was a sporting success . In April 1913 , Roland Garros took second place in the inaugural Schneider Cup in a floatplane version , finishing with a time of 40 minutes 40 seconds . On 26 June , Claude Grahame-White flew another float-equipped example from Paris to London via Le Havre , Boulogne-sur-Mer , and Dover , covering some 500 km ( 310 mi ) that day . Between 21 and 28 September the same year , two float-equipped Type Gs competed at the seaplane meeting at San Sebasti\u00e1n , with Lord Carbery winning the short takeoff prize on one , and Edmond Audemars winning the maneuverability prize on the other . The following week , Carbery flew his Type G in the Italian Waterplane Contest from Lake Como to Pavia and back , along with two other Type Gs in the field of fifteen competitors , these flown by Garros and Morane . Garros not only won the Grand Prize in the general class , but also the prizes for best speed ( 127.7 km/h , 79.8 mph ) and greatest altitude ( 2,100 m , 6,000 ft ) . On 28 September 1913 Roland Garros became the first person to cross the Mediterranean Sea by air , flying from Fr\u00e9jus in the south of France to Bizerte in Tunisia in a Morane-Saulnier G. In 1914 , Russian manufacturer Duks arranged to build the type under licence at their Moscow factory for the Russian Army , and the same year , the Turkish military ordered 40 examples . Before these could be delivered , however , war broke out , and the aircraft were impressed into the French Army . To these , the Army soon added an order of 94 aircraft , and the British Royal Flying Corps also acquired a number , these latter machines purchased from Grahame-White , who was manufacturing the type in the UK under licence .",

  "/wiki/Thulin_D": "The Morane-Saulnier L , or Morane-Saulnier Type L , or officially MoS-3 , was a French parasol wing one or two-seat scout aeroplane of the First World War . The Type L became one of the first successful fighter aircraft when it was fitted with a single machine gun that fired through the arc of the propeller , which was protected by armoured deflector wedges . Its immediate effectiveness in this role launched an arms race in fighter development , and the Type L was swiftly rendered obsolete . The original Type L used wing warping for lateral control , but a later version designated Type LA was fitted with ailerons . Built by Morane-Saulnier , large numbers of the Type L were ordered by the French Aviation Militaire at the outbreak of the war . In total about 600 Type Ls were built and , in addition to the French air force , they served with the Royal Flying Corps , Royal Naval Air Service and the Imperial Russian Air Service . The type was also produced under licence in Germany by Pfalz Flugzeugwerke as the unarmed A.I and A.II scouts ( with 80 HP and 100 HP Oberursel engines respectively ) . About 60 were built for Bavarian air service . A few were later modified as the E.III fighters . A few Type Ls captured by Germany were fitted with a single German Spandau LMG 08 machine gun . These captured and converted aircraft are often mistaken for Pfalz E.IIIs . About 450 aircraft were licence-built in Russia by Duks and Lebed works .",
