  "/wiki/President_of_the_Senate": "President of the Senate is a title often given to the presiding officer of a senate . It corresponds to the speaker in some other assemblies . The senate president often ranks high in a jurisdiction 's succession for its top executive office : for example , the president of the Senate of Nigeria is second in line for succession to the presidency , after only the vice president of the Federal Republic , while in France , which has no vice president , the Senate president is first in line to succeed to the presidential powers and duties .",

  "/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)": "The Republican Party , also referred to as the GOP ( Grand Old Party ) , is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States ; the other is its historic rival , the Democratic Party . The GOP was founded in 1854 by opponents of the Kansas-Nebraska Act , which allowed for the potential expansion of slavery into certain U.S. territories . The party supported classical liberalism , opposed the expansion of slavery , and supported economic reform . Abraham Lincoln was the first Republican president . Under the leadership of Lincoln and a Republican Congress , slavery was banned in the United States in 1865 . The Party was generally dominant during the Third Party System and the Fourth Party System . After 1912 , the Party underwent an ideological shift to the right . Following the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the party 's core base shifted , with Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics . The party 's 21st-century base of support includes people living in rural areas , men , people without college degrees , the elderly , white Americans , and evangelical Christians . The 21st-century Republican Party ideology is American conservatism , which incorporates both economic policies and social values . The GOP supports lower taxes , free market capitalism , restrictions on immigration , increased military spending , gun rights , restrictions on abortion , deregulation and restrictions on labor unions . After the Supreme Court 's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade , the Republican Party opposed abortion in its party platform and grew its support among evangelicals .",

  "/wiki/Majority_Leader": "In U.S. politics , the majority floor leader is a partisan position in a legislative body . In the federal Congress , the role of the Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives and the Majority Leader of the United States Senate differ slightly . In the United States Senate , the majority leader is the chief spokesperson for the majority party , as the president of the Senate is also the Vice-President of the United States , and the President pro tempore , though technically a substitute for the president of the Senate , is in reality a largely ceremonial position . In the United States House of Representatives , the majority leader is elected by U.S. Congresspeople in the political party holding the largest number of seats in the House . While the responsibilities vary depending upon the political climate , the Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives typically sets the floor agenda and oversees the committee chairmen . Given the two-party nature of the U.S. system , the majority leader is almost inevitably either a Republican or a Democrat . The majority leader is often assisted in their role by whips , whose job is to enforce party discipline on votes deemed to be crucial by the party leadership and to ensure that members do not vote in a way not approved of by the party . Some votes are deemed to be so crucial as to lead to punitive measures ( such as demotion from choice committee assignments ) if the party line is violated ; decisions such as these are often made by the majority leader in conjunction with other senior party leaders . In the states , the majority leader of a state legislative chamber usually performs a similar role to the Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives . State senate presidents pro tempore are typically not ceremonial , but more akin to the Majority Leader of the United States Senate .",

  "/wiki/Whip_(politics)": "A whip is an official of a political party whose task is to ensure party discipline in a legislature .

Whips are the party 's enforcers . They ensure that their fellow legislators attend voting sessions and vote according to official policy .

  "/wiki/Minority_Leader": "In U.S. politics , the minority leader is the floor leader of the second largest caucus in a legislative body . Given the two-party nature of the U.S. system , the minority leader is almost inevitably either a Republican or a Democrat . The position could be considered similar to that of the Leader of the Opposition in parliamentary systems . In bicameral legislatures , the counterpart to the minority leader in the lower house is the Speaker , and the majority leader is hence only the second-most senior member of the majority caucus . Contrastingly , in upper houses , the titular Speaker is frequently a separately elected officer such as a lieutenant governor or vice president . The minority leader is often assisted in his/her role by one or more whips , whose job is to enforce party discipline on votes deemed to be crucial by the party leadership and to ensure that members do not vote against the position of the party leaders . Some votes are deemed to be so crucial as to lead to punitive measures ( such as demotion from choice committee assignments ) for members who violate the party line ; decisions such as these are often made by the minority leader in conjunction with other senior party leaders . In a state where the executive branch and both houses of the state legislature are controlled by the other party , the minority leader of one of the houses ( most often the upper one ) may be seen as the most senior member of the party in that state with regard to state government ( although inferior in rank to a United States Senator or United States Representative , if there be such in that party from that state ) . At times , particularly during crucial legislation , the minority leader may be consulted by the opposite leader in order to more easily get things passed and ensure that provisions important to the interests the minority party be included . The level of partisanship in state legislative bodies varies greatly from one state to another .",

  "/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)": "The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States , along with its main rival , the Republican Party . Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison 's Democratic-Republican Party , the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson , making it the world 's oldest active political party . In its early years , the Party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s , the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform . Well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings ; following the New Deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South . The New Deal Coalition of 1932-1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction - many of whom were Catholics based in the cities . After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the core bases of the two parties shifted , with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic . The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s . White evangelicals and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local levels since the 1990s . People living in urban areas , women , college graduates , sexual and gender minorities , millennials , and black , Latino , Jewish , Muslim and Asian Americans tend to support the Democratic Party . The Democratic Party 's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality , along with the welfare state . It seeks to provide government regulation in the economy .",
