  "/wiki/Reginald_Innes_Pocock": "Reginald Innes Pocock F.R.S . ( 4 March 1863 - 9 August 1947 ) was a British zoologist . Pocock was born in Clifton , Bristol , the fourth son of Rev . Nicholas Pocock and Edith Prichard . He began showing interest in natural history at St. Edward 's School , Oxford . He received tutoring in zoology from Sir Edward Poulton , and was allowed to explore comparative anatomy at the Oxford Museum . He studied biology and geology at University College , Bristol , under Conwy Lloyd Morgan and William Johnson Sollas . In 1885 , he became an assistant at the Natural History Museum , and worked in the section of entomology for a year . He was put in charge of the collections of Arachnida and Myriapoda . He was also given the task to arrange the British birds collections , in the course of which he developed a lasting interest in ornithology . The 200 papers he published in his 18 years at the museum soon brought him recognition as an authority on Arachnida and Myriapoda ; he described between 300 and 400 species of millipedes alone , and also described the scorpion genus Brachistosternus . In 1904 , he left to become superintendent of the London Zoo , remaining so until his retirement in 1923 .",

He is known as the father of modern taxonomy . Many of his writings were in Latin , and his name is rendered in Latin as Carolus Linn\u00e6us ( after 1761 Carolus a Linn\u00e9 ) . Linnaeus was born in the countryside of Sm\u00e5land in southern Sweden . He received most of his higher education at Uppsala University and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730 . He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738 , where he studied and also published the first edition of his Systema Naturae in the Netherlands . He then returned to Sweden where he became professor of medicine and botany at Uppsala . In the 1740s , he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals . In the 1750s and 1760s , he continued to collect and classify animals , plants , and minerals , while publishing several volumes . He was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe at the time of his death . Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau sent him the message : Tell him I know no greater man on earth .

These monkeys mainly reside in the bamboo forest ( Odubullu Forest ) of the Bale mountain due their dietary specialization on bamboo , however , other factors such as climate , forest history , soil quality , and disease could are likely to play a role in their choice to inhibit this area .

The term vervet is also used to refer to all the members of the genus Chlorocebus . The five distinct subspecies can be found mostly throughout Southern Africa , as well as some of the eastern countries . Vervets were introduced to Florida , St. Kitts , and Cape Verde . These mostly herbivorous monkeys have black faces and grey body hair color , ranging in body length from about 40 centimetres ( 16 in ) for females , to about 50 centimetres ( 20 in ) for males . In addition to behavioral research on natural populations , vervet monkeys serve as a nonhuman primate model for understanding genetic and social behaviors of humans . They have been noted for having human-like characteristics , such as hypertension , anxiety , and social and dependent alcohol use . Vervets live in social groups ranging from 10 to 70 individuals , with males moving to other groups at the time of sexual maturity . The most significant [ according to whom ? ] studies done on vervet monkeys involve their communication and alarm calls , specifically in regard to kin and group recognition and particular predator sightings .",

Some older sources treat the Dryas monkey as a subspecies of the Diana monkey and classify it as C. diana dryas , but it is geographically isolated from any known Diana monkey population . While the Dryas monkey had been considered data deficient , evidence suggests it is very rare and its total population possibly numbers fewer than 200 individuals . Consequently , its status was changed to critically endangered in the 2008 IUCN Red List . Along with being listed by the IUCN , this species is also listed on Appendix II of CITES .

It is a guenon of the C. mitis group , native to West Africa and living to some extent in rain forests , but more often in the transition zone between rain forest and savannah . It is primarily arboreal and often associates with monkeys of other species . Both their common names come from the monkeys ' prominent white nose . The greater spot-nosed monkey lives in groups consisting of one adult male , a number of adult females , and their dependent offspring . Little recent research has been conducted into its behaviour , and most has concentrated on its auditory communication . Males use three call types which have been described as 'booms ' , 'pyows ' , and 'hacks ' . These are used in a number of contexts including as alarm calls . As in some other species of monkeys , the acoustical structure of greater spot-nosed monkey alarm calls it has been argued to vary according to the kind of predator spotted . The monkey reportedly combines different sounds into a sequence , which has an entirely different meaning from the sounds out of which it is made . For instance , the sound pyow alone means another animal , like a leopard , is lurking nearby , and hack means a flying animal , like an eagle , is flying nearby , but when the two are combined , as in the sequence pyow pyow hack hack hack hack , they have an entirely different meaning : Let 's get out of here and move to another place .",
