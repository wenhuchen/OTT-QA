  "/wiki/Defensive_Line": "In gridiron football , a lineman is a player who specializes in play at the line of scrimmage . The linemen of the team currently in possession of the ball are the offensive line , while linemen on the opposing team are the defensive line . A number of NFL rules specifically address restrictions and requirements for the offensive line , whose job is to help protect the quarterback from getting sacked for a loss , or worse , fumbling . The defensive line is covered by the same rules that apply to all defensive players . Linemen are usually the largest players on the field in both height and weight , since their positions usually require less running and more strength than skill positions .",

  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",
