European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States .

During the Iron Age , what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls , a Celtic people . Rome annexed the area in 51 BC , holding it until the arrival of Germanic Franks in 476 , who formed the Kingdom of Francia . The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned Francia into East Francia , Middle Francia and West Francia . West Francia , which became the Kingdom of France in 987 , emerged as a major European power in the Late Middle Ages , following its victory in the Hundred Years ' War ( 1337-1453 ) .",
  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",
  "/wiki/Australian_Dollar": "The Australian dollar ( sign : $ ; code : AUD ) is the currency of Australia , including its external territories : Christmas Island , Cocos ( Keeling ) Islands , and Norfolk Island . It is officially used as currency by three independent Pacific Island states : Kiribati , Nauru , and Tuvalu . It is legal tender in Australia . Within Australia , it is almost always abbreviated with the dollar sign ( $ ) , with A $ or AU $ sometimes used to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies . The $ symbol precedes the amount . It is subdivided into 100 cents . The Australian dollar was introduced on 14 February 1966 to replace the pre-decimal Australian pound , with the conversion rate of A $ 2 per = A\u20a41 . The Australian dollar was legal tender of Papua New Guinea until 31 December 1975 , when the Papua New Guinean kina became sole legal tender , and of the Solomon Islands until 1977 , when the Solomon Islands dollar became sole legal tender . In 2016 , the Australian dollar was the fifth most traded currency in world foreign exchange markets , accounting for 6.9% of the world 's daily share ( down from 8.6% in 2013 ) behind the United States dollar , the European Union 's euro , the Japanese yen and the United Kingdom 's pound sterling . The Australian dollar is popular with currency traders , because of the comparatively high interest rates in Australia , the relative freedom of the foreign exchange market from government intervention , the general stability of Australia 's economy and political system , and the prevailing view that the Australian dollar offers diversification benefits in a portfolio containing the major world currencies , especially because of its greater exposure to Asian economies and the commodities cycle . As at 31 December 2016 , there were 57.71 billion US $ equivalent in Australian currency in circulation , $ 2,379.05 per person in Australia , which includes cash reserves held by the banking system and cash in circulation in other countries or held as a foreign exchange reserve .",
  "/wiki/Japan": "Japan ( Japanese : \u65e5\u672c , Nippon [ \u0272ippo\ua71c\u0274 ] ( listen ) or Nihon [ \u0272iho\ua71c\u0274 ] ( listen ) ) is an island country located in East Asia . It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",
  "/wiki/Yen": "The yen ( Japanese : \u5186 , Hepburn : en , symbol : \u00a5 ; code : JPY ; also abbreviated as JP\u00a5 ) is the official currency of Japan . It is the third most traded currency in the foreign exchange market after the United States dollar and the euro . It is also widely used as a reserve currency after the U.S. dollar , the euro , and the pound sterling . The concept of the yen was a component of the Meiji government 's modernization program of Japan 's economy , which postulated the pursuit of a uniform currency throughout the country , modelled after the European decimal currency system . Before the Meiji Restoration , Japan 's feudal fiefs all issued their own money , hansatsu , in an array of incompatible denominations . The New Currency Act of 1871 did away with these and established the yen , which was defined as 1.5 g ( 0.048 troy ounces ) of gold , or 24.26 g ( 0.780 troy ounces ) of silver , as the new decimal currency . The former han ( fiefs ) became prefectures and their mints private chartered banks , which initially retained the right to print money . To bring an end to this situation , the Bank of Japan was founded in 1882 and given a monopoly on controlling the money supply . Following World War II the yen lost much of its prewar value . To stabilize the Japanese economy the exchange rate of the yen was fixed at \u00a5360 per US $ 1 as part of the Bretton Woods system . When that system was abandoned in 1971 , the yen became undervalued and was allowed to float . The yen had appreciated to a peak of \u00a5271 per US $ 1 in 1973 , then underwent periods of depreciation and appreciation due to the 1973 oil crisis , arriving at a value of \u00a5227 per US $ 1 by 1980 .",

Its continental European territory is situated on the Iberian Peninsula . Its territory also includes two archipelagoes : the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa , and the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea . The African enclaves of Ceuta , Melilla , and Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera make Spain the only European country to have a physical border with an African country ( Morocco ) . [ h ] Several small islands in the Alboran Sea are also part of Spanish territory . The country 's mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar ; to the north and northeast by France , Andorra , and the Bay of Biscay ; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean . With an area of 505,990 km2 ( 195,360 sq mi ) , Spain is the largest country in Southern Europe , the second largest country in Western Europe and the European Union , and the fourth largest country in the European continent .

Spain 's capital and largest city is Madrid ; other major urban areas include Barcelona , Valencia , Seville , Zaragoza , M\u00e1laga and Bilbao . Modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 35,000 years ago . Iberian cultures along with ancient Phoenician , Greek , Celtic and Carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under Roman rule around 200 BCE , after which the region was named Hispania , based on the earlier Phoenician name Sp ( a ) n or Spania . At the end of the Western Roman Empire the Germanic tribal confederations migrated from Central Europe , invaded the Iberian peninsula and established relatively independent realms in its western provinces , including the Suebi , Alans and Vandals .",

Italy is located in south-central Europe , and it is also considered a part of Western Europe . The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino . Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",

The history of human activity on Polish soil spans almost 500,000 years . Throughout the Iron Age the area became extensively diverse , with various cultures and tribes settling on the vast Central European Plain . However , it was the Western Polans who dominated the region and gave Poland its name . The establishment of Polish statehood can be traced to AD 966 , when Mieszko I , ruler of the realm coextensive with the territory of present-day Poland , converted to Christianity . The Kingdom of Poland was founded in 1025 , and in 1569 it cemented its longstanding political association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the Union of Lublin . This union formed the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , one of the largest ( over 1,000,000 square kilometres - 400,000 square miles ) and most populous countries of 16th and 17th century Europe , with a uniquely liberal political system which adopted Europe 's first written national constitution , the Constitution of 3 May 1791 .",

It is subdivided into 100 groszy ( gr ) . [ a ] The widely recognised English form of the currency is the Polish zloty . It is the most traded currency in Central Europe and ranks 22nd in the foreign exchange market . The word z\u0142oty is a masculine form of the Polish adjective 'golden ' , which closely relates with its name to the Dutch guilder , whereas the grosz subunit was based on Austrian groschen . It was officially introduced to replace its predecessor , the Polish marka , on 28 February 1919 and began circulation in 1924 . The only body permitted to manufacture or mint z\u0142oty coins is Mennica Polska , founded in Warsaw on 10 February 1766 . As a result of inflation in the early 1990s , the currency underwent redenomination . Thus , on 1 January 1995 , 10,000 old z\u0142otych ( PLZ ) became one new z\u0142oty ( PLN ) . Since then , the currency has been relatively stable , with an exchange rate fluctuating between 3 and 4 z\u0142oty for a United States dollar . Though Poland is a member of the European Union , nearly 60% of Poles are strongly against adopting the euro as a new currency ."
