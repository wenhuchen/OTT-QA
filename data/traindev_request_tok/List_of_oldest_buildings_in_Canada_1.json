  "/wiki/Bastion_(Nanaimo)": "The Nanaimo Bastion is a historical octagon shaped fortification located at 98 Front Street in Nanaimo , British Columbia , Canada . The Hudson 's Bay Company , which then held a royal lease on all of what was then the Colony of Vancouver Island , built it between 1853 and 1855 to defend its coal mining operations in Nanaimo . It has been called Nanaimo 's premier landmark , because of its shape and its high visibility from both land and sea . The Bastion was constructed using the pi\u00e8ce-sur-pi\u00e8ce ( post-and-plank ) method . This entailed laying timbers across each other horizontally , with tenons cut into the ends . These tenons would then be inserted into vertical posts . This method was used partially due to the expensive cost of nails ; by using the pi\u00e8ce-sur-pi\u00e8ce method , very few nails were needed . The logs were squared using only basic hand tools : a crosscut saw , broadaxe , adze , auger and pit saw . The wooden structure sat on a masonry foundation and was three stories tall . It is the only remaining freestanding tower structure built by the Hudson 's Bay Company . In 1891 , the Bastion faced demolition threats . The city , recognizing the historic value of the building , paid a sum of $ 175 for the building and moved it across the street from its original location .",
