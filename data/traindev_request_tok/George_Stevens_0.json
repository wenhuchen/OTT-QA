  "/wiki/Short_film": "A short film is any motion picture not long enough in running time to be considered a feature film . The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences defines a short film as an original motion picture that has a running time of 40 minutes or less , including all credits . In the United States , short films were generally termed short subjects from the 1920s into the 1970s when confined to two 35mm reels or less , and featurettes for a film of three or four reels . Short was an abbreviation for either term . The increasingly rare industry term short subject carries more of an assumption that the film is shown as part of a presentation along with a feature film . Short films are often screened at local , national , or international film festivals and made by independent filmmakers with either a low budget or no budget at all . They are usually funded by film grants , nonprofit organizations , sponsor , or personal funds . Short films are generally used for industry experience and as a platform to showcase talent to secure funding for future projects from private investors , a production company , or film studios .",
