  "/wiki/NBA_Jam_(1993_video_game)": "NBA Jam is a basketball arcade game published and developed by Midway in 1993 . It is the first entry in the NBA Jam series . The project leader for this game was Mark Turmell . Midway had previously released such sports games as Arch Rivals in 1989 , High Impact in 1990 , and Super High Impact in 1991 . The gameplay of NBA Jam is based on Arch Rivals , another 2-on-2 basketball video game . However , it was the release of NBA Jam that brought mainstream success to the genre . The game became exceptionally popular , and generated a significant amount of money for arcades after its release , creating revenue of $ 1 billion in quarters . In early 1994 , the Amusement & Music Operators Association reported that NBA Jam had become the highest-earning arcade game of all time . The release of NBA Jam gave rise to a new genre of sports games which were based around fast , action-packed gameplay and exaggerated realism , a formula which Midway would also later apply to the sports of football ( NFL Blitz ) , hockey ( 2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge ) and baseball ( MLB Slugfest ) .",

  "/wiki/Shoot_'em_up": "Shoot 'em up ( also known as shmup or STG ) is a subgenre of video games within the shooter subgenre in the action genre . There is no consensus as to which design elements compose a shoot 'em up . Some restrict the definition to games featuring spacecraft and certain types of character movement ; others allow a broader definition including characters on foot and a variety of perspectives . The genre 's roots can be traced back to Spacewar ! , one of the earliest computer games , developed in 1962 . The shoot 'em up genre was later established by the hit arcade game Space Invaders , which popularised and set the general template for the genre in 1978 , and the genre was then further developed by arcade hits such as Asteroids and Galaxian in 1979 . Shoot 'em ups were popular throughout the 1980s and early 1990s . In the mid-1990s , shoot 'em ups became a niche genre based on design conventions established in the 1980s , and increasingly catered to specialist enthusiasts , particularly in Japan .

  "/wiki/Fighting_game": "A fighting game is a video game genre based around close combat between a limited number of characters , in a stage in which the boundaries are fixed . The characters fight each others until they defeat their opponents or the time expires . The matches typically consist of several rounds , in an arena , with each player character having different abilities but each is relatively viable to choose . Players must master techniques such as blocking , counter-attacking , and chaining attacks together into combos . Starting in the early 1990s , most fighting games allowed the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations . The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups , which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player . The first game to feature fist fighting was Heavyweight Champ in 1976 , but it was Karate Champ which popularized one-on-one martial arts games in arcades in 1984 . The following year , Yie Ar Kung-Fu featured antagonists with differing fighting styles , while The Way of the Exploding Fist further popularized the genre on home systems . In 1987 , Street Fighter introduced hidden special attacks . In 1991 , Capcom 's highly successful Street Fighter II refined and popularized many of the conventions of the genre . The fighting game subsequently became the preeminent genre for competitive video gaming in the early to mid-1990s , particularly in arcades . This period spawned dozens of other popular fighting games , including franchises like Street Fighter , Super Smash Bros. , Tekken , and Virtua Fighter .",

  "/wiki/EA_Sports": "EA Sports is a division of Electronic Arts that develops and publishes sports video games .

Most games under this brand are developed by EA Vancouver , the studio of Electronic Arts in Burnaby , British Columbia as well as EA Tiburon in Maitland , Florida . The main rival to EA Sports is 2K Sports . Notably , both companies compete over the realm of NBA games . Konami is its rival in association football games .

For example , FIFA 98 , Madden NFL 98 , NBA Live 98 , and NHL 98 were released for the Sega Genesis and the Super NES throughout 1997 ; Madden NFL 2005 and FIFA 2005 had PlayStation releases in 2004 ( FIFA 2005 and Madden NFL 2005 were also the last two PlayStation titles to be released ) ; and NCAA Football 08 had an Xbox release in 2007 .

  "/wiki/Beat_'em_up": "Beat 'em up ( also known as brawler ) is a video game genre featuring hand-to-hand combat between the protagonist and an improbably large number of opponents . Traditional beat 'em ups take place in scrolling , two-dimensional ( 2D ) levels , though some later games feature more open three-dimensional ( 3D ) environments with yet larger numbers of enemies . These games are noted for their simple gameplay , a source of both critical acclaim and derision . Two-player cooperative gameplay and multiple player characters are also hallmarks of the genre . Most of these games take place in urban settings and feature crime-fighting and revenge-based plots , though some games may employ historical , science fiction or fantasy themes . The first beat 'em up was 1984 's Kung-Fu Master , with 1986 's Renegade introducing the urban settings and underworld revenge themes employed extensively by later games . The genre then saw a period of high popularity between the release of Double Dragon in 1987 , which defined the two-player cooperative mode central to classic beat 'em ups , and led to 1991 's Street Fighter II , which drew gamers towards one-on-one fighting games . Games such as Streets of Rage , Final Fight , Golden Axe and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are other classics to emerge from this period . The genre has been less popular since the emergence of 3D-based mass-market games , but still some beat 'em ups adapted the simple formula to utilize large-scale 3D environments . In recent years , the genre has seen a resurgence in Asia , with the success of South Korean online beat 'em up Dungeon Fighter Online ( 2004 ) ."
