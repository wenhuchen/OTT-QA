Originally a Viking fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now Gammel Strand , Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century . Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions , defences and armed forces . During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the Kalmar Union , governing the entire present day Nordic region in a personal union with Sweden and Norway ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state . The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of Scandinavia under the union for well over 120 years , starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion . After a plague outbreak and fire in the 18th century , the city underwent a period of redevelopment . This included construction of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden and founding of such cultural institutions as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts .

This ephemeral Norse-ruled empire was a thalassocracy , its components only connected by and dependent upon the sea . The first king to unite all three kingdoms was Sweyn Forkbeard , king of Denmark since 986 and of Norway since 1000 , when he conquered England in 1013 . He died the following year and his realm was divided . His son Cnut the Great acquired England in 1016 , Denmark in 1018 and Norway in 1028 . He died in 1035 and his realm was again divided , but his successor in Denmark , Harthacnut , inherited England in 1040 and ruled it until his death .

Yet after the deaths of his heirs within a decade of his own , and the Norman conquest of England in 1066 , this legacy was lost . He is popularly invoked in the context of the legend of King Canute and the tide , which often misrepresents him as a deluded monarch believing he has supernatural powers , contrary to the original legend which portrays a wise king who rebuked his courtiers for their fawning behaviour . As a Danish prince , Cnut won the throne of England in 1016 in the wake of centuries of Viking activity in northwestern Europe . Scotland submitted to him in 1017 . His later accession to the Danish throne in 1018 brought the crowns of England and Denmark together . Cnut sought to keep this power-base by uniting Danes and English under cultural bonds of wealth and custom , as well as through sheer brutality . After a decade of conflict with opponents in Scandinavia , Cnut claimed the crown of Norway in Trondheim in 1028 . The Swedish city Sigtuna was held by Cnut ( he had coins struck there that called him king , but there is no narrative record of his occupation ) . Dominion of England lent the Danes an important link to the maritime zone between the islands of Great Britain and Ireland , where Cnut , like his father before him , had a strong interest and wielded much influence among the Norse-Gaels . Cnut 's possession of England 's dioceses and the continental Diocese of Denmark - with a claim laid upon it by the Holy Roman Empire 's Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen - was a source of great prestige and leverage within the Catholic Church and among the magnates of Christendom ( gaining notable concessions such as one on the price of the pallium of his bishops , though they still had to travel to obtain the pallium , as well as on the tolls his people had to pay on the way to Rome ) . After his 1026 victory against Norway and Sweden , and on his way back from Rome where he attended the coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor , Cnut , in a letter written for the benefit of his subjects , deemed himself King of all England and Denmark and the Norwegians and of some of the Swedes .",

The state also claimed sovereignty over two historical peoples : Wends and Gutes . Denmark-Norway had several colonies , namely the Danish Gold Coast , the Nicobar Islands , Serampore , Tharangambadi , and the Danish West Indies . The state 's inhabitants were mainly Danes , Norwegians , and Germans , and also included Faroese , Icelanders and Inuit in the Norwegian overseas possessions , a Sami minority in northern Norway , as well as indigenous peoples and enslaved Africans in the colonies .

In 1380 , Olaf II of Denmark inherited the Kingdom of Norway , titled as Olaf IV , after the death of his father Haakon VI of Norway , who was married to Olaf 's mother Margrete I. Margrete I was ruler of Norway from her son 's death in 1387 until her own death in 1412 . Denmark , Norway , and Sweden established and formed the Kalmar Union in 1397 . Following Sweden 's departure in 1523 , the union was effectively dissolved . From 1536/1537 , Denmark and Norway formed a personal union that would eventually develop into the 1660 integrated state called Denmark-Norway by modern historians , at the time sometimes referred to as the Twin Kingdoms , the Monarchy , or simply His Majesty . [ citation needed ] Prior to 1660 , Denmark-Norway was de jure a constitutional and elective monarchy in which the King 's power was somewhat limited ; in that year it became one of the most stringent absolute monarchies in Europe . Even after 1660 , Denmark-Norway consisted of three formally separate parts , and Norway kept its separate laws and some institutions , and separate coinage and army . The Dano-Norwegian union lasted until 1814 , when the Treaty of Kiel decreed that Norway ( except for the Faroe Islands , Iceland , and Greenland ) be ceded to Sweden .",

The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city . As the oldest town in the country Turku was the most important city in Finland , a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden . After the war Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire ( 1809 ) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki ( 1812 ) . It was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku ( Turun Akatemia ) founded in 1640 , which then became the University of Helsinki . Turku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s , and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port . Because of its long history , it has been the site of many important events , and has extensively influenced Finnish history .

It existed between 1809 and 1917 as an autonomous part of the Russian Empire . Originating in the 16th century as a titular grand duchy held by the King of Sweden , it became autonomous after the Russian annexation in the Finnish War . The Grand Duke of Finland was the Romanov Emperor of Russia , who was represented by the Governor-General . Due to the governmental structure of the Russian Empire and Finnish initiative , the grand duchy 's autonomy expanded until the end of the 19th century . The Senate of Finland was founded in 1809 , which became the most important governmental organ and the precursor to the modern Government of Finland , Supreme Court of Finland and the Supreme Administrative Court of Finland . The economic , social and political changes in the Grand Duchy of Finland were closely connected with those in the Russian Empire and the rest of Europe . The economy grew slowly during the first half of the 19th century . The reign of Alexander II after 1855 saw significant cultural , social and intellectual progress and an industrializing economy . Tensions increased after the Russification policies were enacted in 1889 , which saw the introduction of limited autonomy and reduction of Finnish cultural expression . The unrest in Russia and Finland during World War I and the subsequent collapse of the Russian Empire resulted in the Finnish Declaration of Independence and the end of the Grand Duchy .",

The war was fought between the Reds , led by a section of the Social Democratic Party , and the Whites , conducted by the conservative-based Senate and the German Imperial Army . The paramilitary Red Guards , composed of industrial and agrarian workers , controlled the cities and industrial centres of southern Finland . The paramilitary White Guards , composed of farmers , along with middle-class and upper-class social strata , controlled rural central and northern Finland . In the years before the conflict , Finnish society had experienced rapid population growth , industrialisation , pre-urbanisation and the rise of a comprehensive labour movement . The country 's political and governmental systems were in an unstable phase of democratisation and modernisation . The socio-economic condition and education of the population had gradually improved , as well as national thinking and cultural life had awakened . World War I led to the collapse of the Russian Empire , causing a power vacuum in Finland , and a subsequent struggle for dominance led to militarisation and an escalating crisis between the left-leaning labour movement and the conservatives . The Reds carried out an unsuccessful general offensive in February 1918 , supplied with weapons by Soviet Russia . A counteroffensive by the Whites began in March , reinforced by the German Empire 's military detachments in April .

Some of the early kings were prominent in the Red Branch Cycle such as C\u00fa Ro\u00ed and Conaire M\u00f3r . For a few centuries they were competitors for the High Kingship or Ireland , but ultimately lost out to the Connachta , descendants of Conn C\u00e9tchathach . The kingdom had different borders and internal divisions at different times during its history . Major changes reshaped Munster in the 7th century , as the Corcu Lo\u00edgde ( ancestors of the \u00d3 hEidirsceoil ) fell from power .

  "/wiki/Confederate_Ireland": "Confederate Ireland or the Union of the Irish ( Latin : Hiberni Unanimes ) was the period of Irish self-government between 1642 and 1649 , during the Eleven Years ' War . During this time , two-thirds of Ireland was governed by the Irish Catholic Confederation , also known as the Confederation of Kilkenny because it was based in Kilkenny . It was formed by Irish Catholic nobles , clergy and military leaders after the Irish Rebellion of 1641 . The Confederation had what were effectively a parliament ( called the General Assembly ) , an executive ( called the Supreme Council ) , and a military . It pledged allegiance to Charles I . The remaining Protestant-controlled enclaves in Ulster , Munster and Leinster were held by armies loyal to the royalists , parliamentarians or Scottish Covenanters . Throughout its existence , the Confederation waged war against the parliamentarians . In 1648 , it allied itself with the royalists .

  "/wiki/Cromwellian_conquest_of_Ireland": "The Cromwellian conquest of Ireland or Cromwellian war in Ireland ( 1649-53 ) refers to the conquest of Ireland by the forces of the English Parliament , led by Oliver Cromwell , during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms . Cromwell invaded Ireland with his New Model Army on behalf of England 's Rump Parliament in August 1649 . Following the Irish Rebellion of 1641 , most of Ireland came under the control of the Irish Catholic Confederation . In early 1649 , the Confederates allied with the English Royalists , who had been defeated by the Parliamentarians in the English Civil War . By May 1652 , Cromwell 's Parliamentarian army had defeated the Confederate and Royalist coalition in Ireland and occupied the country - bringing to an end the Irish Confederate Wars ( or Eleven Years ' War ) . However , guerrilla warfare continued for a further year . Cromwell passed a series of Penal Laws against Roman Catholics ( the vast majority of the population ) and confiscated large amounts of their land . The Parliamentarian reconquest of Ireland was brutal , and Cromwell is still a hated figure in Ireland . The extent to which Cromwell , who was in direct command for the first year of the campaign , was responsible for the atrocities is debated to this day . Some historians argue that the actions of Cromwell were within the then-accepted rules of war , or were exaggerated or distorted by later propagandists ; these claims have been challenged by others . The impact of the war on the Irish population was unquestionably severe , although there is no consensus as to the magnitude of the loss of life . The war resulted in famine , which was worsened by an outbreak of bubonic plague .",

  "/wiki/Lithuania": "The first known record of the name of Lithuania ( Lithuanian : Lietuva ) is in a 9 March 1009 story of Saint Bruno in the Quedlinburg Chronicle . The Chronicle recorded a Latinized form of the name Lietuva : Litua ( pronounced [ litua ] ) . Due to the lack of reliable evidence , the true meaning of the name is unknown . Nowadays , scholars still debate the meaning of the word and there are a few plausible versions . Since Lietuva has a suffix ( -uva ) , the original word should have no suffix . [ citation needed ] A likely candidate is Liet\u0101 . Because many Baltic ethnonyms originated from hydronyms , linguists have searched for its origin among local hydronyms . Usually , such names evolved through the following process : hydronym \u2192 toponym \u2192 ethnonym . Lietava , a small river not far from Kernav\u0117 , the core area of the early Lithuanian state and a possible first capital of the eventual Grand Duchy of Lithuania , is usually credited as the source of the name . However , the river is very small and some find it improbable that such a small and local object could have lent its name to an entire nation .

The kingdom was a loosely unified nation including the territory of modern-day Norway , modern-day Swedish territory of J\u00e4mtland , Herjedalen , Ranrike and Idre and S\u00e4rna , as well as Norway 's overseas possessions which had been settled by Norwegian seafarers for centuries before being annexed or incorporated into the kingdom as 'tax territories ' . To the North , Norway also bordered extensive tax territories on the mainland . Norway , whose expansionalism starts from the very foundation of the Kingdom in 872 , reached the peak of its power in the years between 1240 and 1319 . At the peak of Norwegian expansion before the civil war ( 1130-1240 ) , Sigurd I led the Norwegian Crusade ( 1107-1110 ) . The crusaders won battles in Lisbon and the Balearic Islands . In the Siege of Sidon they fought alongside Baldwin I and Ordelafo Faliero , and the siege resulted in an expansion of the Kingdom of Jerusalem .

  "/wiki/Bernicia": "Bernicia ( Old English : Bernice , Bryneich , Beornice ; Latin : Bernicia ) was an Anglo-Saxon kingdom established by Anglian settlers of the 6th century in what is now southeastern Scotland and North East England . The Anglian territory of Bernicia was approximately equivalent to the modern English counties of Northumberland and Durham , and the Scottish counties of Berwickshire and East Lothian , stretching from the Forth to the Tees . In the early 7th century , it merged with its southern neighbour , Deira , to form the kingdom of Northumbria and its borders subsequently expanded considerably .",
  "/wiki/Deira": "Deira ( Old English : Derenrice or Dere ) was an Anglo-Saxon kingdom in Northern England . The kingdom was previously inhabited by Britons and was first recorded when Anglian warriors invaded the Derwent Valley in the latter half of the fifth century . Deira 's territory extended from the Humber to the Tees , and from the sea to the western edge of the Vale of York . It later merged with the kingdom of Bernicia , its northern neighbour , to form the kingdom of Northumbria . The name of the kingdom is of Brythonic origin from the Proto-Celtic *daru , meaning oak , ( derw in modern Welsh ) in which case it would mean the people of the Derwent , a derivation also found in the Latin name for Malton , Derventio . It is cognate with the modern Irish doire ( pronounced [ \u02c8d\u032a\u02e0\u025b\u027e\u02e0\u0259 ] ) ; The origin of the name for County Londonderry and city of Derry stems from this word with an oak being featured on the crest of Derry GAA . According to Simeon of Durham ( writing early in the 12th century ) , it extended from the Humber to the Tyne , but the land was waste north of the Tees . After the Brythonic kingdom centred on Eboracum , which may have been called Ebrauc , was taken by King Edwin , the city of Eboracum became its capital , and Eoforwic ( boar-place ) was taken by the Angles . The first Anglian king of Deira of whom we have any record is \u00c6lla , who flourished in the later 6th century after conquering the realm from the Britons in 581 . After his death , Deira was subject to king \u00c6thelfrith of Bernicia , who united the two kingdoms into Northumbria . \u00c6thelfrith ruled until the accession of \u00c6lla 's son Edwin , in 616 or 617 , who also ruled both kingdoms until 633 . Osric , the nephew of Edwin , ruled Deira after Edwin , but his son Oswine was put to death by Oswiu in 651 .",
  "/wiki/Northumbria": "The Kingdom of Northumbria ( /n\u0254\u02d0r\u02c8\u03b8\u028cmbri\u0259/ ; Old English : Nor\u00feanhymbra R\u012b\u010be ; Latin : Regnum Northanhymbrorum ) was a medieval Anglian kingdom in what is now Northern England and south-east Scotland . The name derives from the Old English Nor\u00fean-hymbre meaning the people or province north of the Humber , which reflects the approximate southern limit to the kingdom 's territory , the Humber Estuary . Northumbria started to consolidate into one kingdom in the early seventh century , when the two earlier core territories of Deira and Bernicia entered into a dynastic union . At its height , the kingdom extended from the Humber , Peak District and the River Mersey on the south to the Firth of Forth ( now in Scotland ) on the north . Northumbria ceased to be an independent kingdom in the mid-tenth century , though a rump Earldom of Bamburgh survived around Bernicia in the north , later to be absorbed into the medieval kingdoms of Scotland and England . Today , Northumbria usually refers to a smaller region corresponding to the counties of Northumberland , County Durham and Tyne and Wear in North East England . The term is used in the names of some North East regional institutions , particularly the Northumbria Police ( which covers Northumberland and Tyne and Wear ) , Northumbria University ( based in Newcastle upon Tyne ) , the Northumbria Army Cadet Force , and the regionalist Northumbrian Association . The local Environment Agency office , located in Newcastle Business Park , also uses the term Northumbria to describe its area . However , the term is not the official name for the UK and EU region of North East England .",
  "/wiki/Ebrauc": "The history of York as a city dates to the beginning of the first millennium AD but archaeological evidence for the presence of people in the region of York dates back much further to between 8000 and 7000 BC . As York was a town in Roman times , its Celtic name is recorded in Roman sources ( as Eboracum and Eburacum ) ; after 400 , Angles took over the area and adapted the name by folk etymology to Old English Eoforw\u012bc or Eofor\u012bc , which means wild-boar town or rich in wild-boar . The Vikings , who took over the area later , in turn adapted the name by folk etymology to Norse J\u00f3rv\u00edk meaning horse bay . The modern Welsh name is Efrog . After the Anglian settlement of the North of England , Anglian York was first capital of Deira and later Northumbria , and by the early 7th century , York was an important royal centre for the Northumbrian kings . Following the Norman Conquest of 1066 York was substantially damaged , but in time became an important urban centre as the administrative centre of the county of Yorkshire . York prospered during much of the later medieval era ; the later years of the 14th and the earlier years of the 15th centuries were characterised by particular prosperity . During the English Civil War , the city was regarded as a Royalist stronghold and was besieged and eventually captured by Parliamentary forces under Lord Fairfax in 1644 . After the war , York retained its pre-eminence in the North , and , by 1660 , was the third-largest city in England after London and Norwich . Modern York has 34 Conservation Areas , 2,084 Listed buildings and 22 Scheduled Ancient Monuments in its care . Every year , thousands of tourists come to see the surviving medieval buildings , interspersed with Roman and Viking remains and Georgian architecture .",
