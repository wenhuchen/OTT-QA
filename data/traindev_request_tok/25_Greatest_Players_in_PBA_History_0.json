  "/wiki/Philippine_Basketball_Association_Most_Valuable_Player_award": "The Philippine Basketball Association Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) is an annual Philippine Basketball Association ( PBA ) award given since the start of the league in 1975 to the best performing player of the season . The award is decided using criteria introduced since the 2011-12 season , which include accumulated statistical points , votes from media , players and the league 's Commissioner 's Office . As of April 2019 [ update ] , the current holder of the award is June Mar Fajardo , his fifth consecutive MVP award since 2014 . Note that the league 's seasons have three tournaments ( or conferences ) , so the regular NBA application of having a regular season MVP and a Finals MVP and the meaning of conference does not apply here . The season MVP is for the whole season , including the regular season , the playoffs and the Finals of each Conference , although there is a Best Player of the Conference award for each conference , and a Best Import award for conferences where imports are allowed to play . June Mar Fajardo won the award a record five times from 2013-14 to 2017-18 , while both Ramon Fernandez and Alvin Patrimonio won the award four times . Benjie Paras remains the only rookie to have ever won the award to date , which he did during the 1989 season .
