  "/wiki/Buster_Keaton": "Joseph Frank Keaton ( October 4 , 1895 - February 1 , 1966 ) , known professionally as Buster Keaton , was an American actor , comedian , film director , producer , screenwriter , and stunt performer . He is best known for his silent films , in which his trademark was physical comedy with a consistently stoic , deadpan expression that earned him the nickname The Great Stone Face . Critic Roger Ebert wrote of Keaton 's extraordinary period from 1920 to 1929 when he worked without interruption on a series of films that make him the greatest actor-director in the history of the movies . His career declined afterward with a loss of artistic independence when he signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , his wife divorced him , and he descended into alcoholism . He recovered in the 1940s , remarried , and revived his career as an honored comic performer for the rest of his life , earning an Honorary Academy Award in 1959 . Many of Keaton 's films from the 1920s remain highly regarded , such as Sherlock Jr. ( 1924 ) , The General ( 1926 ) , and The Cameraman ( 1928 ) , with The General widely viewed as his masterpiece . Among its strongest admirers was Orson Welles , who stated that The General was cinema 's highest achievement in comedy , and perhaps the greatest film ever made . Keaton in 1996 was recognized as the seventh-greatest film director by Entertainment Weekly , and the American Film Institute ranked him in 1999 as the 21st greatest male star of classic Hollywood cinema .",
