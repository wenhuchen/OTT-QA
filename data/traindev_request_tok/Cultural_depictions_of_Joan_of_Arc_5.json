  "/wiki/Neo_Geo_(console)": "The Neo Geo ( Japanese : \u30cd\u30aa\u30b8\u30aa , Hepburn : Neojio ) , stylised as NEO\u30fbGEO , also written as NEOGEO , is a cartridge-based arcade system board and fourth-generation home video game console released on April 26 , 1990 , by Japanese game company SNK Corporation . It was the first system in SNK 's Neo Geo family . The Neo Geo was marketed as 24-bit ; its CPU is technically a 16/32-bit 68000-based system with an 8/16-bit Z80 coprocessor , while its GPU chipset has a 24-bit graphics data bus . The Neo Geo originally launched as the MVS ( Multi Video System ) coin-operated arcade machine . The MVS offers owners the ability to put up to six different cartridges into a single cabinet , a unique feature that was also a key economic consideration for operators with limited floorspace , as well as saving money long-term . With its games stored on self-contained cartridges , a game cabinet can be exchanged for a different game title by swapping the game 's ROM cartridge and cabinet artwork . A home console version was also made , called AES ( Advanced Entertainment System ) . It was originally launched as a rental console for video game stores in Japan ( called Neo Geo Rental System ) , with its high price causing SNK not to release it for home use - this was later reversed due to high demand and it came into the market as a luxury console . The AES had the same raw specs as the MVS and had full compatibility , thus managed to bring a true arcade experience to home users . The Neo Geo was revived along with the brand overall in December 2012 through the introduction of the Neo Geo X handheld and home system . The Neo Geo was a very powerful system when released , more powerful than any video game console at the time , and many arcade systems such as rival Capcom 's CPS , which did not surpass it until the CP System II in 1993 . The Neo Geo MVS was a success during the 1990s due to the cabinet 's low cost , six ROM slots , and compact size .",

  "/wiki/Knights_Templar": "The Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon ( Latin : Pauperes commilitones Christi Templique Salomonici ) , also known as the Order of Solomon 's Temple , the Knights Templar or simply the Templars , were a Catholic military order founded in 1119 and recognised in 1139 by the papal bull Omne datum optimum . The order was active until 1312 when it was perpetually suppressed by Pope Clement V by the bull Vox in excelso . The Templars became a favoured charity throughout Christendom and grew rapidly in membership and power . They were prominent in Christian finance . Templar knights , in their distinctive white mantles with a red cross , were among the most skilled fighting units of the Crusades . Non-combatant members of the order , who made up as much as 90% of their members , managed a large economic infrastructure throughout Christendom , developing innovative financial techniques that were an early form of banking , building its own network of nearly 1,000 commanderies and fortifications across Europe and the Holy Land , and arguably forming the world 's first multinational corporation . The Templars were closely tied to the Crusades ; when the Holy Land was lost , support for the order faded . Rumours about the Templars ' secret initiation ceremony created distrust , and King Philip IV of France - deeply in debt to the order - took advantage of this distrust to destroy them and erase his debt . In 1307 , he had many of the order 's members in France arrested , tortured into giving false confessions , and burned at the stake . Pope Clement V disbanded the order in 1312 under pressure from King Philip . The abrupt reduction in power of a significant group in European society gave rise to speculation , legend , and legacy through the ages .",

  "/wiki/Downloadable_content": "Downloadable content ( DLC ) is additional content created for an already released video game , distributed through the Internet by the game 's publisher . It can either be added for no extra cost or it can be a form of video game monetization , enabling the publisher to gain additional revenue from a title after it has been purchased , often using some type of microtransaction system . DLC can range from cosmetic content , such as skins , to new in-game content such as characters , levels , modes , and larger expansions that may contain a mix of such content as a continuation of the base game . In some games , multiple DLC ( including future DLC not yet released ) may be bundled as part of a season pass - typically at a discount in comparison to purchasing each DLC individually . While the Dreamcast was the first home console to support DLC ( albeit in a limited form due to hardware and internet connection limitations ) , Microsoft 's Xbox console and Xbox Live platform helped to popularize the concept . Since the seventh generation of video game consoles , DLC has been a prevalent feature of most major video game platforms with internet connectivity .",
