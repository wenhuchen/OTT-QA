  "/wiki/Caliber": "In guns , particularly firearms , caliber ( or calibre in British English ) is the specified nominal internal diameter of the gun barrel bore regardless of how or where the bore is measured and whether or not the finished bore matches that specification . It is measured in inches to an accuracy of hundredths or thousandths of an inch or in millimeters . For example , a .45 caliber firearm has a barrel diameter of roughly 0.45 inches ( 11 mm ) . Barrel diameters can also be expressed using metric dimensions . For example , a 9 mm pistol has a barrel diameter of about 9 millimeters . Due to the inaccuracy and imprecision of imperial dimensions converted to metric units , metric designations are typically far out of specifications published in decimal inches . True caliber specifications require imperial measure , and even when cartridge designations ( often mistakenly referred to as caliber ) only specify caliber to even tenths or hundredths of an inch , actual barrel/chamber/projectile dimensions are published to at least thousandths of an inch and frequently tolerances extend into ten-thousandths of an inch . In a rifled barrel , the distance is measured between opposing lands or between opposing grooves ; groove measurements are common in cartridge designations originating in the United States , while land measurements are more common elsewhere in the world . Measurements across the grooves are used for maximum precision because rifling and the specific caliber so-measured is the result of final machining process which cuts grooves into the rough bore leaving the lands behind . Good performance requires a concentric , straight bore that accurately centers the projectile within , in preference to a tight fit which can be achieved even with off-center , crooked bores that cause excessive friction , fouling and an out-of-balance , wobbling projectile in flight . While modern firearms are generally referred to by the name of the cartridge the gun is chambered for , they are still categorized together based on bore diameter . For example , a firearm might be described as a 30 caliber rifle , which could be any of a wide range of cartridges using a roughly 0.30 inches ( 7.6 mm ) projectile ; or a 22 rimfire , referring to any rimfire firearms firing cartridges with a .22 caliber projectile .",

Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States .

  "/wiki/Wiard_rifle": "The Wiard rifle refers to several weapons invented by Norman Wiard , most commonly a semi-steel light artillery piece in six-pounder and twelve-pounder calibers . About 60 were manufactured between 1861 and 1862 during the American Civil War , at O'Donnell 's Foundry , New York City : although apparently excellent weapons , [ they ] do not seem to have been very popular . Wiard also designed a rifled steel version of the Dahlgren boat howitzer ( a 12-pounder ( 5.44 kg ) weapon with a 3.4 in ( 86 mm ) bore ) , among other gun types . Further , Wiard unsuccessfully attempted to develop a 15 in ( 381 mm ) rifled gun for the US Navy and proposed a 20 in ( 510 mm ) gun . In 1881 he unsuccessfully proposed various combined rifle and smoothbore weapon conversions of Rodman guns and Parrott rifles . Wiard described two calibers : a six-pounder ( 2.72 kg ) rifle with a 2.6 in ( 66 mm ) bore , and a twelve-pounder ( 5.44 kg ) smoothbore weapon with a 3.67 in ( 93 mm ) bore . All survivors are rifled , though this may have occurred long after manufacture ; this was a common practice during the war . Surviving Wiard guns vary considerably in manufacturing details and markings . Documentation survives for orders of 45 6-pounder Wiards , six 12-pounder 3.67 in ( 93 mm ) Wiards ( though at least 13 survive ) , and 12 12-pounder 3.4 in ( 86 mm ) Wiard rifled howitzers .",

  "/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America": "The Confederate States of America ( CSA or C.S . ) - commonly referred to as the Confederacy - was an unrecognized republic in North America that existed from 1861 to 1865 . The Confederacy was originally formed by seven secessionist slave-holding states - South Carolina , Mississippi , Florida , Alabama , Georgia , Louisiana , and Texas - in the Lower South region of the United States , whose economy was heavily dependent upon agriculture , particularly cotton , and a plantation system that relied upon the labor of African-American slaves . Convinced that the institution of slavery was threatened by the November 1860 election of Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln to the U.S. presidency on a platform which opposed the expansion of slavery into the western territories , the Confederacy declared its secession in rebellion against the United States , with the loyal states becoming known as the Union during the ensuing American Civil War . Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens described its ideology as being centrally based upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man ; that slavery , subordination to the superior race , is his natural and normal condition . Before Lincoln took office in March , a new Confederate government was established in February 1861 which was considered illegal by the government of the United States . States volunteered militia units , and the new government hastened to form its own Confederate States Army from nothing practically overnight . After the American Civil War began in April , four slave states of the Upper South - Virginia , Arkansas , Tennessee , and North Carolina - also seceded and joined the Confederacy . The Confederacy later accepted Missouri and Kentucky as members , although neither officially declared secession nor were they ever largely controlled by Confederate forces ; Confederate shadow governments attempted to control the two states but were later exiled from them . The government of the United States ( the Union ) rejected the claims of secession , considering it illegitimate . The war began April 12 , 1861 , when the Confederates attacked Fort Sumter , a Union fort in the harbor of Charleston , South Carolina . No foreign government ever officially recognized the Confederacy as an independent country , although Great Britain and France granted it belligerent status , which allowed Confederate agents to contract with private concerns for arms and other supplies .",

  "/wiki/Somerset_cannon": "The Somerset cannon was a British cannon designed within the Admiralty and manufactured by Armstrong 's . Its genesis was the unexpected failure of the Armstrong breech-loading rifles recently developed and installed on Royal Navy ships . The Somerset was a 6.5 ton 9.2-inch calibre smoothbore muzzle-loader , firing a 100-pound shot . With a charge of 33 pounds of gunpowder , a steel shot could penetrate 5.5 inches of armour at 800 yards . Providing a mounting which could reliably be worked at sea proved difficult for a piece of this size . Traditional truck carriages were inadequate ; historical research revealed that a carriage which was suitable had been suggested by Captain Sir Thomas Hardy ( Nelson 's Flag Captain ) many years before . In this system the gun-carriage remained stationary , and the recoil of the gun was absorbed by a system of sliding friction blocks attached to the carriage and to the gun . The gun was issued for service , and was mounted in HM Ships Achilles , Research , Favorite and Enterprise , but its performance was so poor , largely due to difficulties in controlling the gun , that it was withdrawn from service .",
