It may signify a remarkable accomplishment of humanity , and serve as evidence of our intellectual history on the planet . The sites are intended for practical conservation for posterity , which otherwise would be subject to risk from human or animal trespassing , unmonitored/uncontrolled/unrestricted access , or threat from local administrative negligence . Sites are demarcated by UNESCO as protected zones . The list is maintained by the international World Heritage Program administered by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee , composed of 21 states parties that are elected by their General Assembly . The programme catalogues , names , and conserves sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common culture and heritage of humanity . Under certain conditions , listed sites can obtain funds from the World Heritage Fund . The programme began with the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World 's Cultural and Natural Heritage , which was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO on 16 November 1972 . Since then , 193 state parties have ratified the convention , making it one of the most widely recognised international agreements and the world 's most popular cultural programme .
