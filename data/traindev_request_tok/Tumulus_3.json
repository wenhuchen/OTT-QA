The heavily industrialized region was economically valuable , due to the wealth of its coal deposits and location on the border between France and Germany . Saarland was returned to Nazi Germany in the 1935 Saar status referendum , becoming de jure part of Bavaria and de facto part of Gau Westmark . Following World War II , the French military administration in Allied-occupied Germany organized the territory as the Saar Protectorate from 1947 , becoming a protectorate of France , and between 1950 and 1956 was a member of the Council of Europe . Saarland rejected the 1955 Saar Statute referendum and joined the Federal Republic of Germany as a state on 1 January 1957 .
