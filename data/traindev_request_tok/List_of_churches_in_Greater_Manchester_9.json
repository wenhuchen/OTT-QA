  "/wiki/Christian_denomination": "A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity , identified by traits such as a name , organization , leadership and doctrine . The Roman Catholic Church , Eastern Orthodox Church , and Oriental Orthodoxy , meaning the large majority , all self-describe as churches , whereas many Protestant denominations self-describe as congregations or fellowships . Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine ; issues such as the nature of Jesus , the authority of apostolic succession , ecclesiology , eschatology , and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another . Groups of denominations - often sharing broadly similar beliefs , practices , and historical ties - are sometimes known as branches of Christianity . These branches differ in many ways , especially through differences in practices and belief . Individual denominations vary widely in the degree to which they recognize one another . Several groups claim to be the direct and sole authentic successor of the church founded by Jesus Christ in the 1st century AD . Others , however , believe in denominationalism , where some or all Christian groups are legitimate churches of the same religion regardless of their distinguishing labels , beliefs , and practices . Because of this concept , some Christian bodies reject the term denomination to describe themselves , to avoid implying equivalency with other churches or denominations . The Roman Catholic Church , which has over 1.3 billion members - slightly over half of all Christians worldwide - does not view itself as a denomination , but as the original pre-denominational church , a view rejected by other Christians . Protestant denominations account for approximately 37 percent of Christians worldwide . Together , Catholicism and Protestantism ( including Anglicanism , and other denominations sharing historical ties ) comprise Western Christianity .",

The Maypole Colliery Disaster in 1908 resulted in 75 deaths and profoundly changed the character of the village .

From the 17th century , for about 300 years , Atherton was known as Chowbent , which was frequently shortened to Bent , the town 's old nickname . Atherton was associated with coal mining and nail manufacture from the 14th century , encouraged by outcropping coal seams . At the beginning of the 20th century the town was described as the centre of a district of collieries , cotton mills and iron-works , which cover the surface of the country with their inartistic buildings and surroundings , and are linked together by the equally unlovely dwellings of the people . Atherton 's last deep coal mine closed in 1966 , and the last working cotton mills closed in 1999 . Today the town is the third largest retail centre in the Borough of Wigan ; almost 20% of those employed in the area work in the wholesale and retail trades , although there is still some significant manufacturing industry in the town . Evidence has been discovered of a Roman road passing through the area , on the ancient route between Coccium ( Wigan ) and Mamucium ( Manchester ) .

  "/wiki/Unitarianism": "Unitarianism ( from Latin unitas unity , oneness , from unus one ) is a Christian theological movement named for its belief that the God in Christianity is one person , as opposed to the Trinity ( tri- from Latin tres three ) which in most other branches of Christianity defines God as one being in three persons : the Father , Son , and Holy Spirit . Unitarian Christians , therefore , believe that Jesus was inspired by God in his moral teachings , and he is a savior , but he was not a deity or God incarnate . As is typical of dissenters , Unitarianism does not constitute one single Christian denomination , but rather refers to a collection of both existing and extinct Christian groups , whether historically related to each other or not , which share a common theological concept of the oneness nature of God . While the uncompromising theological monotheism at the heart of Christian Unitarianism distinguishes it from the major Christian denominations which subscribe to Trinitarian theology , Christian Unitarianism is closer to the monotheistic understandings of God in Judaism , as well as the concept of the oneness of God in Islam . More so , Muslims believe that Christian Unitarianism encompasses the one true monotheistic divine message from God , perpetuated through the Abrahamic faiths that predated Islam . Unitarianism is also known for the rejection of several other Western Christian doctrines , including the doctrines of original sin , predestination , and the infallibility of the Bible . Unitarians in previous centuries accepted the doctrine of punishment in an eternal hell , but few do today . Unitarianism might be considered a part of Protestantism , depending on one 's stance or viewpoint , and some exclude it from that term due to its rejection of the Trinity . Despite common origins during the Protestant Reformation , some scholars call it a part of Nontrinitarianism , while others consider it both Protestant and Nontrinitarian , seeing no contradiction between those two terms . None of the three views is universally accepted . The Unitarian movement is tied to the more radical critiques of the Reformation . First organized in Eastern Europe during the Reformation , Unitarian communities have developed in Britain , South Africa , India , Canada , the United States , Jamaica , Nigeria , and Japan .",

The first town hall was built in King Street and replaced by the present building in 1907 . Originally an agricultural area noted for dairy farming , domestic spinning and weaving led to a considerable silk and , in the 20th century , cotton industry .
