The Heian period is also considered the peak of the Japanese imperial court and noted for its art , especially poetry and literature . Although the Imperial House of Japan had power on the surface , the real power was in the hands of the Fujiwara clan , a powerful aristocratic family who had intermarried with the imperial family .

The outer layer of cultured pearls and the inside layer of pearl oyster and freshwater pearl mussel shells are made of nacre . Other mollusc families that have a nacreous inner shell layer include marine gastropods such as the Haliotidae , the Trochidae and the Turbinidae .",

  "/wiki/Sutra": "Sutra ( Sanskrit : \u0938\u0942\u0924\u094d\u0930 , romanized : s\u016btra , lit . 'string , thread ' ) in Indian literary traditions refers to an aphorism or a collection of aphorisms in the form of a manual or , more broadly , a condensed manual or text . Sutras are a genre of ancient and medieval Indian texts found in Hinduism , Buddhism and Jainism . In Hinduism , sutras are a distinct type of literary composition , a compilation of short aphoristic statements . Each sutra is any short rule , like a theorem distilled into few words or syllables , around which teachings of ritual , philosophy , grammar , or any field of knowledge can be woven . The oldest sutras of Hinduism are found in the Brahmana and Aranyaka layers of the Vedas . Every school of Hindu philosophy , Vedic guides for rites of passage , various fields of arts , law , and social ethics developed respective sutras , which help teach and transmit ideas from one generation to the next . In Buddhism , sutras , also known as suttas , are canonical scriptures , many of which are regarded as records of the oral teachings of Gautama Buddha . They are not aphoristic , but are quite detailed , sometimes with repetition . This may reflect a philological root of sukta ( well spoken ) , rather than sutra ( thread ) . In Jainism , sutras also known as suyas are canonical sermons of Mahavira contained in the Jain Agamas as well as some later ( post-canonical ) normative texts .",
  "/wiki/Maki-e": "Maki-e ( \u8494\u7d75 , literally : sprinkled picture ) is Japanese lacquer sprinkled with gold or silver powder as a decoration using a makizutsu or a kebo brush . The oldest Maki-e in existence now is the ornamentation on the sheath of the Kara-tachi sword with gilded silver fittings and inlay in Togidashi technique held by Sh\u014ds\u014din in Nara , Japan . Originally the sword was treasured by the Emperor Sh\u014dmu ( 701 - June 4 , 756 ) The technique was developed mainly in the Heian period ( 794-1185 ) and blossomed in the Edo period ( 1603-1868 ) . Maki-e objects were initially designed as household items for court nobles ; they soon gained more popularity and were adopted by royal families and military leaders as a symbol of power . To create different colours and textures , maki-e artists use a variety of metal powders including gold , silver , copper , brass , lead , aluminum , platinum , and pewter , as well as their alloys . Bamboo tubes and soft brushes of various sizes are used for laying powders and drawing fine lines . As it requires highly skilled craftsmanship to produce a maki-e painting , young artists usually go through many years of training to develop the skills and to ultimately become maki-e masters . K\u014dami D\u014dch\u014d ( 1410-1478 ) was the first lacquer master linked to specific works . His maki-e works used designs from various Japanese contemporary painters . K\u014dami and another maki-e master , Igarashi Shinsai , were originators of the two major schools of lacquer-making in the history of Japan . Takamakie ( or raised maki-e ) is one of the three major techniques in maki-e making . Developed in the Muromachi period ( 1336-1573 ) , the technique of takamakie involves building up design patterns above the surface through a mixture of metal powder , lacquer , and charcoal or clay dust .",

It was preceded by the Sui dynasty and followed by the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period in Chinese history . Historians generally regard the Tang as a high point in Chinese civilization , and a golden age of cosmopolitan culture . Tang territory , acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers , rivaled that of the Han dynasty . The Tang capital at Chang'an ( present-day Xi'an ) was the most populous city in the world in its day . The L\u01d0 family ( \u674e ) founded the dynasty , seizing power during the decline and collapse of the Sui Empire . The dynasty was interrupted for 15 years when Empress Wu Zetian seized the throne , proclaiming the Wu Zhou dynasty and becoming the only legitimate Chinese empress regnant . In two censuses of the 7th and 8th centuries , the Tang records estimated the population by number of registered households at about 50 million people . Yet , even when the central government was breaking down and unable to compile an accurate census of the population in the 9th century , it is estimated that the population had grown by then to about 80 million people . [ b ] With its large population base , the dynasty was able to raise professional and conscripted armies of hundreds of thousands of troops to contend with nomadic powers in dominating Inner Asia and the lucrative trade-routes along the Silk Road .

The temple was founded by Prince Sh\u014dtoku in 607 , but according to the Nihon Shoki , in 670 all buildings were burned down by lightning . However , reconstructed at least 1,300 years ago , the Kond\u014d ( main holl ) is widely recognized as the world 's oldest wooden building . A fire that broke out during the dismantling and repair of Kondo in January 26 , 1949 destroyed a mural of the Asuka period , a national treasure , and shocked the Japanese . Based on this accident , the day when the fire broke out is now fire prevention day for cultural properties . In 1993 , Horyu-ji Temple , along with Hokki-ji , was registered as Japan 's first UNESCO World Heritage site under the name of Buddhist Monuments in the H\u014dry\u016b-ji Area . A tree ring survey conducted in 2001 revealed that the shinbashira of the five-story Pagoda were cut down in 594 , before burned down in 670 .",
