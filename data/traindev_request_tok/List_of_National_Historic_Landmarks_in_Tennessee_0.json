  "/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee": "Memphis is a city located along the Mississippi River in southwestern Shelby County , Tennessee , United States . The 2018 city population was 650,618 , making Memphis the largest city on the Mississippi River , the second most populous city in Tennessee , as well as the 26th largest city in the United States . Greater Memphis is the 42nd largest metropolitan area in the United States , with a population of 1,348,260 in 2017 . The city is the anchor of West Tennessee and the greater Mid-South region , which includes portions of neighboring Arkansas and Mississippi . Memphis is the seat of Shelby County , the most populous county in Tennessee . As one of the more historic and culturally significant cities of the southern United States , the city features a wide variety of landscapes and distinct neighborhoods . The first European explorer to visit the area of present-day Memphis was Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto in 1541 with his expedition into the New World . The high Chickasaw Bluffs protecting the location from the waters of the Mississippi would then be contested between the Spanish , French , and the English as Memphis took shape . Modern Memphis was founded in 1819 by three prominent Americans : John Overton , James Winchester , and future president Andrew Jackson . Memphis grew into one of the largest cities of the Antebellum South as a market for agricultural goods , natural resources like lumber , and the American slave trade . After the American Civil War and the end of slavery , the city experienced even faster growth into the 20th century as it became among the largest world markets for cotton and lumber . Home to Tennessee 's largest African-American population , Memphis played a prominent role in the American civil rights movement and was the site of Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. 's 1968 assassination .",

  "/wiki/Blues": "Blues is a music genre and musical form which was originated in the Deep South of the United States around the 1870s by African-Americans from roots in African musical traditions , African-American work songs , and spirituals . Blues incorporated spirituals , work songs , field hollers , shouts , chants , and rhymed simple narrative ballads . The blues form , ubiquitous in jazz , rhythm and blues and rock and roll , is characterized by the call-and-response pattern , the blues scale and specific chord progressions , of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common . Blue notes ( or worried notes ) , usually thirds , fifths or sevenths flattened in pitch are also an essential part of the sound . Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove . Blues as a genre is also characterized by its lyrics , bass lines , and instrumentation . Early traditional blues verses consisted of a single line repeated four times . It was only in the first decades of the 20th century that the most common current structure became standard : the AAB pattern , consisting of a line sung over the four first bars , its repetition over the next four , and then a longer concluding line over the last bars . Early blues frequently took the form of a loose narrative , often relating the racial discrimination and other challenges experienced by African-Americans . Many elements , such as the call-and-response format and the use of blue notes , can be traced back to the music of Africa . The origins of the blues are also closely related to the religious music of the Afro-American community , the spirituals . The first appearance of the blues is often dated to after the ending of slavery and , later , the development of juke joints .",
  "/wiki/Music": "Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time . General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch ( which governs melody and harmony ) , rhythm ( and its associated concepts tempo , meter , and articulation ) , dynamics ( loudness and softness ) , and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture ( which are sometimes termed the color of a musical sound ) . Different styles or types of music may emphasize , de-emphasize or omit some of these elements . Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping ; there are solely instrumental pieces , solely vocal pieces ( such as songs without instrumental accompaniment ) and pieces that combine singing and instruments . The word derives from Greek \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae ( mousike ; art of the Muses ) . See glossary of musical terminology . In its most general form , the activities describing music as an art form or cultural activity include the creation of works of music ( songs , tunes , symphonies , and so on ) , the criticism of music , the study of the history of music , and the aesthetic examination of music . Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies . Common sayings such as the harmony of the spheres and it is music to my ears point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to . However , 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music , saying , for example , There is no noise , only sound . The creation , performance , significance , and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context . Indeed , throughout history , some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as not being music , including Beethoven 's Grosse Fuge string quartet in 1825 , early jazz in the beginning of the 1900s and hardcore punk in the 1980s .",
  "/wiki/African_American_music": "African-American music is an umbrella term covering a diverse range of music and musical genres largely developed by African Americans . Their origins are in musical forms that arose out of the historical condition of slavery that characterized the lives of African Americans prior to the American Civil War . Following the Civil War , black Americans , through employment as musicians playing European music in military bands , developed a new style of music called ragtime which gradually evolved into jazz . In developing this latter musical form , African Americans contributed knowledge of the sophisticated polyrhythmic structure of the dance and folk music of peoples across western and sub-Saharan Africa . These musical forms had a wide-ranging influence on the development of music within the United States and around the world during the 20th century . The modern genres of blues and ragtime were developed during the late 19th century by fusing West African vocalizations - which employed the natural harmonic series , and blue notes . The earliest jazz and blues recordings were made in the 1920s . African-American musicians developed related styles such as rhythm and blues in the 1940s . In the 1960s , soul performers had a major influence on white US and UK singers . In the mid-1960s , Black musicians developed funk and they were many of the leading figures in late 1960s and 1970s genre of jazz-rock fusion . In the 1970s and 1980s , Black artists developed hip-hop , and in the 1980s introduced the disco-infused dance style known as house music .

American music is heard around the world . Since the beginning of the 20th century , some forms of American popular music have gained a near-global audience . Native Americans were the earliest inhabitants of the land that is today known as the United States and played its first music . Beginning in the 17th century , immigrants from the United Kingdom , Ireland , Spain , Germany , and France began arriving in large numbers , bringing with them new styles and instruments . African slaves brought their own musical traditions , and each subsequent wave of immigrants contributed to a melting pot . Much of modern popular music has roots in the emergence in the late 19th century of African American blues and the growth of gospel music in the 1920s . The African American basis for popular music used elements derived from European and indigenous musics . There are also strong African roots in the music tradition of the original white settlers , such as country and bluegrass . The United States has also seen documented folk music and recorded popular music produced in the ethnic styles of the Ukrainian , Irish , Scottish , Polish , Hispanic , and Jewish communities , among others .",

Blount , also a signer of the United States Constitution and a U.S . Senator from Tennessee , lived on the property with his family and ten African-American slaves . The mansion served as the de facto capitol of the Southwest Territory . In 1796 , much of the Tennessee Constitution was drafted in Governor Blount 's office at the mansion . Tennessee state historian John Trotwood Moore once called Blount Mansion the most important historical spot in Tennessee . The house is a wood-frame home sheathed in wood siding , built with materials brought from North Carolina in an era when most homes in Tennessee were log cabins . The two-story central portion of the home is the oldest section .

Knoxville is the principal city of the Knoxville Metropolitan Statistical Area , which was 868,546 in 2015 . First settled in 1786 , Knoxville was the first capital of Tennessee . The city struggled with geographic isolation throughout the early 19th century . The arrival of the railroad in 1855 led to an economic boom . During the Civil War , the city was bitterly divided over the secession issue , and was occupied alternately by both Confederate and Union armies . Following the war , Knoxville grew rapidly as a major wholesaling and manufacturing center . The city 's economy stagnated after the 1920s as the manufacturing sector collapsed , the downtown area declined and city leaders became entrenched in highly partisan political fights .

He was a member of the North Carolina delegation at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 , and led efforts in North Carolina to ratify the Constitution in 1789 at Fayetteville . He subsequently served as the only governor of the Southwest Territory and played a leading role in helping the territory gain admission to the Union as the State of Tennessee . He was selected as one of Tennessee 's initial U.S. senators in 1796 . Born to a prominent North Carolina family , Blount served as a paymaster during the American Revolutionary War . He was elected to the North Carolina legislature in 1781 , where he remained in one role or another for most of the decade , the exception being two terms in the Continental Congress in 1782 and 1786 . Blount pushed efforts in the legislature to open the lands west of the Appalachians to settlement . As governor of the Southwest Territory , he negotiated the Treaty of Holston in 1791 , bringing thousands of acres of Indian lands under U.S. control . An aggressive land speculator , Blount gradually acquired millions of acres in Tennessee and the trans-Appalachian west . His risky land investments left him in debt , and in the 1790s , he conspired with Great Britain to seize the Spanish-controlled Louisiana in hopes of boosting western land prices . When the conspiracy was uncovered in 1797 , he was expelled from the Senate and became the first federal official to face impeachment .

A unicameral body with legislative and executive function , it was composed of delegates appointed by the legislatures of the several states . Each state delegation had one vote . It was preceded by the Second Continental Congress ( 1775-1781 ) and was created by the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union in 1781 . The Congress continued to refer itself as the Continental Congress throughout its eight-year history , although modern historians separate it from the two earlier congresses , which operated under slightly different rules and procedures until the later part of American Revolutionary War . The membership of the Second Continental Congress automatically carried over to the Congress of the Confederation when the latter was created by the ratification of the Articles of Confederation , and had the same secretary as the Second Continental Congress , Charles Thomson .

Although the Convention was intended to revise the league of states and first system of government under the Articles of Confederation , the intention from the outset of many of its proponents , chief among them James Madison of Virginia and Alexander Hamilton of New York , was to create a new government rather than fix the existing one . The delegates elected George Washington of Virginia , former commanding general of the Continental Army in the late American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) and proponent of a stronger national government , to become President of the Convention . The result of the Convention was the creation of the Constitution of the United States , placing the Convention among the most significant events in American history . At the time , the convention was not referred to as a Constitutional convention , nor did most of the delegates arrive intending to draft a new constitution . Many assumed that the purpose of the convention was to discuss and draft improvements to the existing Articles of Confederation , and would have not agreed to participate otherwise . Once the Convention began , however , most of the delegates - though not all - came to agree in general terms that the goal would be a new system of government , not simply a revised version of the Articles of Confederation . Several broad outlines were proposed and debated , most notably James Madison 's Virginia Plan and William Paterson 's New Jersey Plan . The Virginia Plan was selected as the basis for the new government . While the concept of a federal government with three branches ( legislative , executive , and judicial ) and the general role of each branch was not heavily disputed , several issues delayed further progress and put the success of the Convention in doubt . The most contentious disputes revolved around the composition and election of the Senate as the upper legislative house of a bicameral Congress ; whether proportional representation was to be defined by a state 's geography or by its population , and whether slaves were to be counted ; whether to divide the executive power among three people or vest the power in a single chief executive to be called the President ; how a president would be elected , for what term , and whether to limit each president to a single term in office ; what offenses should be impeachable ; the nature of a fugitive slave clause , and whether to allow the abolition of the slave trade ; and whether judges should be chosen by the legislature or the executive .

  "/wiki/Governor": "A governor is , in most cases , a public official with the power to govern the executive branch of a non-sovereign or sub-national level of government , ranking under the head of state . In federations , governor may be the title of a politician who governs a constituent state and may be either appointed or elected . The power of the individual governor can vary dramatically between political systems , with some governors having only nominal or largely ceremonial power , while others having a complete control over the entire government . Historically , the title can also apply to the executive officials acting as representatives of a chartered company which has been granted exercise of sovereignty in a colonial area , such as the British East India Company or the Dutch East India Company . These companies operate as a major state within a state with its own armed forces . There can also be non-political governors : high-ranking officials in private or similar governance such as commercial and non-profit management , styled governor ( s ) , who simply govern an institution , such as a corporation or a bank . For example , in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries , there are prison governors ( wardens in the United States ) , school governors and bank governors . The adjective pertaining to a governor is gubernatorial , from the Latin root gubernare . The historical female form is governess , though female officials are referred to by the gender-neutral form governor ( without the gender specific suffix ) of the noun to avoid confusion with other meanings of the term .",

State citizenship and residency are flexible , and no government approval is required to move between states , except for persons restricted by certain types of court orders ( such as paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody ) . States are divided into counties or county-equivalents , which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign .

  "/wiki/Archaeology": "Archaeology , or archeology , is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture . The archaeological record consists of artifacts , architecture , biofacts or ecofacts and cultural landscapes . Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities . In Europe it is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines , while in North America archaeology is a sub-field of anthropology . Archaeologists study human prehistory and history , from the development of the first stone tools at Lomekwi in East Africa 3.3 million years ago up until recent decades . Archaeology is distinct from palaeontology , which is the study of fossil remains . It is particularly important for learning about prehistoric societies , for whom there may be no written records to study . Prehistory includes over 99% of the human past , from the Paleolithic until the advent of literacy in societies across the world . Archaeology has various goals , which range from understanding culture history to reconstructing past lifeways to documenting and explaining changes in human societies through time . The discipline involves surveying , excavation and eventually analysis of data collected to learn more about the past . In broad scope , archaeology relies on cross-disciplinary research .

  "/wiki/Mississippian_culture": "The Mississippian culture was a mound-building Native American civilization that flourished in what is now the Midwestern , Eastern , and Southeastern United States from approximately 800 to 1600 , varying regionally . It was composed of a series of urban settlements and satellite villages ( suburbs ) linked together by loose trading networks . The largest city was Cahokia , believed to be a major religious center . The Mississippian way of life began to develop in the Mississippi River Valley ( for which it is named ) . Cultures in the tributary Tennessee River Valley may have also begun to develop Mississippian characteristics at this point . Almost all dated Mississippian sites predate 1539-1540 ( when Hernando de Soto explored the area ) , with notable exceptions being Natchez communities that maintained Mississippian cultural practices into the 18th century .",

  "/wiki/Human": "Humans ( Homo sapiens ) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina . Together with chimpanzees , gorillas , and orangutans , they are part of the family Hominidae ( the great apes , or hominids ) . Terrestrial animals , humans are characterized by their erect posture and bipedal locomotion ; high manual dexterity and heavy tool use compared to other animals ; open-ended and complex language use compared to other animal communications ; larger , more complex brains than other animals ; and highly advanced and organized societies . Early hominins - particularly the australopithecines , whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes - are less often referred to as human than hominins of the genus Homo . Several of these hominins used fire , occupied much of Eurasia , and the lineage that gave rise to Homo sapiens is thought to have diverged in Africa around 500,000 years ago , with the earliest fossil evidence of evidence of early Homo sapiens appearing ( also in Africa ) around 300,000 years ago . The oldest early H. sapiens fossils were found in Jebel Irhoud , Morocco dating to about 315,000 years ago . Discovered in 1967 , Omo-Kibish I ( Omo I ) from southern Ethiopia is , as of 2017 [ update ] , the oldest anatomically modern Homo sapiens skeleton currently known ( 196 \u00b1 5 ka ) . Humans began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity at least by about 100,000-70,000 years ago and ( according to recent evidence ) as far back as around 300,000 years ago , in the Middle Stone Age , with some features of behavioral modernity possibly beginning earlier , and possibly in parallel with evolutionary brain globularization in H. sapiens . In several waves of migration , H. sapiens ventured out of Africa and populated most of the world . The spread of the large and increasing population of humans has profoundly affected much of the biosphere and millions of species worldwide . Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a larger brain with a well-developed neocortex , prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes , which enable advanced abstract reasoning , language , problem solving , sociality , and culture through social learning . Humans use tools more frequently and effectively than any other animal : they are the only extant species to build fires , cook food , clothe themselves , and create and use numerous other technologies and arts .",

  "/wiki/Fort_Loudoun_(Tennessee)": "Fort Loudoun was a British colonial-era fort located in what is now Monroe County , Tennessee , United States . Built in 1756 and 1757 to help garner Cherokee support for the British at the outset of the Seven Years ' War , the fort was one of the first significant British outposts west of the Appalachian Mountains . The fort was designed by John William G. De Brahm , its construction was supervised by Captain Raymond Demer\u00e9 , and its garrison was commanded by Demer\u00e9 's brother , Paul Demer\u00e9 . It was named for the Earl of Loudoun , the commander of British forces in North America at the time . Relations between the garrison of Fort Loudoun and the local Cherokee inhabitants were initially cordial , but soured in 1758 due to hostilities between Cherokee fighters and European settlers in Virginia and South Carolina . After the massacre of several Cherokee chiefs who were being held hostage at Fort Prince George , the Cherokee laid siege to Fort Loudoun in March 1760 . The fort 's garrison held out for several months , but diminishing supplies forced its surrender in August 1760 . Hostile Cherokees attacked the fort 's garrison as it marched back to South Carolina , killing more than two dozen and taking most of the survivors prisoner . The fall of Fort Loudoun led to an invasion of Cherokee territory by General James Grant and an important peace expedition to the Overhill country by Henry Timberlake . The fort was reconstructed in the 20th century based on the detailed descriptions of its design by De Brahm and Demer\u00e9 , and excavations conducted by the Works Progress Administration , the Fort Loudoun Association , and the Tennessee Division of Archaeology .

  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain": "The Kingdom of Great Britain , officially called Great Britain , was a sovereign state in Western Europe from 1 May 1707 to 1 January 1801 . The state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706 , ratified by the Acts of Union 1707 , which united the kingdoms of England ( which included Wales ) and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands , with the exception of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands . The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster . The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI of Scotland became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Elizabeth I , bringing about the Union of the Crowns . Since its inception , the kingdom was in legislative and personal union with the Kingdom of Ireland . Following the accession of George I to the throne of Great Britain in 1714 , the kingdom was in a personal union with the Electorate of Hanover . The early years of the newly-united kingdom were marked by Jacobite risings , which ended in defeat for the Stuart cause at the Battle of Culloden in 1746 . In 1763 , victory in the Seven Years ' War led to the dominance of the British Empire , which was to become the foremost global power for over a century , slowly growing to become the largest empire in history . From the mid-1750s , the Kingdom came to dominate the Indian subcontinent through the aggressive expansion of the East India Trading Company , and until suffering defeat in the American War of Independence , it claimed vast swaths of the North American continent through its burgeoning American colonies . The Kingdom of Great Britain was replaced by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on 1 January 1801 with the Acts of Union 1800 .",
  "/wiki/French_and_Indian_War": "The French and Indian War ( 1754-1763 ) pitted the colonies of British America against those of New France , each side supported by military units from the parent country and by American indigenous allies . At the start of the war , the French colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 settlers , compared with 2 million in the British colonies . The outnumbered French particularly depended on the Indians . The European nations declared a wider war upon one another overseas in 1756 , two years into the French and Indian war , and some view the French and Indian War as being merely the American theater of the worldwide Seven Years ' War of 1756-63 ; however , the French and Indian War is viewed in the United States as a singular conflict which was not associated with any European war . French Canadians call it Guerre de la Conqu\u00eate ( War of the Conquest ) The British colonists were supported at various times by the Iroquois , Catawba , and Cherokee tribes , and the French colonists were supported by Wabanaki Confederacy member tribes Abenaki and Mi'kmaq , and the Algonquin , Lenape , Ojibwa , Ottawa , Shawnee , and Wyandot tribes . Fighting took place primarily along the frontiers between New France and the British colonies , from the Province of Virginia in the south to Newfoundland in the north . It began with a dispute over control of the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River called the Forks of the Ohio , and the site of the French Fort Duquesne in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . The dispute erupted into violence in the Battle of Jumonville Glen in May 1754 , during which Virginia militiamen under the command of 22-year-old George Washington ambushed a French patrol . In 1755 , six colonial governors met with General Edward Braddock , the newly arrived British Army commander , and planned a four-way attack on the French . None succeeded , and the main effort by Braddock proved a disaster ; he lost the Battle of the Monongahela on July 9 , 1755 and died a few days later . British operations failed in the frontier areas of the Province of Pennsylvania and the Province of New York during 1755-57 due to a combination of poor management , internal divisions , effective Canadian scouts , French regular forces , and Indian warrior allies . In 1755 , the British captured Fort Beaus\u00e9jour on the border separating Nova Scotia from Acadia , and they ordered the expulsion of the Acadians ( 1755-64 ) soon afterwards .",

Prior to the 18th century , they were concentrated in what is now southwestern North Carolina , southeastern Tennessee , edges of western South Carolina , northeastern Georgia and northeastern Alabama . The Cherokee language is part of the Iroquoian language group . In the 19th century , James Mooney , an American ethnographer , recorded one oral tradition that told of the tribe having migrated south in ancient times from the Great Lakes region , where other Iroquoian-speaking peoples lived ; however , anthropologist Thomas R. Whyte writes that the origin of the proto-Iroquoian language was likely the Appalachian region and the split between Northern and Southern Iroquoian languages began 4,000 years ago . By the 19th century , European settlers in the United States classified the Cherokee of the Southeast as one of the Five Civilized Tribes , because they were agrarian and lived in permanent villages and began to adopt some cultural and technological practices of the European American settlers . Today there are three federally recognized Cherokee tribes : the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in North Carolina , the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians ( UKB ) in Oklahoma , and the Cherokee Nation ( CN ) in Oklahoma . The Cherokee Nation has more than 300,000 tribal members , making it the largest of the 567 federally recognized tribes in the United States . In addition , numerous groups claim Cherokee lineage , and some of these are state-recognized . A total of more than 819,000 people are estimated to claim having Cherokee ancestry on the US census , which includes persons who are not enrolled members of any tribe . Of the three federally recognized Cherokee tribes , the Cherokee Nation and the UKB have headquarters in Tahlequah , Oklahoma . The UKB are mostly descendants of Old Settlers , Cherokee who migrated to Arkansas and Oklahoma about 1817 prior to Indian Removal . They are related to the Cherokee who were later forcibly relocated there in the 1830s under the Indian Removal Act .",

  "/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America": "The Confederate States of America ( CSA or C.S . ) - commonly referred to as the Confederacy - was an unrecognized republic in North America that existed from 1861 to 1865 . The Confederacy was originally formed by seven secessionist slave-holding states - South Carolina , Mississippi , Florida , Alabama , Georgia , Louisiana , and Texas - in the Lower South region of the United States , whose economy was heavily dependent upon agriculture , particularly cotton , and a plantation system that relied upon the labor of African-American slaves . Convinced that the institution of slavery was threatened by the November 1860 election of Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln to the U.S. presidency on a platform which opposed the expansion of slavery into the western territories , the Confederacy declared its secession in rebellion against the United States , with the loyal states becoming known as the Union during the ensuing American Civil War . Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens described its ideology as being centrally based upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man ; that slavery , subordination to the superior race , is his natural and normal condition . Before Lincoln took office in March , a new Confederate government was established in February 1861 which was considered illegal by the government of the United States . States volunteered militia units , and the new government hastened to form its own Confederate States Army from nothing practically overnight . After the American Civil War began in April , four slave states of the Upper South - Virginia , Arkansas , Tennessee , and North Carolina - also seceded and joined the Confederacy . The Confederacy later accepted Missouri and Kentucky as members , although neither officially declared secession nor were they ever largely controlled by Confederate forces ; Confederate shadow governments attempted to control the two states but were later exiled from them . The government of the United States ( the Union ) rejected the claims of secession , considering it illegitimate . The war began April 12 , 1861 , when the Confederates attacked Fort Sumter , a Union fort in the harbor of Charleston , South Carolina . No foreign government ever officially recognized the Confederacy as an independent country , although Great Britain and France granted it belligerent status , which allowed Confederate agents to contract with private concerns for arms and other supplies .",

  "/wiki/African_American": "African Americans ( also referred to as Black Americans or Afro-Americans ) are an ethnic group of Americans with total or partial ancestry from any of the black racial groups of Africa . The phrase generally refers to descendants of enslaved black people who are from the United States . African Americans constitute the third largest ethnic group and the second largest racial group in the US , after White Americans and Hispanic and Latino Americans . Most African Americans are descendants of enslaved peoples within the boundaries of the present United States . On average , African Americans are of West/Central African and European descent , and some also have Native American ancestry .

The overwhelming majority of African immigrants identify instead with their own respective ethnicities ( \u224895% ) . Immigrants from some Caribbean , Central American , and South American nations and their descendants may or may not also self-identify with the term . African-American history starts in the 16th century , with peoples from West Africa forcibly taken as slaves to Latin America , and in the 17th century with West African slaves taken to English colonies in North America . After the founding of the United States , black people continued to be enslaved , and the last four million black slaves were only liberated after the Civil War in 1865 .

  "/wiki/Southern_United_States": "The Southern United States , also known as the American South or simply the South , is a geographic and cultural region of the United States . It is located between the Atlantic Ocean and the Western United States , with the Midwestern United States and Northeastern United States to its north and the Gulf of Mexico and Mexico to its south . The South does not fully match the geographic south of the United States but is commonly defined as including the states that fought for the Confederate States of America in the American Civil War . The Deep South is fully located in the southeastern corner . California , Arizona and New Mexico , which are geographically in the southern part of the country , are rarely considered part , while West Virginia , which separated from Virginia in 1863 , commonly is . Some scholars have proposed definitions of the South that do not coincide neatly with state boundaries . While the states of Delaware and Maryland , as well as the District of Columbia , permitted slavery prior to and during the Civil War , they remained with the Union . Since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s , they became more culturally , economically , and politically aligned with the industrial Northern states , and are often identified as part of the Mid-Atlantic or Northeast by many residents , businesses , public institutions , and private organizations ; however , the United States Census Bureau continues to define them as in the South with regard to census regions . Usually , the South is defined as including the southeastern and south-central United States . The region is known for its culture and history , having developed its own customs , musical styles , and cuisines , which have distinguished it in some ways from the rest of the United States . The Southern ethnic heritage is diverse and includes strong European ( mostly English , Italian , Scottish , Scotch-Irish , Irish , German , French , Portuguese and Spanish American ) , African and some Native American components . Some other aspects of the historical and cultural development of the South have been influenced by the institution of slave labor on plantations in the Deep South to an extent seen nowhere else in the United States ; the presence of a large proportion of African Americans in the population ; support for the doctrine of states ' rights , and the legacy of racism magnified by the Civil War and Reconstruction Era , as seen in thousands of lynchings ( mostly from 1880 to 1930 ) , the segregated system of separate schools and public facilities known as Jim Crow laws , that lasted until the 1960s , and the widespread use of poll taxes and other methods to frequently deny black people of the right to vote or hold office until the 1960s .",
  "/wiki/Nathan_Bedford_Forrest": "Nathan Bedford Forrest ( July 13 , 1821 - October 29 , 1877 ) was a Confederate Army general during the American Civil War . Although scholars generally respect Forrest as a military strategist , he has remained a controversial figure in Southern racial history , especially for his role in the massacre of black soldiers at Fort Pillow and his 1867-1869 leadership of the Ku Klux Klan . Before the war , Forrest amassed substantial wealth as a cotton plantation owner , horse and cattle trader , real estate broker , and slave trader . In June 1861 , he enlisted in the Confederate Army , one of the few officers during the war to enlist as a private and be promoted to general without any prior military training . An expert cavalry leader , Forrest was given command of a corps and established new doctrines for mobile forces , earning the nickname The Wizard of the Saddle . His methods influenced future generations of military strategists , although the Confederate high command is seen by some commentators to have under appreciated his talents . In April 1864 , in what has been called one of the bleakest , saddest events of American military history , troops under Forrest 's command massacred Union troops who had surrendered , most of them black soldiers along with some white Southern Tennesseans fighting for the Union , at the Battle of Fort Pillow . Forrest was blamed for the massacre in the Union press and that news may have strengthened the North 's resolve to win the war . Forrest joined the Ku Klux Klan in 1867 ( two years after its founding ) and was elected its first Grand Wizard . The group was a loose collection of local factions throughout the former Confederacy that used violence and the threat of violence to maintain white control over the newly-enfranchised slaves . The Klan , with Forrest at the lead , suppressed voting rights of blacks in the South through violence and intimidation during the elections of 1868 . In 1869 , Forrest expressed disillusionment with the lack of discipline among the various white supremacist groups across the South , and issued a letter ordering the dissolution of the Ku Klux Klan and the destruction of its costumes ; he then withdrew from the organization .",
  "/wiki/Battle_cry": "A battle cry is a yell or chant taken up in battle , usually by members of the same combatant group . Battle cries are not necessarily articulate ( e.g . Eliaaaa ! , Alala . ) , although they often aim to invoke patriotic or religious sentiment . Their purpose is a combination of arousing aggression and esprit de corps on one 's own side and causing intimidation on the hostile side . Battle cries are a universal form of display behaviour ( i.e. , threat display ) aiming at competitive advantage , ideally by overstating one 's own aggressive potential to a point where the enemy prefers to avoid confrontation altogether and opts to flee . In order to overstate one 's potential for aggression , battle cries need to be as loud as possible , and have historically often been amplified by acoustic devices such as horns , drums , conches , carnyxes , bagpipes , bugles , etc . ( see also martial music ) . Battle cries are closely related to other behavioral patterns of human aggression , such as war dances and taunting , performed during the warming up phase preceding the escalation of physical violence . From the Middle Ages , many cries appeared on standards and were adopted as mottoes , an example being the motto Dieu et mon droit ( God and my right ) of the English kings . It is said that this was Edward III 's rallying cry during the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy . The word slogan originally derives from sluagh-gairm or sluagh-ghairm ( sluagh = people , army , and gairm = call , proclamation ) , the Scottish Gaelic word for gathering-cry and in times of war for battle-cry .",
  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country . [ f ] The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union . [ g ] The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years .",

It was one of the worst disasters of the war for the Confederate States Army . Confederate Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood 's Army of Tennessee conducted numerous frontal assaults against fortified positions occupied by the Union forces under Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield and was unable to prevent Schofield from executing a planned , orderly withdrawal to Nashville . The Confederate assault of six infantry divisions containing eighteen brigades with 100 regiments numbering almost 20,000 men , sometimes called the Pickett 's Charge of the West , resulted in devastating losses to the men and the leadership of the Army of Tennessee - fourteen Confederate generals ( six killed , seven wounded , and one captured ) and 55 regimental commanders were casualties . After its defeat against Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas in the subsequent Battle of Nashville , the Army of Tennessee retreated with barely half the men with which it had begun the short offensive , and was effectively destroyed as a fighting force for the remainder of the war . The 1864 Battle of Franklin was the second military action in the vicinity ; a battle in 1863 was a minor action associated with a reconnaissance in force by Confederate cavalry leader Maj. Gen.

Hood had a reputation for bravery and aggressiveness that sometimes bordered on recklessness . Arguably one of the best brigade and division commanders in the CSA , Hood gradually became increasingly ineffective as he was promoted to lead larger , independent commands late in the war ; his career and reputation were marred by his decisive defeats leading an army in the Atlanta Campaign and the Franklin-Nashville Campaign . Hood 's education at the United States Military Academy led to a career as a junior officer in both the infantry and cavalry of the antebellum U.S. Army in California and Texas . At the start of the Civil War , he offered his services to his adopted state of Texas . He achieved his reputation for aggressive leadership as a brigade commander in the army of Robert E. Lee during the Seven Days Battles in 1862 , after which he was promoted to division command . He led a division under James Longstreet in the campaigns of 1862-63 . At the Battle of Gettysburg , he was severely wounded , rendering his left arm useless for the rest of his life . Transferred with many of Longstreet 's troops to the Western Theater , Hood led a massive assault into a gap in the Union line at the Battle of Chickamauga , but was wounded again , requiring the amputation of his right leg . Hood returned to field service during the Atlanta Campaign of 1864 , and at the age of 33 was promoted to temporary full general and command of the Army of Tennessee at the outskirts of Atlanta , making him the youngest soldier on either side of the war to be given command of an army . There , he dissipated his army in a series of bold , calculated , but unfortunate assaults , and was forced to evacuate the besieged city . Leading his men through Alabama and into Tennessee , his army was severely damaged in a massive frontal assault at the Battle of Franklin and he was decisively defeated at the Battle of Nashville by his former West Point instructor , Maj.

In 1869 an additional $ 1,000,000 was given by Mr. Peabody , with $ 384,000 of Florida funds , also repudiated later . The main purpose of the fund was to aid elementary education by strengthening existing schools . Because it was restricted from founding new schools , it did not benefit freedmen in the South , as there were no established schools for blacks . The fund introduced a new type of benefaction in that it was left without restriction in the hands of the trustees to administer . Power to close the trust after thirty years was provided on condition that two-thirds of the fund be distributed to educational institutions in the Southern states . The rules of the Peabody Education Fund were strict , allowing for the distribution of about $ 80,000 per year over a period of thirty years . By the time of the termination of the fund in 1898 , about $ 2,500,000 had been distributed . In 1875 , the trustees of the Peabody Education Fund founded the Peabody Normal School of the South which promptly became the Peabody Normal College ( 1875-1911 ) .

Presley was born in Tupelo , Mississippi , and relocated to Memphis , Tennessee , with his family when he was 13 years old . His music career began there in 1954 , recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips , who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience . Presley , on rhythm acoustic guitar , and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black , was a pioneer of rockabilly , an uptempo , backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues . In 1955 , drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley 's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker , who would manage him for more than two decades . Presley 's first RCA single , Heartbreak Hotel , was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States . With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records , he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll . His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style , combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations , made him enormously popular - and controversial .

  "/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland .",

They can range from simple dwellings such as rudimentary huts of nomadic tribes and the improvised shacks in shantytowns to complex , fixed structures of wood , masonry , concrete or other materials containing plumbing , ventilation , and electrical systems . Houses use a range of different roofing systems to keep precipitation such as rain from getting into the dwelling space . Houses may have doors or locks to secure the dwelling space and protect its inhabitants and contents from burglars or other trespassers . Most conventional modern houses in Western cultures will contain one or more bedrooms and bathrooms , a kitchen or cooking area , and a living room . A house may have a separate dining room , or the eating area may be integrated into another room . Some large houses in North America have a recreation room . In traditional agriculture-oriented societies , domestic animals such as chickens or larger livestock ( like cattle ) may share part of the house with humans . The social unit that lives in a house is known as a household . Most commonly , a household is a family unit of some kind , although households may also be other social groups , such as roommates or , in a rooming house , unconnected individuals .

The land was ceded to the U.S. with the understanding that the proceeds made in the sale of the land to white settlers would go to the Chickasaw . The treaty led to the Chickasaw Trail of Tears , by which the entire Chickasaw Nation emigrated to new territory in present-day Oklahoma in 1837-1838 .",
  "/wiki/Indian_Removal": "Indian removal was a forced migration in the 19th century whereby Native Americans were forced by the United States government to leave their ancestral homelands in the eastern United States to lands west of the Mississippi River , specifically to a designated Indian Territory ( roughly , modern Oklahoma ) . The Indian Removal Act , the key law that forced the removal of the Indians , was signed by Andrew Jackson in 1830 . Jackson took a hard line on Indian removal , but the law was put into effect primarily under the Martin van Buren administration . Indian removal was a consequence of actions first by European settlers to North America in the colonial period , then by the United States government and its citizens until the mid-20th century . The policy traced its direct origins to the administration of James Monroe , though it addressed conflicts between European Americans and Native Americans that had been occurring since the 17th century , and were escalating into the early 19th century as white settlers were continually pushing westward .",

Their traditional territory was in the Southeastern United States of Mississippi , Alabama and Tennessee . Their language is classified as a member of the Muskogean language family . In the present day , they are organized as the federally recognized Chickasaw Nation . Sometime prior to the first European contact , the Chickasaw migrated from western regions and moved east of the Mississippi River , where they settled mostly in present-day northeast Mississippi , Alabama , and into Lawrence County , Tennessee . That is where they encountered European explorers and traders . They had interaction with the French , English and Spanish during the colonial years . The United States considered the Chickasaw one of the Five Civilized Tribes of the Southeast , as they adopted numerous practices of European Americans . Resisting European-American settlers encroaching on their territory , they were forced by the US to sell their country in the 1832 Treaty of Pontotoc Creek and move to Indian Territory ( Oklahoma ) during the era of Indian Removal in the 1830s . Most of their descendants remain as residents of what is now Oklahoma . The Chickasaw Nation in Oklahoma is the 13th largest federally recognized tribe in the United States . Its members are related to the Choctaw and share a common history with them .",

  "/wiki/Mississippi_River": "The Mississippi River is the second-longest river and chief river of the second-largest drainage system on the North American continent , second only to the Hudson Bay drainage system . From its traditional source of Lake Itasca in northern Minnesota , it flows generally south for 2,320 miles ( 3,730 km ) to the Mississippi River Delta in the Gulf of Mexico . With its many tributaries , the Mississippi 's watershed drains all or parts of 32 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian mountains . The main stem is entirely within the United States ; the total drainage basin is 1,151,000 sq mi ( 2,980,000 km2 ) , of which only about one percent is in Canada . The Mississippi ranks as the fourth-longest river and fifteenth-largest river by discharge in the world . The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota , Wisconsin , Iowa , Illinois , Missouri , Kentucky , Tennessee , Arkansas , Mississippi , and Louisiana . Native Americans have lived along the Mississippi River and its tributaries for thousands of years . Most were hunter-gatherers , but some , such as the Mound Builders , formed prolific agricultural societies . The arrival of Europeans in the 16th century changed the native way of life as first explorers , then settlers , ventured into the basin in increasing numbers . The river served first as a barrier , forming borders for New Spain , New France , and the early United States , and then as a vital transportation artery and communications link . In the 19th century , during the height of the ideology of manifest destiny , the Mississippi and several western tributaries , most notably the Missouri , formed pathways for the western expansion of the United States . Formed from thick layers of the river 's silt deposits , the Mississippi embayment is one of the most fertile regions of the United States ; steamboats were widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries to ship agricultural and industrial goods .",

  "/wiki/Victorian_architecture": "Victorian architecture is a series of architectural revival styles in the mid-to-late 19th century . Victorian refers to the reign of Queen Victoria ( 1837-1901 ) , called the Victorian era , during which period the styles known as Victorian were used in construction . However , many elements of what is typically termed Victorian architecture did not become popular until later in Victoria 's reign . The styles often included interpretations and eclectic revivals of historic styles . The name represents the British and French custom of naming architectural styles for a reigning monarch . Within this naming and classification scheme , it followed Georgian architecture and later Regency architecture , and was succeeded by Edwardian architecture .",
  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",
  "/wiki/Building": "A building , or edifice , is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place , such as a house or factory . Buildings come in a variety of sizes , shapes , and functions , and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors , from building materials available , to weather conditions , land prices , ground conditions , specific uses , and aesthetic reasons . To better understand the term building compare the list of nonbuilding structures . Buildings serve several societal needs - primarily as shelter from weather , security , living space , privacy , to store belongings , and to comfortably live and work . A building as a shelter represents a physical division of the human habitat ( a place of comfort and safety ) and the outside ( a place that at times may be harsh and harmful ) . Ever since the first cave paintings , buildings have also become objects or canvasses of much artistic expression . In recent years , interest in sustainable planning and building practices has also become an intentional part of the design process of many new buildings .",

  "/wiki/Sacred": "Something that is sacred is dedicated or set apart for the service or worship of a deity or considered worthy of spiritual respect or devotion ; or inspiring awe or reverence among believers . The property is often ascribed to objects ( a sacred artifact that is venerated and blessed ) , or places ( sacred ground ) . French sociologist \u00c9mile Durkheim considered the dichotomy between the sacred and the profane to be the central characteristic of religion : religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things , that is to say , things set apart and forbidden . In Durkheim 's theory , the sacred represented the interests of the group , especially unity , which were embodied in sacred group symbols , or totems . The profane , on the other hand , involved mundane individual concerns . Although there are similarities between the terms sacred and holy and they are sometimes used interchangeably , there are subtle differences . Holiness is generally the term used in relation to persons and relationship , while sacredness is used in relation to objects , places , or happenings . Thus a saint may be considered as holy , but would not be viewed as sacred .",

  "/wiki/Daniel_Boone": "Daniel Boone ( November 2 , 1734 [ O.S . October 22 ] - September 26 , 1820 ) was an American pioneer , explorer , woodsman , and frontiersman whose frontier exploits made him one of the first folk heroes of the United States . Although he also became a businessman , soldier and politician who represented three different counties in the Virginia General Assembly following the American Revolutionary War , Boone is most famous for his exploration and settlement of what is now Kentucky . Although on the western side of the Appalachian Mountains from most European-American settlements , Kentucky remained part of Virginia until it became a state in 1791 . As a young adult , Boone supplemented his farm income by hunting and trapping game , and selling their pelts in the fur market . Through this work , Boone first learned the easy routes westward . Despite some resistance from Native American tribes such as the Shawnee , in 1775 , Boone blazed his Wilderness Road from North Carolina and Tennessee through Cumberland Gap in the Cumberland Mountains into Kentucky . There , he founded the village of Boonesborough , Kentucky , one of the first American settlements west of the Appalachians . Before the end of the 18th century , more than 200,000 Americans migrated to Kentucky/Virginia by following the route marked by Boone . Boone served as a militia officer during the Revolutionary War ( 1775-83 ) , which , in Kentucky , was fought primarily between the American settlers and British-allied Native Americans , who hoped to expel the Americans . Shawnee warriors captured Boone in 1778 . He escaped and alerted Boonesborough that the Shawnee were planning an attack .",
  "/wiki/Wilderness_Road": "The Wilderness Road was one of two principal routes used by colonial and early national era settlers to reach Kentucky from the East . Although this road goes through the Cumberland Gap into southern Kentucky and northern Tennessee , the other ( more northern route ) is sometimes called the Cumberland Road because it started in Fort Cumberland in Maryland . Despite Kentucky Senator Henry Clay 's advocacy of this route , early in the 19th century , the northern route was selected for the National Road , connecting near Washington , Pennsylvania into the Ohio Valley of northern Kentucky and Ohio . In 1775 , Daniel Boone blazed a trail for the Transylvania Company from Fort Chiswell in Virginia through the Cumberland Gap . It was later lengthened , following Native American trails , to reach the Falls of the Ohio at Louisville . The Wilderness Road was steep , rough and narrow , and could only be traversed on foot or horseback . By contrast , wagons could travel along the National Road route ( originally the Braddock Road blazed by the competing Ohio Company and George Washington circa 1750 ) , particularly after the improvements . Despite the adverse conditions , thousands of people used the Wilderness Road , particularly slaveholders after the states of Ohio , then Indiana and finally Illinois became free states ( abolishing slavery ) on the northern bank of the Ohio River , where travelers often embarked on boats to travel westward . In 1792 , the new Kentucky legislature provided money to upgrade the road . In 1796 , an improved all-weather road was opened for wagon and carriage travel . The road was abandoned around 1840 ( construction on the National Road after Vandalia , Illinois also stopping due to the Panic of 1837 and early railroad construction ) , although modern highways follow much of its route .",

A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands , such as the Philippines , is referred to as an archipelago . An island may be described as such , despite the presence of an artificial land bridge ; examples are Singapore and its causeway , and the various Dutch delta islands , such as IJsselmonde . Some places may even retain island in their names for historical reasons after being connected to a larger landmass by a land bridge or landfill , such as Coney Island and Coronado Island , though these are , strictly speaking , tied islands .

The ancestors of living Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago , possibly much earlier , from Asia via Beringia . A vast variety of peoples , societies and cultures subsequently developed . Native Americans were greatly affected by the European colonization of the Americas , which began in 1492 , and their population declined precipitously overwhelmingly due to introduced diseases as well as warfare , including biological warfare , territorial confiscation and slavery . After its creation , the United States , as part of its policy of settler colonialism , waged war and perpetrated massacres against many Native American peoples , removed them from their ancestral lands , and subjected them to one-sided treaties and to discriminatory government policies into the 20th century . Since the 1960s , Native American self-determination movements have resulted in changes to the lives of Native Americans , though there are still many contemporary issues faced by Native Americans . Today , there are over five million Native Americans in the United States , 78% of whom live outside reservations . When the United States was created , established Native American tribes were generally considered semi-independent nations , as they generally lived in communities separate from British settlers .

  "/wiki/Woodland_period": "In the classification of archaeological cultures of North America , the Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures spanned a period from roughly 1000 BCE to European contact in the eastern part of North America , with some archaeologists distinguishing the Mississippian period , from 1000 CE to European contact as a separate period . The term Woodland Period was introduced in the 1930s as a generic term for prehistoric sites falling between the Archaic hunter-gatherers and the agriculturalist Mississippian cultures . The Eastern Woodlands cultural region covers what is now eastern Canada south of the Subarctic region , the Eastern United States , along to the Gulf of Mexico . This period is variously considered a developmental stage , a time period , a suite of technological adaptations or traits , and a family tree of cultures related to earlier Archaic cultures . It can be characterized as a chronological and cultural manifestation without any massive changes in a short time but instead having a continuous development in stone and bone tools , leather crafting , textile manufacture , cultivation , and shelter construction . Many Woodland peoples used spears and atlatls until the end of the period , when they were replaced by bows and arrows ; however , Southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns . The most cited technological distinction of this period was the widespread use of pottery ( although pottery manufacture had arisen during the Archaic period in some places ) , and the diversification of pottery forms , decorations , and manufacturing practices . The increasing use of horticulture and the development of the Eastern Agricultural Complex , consisting of weedy seed plants as well as gourd cultivation , also meant that groups became less mobile over time and , in some times and places , people lived in permanently occupied villages and cities . Intensive agriculture characterizes the Mississippian period from c. 1000-1400 CE and may have continued up to European contact , around 500 years ago .",

In ancient Greece , large stone walls had been built in Mycenaean Greece , such as the ancient site of Mycenae ( famous for the huge stone blocks of its 'cyclopean ' walls ) . A Greek phrourion was a fortified collection of buildings used as a military garrison , and is the equivalent of the Roman castellum or English fortress . These constructions mainly served the purpose of a watch tower , to guard certain roads , passes , and borders . Though smaller than a real fortress , they acted as a border guard rather than a real strongpoint to watch and maintain the border . The art of setting out a military camp or constructing a fortification traditionally has been called castrametation since the time of the Roman legions . Fortification is usually divided into two branches : permanent fortification and field fortification . There is also an intermediate branch known as semi-permanent fortification . Castles are fortifications which are regarded as being distinct from the generic fort or fortress in that they are a residence of a monarch or noble and command a specific defensive territory .",
  "/wiki/Chattanooga_Campaign": "The Chattanooga campaign was a series of maneuvers and battles in October and November 1863 , during the American Civil War . Following the defeat of Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans 's Union Army of the Cumberland at the Battle of Chickamauga in September , the Confederate Army of Tennessee under Gen. Braxton Bragg besieged Rosecrans and his men by occupying key high terrain around Chattanooga , Tennessee . Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant was given command of Union forces in the West , now consolidated under the Division of the Mississippi . Significant reinforcements also began to arrive with him in Chattanooga from Mississippi and the Eastern Theater . On October 18 , Grant removed Rosecrans from command of the Army of the Cumberland and replaced him with Major General George Henry Thomas . After the opening of a supply line ( the Cracker Line ) to feed the starving men and animals in Chattanooga , a force under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker fought off a Confederate counterattack at the Battle of Wauhatchie on October 28-29 , 1863 . On November 23 , the Army of the Cumberland advanced from the fortifications around Chattanooga to seize the strategic high ground at Orchard Knob while elements of the Union Army of the Tennessee under Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman maneuvered to launch a surprise attack against Bragg 's right flank on Missionary Ridge . On November 24 , Sherman 's men crossed the Tennessee River in the morning and then advanced to occupy high ground at the northern end of Missionary Ridge in the afternoon . The same day , a mixed force of almost three divisions under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker defeated the Confederates in the Battle of Lookout Mountain . The next day they began a movement toward Bragg 's left flank at Rossville . On November 25 , Sherman 's attack on Bragg 's right flank made little progress . Hoping to distract Bragg 's attention , Grant ordered Thomas 's army to advance in the center and take the Confederate positions at the base of Missionary Ridge .",

  "/wiki/Tunnel": "A tunnel is an underground passageway , dug through the surrounding soil/earth/rock and enclosed except for entrance and exit , commonly at each end . A pipeline is not a tunnel , though some recent tunnels have used immersed tube construction techniques rather than traditional tunnel boring methods . A tunnel may be for foot or vehicular road traffic , for rail traffic , or for a canal . The central portions of a rapid transit network are usually in the tunnel . Some tunnels are aqueducts to supply water for consumption or for hydroelectric stations or are sewers . Utility tunnels are used for routing steam , chilled water , electrical power or telecommunication cables , as well as connecting buildings for convenient passage of people and equipment . Secret tunnels are built for military purposes , or by civilians for smuggling of weapons , contraband , or people . Special tunnels , such as wildlife crossings , are built to allow wildlife to cross human-made barriers safely . Tunnels can be connected together in tunnel networks .",

European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States .

  "/wiki/Water": "Water is an inorganic , transparent , tasteless , odorless , and nearly colorless chemical substance , which is the main constituent of Earth 's hydrosphere and the fluids of most living organisms . It is vital for all known forms of life , even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients . Its chemical formula is H2O , meaning that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms , connected by covalent bonds . Water is the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard ambient temperature and pressure . It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog . Clouds are formed from suspended droplets of water and ice , its solid state . When finely divided , crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of snow . The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor . Water moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation , transpiration ( evapotranspiration ) , condensation , precipitation , and runoff , usually reaching the sea . Water covers 71% of the Earth 's surface , mostly in seas and oceans . Small portions of water occur as groundwater ( 1.7% ) , in the glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland ( 1.7% ) , and in the air as vapor , clouds ( formed of ice and liquid water suspended in air ) , and precipitation ( 0.001% ) . Water plays an important role in the world economy .",
  "/wiki/Hydropower": "Hydropower or water power ( from Greek : \u1f55\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1 , water ) is power derived from the energy of falling or fast-running water , which may be harnessed for useful purposes . Since ancient times , hydropower from many kinds of watermills has been used as a renewable energy source for irrigation and the operation of various mechanical devices , such as gristmills , sawmills , textile mills , trip hammers , dock cranes , domestic lifts , and ore mills . A trompe , which produces compressed air from falling water , is sometimes used to power other machinery at a distance . In the late 19th century , hydropower became a source for generating electricity . Cragside in Northumberland was the first house powered by hydroelectricity in 1878 and the first commercial hydroelectric power plant was built at Niagara Falls in 1879 . In 1881 , street lamps in the city of Niagara Falls were powered by hydropower . Since the early 20th century , the term has been used almost exclusively in conjunction with the modern development of hydroelectric power . International institutions such as the World Bank view hydropower as a means for economic development without adding substantial amounts of carbon to the atmosphere , but dams can have significant negative social and environmental impacts .",
  "/wiki/History_of_slavery_in_the_United_States": "Slavery in the United States was the legal institution of human chattel enslavement , primarily of Africans and African Americans , that existed in the United States of America from the beginning of the nation in 1776 until passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865 . Slavery had been practiced in British America from early colonial days , and was legal in all thirteen colonies at the time of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 . Under the law , an enslaved person was treated as property and could be bought , sold , or given away . Slavery lasted in about half of U.S. states until 1865 . As an economic system , slavery was largely replaced by sharecropping and convict leasing . By the time of the American Revolution ( 1775-1783 ) , the status of enslaved people had been institutionalized as a racial caste associated with African ancestry . The role of slavery under the U.S. Constitution ( 1789 ) was the most contentious issue during its drafting . Although the creators of the Constitution never used the word slavery , the final document , through the three-fifths clause , gave slave-owners disproportionate political power . During and immediately following the War , abolitionist laws were passed in most Northern states and a movement developed to abolish slavery . All Northern states had abolished slavery in some way by 1805 ; sometimes , abolition was a gradual process , and hundreds of people were still enslaved in the Northern states as late as the 1840 Census . Some slaveowners - primarily in the Upper South -- freed the people they had enslaved , and philanthropists and charitable groups bought and freed other enslaved people . The Atlantic slave trade was outlawed by individual states beginning during the American Revolution .",
  "/wiki/Hammer": "A hammer is a tool consisting of a weighted head fixed to a long handle that is swung to deliver an impact to a small area of an object . This can be , for example , to drive nails into wood , to shape metal ( as with a forge ) , or to crush rock . Hammers are used for a wide range of driving , shaping , and breaking applications . The modern hammer head is typically made of steel which has been heat treated for hardness , and the handle ( also known as a haft or helve ) is typically made of wood or plastic . The claw hammer has a claw to pull nails out of wood , and is commonly found in an inventory of household tools in North America . Other types of hammer vary in shape , size , and structure , depending on their purposes . Hammers used in many trades include sledgehammers , mallets , and ball-peen hammers . Although most hammers are hand tools , powered hammers , such as steam hammers and trip hammers , are used to deliver forces beyond the capacity of the human arm . There are over 40 different types of hammers that have many different types of uses .",
  "/wiki/Chisel": "A chisel is a tool with a characteristically shaped cutting edge ( such that wood chisels have lent part of their name to a particular grind ) of blade on its end , for carving or cutting a hard material such as wood , stone , or metal by hand , struck with a mallet , or mechanical power . The handle and blade of some types of chisel are made of metal or of wood with a sharp edge in it . Chiselling use involves forcing the blade into some material to cut it . The driving force may be applied by pushing by hand , or by using a mallet or hammer . In industrial use , a hydraulic ram or falling weight ( 'trip hammer ' ) may be used to drive a chisel into the material . A gouge ( one type of chisel ) serves to carve small pieces from the material , particularly in woodworking , woodturning and sculpture . Gouges most frequently produce concave surfaces . A gouge typically has a ' U'-shaped cross-section .",
  "/wiki/Black_powder": "Gunpowder , also known as black powder to distinguish it from modern smokeless powder , is the earliest known chemical explosive . It consists of a mixture of sulfur ( S ) , charcoal ( C ) , and potassium nitrate ( saltpeter , KNO3 ) . The sulfur and charcoal act as fuels while the saltpeter is an oxidizer . Because of its incendiary properties and the amount of heat and gas volume that it generates , gunpowder has been widely used as a propellant in firearms , artillery , rockets , and fireworks , and as a blasting powder in quarrying , mining , and road building . Gunpowder was invented in 9th-century China as one of the Four Great Inventions , and spread throughout most parts of Eurasia by the end of the 13th century . Originally developed by the Taoists for medicinal purposes , gunpowder was first used for warfare about 904 AD . Gunpowder is classified as a low explosive because of its relatively slow decomposition rate and consequently low brisance . Low explosives deflagrate ( i.e. , burn ) at subsonic speeds , whereas high explosives detonate producing a supersonic shockwave . Ignition of gunpowder packed behind a projectile generates enough pressure to force the shot from the muzzle at high speed , but usually not enough force to rupture the gun barrel . Gunpowder thus makes a good propellant , but is less suitable for shattering rock or fortifications with its low-yield explosive power . However , by transferring enough energy ( from the burning gunpowder to the mass of the cannonball , and then from the cannonball to the opposing fortifications by way of the impacting ammunition ) eventually a bombardier may wear down an opponent 's fortified defenses . Gunpowder was widely used to fill fused artillery shells ( and used in mining and civil engineering projects ) until the second half of the 19th century , when the first high explosives were put into use .",

  "/wiki/Church_(building)": "A church building or church house , often simply called a church , is a building used for Christian religious activities , particularly for Christian worship services . The term is often used by Christians to refer to the physical buildings where they worship , but it is sometimes used ( by analogy ) to refer to buildings of other religions . In traditional Christian architecture , a church interior is often structured in the shape of a Christian cross . When viewed from plan view the vertical beam of the cross is represented by the center aisle and seating while the horizontal beam and junction of the cross is formed by the bema and altar . Towers or domes are often added with the intention of directing the eye of the viewer towards the heavens and inspiring a range of thoughts and emotions in visitors and worshippers . Modern church buildings have a variety of architectural styles and layouts ; many buildings that were designed for other purposes have now been converted for church use , and , conversely , many original church buildings have been put to other uses . The earliest identified Christian church building was a house church founded between 233 and 256 . From the 11th through the 14th centuries , a wave of building of cathedrals and smaller parish churches were erected across Western Europe . A cathedral is a church building , usually Roman Catholic , Protestant ( including Anglican ) , Eastern Orthodox , or Oriental Orthodox , housing a cathedra , the formal name for the seat or throne of a presiding bishop .",

  "/wiki/Temple": "A temple ( from the Latin word templum ) is a building reserved for religious or spiritual rituals and activities such as prayer and sacrifice . It is typically used for such buildings belonging to all faiths where a more specific term such as church , mosque or synagogue is not generally used in English . These include Hinduism , Buddhism , and Jainism among religions with many modern followers , as well as other ancient religions such as Ancient Egyptian religion . The form and function of temples is thus very variable , though they are often considered by believers to be in some sense the house of one or more deities . Typically offerings of some sort are made to the deity , and other rituals enacted , and a special group of clergy maintain , and operate the temple . The degree to which the whole population of believers can access the building varies significantly ; often parts or even the whole main building can only be accessed by the clergy . Temples typically have a main building and a larger precinct , which may contain many other buildings , or may be a dome shaped structure , much like an igloo . The word comes from Ancient Rome , where a templum constituted a sacred precinct as defined by a priest , or augur . It has the same root as the word template , a plan in preparation of the building that was marked out on the ground by the augur . Templa also became associated with the dwelling places of a god or gods . Despite the specific set of meanings associated with the word , it has now become widely used to describe a house of worship for any number of religions and is even used for time periods prior to the Romans .",
  "/wiki/Effigy_mound": "An effigy mound is a raised pile of earth built in the shape of a stylized animal , symbol , human , or other figure and generally containing one or more human burials . Effigy mounds were primarily built during the Late Woodland Period ( 350-1300 CE ) . Conical and linear mounds , the predecessors of effigy mounds may date from as far back as 700 BCE . They remain places First Peoples frequent to visit and speak with ancestors , to put down tobacco and to give thanks . These sites are primarily visited by Hochungra ( pl . of Hochunk ) people whose ancestors likely built the great majority of them , though they are also visited by people from other original indigenous nations such as Anishinaabe ( Ojibwe ) , Kikapu , Oneida , Menominii who reside in Wisconsin and surrounding areas . There also remains the possibility that a greater diversity of First Peoples such as ancestors of those named nations may have contributed to building some percentage of the mounds . That is to say that ancestral Hochunk likely popularized the form and other groups may have adopted the practice of building effigy mounds from having observed the Hochunk ancestors methods and aesthetics surrounding their construction . Scholars believe that effigy mounds were built primarily for spiritual purposes , although most also fulfilled a burial mound function . According to 2011 ground-penetrating radar and magnetometry studies surveying 586 mounds at 128 sites , 65% of linear mounds in Wisconsin contain evidence of burials , 89% of conical mounds contain evidence of burials , and 87% of effigy ( animal and other abstract shaped ) mounds contain persistent evidence of burials . Older conical mound construction evolves into effigy mound construction over time . Given the expected rates of decay regarding burial evidence ( some conical mounds being as old as 2700 years ) it is reasonable to project that all mounds in the conical-to-effigy mound spectrum , are burial or funerary earthworks .",

  "/wiki/James_K._Polk": "James Knox Polk ( November 2 , 1795 - June 15 , 1849 ) was the 11th president of the United States , serving from 1845 to 1849 . He previously was Speaker of the House of Representatives ( 1835-1839 ) and governor of Tennessee ( 1839-1841 ) . A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Andrew Jackson , he was a member of the Democratic Party and an advocate of Jacksonian democracy . Polk is chiefly known for extending the territory of the United States during the Mexican-American War ; during his presidency , the United States expanded significantly with the annexation of the Republic of Texas , the Oregon Territory , and the Mexican Cession following the American victory in the Mexican-American War . After building a successful law practice in Tennessee , Polk was elected to the state legislature ( 1823 ) and then to the United States House of Representatives in 1825 , becoming a strong supporter of Andrew Jackson . After serving as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee , he became Speaker in 1835 , the only president to have been Speaker . Polk left Congress to run for governor of Tennessee ; he won in 1839 , but lost in 1841 and 1843 . He was a dark horse candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in 1844 ; he entered his party 's convention as a potential nominee for vice president , but emerged as a compromise to head the ticket when no presidential candidate could secure the necessary two-thirds majority . In the general election , Polk defeated Henry Clay of the rival Whig Party . Historians consider Polk the most effective president of the pre-Civil War era , having met during his four-year term every major domestic and foreign policy goal he had set . After a negotiation fraught with risk of war , he reached a settlement with Great Britain over the disputed Oregon Country , the territory for the most part being divided along the 49th parallel . Polk achieved a sweeping victory in the Mexican-American War , which resulted in the cession by Mexico of nearly all the American Southwest .",

  "/wiki/Kinship_and_descent": "In anthropology , kinship is the web of social relationships that form an important part of the lives of all humans in all societies , although its exact meanings even within this discipline are often debated . Anthropologist Robin Fox states that the study of kinship is the study of what man does with these basic facts of life - mating , gestation , parenthood , socialization , siblingship etc . Human society is unique , he argues , in that we are working with the same raw material as exists in the animal world , but [ we ] can conceptualize and categorize it to serve social ends . These social ends include the socialization of children and the formation of basic economic , political and religious groups . Kinship can refer both to the patterns of social relationships themselves , or it can refer to the study of the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures ( i.e . kinship studies ) . Over its history , anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms in the study of kinship , such as descent , descent group , lineage , affinity/affine , consanguinity/cognate and fictive kinship . Further , even within these two broad usages of the term , there are different theoretical approaches . Broadly , kinship patterns may be considered to include people related by both descent - i.e . social relations during development - and by marriage . Human kinship relations through marriage are commonly called affinity in contrast to the relationships that arise in one 's group of origin , which may be called one 's descent group . In some cultures , kinship relationships may be considered to extend out to people an individual has economic or political relationships with , or other forms of social connections .",
  "/wiki/Corinthian_order": "The Corinthian order is the last developed of the three principal classical orders of ancient Greek and Roman architecture . The other two are the Doric order which was the earliest , followed by the Ionic order . When classical architecture was revived during the Renaissance , two more orders were added to the canon : the Tuscan order and the Composite order . The Corinthian , with its offshoot the Composite , is the most ornate of the orders . This architectural style is characterized by slender fluted columns and elaborate capitals decorated with acanthus leaves and scrolls . There are many variations . The name Corinthian is derived from the ancient Greek city of Corinth , although the style had its own model in Roman practice , following precedents set by the Temple of Mars Ultor in the Forum of Augustus ( c. 2 AD ) . It was employed in southern Gaul at the Maison Carr\u00e9e , N\u00eemes and at the comparable Temple of Augustus and Livia [ fr ] at Vienne . Other prime examples noted by Mark Wilson Jones are the lower order of the Basilica Ulpia and the Arch of Trajan at Ancona ( both of the reign of Trajan , 98-117 AD ) , the Column of Phocas ( re-erected in Late Antiquity but 2nd century in origin ) , and the Temple of Bacchus at Baalbek ( c. 150 AD ) .",
  "/wiki/Portico": "A portico is a porch leading to the entrance of a building , or extended as a colonnade , with a roof structure over a walkway , supported by columns or enclosed by walls . This idea was widely used in ancient Greece and has influenced many cultures , including most Western cultures . Some noteworthy examples of porticos are the East Portico of the United States Capitol , the portico adorning the Pantheon in Rome and the portico of University College London . Porticos are sometimes topped with pediments . Palladio was a pioneer of using temple-fronts for secular buildings . In the UK , the temple-front applied to The Vyne , Hampshire , was the first portico applied to an English country house . A pronaos ( UK : /pro\u028a\u02c8ne\u026a.\u0252s/ or US : /pro\u028a\u02c8ne\u026a.\u0259s/ ) is the inner area of the portico of a Greek or Roman temple , situated between the portico 's colonnade or walls and the entrance to the cella , or shrine . Roman temples commonly had an open pronaos , usually with only columns and no walls , and the pronaos could be as long as the cella . The word pronaos is Greek for before a temple . In Latin , a pronaos is also referred to as an anticum or prodomus ."
