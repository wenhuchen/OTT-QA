Construction on the fortress began 1819 to realize the so-called central defense idea adopted by the Swedish military after the Finnish and Napoleonic Wars . The site was chosen by Baltzar von Platen in connection with the construction of G\u00f6ta Canal . The intent of the central defense idea was that the King , the Council , the Riksdag and central command functions would , in the event of an attack against the kingdom , pull back and ensconce themselves in this fortress in the middle of the country . Even the gold reserves of the central bank of Sweden were to be safeguarded in the fortress in times of trouble . The fortress is one of northern Europe 's largest buildings and consists primarily of limestone from Omberg . Construction was begun in 1819 on 100 hectares ( 250 acres ) of land . The fortress was to house a garrison of 6,000 enlisted men and an additional 8,000-10,000 people . The walls were mostly complete in 1830 , and after comprehensive visits to other fortresses in Europe , fortress architect Johan av Klen presented plans similar in style to the Fort Winiary in Posen ( present-day Pozna\u0144 ) . Due to its great expense and reduced funding , the fortress was n't in operation until 1870 , and was n't fully completed until 1909 . To compensate for the rapidly evolving technology of artillery during this time , Vaberget Fortress was built in the early 1900s five kilometers west of Karlsborg to provide additional protection to the main fortress . The town of Karlsborg has sprung up next to the fortress .",
