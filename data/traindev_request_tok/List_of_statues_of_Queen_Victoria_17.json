The Park was named after Queen Victoria ahead of her diamond jubilee on the British throne . The human-made lake is fed by Schneider Creek , surrounds three small islands , and is crossed by multiple bridges . The park also contains the Victoria Park pavilion , the Victoria Park Gallery and Archives , a bandstand , and a historic boathouse , a pub and music venue .

Designed by Charles Knechtel , the structure was set on fire in 1916 and deemed too damaged to recover . A second pavilion , borrowing heavily from Knechtel 's original design , was built in 1924 .",

In her public life , she was a strong proponent of the arts and higher education and of the feminist cause . Her early life was spent moving among the various royal residences in the company of her family . When her father , the prince consort , died on 14 December 1861 , the court went into a long period of mourning , to which with time Louise became unsympathetic . Louise was an able sculptor and artist , and several of her sculptures remain today . She was also a supporter of the feminist movement , corresponding with Josephine Butler , and visiting Elizabeth Garrett . Before her marriage , from 1866 to 1871 , Louise served as an unofficial secretary to her mother , the Queen . The question of Louise 's marriage was discussed in the late 1860s . Suitors from the royal houses of Prussia and Denmark were suggested , but Victoria did not want her to marry a foreign prince , and therefore suggested a high-ranking member of the British aristocracy . Despite opposition from members of the royal family , Louise fell in love with John , Marquess of Lorne , the heir of the Duke of Argyll . Victoria consented to the marriage , which took place on 21 March 1871 . Despite a happy beginning , the two drifted apart , possibly because of their childlessness and the queen 's constraints on their activities .",
