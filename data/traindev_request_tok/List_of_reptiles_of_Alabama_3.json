  "/wiki/Loggerhead_sea_turtle": "The loggerhead sea turtle ( Caretta caretta ) , also commonly called Caretta Caretta , is a species of oceanic turtle distributed throughout the world . It is a marine reptile , belonging to the family Cheloniidae . The average loggerhead measures around 90 cm ( 35 in ) in carapace length when fully grown . The adult loggerhead sea turtle weighs approximately 135 kg ( 298 lb ) , with the largest specimens weighing in at more than 450 kg ( 1,000 lb ) . The skin ranges from yellow to brown in color , and the shell is typically reddish brown . No external differences in sex are seen until the turtle becomes an adult , the most obvious difference being the adult males have thicker tails and shorter plastrons ( lower shells ) than the females . The loggerhead sea turtle is found in the Atlantic , Pacific , and Indian Oceans , as well as the Mediterranean Sea . It spends most of its life in saltwater and estuarine habitats , with females briefly coming ashore to lay eggs . The loggerhead sea turtle has a low reproductive rate ; females lay an average of four egg clutches and then become quiescent , producing no eggs for two to three years . The loggerhead reaches sexual maturity within 17-33 years and has a lifespan of 47-67 years . The loggerhead sea turtle is omnivorous , feeding mainly on bottom-dwelling invertebrates . Its large and powerful jaws serve as an effective tool for dismantling its prey .",
  "/wiki/Cheloniidae": "Cheloniidae is a family of typically large marine turtles that are characterised by their common traits such as , having a flat streamlined wide and rounded shell and almost paddle-like flippers for their forelimbs . The six species that make up this family are : the green sea turtle , loggerhead sea turtle , olive ridley sea turtle , hawksbill sea turtle , flatback sea turtle and the Kemp 's ridley sea turtle .",
  "/wiki/Green_sea_turtle": "The green sea turtle ( Chelonia mydas ) , also known as the green turtle , black ( sea ) turtle or Pacific green turtle , is a species of large sea turtle of the family Cheloniidae . It is the only species in the genus Chelonia . Its range extends throughout tropical and subtropical seas around the world , with two distinct populations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans , but it is also found in the Indian Ocean . The common name refers to the usually green fat found beneath its carapace , not to the color of its carapace , which is olive to black . This sea turtle 's dorsoventrally flattened body is covered by a large , teardrop-shaped carapace ; it has a pair of large , paddle-like flippers . It is usually lightly colored , although in the eastern Pacific populations parts of the carapace can be almost black . Unlike other members of its family , such as the hawksbill sea turtle , C. mydas is mostly herbivorous . The adults usually inhabit shallow lagoons , feeding mostly on various species of seagrasses . The turtles bite off the tips of the blades of seagrass , which keeps the grass healthy . Like other sea turtles , green sea turtles migrate long distances between feeding grounds and hatching beaches . Many islands worldwide are known as Turtle Island due to green sea turtles nesting on their beaches . Females crawl out on beaches , dig nests and lay eggs during the night .",
  "/wiki/Kemp's_ridley_sea_turtle": "Kemp 's ridley sea turtle ( Lepidochelys kempii ) , also called the Atlantic ridley sea turtle , is the rarest species of sea turtle and is critically endangered . It is one of two living species in the genus Lepidochelys ( the other one being L. olivacea , the olive ridley sea turtle ) .",
  "/wiki/Common_snapping_turtle": "The common snapping turtle ( Chelydra serpentina ) is a large freshwater turtle of the family Chelydridae . Its natural range extends from southeastern Canada , southwest to the edge of the Rocky Mountains , as far east as Nova Scotia and Florida . The three species of Chelydra and the larger alligator snapping turtles ( genus Macrochelys ) are the only extant chelydrids , a family now restricted to the Americas . The common snapping turtle , as its name implies , is the most widespread . The common snapping turtle is noted for its combative disposition when out of the water with its powerful beak-like jaws , and highly mobile head and neck ( hence the specific name serpentina , meaning snake-like ) . In water , they are likely to flee and hide themselves underwater in sediment . Snapping turtles have a life-history strategy characterized by high and variable mortality of embryos and hatchlings , delayed sexual maturity , extended adult longevity , and iteroparity ( repeated reproductive events ) with low reproductive success per reproductive event . Females , and presumably also males , in more northern populations mature later ( at 15-20 years ) and at a larger size than in more southern populations ( about 12 years ) . Lifespan in the wild is poorly known , but long-term mark-recapture data from Algonquin Park in Ontario , Canada , suggest a maximum age over 100 years .",
  "/wiki/Chelydridae": "The Chelydridae are a family of turtles that has seven extinct and two extant genera . The extant genera are the snapping turtles , Chelydra and Macrochelys . Both are endemic to the Western Hemisphere . The extinct genera are Acherontemys , Chelydrops , Chelydropsis , Emarginachelys , Macrocephalochelys , Planiplastron , and Protochelydra .",
  "/wiki/Alligator_snapping_turtle": "The alligator snapping turtle ( Macrochelys temminckii ) is a species of turtle in the family Chelydridae . The species is native to freshwater habitats in the United States . M. temminckii is one of the heaviest freshwater turtles in the world . It is often associated with , but not closely related to , the common snapping turtle , which is in the genus Chelydra . The specific epithet temminckii is in honor of Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck .",
  "/wiki/Leatherback_sea_turtle": "The leatherback sea turtle ( Dermochelys coriacea ) , sometimes called the lute turtle or leathery turtle or simply the luth , is the largest of all living turtles and is the fourth-heaviest modern reptile behind three crocodilians . It is the only living species in the genus Dermochelys and family Dermochelyidae . It can easily be differentiated from other modern sea turtles by its lack of a bony shell , hence the name . Instead , its carapace is covered by skin and oily flesh .",

  "/wiki/Painted_turtle": "The painted turtle ( Chrysemys picta ) is the most widespread native turtle of North America . It lives in slow-moving fresh waters , from southern Canada to northern Mexico , and from the Atlantic to the Pacific . The turtle is the only species of the genus Chrysemys , which is part of the pond turtle family Emydidae . Fossils show that the painted turtle existed 15 million years ago . Four regionally based subspecies ( the eastern , midland , southern , and western ) evolved during the last ice age . The adult painted turtle female is 10-25 cm ( 4-10 in ) long ; the male is smaller . The turtle 's top shell is dark and smooth , without a ridge . Its skin is olive to black with red , orange , or yellow stripes on its extremities . The subspecies can be distinguished by their shells : the eastern has straight-aligned top shell segments ; the midland has a large gray mark on the bottom shell ; the southern has a red line on the top shell ; the western has a red pattern on the bottom shell . The turtle eats aquatic vegetation , algae , and small water creatures including insects , crustaceans , and fish . Although they are frequently consumed as eggs or hatchlings by rodents , canines , and snakes , the adult turtles ' hard shells protect them from most predators . Reliant on warmth from its surroundings , the painted turtle is active only during the day when it basks for hours on logs or rocks .",

  "/wiki/Diamondback_terrapin": "The diamondback terrapin ( Malaclemys terrapin ) or simply terrapin , is a species of turtle native to the brackish coastal tidal marshes of the eastern and southern United States , and in Bermuda . It belongs to the monotypic genus , Malaclemys . It has one of the largest ranges of all turtles in North America , stretching as far south as the Florida Keys and as far north as Cape Cod . The name terrapin is derived from the Algonquian word torope . It applies to Malaclemys terrapin in both British English and American English . The name originally was used by early European settlers in North America to describe these brackish-water turtles that inhabited neither freshwater habitats nor the sea . It retains this primary meaning in American English . In British English , however , other semi-aquatic turtle species , such as the red-eared slider , might be called a terrapin .
