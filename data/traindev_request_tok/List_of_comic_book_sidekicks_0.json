  "/wiki/Aquaman": "Aquaman ( Arthur Curry ) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics . Created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger , the character debuted in More Fun Comics # 73 ( November 1941 ) . Initially a backup feature in DC 's anthology titles , Aquaman later starred in several volumes of a solo comic book series . During the late 1950s ' and 1960s ' superhero-revival period known as the Silver Age , he was a founding member of the Justice League . In the 1990s ' Modern Age , writers interpreted Aquaman 's character more seriously , with storylines depicting the weight of his role as king of Atlantis . The character 's original 1960s animated appearances left a lasting impression , making Aquaman widely recognized in popular culture and one of the world 's most recognized superheroes . Jokes about his wholesome , weak portrayal in Super Friends and perceived feeble powers and abilities have been staples of comedy programs and stand-up routines , leading DC at several times to attempt to make the character edgier or more powerful in comic books . Modern comic book depictions have attempted to reconcile these various aspects of his public perception , with many versions often casting Aquaman as serious and brooding , saddled with an ill reputation , and struggling to find a true role and purpose beyond his public side as a deposed king and a fallen hero . Aquaman has been featured in several adaptations , first appearing in animated form in the 1967 The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure and then in the related Super Friends program . Since then he has appeared in various animated productions , including prominent roles in the 2000s series Justice League and Justice League Unlimited and Batman : The Brave and the Bold , as well as several DC Universe Animated Original Movies . Actor Alan Ritchson also portrayed the character in the live-action television show Smallville . In the DC Extended Universe , actor Jason Momoa portrays the character in the films Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice , Justice League , and Aquaman .",

Barry Allen is a reinvention of a previous character called the Flash , who appeared in 1940s comic books as the character Jay Garrick . Because he is a speedster , his power consists mainly of superhuman speed . Various other effects are also attributed to his ability to control the speed of molecular vibrations , including his ability to vibrate at speed to pass through objects . The Flash wears a distinct red and gold costume treated to resist friction and wind resistance , traditionally storing the costume compressed inside a ring .

Nicknamed the Scarlet Speedster , all incarnations of the Flash possess super speed , which includes the ability to run , move , and think extremely fast , use superhuman reflexes , and seemingly violate certain laws of physics . Thus far , at least four different characters - each of whom somehow gained the power of the speed force - have assumed the mantle of the Flash in DC 's history : college athlete Jay Garrick ( 1940-1951 , 1961-2011 , 2017-present ) , forensic scientist Barry Allen ( 1956-1985 , 2008-present ) , Barry 's nephew Wally West ( 1986-2011 , 2016-present ) , and Barry 's grandson Bart Allen ( 2006-2007 ) .

The Flash is one of DC Comics ' most popular characters and has been integral to the publisher 's many reality-changing crisis storylines over the years . The original meeting of the Golden Age Flash Jay Garrick and Silver Age Flash Barry Allen in Flash of Two Worlds ( 1961 ) introduced the Multiverse storytelling concept to DC readers , which would become the basis for many DC stories in the years to come .
