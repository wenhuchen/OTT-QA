The county town is the city of Winchester . Its two largest cities , Southampton and Portsmouth , are administered separately as unitary authorities ; the rest of the county is governed by Hampshire County Council . First settled about 14,000 years ago , Hampshire 's history dates to Roman Britain , when its chief town was Winchester . When the Romans left Britain , the area was infiltrated by tribes from Scandinavia and mainland Europe , principally in the river valleys . The county was recorded in the 11th century Domesday Book , divided into 44 hundreds . From the 12th century , the ports grew in importance , fuelled by trade with the continent , wool and cloth manufacture in the county , and the fishing industry , and a shipbuilding industry was established . By the 16th century , the population of Southampton had outstripped that of Winchester . By the mid-19th century , with the county 's population at 219,210 ( double that at the beginning of the century ) in more than 86,000 dwellings , agriculture was the principal industry and 10 per cent of the county was still forest . Hampshire played a crucial military role in both World Wars . The Isle of Wight , historically part of Hampshire , became a separate ceremonial county in 1974 .",
  "/wiki/England": "England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It shares land borders with Wales to the west and Scotland to the north . The Irish Sea lies west of England and the Celtic Sea to the southwest . England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south . The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain , which lies in the North Atlantic , and includes over 100 smaller islands , such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight . It is the largest country of British Isles . The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula , who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries . England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law - the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world - developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations . The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England , transforming its society into the world 's first industrialised nation . England 's terrain is chiefly low hills and plains , especially in central and southern England . However , there is upland and mountainous terrain in the north ( for example , the Lake District and Pennines ) and in the west ( for example , Dartmoor and the Shropshire Hills ) .",

The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England . In 1997 , a Scottish Parliament was re-established , in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members , having authority over many areas of domestic policy . The head of the Scottish Government is the first minister of Scotland , who is supported by the deputy first minister of Scotland .",

The area of the unitary authority , Durham County Council , does not include Darlington , Hartlepool or Stockton-on-Tees . The historic county 's boundaries stretch between the rivers Tyne and Tees , thus including places such as Gateshead , Jarrow , South Shields and Sunderland , but do not include the part of the modern county south of the Tees . During the Middle Ages , the county was an ecclesiastical centre , due largely to the presence of St Cuthbert 's shrine in Durham Cathedral , and the extensive powers granted to the Bishop of Durham as ruler of the County Palatine of Durham . The county has a mixture of mining , farming and heavy railway heritage , with the latter especially noteworthy in the southeast of the county , in Darlington , Shildon and Stockton . It is an area of regeneration and promoted as a tourist destination ; in the centre of the city of Durham , Durham Castle and Durham Cathedral are UNESCO-designated World Heritage Sites .",

  "/wiki/County_Londonderry": "County Londonderry ( Irish : Contae Dhoire ; Ulster-Scots : Coontie Lunnonderrie ) , also known as County Derry , is one of the six counties of Northern Ireland . Prior to the partition of Ireland , it was one of the counties of the Kingdom of Ireland from 1613 onward and then of the United Kingdom after the Acts of Union 1800 . Adjoining the north-west shore of Lough Neagh , the county covers an area of 2,074 km\u00b2 ( 801 sq mi ) and today has a population of about 247,132 . Since 1972 , the counties in Northern Ireland , including Londonderry , have no longer been used by the state as part of the local administration . Following further reforms in 2015 , the area is now governed under three different districts ; Derry and Strabane , Causeway Coast and Glens and Mid-Ulster . Despite no longer being used for local government and administrative purposes , it is sometimes used in a cultural context in All-Ireland sporting and cultural events ( i.e . Derry GAA ) . Since 1981 , it has become one of four counties in Northern Ireland that has a Catholic majority ( 55.56% according to the 2001 Census ) , with 57% of the Catholic population residing within Derry City Council . The county flower is the Purple Saxifrage .",
  "/wiki/Northern_Ireland": "Northern Ireland ( Irish : Tuaisceart \u00c9ireann [ \u02c8t\u032a\u02e0u\u0259\u0283c\u0259\u027e\u02e0t\u032a\u02e0 \u02c8e\u02d0\u027e\u02b2\u0259n\u032a\u02e0 ] ( listen ) ; Ulster-Scots : Norlin Airlann ) is variously described as a country , province or region which is part of the United Kingdom . Located in the northeast of the island of Ireland , Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland . In 2011 , its population was 1,810,863 , constituting about 30% of the island 's total population and about 3% of the UK 's population . Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement , the Northern Ireland Assembly ( colloquially referred to as Stormont after its location ) holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters , while other areas are reserved for the British government . Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in several areas , and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to put forward views and proposals with determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments . On 11 January 2020 , legislators in Northern Ireland formed a government for the first time since the Executive of the 5th Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed in January 2017 , following the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal . Northern Ireland was created in 1921 , when Ireland was partitioned between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 . Unlike Southern Ireland , which would become the Irish Free State in 1922 , the majority of Northern Ireland 's population were unionists , who wanted to remain within the United Kingdom . Most of these were the Protestant descendants of colonists from Great Britain . However , a significant minority , mostly Catholics , were nationalists who wanted a united Ireland independent of British rule . Today , the former generally see themselves as British and the latter generally see themselves as Irish , while a distinct Northern Irish or Ulster identity is claimed both by a large minority of Catholics and Protestants and by many of those who are non-aligned . For most of the 20th century , when it came into existence , Northern Ireland was marked by discrimination and hostility between these two sides in what First Minister of Northern Ireland , David Trimble , called a cold house for Catholics .",
  "/wiki/Sussex": "Sussex ( /\u02c8s\u028cs\u026aks/ ) , from the Old English S\u016b\u00fes\u0113axe ( South Saxons ) , is a historic county in South East England corresponding roughly in area to the ancient Kingdom of Sussex . It is bounded to the west by Hampshire , north by Surrey , northeast by Kent , south by the English Channel , and divided for many purposes into the ceremonial counties of West Sussex and East Sussex . Brighton and Hove , though part of East Sussex , was made a unitary authority in 1997 , and as such , is administered independently of the rest of East Sussex . Brighton and Hove was granted City status in 2000 . Until then , Chichester was Sussex 's only city . Sussex has three main geographic sub-regions , each oriented approximately east to west . In the southwest is the fertile and densely populated coastal plain . North of this are the rolling chalk hills of the South Downs , beyond which is the well-wooded Sussex Weald . The name derives from the Kingdom of Sussex , which was founded , according to legend , by \u00c6lle of Sussex in AD 477 . Around 827 , it was absorbed into the kingdom of Wessex and subsequently into the kingdom of England . It was the home of some of Europe 's earliest recorded hominids , whose remains have been found at Boxgrove . It was invaded by the Romans and is the site of the Battle of Hastings ."
