Although the five-act comedy was published in 1524 and first performed in the carnival season of 1526 , Machiavelli likely wrote The Mandrake in 1518 as a distraction from his bitterness at having been excluded from the diplomatic and political life of Florence following the 1512 reversion to Medici rule . Some scholars read the play as an overt critique of the House of Medici ; and some scholars assert that the play is a mirror to his political treatises . However , Machiavelli set the action in 1504 during the period of the Florentine Republic in order to express his frustrations without fear of censure from patrons already ill-disposed towards him and his writing .",

The architect was George Dance the Younger , with John Palmer carrying out much of the work . It opened with a performance of Shakespeare 's Richard III and hosted performances by many leading actors of the time including Dorothea Jordan , William Macready and Edmund Kean .

Further redecoration was undertaken in 1892 ; more extensive building work , including a new staircase and the installation of electric lighting , followed in 1902 . Despite performances by casts including Sarah Bernhardt , the ballerina Anna Pavlova and Mrs. Patrick Campbell , the theatre was rarely very profitable .

  "/wiki/The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest": "The Importance of Being Earnest , A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde . First performed on 14 February 1895 at the St James 's Theatre in London , it is a farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious personae to escape burdensome social obligations . Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London , the play 's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage , and the resulting satire of Victorian ways . Some contemporary reviews praised the play 's humour and the culmination of Wilde 's artistic career , while others were cautious about its lack of social messages . Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde 's most enduringly popular play . The successful opening night marked the climax of Wilde 's career but also heralded his downfall . The Marquess of Queensberry , whose son Lord Alfred Douglas was Wilde 's lover , planned to present the writer with a bouquet of rotten vegetables and disrupt the show . Wilde was tipped off and Queensberry was refused admission . Their feud came to a climax in court , where Wilde 's homosexuality was revealed to the Victorian public and he was sentenced to imprisonment . Despite the play 's early success , Wilde 's notoriety caused the play to be closed after 86 performances . After his release from prison , he published the play from exile in Paris , but he wrote no further comic or dramatic work . The Importance of Being Earnest has been revived many times since its premiere .",
