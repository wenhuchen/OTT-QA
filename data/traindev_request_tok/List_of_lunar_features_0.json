The adjectives derived from eponym include eponymous and eponymic .

  "/wiki/Impact_crater": "An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet , moon , or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere , formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body . In contrast to volcanic craters , which result from explosion or internal collapse , impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain . Impact craters range from small , simple , bowl-shaped depressions to large , complex , multi-ringed impact basins . Meteor Crater is a well-known example of a small impact crater on Earth . Impact craters are the dominant geographic features on many solid Solar System objects including the Moon , Mercury , Callisto , Ganymede and most small moons and asteroids . On other planets and moons that experience more active surface geological processes , such as Earth , Venus , Mars , Europa , Io and Titan , visible impact craters are less common because they become eroded , buried or transformed by tectonics over time . Where such processes have destroyed most of the original crater topography , the terms impact structure or astrobleme are more commonly used . In early literature , before the significance of impact cratering was widely recognised , the terms cryptoexplosion or cryptovolcanic structure were often used to describe what are now recognised as impact-related features on Earth . The cratering records of very old surfaces , such as Mercury , the Moon , and the southern highlands of Mars , record a period of intense early bombardment in the inner Solar System around 3.9 billion years ago . The rate of crater production on Earth has since been considerably lower , but it is appreciable nonetheless ; Earth experiences from one to three impacts large enough to produce a 20-kilometre-diameter ( 12 mi ) crater about once every million years on average . This indicates that there should be far more relatively young craters on the planet than have been discovered so far . The cratering rate in the inner solar system fluctuates as a consequence of collisions in the asteroid belt that create a family of fragments that are often sent cascading into the inner solar system .",
  "/wiki/Vallis_Alpes": "Vallis Alpes ( Latin for Alpine Valley ) is a lunar valley feature that bisects the Montes Alpes range . It extends 166 km from the Mare Imbrium basin , trending east-northeast to the edge of the Mare Frigoris . The valley is narrow at both ends and widens to a maximum width of about 10 km along the middle stretch . The selenographic coordinates of the center of this feature are 49\u00b013\u2032N 3\u00b038\u2032E / 49.21\u00b0N 3.63\u00b0E / 49.21 ; 3.63 . The valley floor is a flat , lava-flooded surface that is bisected by a slender , broken , cleft-like rille . The center rille is a challenging target for telescope observation from the Earth and described as , notoriously hard to spot . The rille itself is longer than the valley proper , at 196.65 km \u00b1 10.98 km , and has a width of 0.58 km \u00b1 0.09 km and depth of 77.69 m \u00b1 28.07 m. The sides of the valley rise from the floor to the surrounding highland terrain , a blocky , irregular surface . The southern face of the valley is straighter than the northern side , which is slightly bowed and uneven . The more rugged edges of the valley lie at the narrow west-southwest end that cuts through the mountain range . Most likely this valley is a graben that was subsequently flooded with magma from Mare Imbrium and Mare Frigoris . However , the valley could have been formed by stress fractures due to expansion of the mantle or contraction after solidification of regolith . It is not dissimilar to other linear features radiating from Mare Imbrium , and the impact event which created the Imbrium basin may have also led to the stresses creating Vallis Alpes .",

The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets and ultimately from the Phoenician alphabet . Latin was originally spoken in the area around Rome , known as Latium . Through the power of the Roman Republic , it became the dominant language in Italy , and subsequently throughout the western Roman Empire . Latin has contributed many words to the English language . In particular , Latin ( and Ancient Greek ) roots are used in English descriptions of theology , the sciences , medicine , and law . By the late Roman Republic ( 75 BC ) , Old Latin had been standardised into Classical Latin . Vulgar Latin was the colloquial form spoken during the same time and attested in inscriptions and the works of comic playwrights like Plautus and Terence and author Petronius . Late Latin is the written language from the 3rd century and the colloquial form Vulgar Latin developed into the Romance languages , such as French , Italian , Portuguese , Romanian , Catalan and Spanish in the 6th to 9th centuries . Medieval Latin was used as a literary language from the 9th century to the Renaissance which used Renaissance Latin . Later , Early Modern Latin and New Latin evolved . Latin was used as the language of international communication , scholarship and science until well into the 18th century , when it began to be supplanted by vernaculars ( including the Romance languages ) .",

Bohr was also a philosopher and a promoter of scientific research . Bohr developed the Bohr model of the atom , in which he proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the atomic nucleus but can jump from one energy level ( or orbit ) to another . Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models , its underlying principles remain valid . He conceived the principle of complementarity : that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties , like behaving as a wave or a stream of particles . The notion of complementarity dominated Bohr 's thinking in both science and philosophy . Bohr founded the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen , now known as the Niels Bohr Institute , which opened in 1920 . Bohr mentored and collaborated with physicists including Hans Kramers , Oskar Klein , George de Hevesy , and Werner Heisenberg . He predicted the existence of a new zirconium-like element , which was named hafnium , after the Latin name for Copenhagen , where it was discovered . Later , the element bohrium was named after him . During the 1930s , Bohr helped refugees from Nazism . After Denmark was occupied by the Germans , he had a famous meeting with Heisenberg , who had become the head of the German nuclear weapon project .",
