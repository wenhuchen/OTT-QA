  "/wiki/Cyclone_Xynthia": "Cyclone Xynthia was an extraordinarily violent European windstorm which crossed Western Europe between 27 February and 1 March 2010 . It reached a minimum pressure of 967 mb ( 28.6 inHg ) on 27 February . In France - where it was described by the civil defence as the most violent since Lothar and Martin in December 1999 - at least 51 people were killed , with 12 more said to be missing . A further six people were killed in Germany , three in Spain , one in Portugal , one in Belgium and another one in England . Most of the deaths in France occurred when a powerful storm surge topped by battering waves up to 7.5 m ( 25 ft ) high , hitting at high tide , smashed through the sea wall off the coastal town of L'Aiguillon-sur-Mer . A mobile home park built close to the sea wall was particularly hard-hit . The sea wall was about two hundred years old , built in the time of Napoleon ; critics said that situating a mobile home park so close to the sea wall showed poor coastal development practices . The storm cut power to over a million homes in France and a million customers in Portugal lost power .",

It is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark . Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America , Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe ( specifically Norway and Denmark , the colonial powers , as well as the nearby island of Iceland ) for more than a millennium . The majority of its residents are Inuit , whose ancestors migrated from Alaska through Northern Canada , gradually settling across the island by the 13th century . Nowadays , the population is largely concentrated on the southwest coast , while the rest of the island is sparsely populated . Greenland is divided into five municipalities - Sermersooq , Kujalleq , Qeqertalik , Qeqqata , and Avannaata . It has two unincorporated areas - the Northeast Greenland National Park and the Thule Air Base . The last one , even if under Danish control , is administered by the United States Air Force . Three-quarters of Greenland is covered by the only permanent ice sheet outside Antarctica . With a population of about 56,480 ( 2013 ) , it is the least densely populated territory in the world . About a third of the population lives in Nuuk , the capital and largest city . The Arctic Umiaq Line ferry acts as a lifeline for western Greenland , connecting the various cities and settlements .",

Cornwall is the westernmost part of the South West Peninsula of the island of Great Britain . The southwesternmost point is Land 's End and the southernmost Lizard Point . Cornwall has a population of 568,210 and an area of 3,563 km2 ( 1,376 sq mi ) . The county has been administered since 2009 by the unitary authority , Cornwall Council . The ceremonial county of Cornwall also includes the Isles of Scilly , which are administered separately . The administrative centre of Cornwall is Truro , its only city . Cornwall is the homeland of the Cornish people and the cultural and ethnic origin of the Cornish diaspora . It retains a distinct cultural identity that reflects its history , and is recognised as one of the Celtic nations . It was formerly a Brythonic kingdom and subsequently a royal duchy . The Cornish nationalist movement contests the present constitutional status of Cornwall and seeks greater autonomy within the United Kingdom in the form of a devolved legislative Cornish Assembly with powers similar to those in Wales and Scotland . In 2014 , Cornish people were granted minority status under the European Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities , giving them recognition as a distinct ethnic group .",

It is the country 's second most-densely populated province and second-smallest province by area , both after neighbouring Prince Edward Island . Its area of 55,284 square kilometres ( 21,345 sq mi ) includes Cape Breton Island and 3,800 other coastal islands . The peninsula that makes up Nova Scotia 's mainland is connected to the rest of North America by the Isthmus of Chignecto , on which the province 's land border with New Brunswick is located . The province borders the Bay of Fundy to the northwest and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and east , and is separated from Prince Edward Island and the island of Newfoundland by the Northumberland and Cabot straits , respectively . The land that comprises what is now Nova Scotia has been inhabited by the indigenous Mi\ua78ckmaq people for thousands of years . France 's first settlement in North America , Port-Royal , was established in 1605 and intermittently served in various locations as the capital of the French colony of Acadia for over a hundred years . The Fortress of Louisbourg was a key focus point in the struggle between the British and French for control of the area , changing hands numerous times in the until France relinquished its claims with the Treaty of Paris in 1763 . During the American Revolutionary War , thousands of Loyalists settled in Nova Scotia . In 1848 , Nova Scotia became the first British colony to achieve responsible government , and it federated in July 1867 with New Brunswick and the Province of Canada ( now Ontario and Quebec ) to form what is now the country of Canada . Nova Scotia 's capital and largest city is Halifax , which is today home to about 45 per cent of the province 's population , is the thirteenth-largest census metropolitan area in Canada , the largest city in Atlantic Canada , and Canadas second largest coastal city ( after Vancouver ) .",

It is Scotland 's third most populous city , one of Scotland 's 32 local government council areas and the United Kingdom 's 39th most populous built-up area , with an official population estimate of 196,670 for the city of Aberdeen and 227,560 for the local council area . During the mid-18th to mid-20th centuries , Aberdeen 's buildings incorporated locally quarried grey granite , which can sparkle like silver because of its high mica content . Since the discovery of North Sea oil in the 1970s , Aberdeen has been known as the off-shore oil capital of Europe . The area around Aberdeen has been settled for at least 8,000 years , when prehistoric villages lay around the mouths of the rivers Dee and Don . The city has a long , sandy coastline and a marine climate , the latter resulting in chilly summers and mild winters . Aberdeen received Royal burgh status from David I of Scotland ( 1124-1153 ) , transforming the city economically . The city has two universities , the University of Aberdeen , founded in 1495 , and Robert Gordon University , which was awarded university status in 1992 , making Aberdeen the educational centre of north-east Scotland . The traditional industries of fishing , paper-making , shipbuilding , and textiles have been overtaken by the oil industry and Aberdeen 's seaport . Aberdeen Heliport is one of the busiest commercial heliports in the world and the seaport is the largest in the north-east of Scotland . Aberdeen used to host the Aberdeen International Youth Festival , a major international event which attracted up to 1000 of the most talented young performing arts companies but the council ended funding in 2017 and the festival was wound up in 2018 .

The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England . In 1997 , a Scottish Parliament was re-established , in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members , having authority over many areas of domestic policy . The head of the Scottish Government is the first minister of Scotland , who is supported by the deputy first minister of Scotland .",

  "/wiki/Hurricane_Katia_(2011)": "Hurricane Katia was a fairly intense Cape Verde hurricane that had substantial impact across Europe as a post-tropical cyclone . The eleventh named storm , second hurricane , and second major hurricane of the active 2011 Atlantic hurricane season , Katia originated as a tropical depression from a tropical wave over the eastern Atlantic on August 29 . It intensified into a tropical storm the following day and further developed into a hurricane by September 1 , although unfavorable atmospheric conditions hindered strengthening thereafter . As the storm began to recurve over the western Atlantic , a more hospitable regime allowed Katia to become a major hurricane by September 5 and peak as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 140 mph ( 220 km/h ) that afternoon . Internal core processes , increased wind shear , an impinging cold front , and increasingly cool ocean temperatures all prompted the cyclone to weaken almost immediately after peak , and Katia ultimately transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 10 . Although Katia passed well north of the Lesser Antilles , a yellow alert was hoisted for Guadeloupe to notify residents of dangerous seas . Strong rip currents along the East Coast of the United States led to the deaths of two swimmers . After losing its tropical characteristics , Katia prompted the issuance of numerous warnings across Europe . Hurricane-force winds impacted numerous locations , downing trees , toppling power poles , and leaving thousands without electricity . The storm was responsible for two deaths in the United Kingdom : one when a tree fell on a vehicle in County Durham , and another during a multi-car accident on the M54 motorway resulting from adverse weather conditions . The post-tropical cyclone caused approximately \u00a3100m ( $ 157 million , 2011 USD ) in damage in the United Kingdom alone .",

It forms part of the Macaronesia ecoregion , along with the Azores , Canary Islands , Madeira , and the Savage Isles . Located 570 kilometres ( 350 mi ) west of the Cape Verde Peninsula off the coast of Northwest Africa , the islands cover a combined area of slightly over 4,000 square kilometres ( 1,500 sq mi ) . The Cape Verde archipelago was uninhabited until the 15th century , when Portuguese explorers discovered and colonized the islands , establishing the first European settlement in the tropics . Ideally located for the Atlantic slave trade , the islands grew prosperous throughout the 16th and 17th centuries , attracting merchants , privateers , and pirates . The end of transatlantic slavery in the 19th century led to economic decline and emigration . Cape Verde gradually recovered as an important commercial center and stopover for shipping routes . Incorporated as an overseas department of Portugal in 1951 , the islands continued to campaign for independence , which was achieved in 1975 . Since the early 1990s , Cape Verde has been a stable representative democracy , and remains one of the most developed and democratic countries in Africa . Lacking natural resources , its developing economy is mostly service-oriented , with a growing focus on tourism and foreign investment . Its population of around 540,000 is mostly of mixed European , Moorish , Arab and African heritage , and predominantly Roman Catholic , reflecting the legacy of Portuguese rule . A sizeable diaspora community exists across the world , slightly outnumbering inhabitants on the islands .",

Free Associated State of Puerto Rico ) [ b ] and briefly called Porto Rico , [ c ] is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea , approximately 1,000 miles ( 1,600 km ) southeast of Miami , Florida . An archipelago among the Greater Antilles , located between the Dominican Republic and the US Virgin Islands , Puerto Rico includes the eponymous main island and several smaller islands , such as Mona , Culebra , and Vieques . The capital and most populous city is San Juan . The territory 's total population is approximately 3.4 million , more than 21 U.S. states . Spanish and English are the official languages of the executive branch of government , though Spanish predominates . Originally populated by the indigenous Ta\u00edno people , Puerto Rico was colonized by Spain following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493 . It was contested by the French , Dutch , and British , but remained a Spanish possession for the next four centuries . The island 's cultural and demographic landscapes were shaped by the displacement and assimilation of the native population , the forced migration of African slaves , and settlement from the Canary Islands and Andalusia . In the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategic role compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain . Spain 's distant administrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century , producing a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined indigenous , African , and European elements . On September 23 , 1868 , Ram\u00f3n Emeterio Betances unleashed a revolt against Spanish rule , declaring for the first time the idea of Puerto Ricans as a distinct people , with right to sovereignty .",

He is generally identified with Thaddeus , and is also variously called Jude of James , Jude Thaddaeus , Judas Thaddaeus or Lebbaeus . He is sometimes identified with Jude , the brother of Jesus , but is clearly distinguished from Judas Iscariot , the apostle who betrayed Jesus prior to his crucifixion . Catholic writer Michal Hunt suggests that Judas Thaddaeus became known as Jude after early translators of the New Testament from Greek into English sought to distinguish him from Judas Iscariot and subsequently abbreviated his forename . Most versions of the New Testament in languages other than English and French refer to Judas and Jude by the same name . The Armenian Apostolic Church honors Thaddeus along with Saint Bartholomew as its patron saints . In the Roman Catholic Church , he is the patron saint of desperate cases and lost causes . Saint Jude 's attribute is a club . He is also often shown in icons with a flame around his head . This represents his presence at Pentecost , when he received the Holy Spirit with the other apostles . Another common attribute is Jude holding an image of Jesus Christ , known as the Image of Edessa .

Many storms were explosively deepened by a strong jet stream , many deepening below 950 hPa . The repeated formation of large deep lows over the Atlantic brought storm surges and large waves which coincided with some of the highest astronomical tides of the year and caused coastal damage . The low pressure areas brought heavy rainfalls which led to flooding , which became most severe over parts of England such as at the Somerset Levels . The repeated storms fit into a pattern of disturbed weather in the Northern Hemisphere , which saw from November 2013 a disturbance to the jet stream in the western Pacific , which propagated eastwards bringing a warm winter to Alaska , drought to California , and repeated cold air outbreaks to the eastern USA where the early 2014 North American cold wave resulted .",

  "/wiki/Weather_front": "A weather front is a boundary separating two masses of air of different densities , and is the principal cause of meteorological phenomena outside the tropics . In surface weather analyses , fronts are depicted using various colored triangles and half-circles , depending on the type of front . The air masses separated by a front usually differ in temperature and humidity . Cold fronts may feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather , and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines . Warm fronts are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog . The weather usually clears quickly after a front 's passage . Some fronts produce no precipitation and little cloudiness , although there is invariably a wind shift . Cold fronts and occluded fronts generally move from west to east , while warm fronts move poleward . Because of the greater density of air in their wake , cold fronts and cold occlusions move faster than warm fronts and warm occlusions . Mountains and warm bodies of water can slow the movement of fronts . When a front becomes stationary - and the density contrast across the frontal boundary vanishes - the front can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind velocity , known as a shearline . This is most common over the open ocean .",

Departments are further subdivided into 334 arrondissements , themselves divided into cantons ; the last two have no autonomy , and are used for the organisation of police , fire departments , and sometimes , elections . Each department is administered by an elected body called a departmental council ( conseil d\u00e9partemental [ sing . ] , conseils d\u00e9partementaux [ plur. ] ) . From 1800 to April 2015 , these were called general councils ( conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sing . conseils g\u00e9n\u00e9raux [ plur. ] ) . Each council has a president .

The coastal zones are rich in fish that visit the Norwegian Sea from the North Atlantic or from the Barents Sea ( cod ) for spawning . The warm North Atlantic Current ensures relatively stable and high water temperatures , so that unlike the Arctic seas , the Norwegian Sea is ice-free throughout the year .

Known among Russians in the Middle Ages as the Murman Sea ( Norwegian Sea ) , the current name of the sea is after the historical Dutch navigator Willem Barentsz . This is a rather shallow shelf sea , with an average depth of 230 metres ( 750 ft ) , and it is an important site for both fishing and hydrocarbon exploration .

The islands of Novaya Zemlya , an extension of the northern end of the Ural Mountains , separate the Barents Sea from the Kara Sea . Although part of the Arctic Ocean , the Barents Sea has been characterised as turning into the Atlantic because of its status as the Arctic warming hot spot .
