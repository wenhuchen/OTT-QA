  "/wiki/Hudson's_Bay_Company": "The Hudson 's Bay Company ( HBC ; French : Compagnie de la Baie d'Hudson ) is a Canadian retail business group . A fur trading business for much of its existence , HBC now owns and operates retail stores in Canada and the United States . The company sold most of its European operations by August 2019 and its remaining stores , in the Netherlands , were closed by the end of 2019 . HBC owns the Saks stores in the US ; most other US operations were sold by mid-2019 and the last remaining stores ( Lord & Taylor chain ) were sold prior to the end of 2019 . The company 's namesake business division is Hudson 's Bay , commonly referred to as The Bay ( La Baie in French ) . After incorporation by English royal charter in 1670 , the company functioned as the de facto government in parts of North America for nearly 200 years until the HBC sold the land it owned ( the entire Hudson Bay drainage basin , known as Rupert 's Land ) to Canada in 1869 as part of The Deed of Surrender , authorised by the Rupert 's Land Act 1868 . During its peak , the company controlled the fur trade throughout much of the English- and later British-controlled North America . By the mid-19th century , the company evolved into a mercantile business selling a wide variety of products from furs to fine homeware in a small number of sales shops ( as opposed to trading posts ) across Canada . These shops were the first step towards the department stores the company owns today . In 2008 , HBC was acquired by NRDC Equity Partners , which also owns the upmarket American department store Lord & Taylor . From 2008 to 2012 , the HBC was run through a holding company of NRDC , Hudson 's Bay Trading Company , which was dissolved in early 2012 . HBC 's head office is currently located in Brampton , Ontario .",
  "/wiki/Brig": "A brig is a sailing vessel with two square-rigged masts . During the Age of Sail , brigs were seen as fast and maneuverable and were used as both naval warships and merchant vessels . They were especially popular in the 18th and early 19th centuries . Brigs fell out of use with the arrival of the steam ship because they required a relatively large crew for their small size and were difficult to sail into the wind . Their rigging differs from that of a brigantine which has a gaff-rigged mainsail , while a brig has a square mainsail with an additional gaff-rigged spanker behind the mainsail .",
  "/wiki/United_States": "The United States of America ( USA ) , commonly known as the United States ( U.S. or US ) or America , is a country consisting of 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . [ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",
  "/wiki/Nootka_Crisis": "The Nootka Crisis , also known as the Spanish Armament , was an international incident and political dispute between the Spanish Empire , the Kingdom of Great Britain , and the fledgling United States of America triggered by a series of events that took place during the summer of 1789 at the Spanish outpost Santa Cruz de Nuca , in Nootka Sound , present-day British Columbia , Canada . The commander of the outpost , Jose Esteban Mart\u00ednez , seized some British commercial ships which had come for the maritime fur trade and to build a permanent post at Nootka Sound . Public outcry in England led to the mobilization of the British and Spanish navies and the possibility of war . Both sides called upon allies , and although Spain 's key ally France also mobilized their navy , they soon announced they would not go to war . Without French help Spain had little hope against the British and their Dutch ally , resulting in Spain seeking a diplomatic solution and making concessions . Nootka Sound is a network of inlets on the west coast of Vancouver Island , today part of Canada 's British Columbia . The crisis revolved around sovereignty claims and rights of navigation and trade . Between 1774 and 1789 , Spain sent several expeditions to the Pacific Northwest to reassert its long-held navigation and territorial claims to the area . By 1776 , these expeditions had reached as far north as Bucareli Bay and Sitka Sound . Territorial rights were asserted according to acts of sovereignty - customary of the time . However , some years later , several British fur-trading vessels entered the area to which Spain had laid claim . A complex series of events led to these British vessels being seized by the Spanish Navy at Nootka Sound .",

  "/wiki/RMS_Empress_of_Japan_(1891)": "RMS Empress of Japan , also known as the Queen of the Pacific , was an ocean liner built in 1890-1891 by Naval Construction & Armaments Co , Barrow-in-Furness , England for Canadian Pacific Steamships ( CP ) . This ship - the first of two CP vessels to be named Empress of Japan - regularly traversed the trans-Pacific route between the west coast of Canada and the Far East until 1922 . During the First World War she served as armed merchant cruiser , becoming HMS Empress of Japan for the period that she was a commissioned ship of the Royal Navy . Over the course of her career , Empress of Japan traversed 4 million kilometres ( 2.5 million miles ) . She made 315 Pacific crossings . In 1891 , Canadian Pacific Railway ( CPR ) and the British government reached agreement on a contract for subsidized mail service between Britain and Hong Kong via Canada ; and the route began to be serviced by three specially designed ocean liners . Each of these three vessels was given an Imperial name . Empress of Japan and her two running mates - RMS Empress of China and the RMS Empress of India - created a flexible foundation for the CPR trans-Pacific fleet which would ply this route for the next half century .",
  "/wiki/Steamship": "A steamship , often referred to as a steamer , is a type of steam-powered vessel , typically ocean-faring and seaworthy , that is propelled by one or more steam engines that typically move ( turn ) propellers or paddlewheels . The first steamships came into practical usage during the early 1800s ; however , there were exceptions that came before . Steamships usually use the prefix designations of PS for paddle steamer or SS for screw steamer ( using a propeller or screw ) . As paddle steamers became less common , SS is assumed by many to stand for steamship . Ships powered by internal combustion engines use a prefix such as MV for motor vessel , so it is not correct to use SS for most modern vessels . As steamships were less dependent on wind patterns , new trade routes opened up . The steamship has been described as a major driver of the first wave of trade globalization ( 1870-1913 ) and contributor to an increase in international trade that was unprecedented in human history .",
  "/wiki/Ocean_liner": "An ocean liner is a passenger ship primarily used as a form of transportation across seas or oceans . Liners may also carry cargo or mail , and may sometimes be used for other purposes ( such as for pleasure cruises or as hospital ships ) . Cargo vessels running to a schedule are sometimes called liners . The category does not include ferries or other vessels engaged in short-sea trading , nor dedicated cruise ships where the voyage itself , and not transportation , is the prime purpose of the trip . Nor does it include tramp steamers , even those equipped to handle limited numbers of passengers . Some shipping companies refer to themselves as lines and their container ships , which often operate over set routes according to established schedules , as liners . Ocean liners are usually strongly built with a high freeboard to withstand rough seas and adverse conditions encountered in the open ocean . Additionally , they are often designed with thicker hull plating than is found on cruise ships , and have large capacities for fuel , food and other consumables on long voyages . The first ocean liners were built in the mid-19th century . Technological innovations such as the steam engine and steel hull allowed larger and faster liners to be built , giving rise to a competition between world powers of the time , especially between the United Kingdom and Germany . Once the dominant form of travel between continents , ocean liners were rendered largely obsolete by the emergence of long-distance aircraft after World War II . Advances in automobile and railway technology also played a role .",

Its southern border with the United States , stretching some 8,891 kilometres ( 5,525 mi ) , is the world 's longest bi-national land border . Canada 's capital is Ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . As a whole , Canada is sparsely populated , with most of its land area dominated by forest and tundra . Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",

It was formed to trade in the Indian Ocean region , initially with Mughal India and the East Indies , and later with Qing China . The company ended up seizing control of large parts of the Indian subcontinent , colonised parts of Southeast Asia , and colonised Hong Kong after a war with Qing China . Originally chartered as the Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East-Indies , the company rose to account for half of the world 's trade , particularly in basic commodities including cotton , silk , indigo dye , salt , spices , saltpetre , tea , and opium . The company also ruled the beginnings of the British Empire in India . In his speech to the House of Commons in July 1833 , Lord Macaulay explained that since the beginning , the East India company had always been involved in both trade and politics , just as its French and Dutch counterparts had been . The company received a Royal Charter from Queen Elizabeth I on 31 December 1600 , coming relatively late to trade in the Indies . Before them the Portuguese Estado da \u00cdndia had traded there for much of the 16th century and the first of half a dozen Dutch Companies sailed to trade there from 1595 . These Dutch companies amalgamated in March 1602 into the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) , which introduced the first permanent joint stock from 1612 ( meaning investment into shares did not need to be returned , but could be traded on a stock exchange ) . By contrast , wealthy merchants and aristocrats owned the EIC 's shares . Initially the government owned no shares and had only indirect control until 1657 when permanent joint stock was established . During its first century of operation , the focus of the company was trade , not the building of an empire in India .",
  "/wiki/Maritime_Fur_Trade": "The maritime fur trade was a ship-based fur trade system that focused on acquiring furs of sea otters and other animals from the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast and natives of Alaska . The furs were mostly sold in China in exchange for tea , silks , porcelain , and other Chinese goods , which were then sold in Europe and the United States . The maritime fur trade was pioneered by Russians , working east from Kamchatka along the Aleutian Islands to the southern coast of Alaska . British and Americans entered during the 1780s , focusing on what is now the coast of British Columbia . The trade boomed around the beginning of the 19th century . A long period of decline began in the 1810s . As the sea otter population was depleted , the maritime fur trade diversified and transformed , tapping new markets and commodities , while continuing to focus on the Northwest Coast and China . It lasted until the middle to late 19th century . Russians controlled most of the coast of what is now Alaska during the entire era . The coast south of Alaska endured fierce competition between , and among , British and American trading vessels . The British were the first to operate in the southern sector , but were unable to compete against the Americans , who dominated from the 1790s to the 1830s . The British Hudson 's Bay Company entered the coast trade in the 1820s with the intention of driving the Americans away .",

Macau was formerly a colony of the Portuguese Empire , after Ming China leased the territory as a trading post in 1557 . Between 1557 and 1887 , Macau was governed by the Portuguese under Chinese authority and sovereignty with the Portuguese paying an annual land rent . In 1887 , Portugal was given perpetual colonial rights for Macau which gave Portuguese sovereignty over Macau . The colony remained under Portuguese rule until 1999 , when it was transferred to China .
