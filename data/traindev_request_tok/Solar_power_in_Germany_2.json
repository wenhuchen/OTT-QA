  "/wiki/Nameplate_capacity": "Nameplate capacity , also known as the rated capacity , nominal capacity , installed capacity , or maximum effect , is the intended full-load sustained output of a facility such as a power plant , electric generator , a chemical plant , fuel plant , metal refinery , mine , and many others . Nameplate capacity is the number registered with authorities for classifying the power output of a power station usually expressed in megawatts ( MW ) . Power plants with an output consistently near their nameplate capacity have a high capacity factor .",
  "/wiki/Megawatt": "The watt ( symbol : W ) is a unit of power . In the International System of Units ( SI ) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second , and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer . In SI base units , the watt is described as k g m 2 s \u2212 3 { \\displaystyle kg\\ , m^ { 2 } s^ { -3 } } , which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis . The watt is named after James Watt , an 18th century scottish inventor .",
  "/wiki/Watt-peak": "The nominal power is the nameplate capacity of photovoltaic ( PV ) devices , such as solar cells , panels and systems , and is determined by measuring the electric current and voltage in a circuit , while varying the resistance under precisely defined conditions . These Standard Test Conditions ( STC ) are specified in standards such as IEC 61215 , IEC 61646 and UL 1703 ; specifically the light intensity is 1000 W/m2 , with a spectrum similar to sunlight hitting the earth 's surface at latitude 35\u00b0N in the summer ( airmass 1.5 ) , the temperature of the cells being 25 \u00b0C . The power is measured while varying the resistive load on the module between an open and closed circuit ( between maximum and minimum resistance ) . The highest power thus measured is the 'nominal ' power of the module in watts . This nominal power divided by the light power that falls on a given area of a photovoltaic device ( area \u00d7 1000 W/m2 ) defines its efficiency , the ratio of the device 's electrical output to the incident energy . The nominal power is important for designing an installation in order to correctly dimension its cabling and converters . If the available area is limited the solar cell efficiency and with it the nominal power per area ( e.g . kW/m2 ) is also relevant . For comparing modules , the price per nominal power ( e.g . $ /W ) is relevant . For a given installation 's physical orientation and location the expected annual production ( e.g . kWh ) per annual production assuming nominal power i.e .",
