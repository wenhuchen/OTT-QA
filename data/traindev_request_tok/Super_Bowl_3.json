With an estimated population of 391,006 in 2018 , it is the most populous city in Louisiana . Serving as a major port , New Orleans is considered an economic and commercial hub for the broader Gulf Coast region of the United States . New Orleans is world-renowned for its distinct music , Creole cuisine , unique dialect , and its annual celebrations and festivals , most notably Mardi Gras . The historic heart of the city is the French Quarter , known for its French and Spanish Creole architecture and vibrant nightlife along Bourbon Street . The city has been described as the most unique in the United States , owing in large part to its cross-cultural and multilingual heritage . Founded in 1718 by French colonists , New Orleans was once the territorial capital of French Louisiana before being traded to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 . New Orleans in 1840 was the third-most populous city in the United States , and it was the largest city in the American South from the Antebellum era until after World War II . The city has historically been very vulnerable to flooding , due to such factors as high rainfall , low lying elevation , poor natural drainage and location next to multiple bodies of water . State and federal authorities have installed a complex system of levees and drainage pumps in an effort to protect the city . New Orleans was severely affected by Hurricane Katrina on August 29 , 2005 , which resulted in flooding more than 80% of the city , thousands of deaths , and so much displacement because of damaged communities and lost housing as to cause a population decline of over 50% . Since Katrina , major redevelopment efforts have led to a rebound in the city 's population .",

The National Football League ( NFL ) 's defending champion Green Bay Packers defeated the American Football League ( AFL ) champion Oakland Raiders by the score of 33-14 . This game and Super Bowl III are the only two Super Bowl games to be played in back-to-back years in the same stadium . Coming into this game , like during the first Super Bowl , many sports writers and fans believed that any team in the NFL was vastly superior to any club in the AFL . The Packers , the defending champions , posted a 9-4-1 record during the 1967 NFL season before defeating the Dallas Cowboys , 21-17 , in the 1967 NFL Championship Game ( also popularly known as the Ice Bowl ) . The Raiders finished the 1967 AFL season at 13-1 , and defeated the Houston Oilers , 40-7 , in the 1967 AFL Championship Game . As expected , Green Bay dominated Oakland throughout most of Super Bowl II . The Raiders could only score two touchdown passes from quarterback Daryle Lamonica . Meanwhile , Packers kicker Don Chandler made four field goals , including three in the first half , while defensive back Herb Adderley had a 60-yard interception return for a touchdown .

  "/wiki/Super_Bowl_III": "Super Bowl III was the third AFL-NFL Championship Game in professional American football , and the first to officially bear the trademark name Super Bowl . Played on January 12 , 1969 , at the Orange Bowl in Miami , Florida , the game is regarded as one of the greatest upsets in both American football history and in the recorded history of sports . The 18-point underdog American Football League ( AFL ) champion New York Jets defeated the National Football League ( NFL ) champion Baltimore Colts by a score of 16-7 . This was the first Super Bowl victory for the AFL . Before the game , most sports writers and fans believed that AFL teams were less talented than NFL clubs , and expected the Colts to defeat the Jets by a wide margin . Baltimore posted a 13-1 record in the regular season and shut out the Cleveland Browns 34-0 in the NFL Championship Game . The Jets were 11-3 in the regular season , and defeated the Oakland Raiders 27-23 in the AFL Championship Game . Jets quarterback Joe Namath famously made an appearance three days before the Super Bowl at the Miami Touchdown Club and personally guaranteed his team 's victory . His team backed up his words by controlling most of the game , building a 16-0 lead by the fourth quarter off of a touchdown run by Matt Snell and three field goals by Jim Turner . Colts quarterback Earl Morrall threw three interceptions before being replaced by Johnny Unitas , who then led Baltimore to its only touchdown , during the last few minutes of the game . With the victory , the Jets were the only winning team to score only one touchdown ( either offensive , defensive , or special teams ) until the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LIII . Namath , who completed 17 out of 28 passes for 206 yards , was named as the Super Bowl 's most valuable player , making him the first player in Super Bowl history to be declared MVP without personally scoring or throwing for a touchdown .",

Along with the Colts , the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers agreed to join the ten AFL teams to form the AFC ; the remaining 13 NFL teams formed the NFC . This explains why the Colts represented the NFL in Super Bowl III , but the AFC for Super Bowl V. Baltimore advanced to Super Bowl V after posting an 11-2-1 regular season record . Meanwhile , the Cowboys were making their first Super Bowl appearance after posting a 10-4 regular season record .

The National Football League ( NFL ) champion Green Bay Packers defeated the American Football League ( AFL ) champion Kansas City Chiefs by the score of 35-10 .

Still , many sports writers and fans believed any team in the older NFL was vastly superior to any club in the upstart AFL , and so expected Green Bay would blow out Kansas City .

Located in Southeast Texas near Galveston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico , it is the seat of Harris County and the principal city of the Greater Houston metropolitan area , which is the fifth most populous metropolitan statistical area in the United States and the second most populous in Texas after the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex , with a population of 6,997,384 in 2018 . Comprising a total area of 637.4 square miles ( 1,651 km2 ) , Houston is the eighth most expansive city in the United States ( including consolidated city-counties ) . It is the largest city in the United States by total area , whose government is not consolidated with that of a county , parish or borough . Though primarily in Harris County , small portions of the city extend into Fort Bend and Montgomery counties , bordering other principal communities of Greater Houston such as Sugar Land and The Woodlands . The city of Houston was founded by land investors on August 30 , 1836 , at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou ( a point now known as Allen 's Landing ) and incorporated as a city on June 5 , 1837 . The city is named after former General Sam Houston , who was president of the Republic of Texas and had won Texas ' independence from Mexico at the Battle of San Jacinto 25 miles ( 40 km ) east of Allen 's Landing . After briefly serving as the capital of the Texas Republic in the late 1830s , Houston grew steadily into a regional trading center for the remainder of the 19th century . The arrival of the 20th century saw a convergence of economic factors which fueled rapid growth in Houston , including a burgeoning port and railroad industry , the decline of Galveston as Texas ' primary port following a devastating 1900 hurricane , the subsequent construction of the Houston Ship Channel , and the Texas oil boom . In the mid-20th century , Houston 's economy diversified as it became home to the Texas Medical Center - the world 's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions - and NASA 's Johnson Space Center , where the Mission Control Center is located . Houston 's economy since the late 19th century has a broad industrial base in energy , manufacturing , aeronautics , and transportation . Leading in healthcare sectors and building oilfield equipment , Houston has the second most Fortune 500 headquarters of any U.S. municipality within its city limits ( after New York City ) .",

It has been the home of the Rice Owls football team since its completion in 1950 and hosted Super Bowl VIII in 1974 . Architecturally , Rice Stadium is an example of modern architecture , with simple lines and an unadorned , functional design . The lower seating bowl is located below the surrounding ground level . Built solely for football , the stadium has excellent sightlines from almost every seat . To achieve this , the running track was eliminated so that spectators were closer to the action and each side of the upper decks was brought in at a concave angle to provide better sightlines . It is still recognized in many circles as the best stadium in Texas for watching a football game . Entrances and aisles were strategically placed so that the entire stadium could be emptied of spectators in nine minutes . In 2006 , Rice University upgraded the facility by switching from AstroTurf to FieldTurf and adding a modern scoreboard above the north concourse . Seating in the upper deck is in poor condition , which led the university to move home games for which large crowds were expected to nearby NRG Stadium . High school football games , especially neutral-site playoff games , are frequently played at Rice Stadium . It can also be used as a concert venue .",
