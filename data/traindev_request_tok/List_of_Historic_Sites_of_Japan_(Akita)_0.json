  "/wiki/Dendrochronology": "Dendrochronology ( or tree-ring dating ) is the scientific method of dating tree rings ( also called growth rings ) to the exact year they were formed . As well as dating them this can give data for dendroclimatology , the study of climate and atmospheric conditions during different periods in history from wood . Dendrochronology is useful for determining the precise age of samples , especially those that are too recent for radiocarbon dating , which always produces a range rather than an exact date , to be very accurate . However , for a precise date of the death of the tree a full sample to the edge is needed , which most trimmed timber will not provide . It also gives data on the timing of events and rates of change in the environment ( most prominently climate ) and also in wood found in archaeology or works of art and architecture , such as old panel paintings . It is also used as a check in radiocarbon dating to calibrate radiocarbon ages . New growth in trees occurs in a layer of cells near the bark . A tree 's growth rate changes in a predictable pattern throughout the year in response to seasonal climate changes , resulting in visible growth rings . Each ring marks a complete cycle of seasons , or one year , in the tree 's life . As of 2013 [ update ] , the oldest tree-ring measurements in the Northern Hemisphere are a floating sequence extending from about 12,580 to 13,900 years .
