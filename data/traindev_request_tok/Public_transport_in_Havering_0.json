The 11 lines collectively handle up to 5 million passengers a day . The system 's first tunnels were built just below the surface , using the cut-and-cover method ; later , smaller , roughly circular tunnels - which gave rise to its nickname , the Tube - were dug through at a deeper level . The system has 270 stations and 250 miles . The current operator , London Underground Limited ( LUL ) , is a wholly owned subsidiary of Transport for London ( TfL ) , the statutory corporation responsible for the transport network in London region . As of 2015 [ update ] , 92% of operational expenditure is covered by passenger fares . The Travelcard ticket was introduced in 1983 and Oyster , a contactless ticketing system , in 2003 .
