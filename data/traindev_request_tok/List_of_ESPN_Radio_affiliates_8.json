The Heat compete in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) as a member of the league 's Eastern Conference Southeast Division . The Heat play their home games at American Airlines Arena , and have won three NBA championships . The franchise began play in the 1988-89 NBA season as an expansion team . After a period of mediocrity , the Heat would gain relevance during the 1990s following the appointment of former head coach Pat Riley in the role of team president . Riley would construct the high-profile trades of Alonzo Mourning in 1995 , and of Tim Hardaway in 1996 , which immediately propelled the team into playoff contention . Mourning and Hardaway would eventually lead the Heat to four division titles , prior to their departures in 2001 and 2002 , respectively . As a result , the team struggled , and entered into a rebuild in time for the 2002-03 season . Led by Dwyane Wade , and following a trade for former NBA Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) Shaquille O'Neal , Miami advanced to play in the NBA Finals in 2006 , where they clinched their first championship , led by Riley as head coach . After the departure of O'Neal two years later , the team entered into another period of decline for the remainder of the 2000s . This saw the resignation of Riley as head coach , who returned to his position as team president , and was replaced by Erik Spoelstra . In 2010 , after creating significant cap space , the Heat partnered Wade with former league MVP LeBron James , and perennial NBA All-Star Chris Bosh , creating the Big Three ."
