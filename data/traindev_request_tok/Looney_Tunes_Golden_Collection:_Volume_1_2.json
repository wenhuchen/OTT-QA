  "/wiki/Elmer_Fudd": "Elmer J. Fudd is a fictional cartoon character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies series , and an adversary of Bugs Bunny . He has one of the more disputed origins in the Warner Bros. cartoon pantheon ( second only to Bugs himself ) . His aim is to hunt Bugs , but he usually ends up seriously injuring himself and other antagonizing characters . He speaks in an unusual way , replacing his Rs and Ls with Ws , so he always refers to Bugs Bunny as a scwewy wabbit . Elmer 's signature catchphrase is , Shhh . Be vewy vewy quiet , I 'm hunting wabbits , as well as his trademark laughter . The best known Elmer Fudd cartoons include Chuck Jones ' work What 's Opera , Doc ? ( one of the few times Fudd bested Bugs , though he felt bad about it ) , the Rossini parody Rabbit of Seville , and the Hunting Trilogy of Rabbit Season/Duck Season shorts ( Rabbit Fire , Rabbit Seasoning , and Duck ! Rabbit , Duck ! ) with Fudd , Bugs Bunny , and Daffy Duck . An earlier character named Egghead set some of Elmer 's aspects before the character 's more conspicuous features were set .",
  "/wiki/Happy_Rabbit_(character)": "Bugs Bunny is an animated cartoon character , created in the late 1930s by Leon Schlesinger Productions ( later Warner Bros. Cartoons ) and voiced originally by Mel Blanc . Bugs is best known for his starring roles in the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of animated short films , produced by Warner Bros . Though a similar character called Happy Rabbit debuted in the WB cartoon Porky 's Hare Hunt ( 1938 ) and appeared in a few subsequent shorts , the definitive character of Bugs is widely credited to have made his debut in director Tex Avery 's Oscar-nominated film A Wild Hare ( 1940 ) . Bugs is an anthropomorphic gray and white rabbit or hare who is famous for his flippant , insouciant personality . He is also characterized by a Brooklyn accent , his portrayal as a trickster , and his catch phrase Eh.What 's up , doc ? . Due to Bugs ' popularity during the golden age of American animation , he became not only an American cultural icon and the official mascot of Warner Bros. Entertainment , but also one of the most recognizable characters in the world . He can thus be seen in the older Warner Bros. company logos . Since his debut , Bugs has appeared in various short films , feature films , compilations , TV series , music records , comics , video games , award shows , amusement park rides , and commercials . He has also appeared in more films than any other cartoon character , is the 9th most-portrayed film personality in the world , and has his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame .",

It was later reissued as a Blue Ribbon Merrie Melodies cartoon . Fast and Furry-ous was the debut for Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner . It set the template for the series , in which Wile E. Coyote ( here given the Latin name Carnivorous Vulgaris ) tries to catch the Road Runner ( Accelleratii Incredibus ) through many traps , plans and products , although in this first cartoon not all of the products are yet made by ACME . The title is a play on the old expression fast and furious .",
  "/wiki/Wile_E._Coyote_and_Road_Runner": "Wile E. Coyote ( also known simply as the Coyote ) and the Road Runner are a duo of cartoon characters from the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons . In each episode , the Coyote repeatedly attempts to catch and subsequently eat the Road Runner , a fast-running ground bird , but is never successful . Instead of his animal instincts , the Coyote uses absurdly complex contraptions ( sometimes in the manner of Rube Goldberg ) to try to catch his prey , which backfire comically , with the Coyote often getting injured in slapstick fashion . Many of the items for these contrivances are mail-ordered from a variety of companies that are all named Acme . One running gag running gag involves the Coyote falling from a high cliff . After he goes over the edge , the rest of the scene , shot from a bird's-eye view , shows him falling into a canyon so deep , that his figure is eventually lost to sight . This is followed , a second or two later , by the rising of a dust cloud from the canyon floor as the Coyote hits . Most of the cartoons identify the characters and show a fake Latin species name . The Road Runner is called by such names as Accelerati incredibilus , Velocitus tremenjus , Birdibus zippibus , Speedipus rex and Morselus babyfatious tastius . Species names for Wile E. Coyote include Carnivorous slobbius , Eatius birdius , Overconfidentii vulgaris , Poor schinookiusor Caninus nervousrex . The characters were created by animation director Chuck Jones and writer Michael Maltese in 1948 for Warner Bros. , while the template for their adventures was the work of writer Michael Maltese . The characters star in a long-running series of theatrical cartoon shorts ( the first 16 of which were written by Maltese ) and occasional made-for-television cartoons .",

The word gossamer means any sort of thin , fragile , transparent material . In particular , it can refer to a kind of delicate , sheer gauze or a light cobweb .

  "/wiki/Porky_Pig": "Porky Pig is an animated character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons . He was the first character created by the studio to draw audiences based on his star power , and the animators created many critically acclaimed shorts featuring the character . Even after he was supplanted by later characters , Porky continued to be popular with moviegoers and , more importantly , the Warners directors , who recast him in numerous everyman and sidekick roles . He is known for his signature line at the end of many shorts , Th-th-th-that 's all folks ! This slogan ( without stuttering ) had also been used by both Bosko and Buddy and even Beans at the end of Looney Tunes cartoons . In contrast , the Merrie Melodies series used the slogan : So Long , Folks ! until the mid 1930s when it was replaced with the same one used on the Looney Tunes series ( when Bugs Bunny was the closing character , he would break the pattern by simply saying , in his Brooklynese accent , And Dat 's De End ! ) . He is the oldest continuing Looney Tunes character . Porky 's most distinctive trait is a severe stutter , for which he sometimes compensates by replacing his words ; for example , What 's going on ? might become What 's guh-guh-guh-guh - .what 's happening ? Porky 's age varied widely in the series ; originally conceived as an innocent seven-year-old piglet ( explicitly mentioned as such in Porky 's Preview ) , Porky was more frequently cast as an adult , often being cast as the competent straight man in the series in later years . In the ending of many Looney Tunes cartoons , Porky Pig bursts through a bass drum head , and his attempt to close the show with The End becomes Th-Th-The , Th-Th-The , Th-Th .",

Coyote - brown fur , wiry body , and huge ears , but with a red nose in place of the Coyote 's black one ; ( usually ) white eyes instead of the Coyote 's yellow ones ; and , occasionally , a fang protruding from his mouth . He also shares the Coyote 's appetite and persistent use of Acme Corporation products , but he covets sheep instead of roadrunners and , when he speaks , does not have the upper-class accent or the egotistical bearing of the Coyote . Another crucial difference is that of personality : Ralph does not have the fanatical drive of the Coyote in pursuing his prey , preferring to abandon his chase at the end of the working day . Sam Sheepdog , by contrast , is a large , burly Berger de Brie ( Briard ) with white or tan fur and a mop of red hair that usually covers his eyes .
