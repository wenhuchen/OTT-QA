  "/wiki/Bugs_Bunny": "Bugs Bunny is an animated cartoon character , created in the late 1930s by Leon Schlesinger Productions ( later Warner Bros. Cartoons ) and voiced originally by Mel Blanc . Bugs is best known for his starring roles in the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of animated short films , produced by Warner Bros . Though a similar character called Happy Rabbit debuted in the WB cartoon Porky 's Hare Hunt ( 1938 ) and appeared in a few subsequent shorts , the definitive character of Bugs is widely credited to have made his debut in director Tex Avery 's Oscar-nominated film A Wild Hare ( 1940 ) . Bugs is an anthropomorphic gray and white rabbit or hare who is famous for his flippant , insouciant personality . He is also characterized by a Brooklyn accent , his portrayal as a trickster , and his catch phrase Eh.What 's up , doc ? . Due to Bugs ' popularity during the golden age of American animation , he became not only an American cultural icon and the official mascot of Warner Bros. Entertainment , but also one of the most recognizable characters in the world . He can thus be seen in the older Warner Bros. company logos . Since his debut , Bugs has appeared in various short films , feature films , compilations , TV series , music records , comics , video games , award shows , amusement park rides , and commercials . He has also appeared in more films than any other cartoon character , is the 9th most-portrayed film personality in the world , and has his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame .",

Jones was nominated for eight Academy Awards , winning three times . He won for the cartoons For Scent-imental Reasons , So Much for So Little , and The Dot and the Line . Robin Williams presented Jones with an Honorary Academy Award in 1996 for his iconic work in the animation industry . Film historian Leonard Maltin has praised Jones ' work at Warner Bros. , MGM and Chuck Jones Enterprises . He also said that the feud that there may have been between Jones and colleague Bob Clampett was mainly because they were so different from each other . In Jerry Beck 's The 50 Greatest Cartoons , ten of the entries were directed by Jones , with four out of the five top cartoons ( including first place ) being Jones shorts .",

  "/wiki/Porky_Pig": "Porky Pig is an animated character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons . He was the first character created by the studio to draw audiences based on his star power , and the animators created many critically acclaimed shorts featuring the character . Even after he was supplanted by later characters , Porky continued to be popular with moviegoers and , more importantly , the Warners directors , who recast him in numerous everyman and sidekick roles . He is known for his signature line at the end of many shorts , Th-th-th-that 's all folks ! This slogan ( without stuttering ) had also been used by both Bosko and Buddy and even Beans at the end of Looney Tunes cartoons . In contrast , the Merrie Melodies series used the slogan : So Long , Folks ! until the mid 1930s when it was replaced with the same one used on the Looney Tunes series ( when Bugs Bunny was the closing character , he would break the pattern by simply saying , in his Brooklynese accent , And Dat 's De End ! ) . He is the oldest continuing Looney Tunes character . Porky 's most distinctive trait is a severe stutter , for which he sometimes compensates by replacing his words ; for example , What 's going on ? might become What 's guh-guh-guh-guh - .what 's happening ? Porky 's age varied widely in the series ; originally conceived as an innocent seven-year-old piglet ( explicitly mentioned as such in Porky 's Preview ) , Porky was more frequently cast as an adult , often being cast as the competent straight man in the series in later years . In the ending of many Looney Tunes cartoons , Porky Pig bursts through a bass drum head , and his attempt to close the show with The End becomes Th-Th-The , Th-Th-The , Th-Th .",
