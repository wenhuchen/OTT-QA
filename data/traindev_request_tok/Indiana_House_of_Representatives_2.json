  "/wiki/Committee_of_the_Whole": "A committee of the whole is a meeting of a deliberative assembly according to modified procedural rules based on those of a committee . The committee includes all members of the assembly , except that some officers may be replaced . As with other committees , the activities of a committee of the whole are limited to considering and making recommendations on matters that the assembly has referred to it ; it can not take up other matters or vote directly on the assembly 's business . The purpose of a committee of the whole is to relax the usual limits on debate , allowing a more open exchange of views without the urgency of a final vote . Debates in a committee of the whole may be recorded but are often excluded from the assembly 's minutes . After debating , the committee submits its conclusions to the assembly ( that is , to itself ) and business continues according to the normal rules . In legislative assemblies , the committee stage of important bills is typically conducted by the committee of the whole , whereas lesser bills may be considered in smaller committees .",
