  "/wiki/Eastbourne": "Eastbourne ( /\u02c8i\u02d0stb\u0254\u02d0rn/ ( listen ) ) is a town , seaside resort and borough in the non-metropolitan county of East Sussex on the south coast of England , 19 miles ( 31 km ) east of Brighton . Eastbourne is immediately to the east of Beachy Head , the highest chalk sea cliff in Great Britain and part of the larger Eastbourne Downland Estate . With a seafront consisting largely of Victorian hotels , a pier and a Napoleonic era fort and military museum , Eastbourne was developed at the direction of the Duke of Devonshire from 1859 from four separate hamlets . It has a growing population , a broad economic base and is home to companies in a wide range of industries . Though Eastbourne is a relatively new town , there is evidence of human occupation in the area from the Stone Age . The town grew as a fashionable tourist resort largely thanks to prominent landowner , William Cavendish , later to become the Duke of Devonshire . Cavendish appointed architect Henry Currey to design a street plan for the town , but not before sending him to Europe to draw inspiration . The resulting mix of architecture is typically Victorian and remains a key feature of Eastbourne . As a seaside resort Eastbourne derives a large and increasing income from tourism , with revenue from traditional seaside attractions augmented by conferences , public events and cultural sightseeing . The other main industries in Eastbourne include trade and retail , healthcare , education , construction , manufacturing , professional scientific and the technical sector . Eastbourne 's population is growing ; between 2001 and 2011 it increased from 89,800 to 99,412 . The 2011 census shows that the average age of residents has decreased as the town has attracted students , families and those commuting to London and Brighton .",
  "/wiki/Methodism": "Methodism is an umbrella term used to describe denominations of Protestant Christianity which follow the line of the Methodist movement . Methodist denominations are historically related and derive their doctrine of practice and belief from the life and teachings of John Wesley . George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . [ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals , collectively known as the Social Gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people .",
  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

  "/wiki/St_Elisabeth's_Church,_Eastbourne": "St Elisabeth 's Church is a church in the Old Town area of Eastbourne , England . It was built in 1938 to the designs of local architects Stonham & Sons and Fenning . The church hall is a good example of the architecture of the period . St E 's , as it is affectionately referred to , is an Anglican church within the Diocese of Chichester . The original derelict church building , which is set for demolition in 2019 and 2020 , once contained chancel paintings by the art historian and conservator , Ernest William Tristram ( 1882-1952 ) . Now housed in the new domed church building next door , the Tristram Panels depict the life of John the Baptist and his parents , the priest Zacharias and his wife Elizabeth . ( Tristram also painted a limited number of original works , including the panels at St Elisabeth 's and paintings at York Minster and St Fin Barre 's Cathedral in Cork City ) . In addition , St Elisabeth 's crypt contained a series of large wall paintings by the artist Hans Feibusch ( 1898-1998 ) . Through this work he came to the attention of Charles Herbert Reilly , professor of architecture , and George Bell who provided Feinbusch with the opportunity to create a mural of his own design at St Elisabeth 's in 1944 . Feibusch chose the allegory of Pilgrim 's Progress as a vehicle for his own story as a refugee fleeing Nazi Germany and his eventual acceptance in 1940s Britain . Feibusch enlisted the help of local people to complete the mural , which is now a registered War Memorial dedicated to civilian casualties of war .",
  "/wiki/Anglicanism": "Anglicanism is a Western Christian tradition which has developed from the practices , liturgy , and identity of the Church of England following the English Reformation . Adherents of Anglicanism are called Anglicans , or Episcopalians in some countries . The majority of Anglicans are members of national or regional ecclesiastical provinces of the international Anglican Communion , which forms the third-largest Christian communion in the world , after the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church . They are in full communion with the See of Canterbury , and thus the Archbishop of Canterbury , whom the communion refers to as its primus inter pares ( Latin , first among equals ) . He calls the decennial Lambeth Conference , chairs the meeting of primates , and is the president of the Anglican Consultative Council . Some churches that are not part of the Anglican Communion or recognised by the Anglican Communion also call themselves Anglican , including those that are part of the Continuing Anglican movement and Anglican realignment . Anglicans base their Christian faith on the Bible , traditions of the apostolic Church , apostolic succession ( historic episcopate ) , and the writings of the Church Fathers . Anglicanism forms one of the branches of Western Christianity , having definitively declared its independence from the Holy See at the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement . Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary Protestantism . These reforms in the Church of England were understood by one of those most responsible for them , Thomas Cranmer , the Archbishop of Canterbury , and others as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions , namely Lutheranism and Calvinism . In the first half of the 17th century , the Church of England and its associated Church of Ireland were presented by some Anglican divines as comprising a distinct Christian tradition , with theologies , structures , and forms of worship representing a different kind of middle way , or via media , between Protestantism and Catholicism - a perspective that came to be highly influential in later theories of Anglican identity and expressed in the description of Anglicanism as Catholic and Reformed . The degree of distinction between Protestant and Catholic tendencies within the Anglican tradition is routinely a matter of debate both within specific Anglican churches and throughout the Anglican Communion .",

  "/wiki/Baptists": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and doing so by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or aspersion ) . Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency ( the responsibility and accountability of every person before God ) , sola fide ( salvation by faith alone ) , sola scriptura ( scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice ) and congregationalist church government . Baptists generally recognize two ordinances : baptism and communion . Diverse from their beginning , those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe , how they worship , their attitudes toward other Christians , and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship . Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam , Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law , so that individuals might have freedom of religion . Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the 18th and 19th centuries , the First and Second Great Awakening increased church membership in the United States . Baptist missionaries have spread their faith to every continent .",

They were developed in the mid-19th century initially in the United Kingdom . Corrugated iron was first used for roofing in London in 1829 by civil engineer Henry Robinson Palmer , and the patent was later sold to Richard Walker who advertised portable buildings for export in 1832 . The technology for producing the corrugated sheets improved , and to prevent corrosion , the sheets were galvanised with a coating of zinc , a process developed by Stanislas Sorel in Paris in the 1830s . After 1850 , many types of prefabricated buildings were produced , including churches , chapels and mission halls .",

  "/wiki/Central_Methodist_Church,_Eastbourne": "The former Central Methodist Church was until 2018 the main Methodist place of worship in Eastbourne , a town and borough in the English county of East Sussex . The large town-centre building , with attached schoolrooms and ancillary buildings , was the successor to earlier Methodist places of worship in the area . Soldiers brought the denomination to the area in 1803 , when an isolated collection of clifftop villages stood where the 19th-century resort town of Eastbourne developed . A society they formed in that year to encourage Methodism 's growth and outreach survives . Local Methodist worshipper and historian Carlos Crisford designed the lavish church in 1907 , and it has been used for worship ever since - even as several other Methodist churches in the town and surrounding villages have declined and closed . For several years until 2013 , it also housed a Baptist congregation displaced from their own church building . Central Methodist Church is a Grade II listed building . A reorganisation of Methodist worship in the Eastbourne area and closer links with the United Reformed Church led to the formation of a Local ecumenical partnership in early 2018 between Central Methodist Church , Greenfield Methodist Church and two United Reformed congregations , which all came together under the name Emmanuel Church . Worship was consolidated at one of the buildings pending a rebuilding project to provide a new church and community building , and the other premises - including Central Methodist Church - were vacated . The church was then occupied by a Pentecostal group , which has renamed the premises Deliverance Centre Eastbourne and which continues to use the church as its main place of worship .",
  "/wiki/Congregational_church": "Congregational churches ( also Congregationalist churches ; Congregationalism ) are Protestant churches in the Reformed tradition practicing congregationalist church governance , in which each congregation independently and autonomously runs its own affairs . Congregationalism , as defined by the Pew Research Center , is estimated to represent 0.5 percent of the worldwide Protestant population ; though their polity-related customs and other ideas influenced significant parts of Protestantism , as well as other Christian congregations . The report defines it very narrowly , encompassing mainly denominations in the United States and the United Kingdom , which can trace their history back to nonconforming Protestants , Puritans , Separatists , Independents , English religious groups coming out of the English Civil War , and other English dissenters not satisfied with the degree to which the Church of England had been reformed . Congregationalist tradition has a presence in the United States , the United Kingdom , Ireland , Canada , South Africa , Australia , New Zealand , and various island nations in the Pacific region . It has been introduced either by immigrant dissenter Protestants or by missionary organization such as the London Missionary Society . A number of evangelical Congregational churches are members of the World Evangelical Congregational Fellowship . In the United Kingdom , many Congregational churches claim their descent from Protestant denominations formed on a theory of union published by the theologian and English separatist Robert Browne in 1582 . Other accounts trace these origins further back to the London Underground Church of the 1560s . Ideas of nonconforming Protestants during the Puritan Reformation of the Church of England laid foundation for these churches . In England , the early Congregationalists were called Separatists or Independents to distinguish them from the similarly Calvinistic Presbyterians , whose churches embrace a polity based on the governance of elders . Congregationalists also differed with the Reformed churches using episcopalian church governance , which is usually led by a bishop . Congregationalism in the United States traces its origins to the Puritans of New England , who wrote the Cambridge Platform of 1648 to describe the autonomy of the church and its association with others .",

  "/wiki/Christian_Science": "Christian Science is a set of beliefs and practices belonging to the metaphysical family of new religious movements . [ n 2 ] It was developed in 19th-century New England by Mary Baker Eddy , who argued in her 1875 book Science and Health that sickness is an illusion that can be corrected by prayer alone . [ n 3 ] The book became Christian Science 's central text , along with the Bible , and by 2001 had sold over nine million copies . Eddy and 26 followers were granted a charter in 1879 to found the Church of Christ , Scientist , and in 1894 the Mother Church , The First Church of Christ , Scientist , was built in Boston , Massachusetts . Christian Science became the fastest growing religion in the United States , with nearly 270,000 members there by 1936 , a figure that had declined by 1990 to just over 100,000 , and by 2009 reportedly to under 50,000 . The church is known for its newspaper , The Christian Science Monitor , which won seven Pulitzer Prizes between 1950 and 2002 , and for its public Reading Rooms around the world . [ n 4 ] Eddy described Christian Science as a return to primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing . There are key differences between Christian Science theology and that of traditional Christianity . In particular , adherents subscribe to a radical form of philosophical idealism , believing that reality is purely spiritual and the material world an illusion . This includes the view that disease is a mental error rather than physical disorder , and that the sick should be treated not by medicine but by a form of prayer that seeks to correct the beliefs responsible for the illusion of ill health . The church does not require that Christian Scientists avoid all medical care - adherents use dentists , optometrists , obstetricians , physicians for broken bones , and vaccination when required by law - but maintains that Christian-Science prayer is most effective when not combined with medicine . Between the 1880s and 1990s , the avoidance of medical treatment led to the deaths of several adherents and their children .",

Evangelicals believe in the centrality of the conversion or born again experience in receiving salvation , in the authority of the Bible as God 's revelation to humanity , and in spreading the Christian message . The movement has long had a presence in the Anglosphere before spreading further afield in the 19th , 20th and early 21st centuries . Its origins are usually traced to 1738 , with various theological streams contributing to its foundation , including English Methodism , the Moravian Church ( in particular its bishop Nicolaus Zinzendorf and his community at Herrnhut ) , and German Lutheran Pietism . Preeminently , John Wesley and other early Methodists were at the root of sparking this new movement during the First Great Awakening . Today , evangelicals are found across many Protestant branches , as well as in various denominations not subsumed to a specific branch . Among leaders and major figures of the evangelical Protestant movement were John Wesley , George Whitefield , Jonathan Edwards , Billy Graham , Bill Bright , Harold Ockenga , John Stott and Martyn Lloyd-Jones . The movement gained great momentum during the 18th and 19th centuries with the Great Awakenings in Great Britain and the United States . In 2016 , there were an estimated 619 million evangelicals in the world , meaning that one in four Christians would be classified as evangelical . The United States has the largest concentration of evangelicals in the world . American evangelicals are a quarter of the nation 's population and its single largest religious group . The main movements are Baptist churches , Pentecostalism , charismatic Evangelicalism , neo-charismatic Evangelicalism and nondenominational Evangelicalism .",

  "/wiki/Open_Brethren": "The Open Brethren , sometimes called Christian Brethren , are a group of Evangelical Christian churches that arose in the late 1820s as part of the Assembly Movement . They originated in Ireland before spreading throughout the British Isles , and now have an estimated 26,000 assemblies worldwide . The Open Brethren form independent , autonomous assemblies and the name Open is given to them to distinguish them from Exclusive Brethren , with whom they share historical roots . The division of the Plymouth Brethren into the Open Brethren and Exclusive Brethren took place in 1848 . Open Brethren are also commonly known as Plymouth Brethren , especially in North America . Many Open Brethren outside of North America , however , are unwilling to use the Plymouth Brethren designation because it is associated with the Exclusive Brethren , particularly the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church , which has often been accused of being a cult and has attracted a considerable degree of unfavourable publicity in the media . The Brethren are committed to missionary work and hold that the Bible is the first authority in matters of faith and practice . Each assembly ( or congregation ) is independent of the others in doctrinal matters , yet there is a high degree of communication and cooperation among those who share similar doctrine and practice . Open Brethren assemblies form a continuum , from tight gatherings that extend fellowship only to those who have first left other denominations , to very loose gatherings that receive into fellowship any stranger without question . A building associated with a group of open brethren is usually called a Gospel Chapel , Gospel Hall , Bible Chapel , Christian Assembly , or other similar term .

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",

  "/wiki/English_Gothic_architecture": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style . So are numerous castles , palaces , great houses , universities , and many smaller unpretentious secular buildings , including almshouses and trade halls .",
