As a Columbia University college student in the 1940s , he began friendships with William S. Burroughs and Jack Kerouac , forming the core of the Beat Generation . He vigorously opposed militarism , economic materialism , and sexual repression , and he embodied various aspects of this counterculture with his views on drugs , hostility to bureaucracy , and openness to Eastern religions . Ginsberg is best known for his poem Howl in which he denounced what he saw as the destructive forces of capitalism and conformity in the United States . San Francisco police and US Customs seized Howl in 1956 , and it attracted widespread publicity in 1957 when it became the subject of an obscenity trial , as it described heterosexual and homosexual sex at a time when sodomy laws made homosexual acts a crime in every state . The poem reflected Ginsberg 's own sexuality and his relationships with a number of men , including Peter Orlovsky , his lifelong partner . Judge Clayton W. Horn ruled that Howl was not obscene : Would there be any freedom of press or speech if one must reduce his vocabulary to vapid innocuous euphemisms ? Ginsberg was a Buddhist who studied Eastern religious disciplines extensively . He lived modestly , buying his clothing in second-hand stores and residing in apartments in New York 's East Village . One of his most influential teachers was Tibetan Buddhist Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa , the founder of the Naropa Institute in Boulder , Colorado .

He was a founder of the Mattachine Society , the first sustained gay rights group in the United States , as well as the Radical Faeries , a loosely affiliated gay spiritual movement . Born to an upper middle class family in England , Hay was raised in Chile and California . From an early age he acknowledged his same-sex sexual attraction , and came under the influence of Marxism . Briefly studying at Stanford University , he subsequently became a professional actor in Los Angeles , where he joined the Communist Party USA , becoming a committed activist in left-wing labor and anti-racist campaigns . As a result of societal pressure , he attempted to become heterosexual by marrying a female Party activist in 1938 , with whom he adopted two children . Recognizing that he remained homosexual , his marriage ended and in 1950 he founded the Mattachine Society . Although involved in campaigns for gay rights , he resigned from the Society in 1953 . Hay 's developing belief in the cultural minority status of homosexuals led him to take a stand against the assimilationism advocated by the majority of gay rights campaigners . He subsequently became a co-founder of the Los Angeles chapter of the Gay Liberation Front in 1969 , although in 1970 he moved to New Mexico with his longtime partner John Burnside . Hay 's ongoing interest in American Indian religion led the couple to co-found the Radical Faeries in 1979 with Don Kilhefner and Mitchell L. Walker .

The experiment , which other researchers subsequently repeated , argues that homosexuality is not a mental disorder , as there was no detectable difference between homosexual and heterosexual men in terms of mental adjustment . Her work argued that a false correlation between homosexuality and mental illness had formed the basis of classifying homosexuality as a mental disorder by studying only a sample group that contained homosexual men with a history of treatment for mental illness . This is of critical importance in refuting cultural heterosexism because it argues that homosexuality is not developmentally inferior to heterosexuality . Her demonstration that it is not an illness led the way to the eventual removal of homosexuality from the American Psychiatric Association 's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders .",

Set in the distant future , the film chronicles the conflict between rival noble families as they battle for control of the extremely harsh desert planet Arrakis , also known as Dune . The planet is the only source of the drug melange - also called the spice - which allows prescience and is vital to space travel , making it the most essential and valuable commodity in the universe . Paul Atreides is the scion and heir of a powerful noble family , whose inheritance of control over Arrakis brings them into conflict with its former overlords , House Harkonnen . Paul is also a candidate for the Kwisatz Haderach , a messianic figure in the Bene Gesserit religion .
