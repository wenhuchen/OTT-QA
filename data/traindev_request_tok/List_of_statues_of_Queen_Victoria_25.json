Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah occupied Calcutta in 1756 , and the East India Company retook it the following year . In 1793 the East India company was strong enough to abolish Nizamat ( local rule ) , and assumed full sovereignty of the region . Under the company rule , and later under the British Raj , Calcutta served as the capital of British-held territories in India until 1911 , when its perceived geographical disadvantages , combined with growing nationalism in Bengal , led to a shift of the capital to New Delhi . Calcutta was the centre for the Indian independence movement ; it remains a hotbed of contemporary state politics .",
