  "/wiki/Rajputs": "Rajput ( from Sanskrit raja-putra , son of a king ) is a large multi-component cluster of castes , kin bodies , and local groups , sharing social status and ideology of genealogical descent originating from the Indian subcontinent . The term Rajput covers various patrilineal clans historically associated with warriorhood : several clans claim Rajput status , although not all claims are universally accepted . The term Rajput acquired its present meaning only in the 16th century , although it is also anachronistically used to describe the earlier lineages that emerged in northern India from 6th century onwards . In the 11th century , the term rajaputra appeared as a non-hereditary designation for royal officials . Gradually , the Rajputs emerged as a social class comprising people from a variety of ethnic and geographical backgrounds . During the 16th and 17th centuries , the membership of this class became largely hereditary , although new claims to Rajput status continued to be made in the later centuries . Several Rajput-ruled kingdoms played a significant role in many regions of central and northern India until the 20th century . The Rajput population and the former Rajput states are found in north , west , central and east India . These areas include Rajasthan , Gujarat , Uttar Pradesh , Himachal Pradesh , Haryana , Jammu , Uttarakhand , Bihar and Madhya Pradesh .",

It also represents recursion and equivalence of the macrocosm and the microcosm by astronomical numbers , and by specific alignments related to the geography of the place and the presumed linkages of the deity and the patron . A temple incorporates all elements of Hindu cosmos - presenting the good , the evil and the human , as well as the elements of Hindu sense of cyclic time and the essence of life - symbolically presenting dharma , kama , artha , moksa , and karma . The spiritual principles symbolically represented in Hindu temples are given in the ancient Sanskrit texts of India ( for example , Vedas and Upanishads ) , while their structural rules are described in various ancient Sanskrit treatises on architecture ( Brhat Samhita , Vastu Sastras ) . The layout , the motifs , the plan and the building process recite ancient rituals , geometric symbolisms , and reflect beliefs and values innate within various schools of Hinduism . A Hindu temple is a spiritual destination for many Hindus , as well as landmarks around which ancient arts , community celebrations and economy have flourished . Hindu temples come in many styles , are situated in diverse locations , deploy different construction methods and are adapted to different deities and regional beliefs , yet almost all of them share certain core ideas , symbolism and themes .

It is the primary liturgical language of Hinduism and the predominant language of most works of Hindu philosophy as well as some of the principal texts of Buddhism and Jainism . Sanskrit , in its variants and numerous dialects , was the lingua franca of ancient and medieval India . In the early 1st millennium CE , along with Buddhism and Hinduism , Sanskrit migrated to Southeast Asia , parts of East Asia and Central Asia , emerging as a language of high culture and of local ruling elites in these regions . Sanskrit is an Old Indo-Aryan language . As one of the oldest documented members of the Indo-European family of languages , [ note 1 ] [ note 2 ] Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies . It is related to Greek and Latin , as well as Hittite , Luwian , Old Avestan and many other living and extinct languages with historical significance to Europe , West Asia , Central Asia and South Asia . It traces its linguistic ancestry to the Proto-Indo-Aryan language , Proto-Indo-Iranian and the Proto-Indo-European languages . Sanskrit is traceable to the 2nd millennium BCE in a form known as Vedic Sanskrit , with the Rigveda as the earliest-known composition . A more refined and standardized grammatical form called Classical Sanskrit emerged in the mid-1st millennium BCE with the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b treatise of P\u0101\u1e47ini . Sanskrit , though not necessarily Classical Sanskrit , is the root language of many Prakrit languages . Examples include numerous , modern , North Indian , subcontinental daughter languages such as Hindi , Marathi , Bengali , Punjabi , Gujarati , Sindhi , Kashmiri , Kumaoni , Garhwali , Urdu , Dogri , Maithili , Konkani , Assamese , Odia , and Nepali .",
  "/wiki/Eastern_Ganga_dynasty": "The Eastern Ganga dynasty was a medieval Indian dynasty that reigned from Kalinga from the 11th century to the early 15th century . The territory ruled by the dynasty consisted of the whole of the modern-day Indian state of Odisha as well as parts of West Bengal , Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh . The early rulers of the dynasty ruled from Dantapura ; the capital was later moved to Kalinganagara ( modern Mukhalingam ) , and ultimately to Kataka ( modern Cuttack ) . Today , they are most remembered as the builders of the Konark Sun Temple , a UNESCO World Heritage site at Konark , Odisha . The rulers of Eastern Ganga dynasty defended their kingdom from the constant attacks of the Muslim rulers . This kingdom prospered through trade and commerce and the wealth was mostly used in the construction of temples . The rule of the dynasty came to an end under the reign of King Bhanudeva IV ( 1414-34 ) , in the early 15th century . Their currency was called Ganga fanams and was greatly influenced by the Cholas and Eastern Chalukyas of southern India .",

The term particularly refers to the annual Rathajatra in Odisha , Jharkhand , West Bengal and other East Indian states , particularly the Odia festival that involve a public procession with a chariot with deities Jagannath ( Vishnu avatar ) , Balabhadra ( his brother ) , Subhadra ( his sister ) and Sudarshana Chakra ( his weapon ) on a ratha , a wooden deula-shaped chariot . It attracts over a million Hindu pilgrims who join the procession each year . Rathajatra processions have been historically common in Vishnu-related ( Jagannath , Rama , Krishna ) traditions in Hinduism across India , in Shiva-related traditions , saints and goddesses in Nepal , with Tirthankaras in Jainism , as well as tribal folk religions found in the eastern states of India . Notable ratha jatras in India include the Ratha jatra of Puri , the Dhamrai Ratha yatra and the Ratha yatra of Mahesh . Hindu communities outside India , such as in Singapore , celebrate Rathajatra such as those associated with Jagannath , Krishna , Shiva and Mariamman . According to Knut Jacobsen , a Rathajatra has religious origins and meaning , but the events have a major community heritage , social sharing and cultural significance to the organizers and participants .",
  "/wiki/Temple_car": "Temple cars are chariots that are used to carry representations of Hindu gods . The cars are usually used on annual festival days called 'Ther Thiruvizha ' ( \u0ba4\u0bc7\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bbe ) , during which many people gather around . The size of the largest temple cars inspired the Anglo-Indian term Juggernaut ( from Jagannath ) , signifying a tremendous , virtually unstoppable force or phenomenon .

  "/wiki/Deities": "A deity ( /\u02c8di\u02d0\u026ati/ ( listen ) , /\u02c8de\u026a-/ ( listen ) ) or god is a supernatural being considered divine or sacred . The Oxford Dictionary of English defines deity as a god or goddess ( in a polytheistic religion ) , or anything revered as divine . C. Scott Littleton defines a deity as a being with powers greater than those of ordinary humans , but who interacts with humans , positively or negatively , in ways that carry humans to new levels of consciousness , beyond the grounded preoccupations of ordinary life . In the English language , a male deity is referred to as a god , while a female deity is referred to as a goddess . Religions can be categorized by how many deities they worship . Monotheistic religions accept only one deity ( predominantly referred to as God ) , polytheistic religions accept multiple deities . Henotheistic religions accept one supreme deity without denying other deities , considering them as aspects of the same divine principle ; and nontheistic religions deny any supreme eternal creator deity but accept a pantheon of deities which live , die and may be reborn like any other being . :35-37:357-58 Although most monotheistic religions traditionally envision their God as omnipotent , omnipresent , omniscient , omnibenevolent , and eternal , none of these qualities are essential to the definition of a deity and various cultures conceptualized their deities differently . Monotheistic religions typically refer to God in masculine terms , :96 while other religions refer to their deities in a variety of ways - masculine , feminine , androgynous and without gender . Historically , many ancient cultures - including the ancient Mesopotamians , Egyptians , Greeks , Romans , and Norsemen- personified natural phenomena , variously as either deliberate causes or effects . Some Avestan and Vedic deities were viewed as ethical concepts . In Indian religions , deities were envisioned as manifesting within the temple of every living being 's body , as sensory organs and mind .",

The temple is the most prominent landmark of Bhubaneswar city and one of the major tourist attractions of the state . The Lingaraja temple is the largest temple in Bhubaneswar . The central tower of the temple is 180 ft ( 55 m ) tall . The temple represents the quintessence of the Kalinga architecture and culminating the medieval stages of the architectural tradition at Bhubaneswar . The temple is believed to be built by the kings from the Somavamsi dynasty , with later additions from the Ganga rulers . The temple is built in the Deula style that has four components namely , vimana ( structure containing the sanctum ) , jagamohana ( assembly hall ) , natamandira ( festival hall ) and bhoga-mandapa ( hall of offerings ) , each increasing in the height to its predecessor .

Bhubaneswar is called the Ekamra Kshetra as the deity of Lingaraja was originally under a mango tree ( Ekamra ) as noted in Ekamra Purana , a 13th-century Sanskrit treatise . The temple is active in worship practises , unlike most other temples in Bhubaneswar and Shiva is worshipped as Harihara , a combined form of Vishnu and Shiva .

  "/wiki/Hindu": "Hindus ( Hindustani : [ \u02c8\u0266\u026andu ] ( listen ) ) are persons who regard themselves as culturally , ethnically , or religiously adhering to aspects of Hinduism . Historically , the term has also been used as a geographical , cultural , and later religious identifier for people living in the Indian subcontinent . The historical meaning of the term Hindu has evolved with time . Starting with the Persian and Greek references to the land of the Indus in the 1st millennium BCE through the texts of the medieval era , the term Hindu implied a geographic , ethnic or cultural identifier for people living in the Indian subcontinent around or beyond the Sindhu ( Indus ) river . By the 16th century , the term began to refer to residents of the subcontinent who were not Turkic or Muslims . [ a ] [ b ] The historical development of Hindu self-identity within the local South Asian population , in a religious or cultural sense , is unclear . Competing theories state that Hindu identity developed in the British colonial era , or that it may have developed post-8th century CE after the Islamic invasion and medieval Hindu-Muslim wars . A sense of Hindu identity and the term Hindu appears in some texts dated between the 13th and 18th century in Sanskrit and Bengali . The 14th- and 18th-century Indian poets such as Vidyapati , Kabir and Eknath used the phrase Hindu dharma ( Hinduism ) and contrasted it with Turaka dharma ( Islam ) . The Christian friar Sebastiao Manrique used the term 'Hindu ' in religious context in 1649 . In the 18th century , the European merchants and colonists began to refer to the followers of Indian religions collectively as Hindus , in contrast to Mohamedans for Mughals and Arabs following Islam . By the mid-19th century , colonial orientalist texts further distinguished Hindus from Buddhists , Sikhs and Jains , but the colonial laws continued to consider all of them to be within the scope of the term Hindu until about mid-20th century .",
  "/wiki/Harihara": "Harihara ( Sanskrit : \u0939\u0930\u093f\u0939\u0930 ) is the fused representation of Vishnu ( Hari ) and Shiva ( Hara ) from the Hindu tradition . Also known as Shankaranarayana ( Shankara is Shiva , and Narayana is Vishnu ) like Brahmanarayana ( Half represents Brahma and half represents Vishnu ) , Harihara is thus revered by both Vaishnavites and Shaivites as a form of the Supreme God . Harihara is also sometimes used as a philosophical term to denote the unity of Vishnu and Shiva as different aspects of the same Ultimate Reality called Brahman . This concept of equivalence of various gods as one principle and oneness of all existence is discussed as Harihara in the texts of Advaita Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy . Some of the earliest sculptures of Harihara , with one half of the image as Vishnu and other half as Shiva , are found in the surviving cave temples of India , such as in the cave 1 and cave 3 of the 6th-century Badami cave temples .",
