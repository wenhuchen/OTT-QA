  "/wiki/Topographic_prominence": "In topography , prominence [ a ] measures the height of a mountain or hill 's summit relative to the lowest contour line encircling it but containing no higher summit within it . It is a measure of the independence of a summit . A peak 's key col ( highest gap between two mountains ) is a unique point on this contour line and the parent peak is some higher mountain , selected according to various criteria .",
  "/wiki/Diablerets": "The Diablerets ( French : Les Diablerets ; lit . the abode of devils ) are a huge ice-covered mountain massif of the Alps , culminating at the Sommet des Diablerets ( VD , VS ) at 3,210 metres ( 10,530 ft ) above sea level and straddling the border between the Swiss cantons of Vaud ( VD ) and Valais ( VS ) . The northeastern part of the massif stretches also into the canton of Bern ( BE ) . The Diablerets massif , which consists of several peaks , extends for about 10 kilometres near the western extremity of the Bernese Alps , between the two deep passes , the Cheville Pass ( 2,038 m ( 6,686 ft ) ) right below the main summit to the south , and the Sanetsch/S\u00e9nin Pass ( 2,252 m ( 7,388 ft ) ) to the east . The mountain is covered by two distinct glaciers , the largest being the Tsanfleuron Glacier and the highest being the Diablerets Glacier . The main summit ( officially referred to as Sommet des Diablerets ) is the highest point in the canton of Vaud . In the latter canton , the mountain has given its name to the nearby village and resort of Les Diablerets , which lies on the north side of the massif . On the south side ( Valais ) the mountain overlooks the hamlet and valley of Derborence .",
  "/wiki/Alps": "The Alps ( /\u00e6lps/ ; French : Alpes [ alp ] ; German : Alpen [ \u02c8alpn\u0329 ] ( listen ) ; Italian : Alpi [ \u02c8alpi ] ; Romansh : Alps ; Slovene : Alpe [ \u02c8\u00e1\u02d0lp\u025b ] ) are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe , [ note 1 ] and stretching approximately 1,200 kilometres ( 750 mi ) across eight Alpine countries ( from west to east ) : France , Switzerland , Monaco , Italy , Liechtenstein , Austria , Germany , and Slovenia . The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided . Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn . Mont Blanc spans the French-Italian border , and at 4,810 m ( 15,781 ft ) is the highest mountain in the Alps . The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4,000 metres ( 13,000 ft ) . The altitude and size of the range affects the climate in Europe ; in the mountains precipitation levels vary greatly and climatic conditions consist of distinct zones . Wildlife such as ibex live in the higher peaks to elevations of 3,400 m ( 11,155 ft ) , and plants such as Edelweiss grow in rocky areas in lower elevations as well as in higher elevations . Evidence of human habitation in the Alps goes back to the Palaeolithic era . A mummified man , determined to be 5,000 years old , was discovered on a glacier at the Austrian-Italian border in 1991 . By the 6th century BC , the Celtic La T\u00e8ne culture was well established . Hannibal famously crossed the Alps with a herd of elephants , and the Romans had settlements in the region . In 1800 , Napoleon crossed one of the mountain passes with an army of 40,000 .",
