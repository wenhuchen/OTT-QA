  "/wiki/Communes_of_France": "The commune ( French pronunciation : \u200b [ k\u0254myn ] ) is a level of administrative division in the French Republic . French communes are analogous to civil townships and incorporated municipalities in the United States and Canada , Gemeinden in Germany , comuni in Italy or ayuntamiento in Spain . The United Kingdom has no exact equivalent , as communes resemble districts in urban areas , but are closer to parishes in rural areas where districts are much larger . Communes are based on historical geographic communities or villages and are vested with significant powers to manage the populations and land of the geographic area covered . The communes are the fourth-level administrative divisions of France . Communes vary widely in size and area , from large sprawling cities with millions of inhabitants like Paris , to small hamlets with only a handful of inhabitants . Communes typically are based on pre-existing villages and facilitate local governance . All communes have names , but not all named geographic areas or groups of people residing together are communes ( lieu dit or bourg ) , the difference residing in the lack of administrative powers . Except for the municipal arrondissements of its largest cities , the communes are the lowest level of administrative division in France and are governed by elected officials ( mayor and a conseil municipal ) with extensive autonomous powers to implement national policy .",
  "/wiki/Departments_of_France": "In the administrative divisions of France , the department ( French : d\u00e9partement , pronounced [ depa\u0281t ( \u0259 ) m\u0251\u0303 ] ) is one of the three levels of government below the national level ( territorial collectivities ) , between the administrative regions and the commune . Ninety-five departments are in metropolitan France , and five are overseas departments , which are also classified as regions . Departments are further subdivided into 334 arrondissements , themselves divided into cantons ; the last two have no autonomy , and are used for the organisation of police , fire departments , and sometimes , elections . Each department is administered by an elected body called a departmental council ( conseil d\u00e9partemental [ sing . ] , conseils d\u00e9partementaux [ plur. ] ) . From 1800 to April 2015 , these were called general councils ( conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sing . conseils g\u00e9n\u00e9raux [ plur. ] ) . Each council has a president . Their main areas of responsibility include the management of a number of social and welfare allowances , of junior high school ( coll\u00e8ge ) buildings and technical staff , and local roads and school and rural buses , and a contribution to municipal infrastructures . Local services of the state administration are traditionally organised at departmental level , where the prefect represents the government ; however , regions have gained importance in this regard since the 2000s , with some department-level services merged into region-level services . The departments were created in 1790 as a rational replacement of Ancien R\u00e9gime provinces with a view to strengthen national unity ; the title department is used to mean a part of a larger whole . Almost all of them were named after physical geographical features ( rivers , mountains , or coasts ) , rather than after historical or cultural territories which could have their own loyalties .",
  "/wiki/Regions_of_France": "France is divided into 18 administrative regions ( French : r\u00e9gions , singular r\u00e9gion [ \u0281e\u0292j\u0254\u0303 ] ) , of which 13 are located in metropolitan France ( i.e . on the European continent ) , while the other five are overseas regions ( not be confused with the overseas collectivities , which have a semi-autonomous status ) . All 13 mainland administrative regions ( including Corsica as of 2019 [ update ] ) are further subdivided into 2 to 13 administrative departments , with the prefect of each region 's administrative center 's department also acting as the regional prefect . The overseas regions administratively consist of only one department each and hence also have the status of overseas departments . Most administrative regions also have the status of regional territorial collectivities , which comes with a local government , with departmental and communal collectivities below the region level . The exceptions are Corsica , the French Guiana , Mayotte , and Martinique , where region and department functions are managed by single local governments having consolidated jurisdiction , and which are known as single territorial collectivities .",
