Jannetty is widely known for his tenure as half of tag team The Rockers , in which he partnered with Shawn Michaels . The duo originally found success during the mid-to-late 1980s under the moniker of The Midnight Rockers , becoming two-time AWA World Tag Team Champions and winning various regional titles . They became one of the foremost teams of the WWF 's Golden Age , headlining multiple events . The Rockers held the WWF World Tag Team Championship in late 1990 , but their reign was voided for disputed reasons . After splitting from Michaels in early 1992 , Jannetty became a one-time WWF Intercontinental Champion and a one-time WWF World Tag Team Champion with the 1-2-3 Kid . He competed in multiple world championship matches between ECW and the WWF from 1995-1996 , but Jannetty 's star faded thereafter , and he was largely used as enhancement talent during a late 1990s run in WCW . He made sporadic appearances for WWE during the latter half of the 2000s ( including a brief 2005 reunion with Michaels ) , and has remained a challenger for titles on the independent circuit . Although his career was continually halted by personal issues and his achievements overshadowed by those of Michaels , Jannetty was described by Talksport as being as smooth and jaw-dropping as his partner , with a drop-kick to rival any ."
