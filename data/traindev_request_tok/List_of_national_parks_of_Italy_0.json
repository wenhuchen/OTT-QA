Geographically , Abruzzo is divided into a mountainous area in the west , which includes the Gran Sasso d'Italia , and a coastal area in the east with beaches on the Adriatic Sea . Abruzzo is considered a region of Southern Italy in terms of its culture , language , history and economy , although geographically it may also be considered central . The Italian Statistical Authority ( ISTAT ) also deems it to be part of Southern Italy , partly because of Abruzzo 's historic association with the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies . Abruzzo is known as the greenest region in Europe as almost half of its territory , the largest in Europe , is set aside as national parks and protected nature reserves . There are three national parks , one regional park , and 38 protected nature reserves . These ensure the survival of 75% of Europe 's living species , including rare species such as the golden eagle , the Abruzzo ( or Abruzzese ) chamois , the Apennine wolf and the Marsican brown bear . Abruzzo is also home to Calderone , Europe 's southernmost glacier . The visiting nineteenth-century Italian diplomat and journalist Primo Levi ( 1853-1917 ) said that the adjectives forte e gentile ( strong and kind ) best describe the beauty of the region and the character of its people .",

The island 's most iconic civilization is the indigenous Nuragic one , which lasted from the 18th century BC to either 238 BC or the 2nd century AD in some areas and to the 6th century AD in the region known as Barbagia . After a period under a political and economic alliance between the Nuragic Sardinians and the Phoenicians , the island was partly conquered by Carthage and Rome , in the late 6th century BC and in 238 BC respectively ; the Roman occupation lasted for 700 years , followed in the Early Middle Ages by the Vandals and the Byzantines . Since the island was finding itself disconnected from Byzantium 's scope of territorial influence , the Sardinians provided themselves with a self-ruling political organization , leading to the birth of the four Judicates . As the Italian maritime republics of Pisa and Genoa struggled to exercise increasing political interference upon the indigenous states , the Crown of Aragon subsumed the island as the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1324 .",
