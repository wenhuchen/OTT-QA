  "/wiki/Shortstop": "Shortstop , abbreviated SS , is the baseball or softball fielding position between second and third base , which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions . Historically the position was assigned to defensive specialists who were typically poor at batting and were often placed at the bottom of the batting order . Today shortstops are often able to hit well and many are placed at the top of the lineup . In the numbering system used by scorers to record defensive plays , the shortstop is assigned the number 6 . More hit balls go to the shortstop than to any other position , as there are more right-handed hitters in baseball than left-handed hitters , and most hitters have a tendency to pull the ball slightly . Like a second baseman , a shortstop must be agile , for example when performing a 4-6-3 double play . Also , like a third baseman , the shortstop fields balls hit to the left side of the infield , where a strong arm is needed to throw out a batter-runner before they reach the safety of first base .",

  "/wiki/First_baseman": "First base , or 1B , is the first of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a baserunner to score a run for that player 's team . A first baseman is the player on the team playing defense who fields the area nearest first base , and is responsible for the majority of plays made at that base . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the first baseman is assigned the number 3 . Also called first sacker or cornerman , the first baseman is ideally a tall player who throws left-handed and possesses good flexibility and quick reflexes . Flexibility is needed because the first baseman receives throws from the other infielders , the catcher and the pitcher after they have fielded ground balls . In order for the runner to be called out , the first baseman must be able to stretch towards the throw and catch it before the runner reaches first base . First base is often referred to as the other hot corner - the hot corner being third base - and therefore , like the third baseman , he must have quick reflexes to field the hardest hit balls down the foul line , mainly by left-handed pull hitters and right-handed hitters hitting to the opposite field . They often are power hitters who have a substantial number of home runs and extra base hits while maintaining a .270 plus batting average . [ citation needed ]",

Sports in which the term is often used include association football , gridiron football , baseball , rugby union , rugby league , softball , and water polo . The term has gained prominence in all sports due to its use in fantasy leagues , but in rugby union and rugby league , it is commonly used by commentators to recognize a player 's versatility . The use of this term to describe a player may in some circumstances be a backhanded compliment , as it suggests the player is n't good enough to be considered a specialist in one position .",

  "/wiki/Second_baseman": "In baseball and softball , second baseman is a fielding position in the infield , between second and first base . The second baseman often possesses quick hands and feet , needs the ability to get rid of the ball quickly , and must be able to make the pivot on a double play . In addition , second basemen are usually right-handed ; only four left-handed throwing players have ever played second base in Major League Baseball since 1950 . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the second baseman is assigned the number 4 . Good second basemen need to have very good range since they have to field balls closer to the first baseman who is often holding runners on , or moving towards the base to cover . On a batted ball to right field , the second baseman goes out towards the ball for the relay . Due to these requirements , second base is sometimes a primarily defensive position in the modern game , but there are hitting stars as well .",

  "/wiki/Starting_pitcher": "In baseball ( hardball or softball ) , a starting pitcher or starter is the first pitcher in the game for each team . A pitcher is credited with a game started if they throw the first pitch to the opponent 's first batter of a game . Starting pitchers are expected to pitch for a significant portion of the game , although their ability to do this depends on many factors , including effectiveness , stamina , health , and strategy . A starting pitcher in professional baseball usually rests three , four , or five days after pitching a game before pitching another . Therefore , most professional baseball teams have four , five or six starting pitchers on their rosters . These pitchers , and the sequence in which they pitch , is known as the rotation . In modern baseball , a five-man rotation is most common . In contrast , a pitcher who enters the game after the first pitch of the game is a relief pitcher . Occasionally , an opening pitcher is used for only a few innings , and is replaced by a long reliever or a pitcher who would typically be a starting pitcher .",

These defenders are the left fielder , the center fielder , and the right fielder . As an outfielder , their duty is to catch fly balls and/ ground balls then to return them to the infield for the out or before the runner advances , if there is any runners on the bases . As an outfielder , they normally play behind the six players located in the field . By convention , each of the nine defensive positions in baseball is numbered . The outfield positions are 7 ( left field ) , 8 ( center field ) and 9 ( right field ) .

  "/wiki/Ezra_Sutton": "Ezra Ballou Sutton ( September 17 , 1849 - June 20 , 1907 ) was an American third baseman in the National Association and Major League Baseball from 1871 to 1888 . Sutton collected 1,574 hits during this time period ; he had a lifetime batting average of .294 . Like many players in an era when walks were more rare , Sutton did not walk a lot , only drawing 169 walks in more than 5,500 plate appearances . By almost all measures , Sutton had his 2 best seasons in 1883 and 1884 - he collected 203 runs and 296 hits during those 2 seasons . On May 8 , 1871 , Sutton hit the first home run in professional baseball history for the Cleveland Forest Citys against the Chicago White Stockings . He would go on to hit another home run later in the game but Cleveland still lost the game 14-12 . The Seneca Falls , New York born Sutton came to the Cleveland Forest Citys in 1870 from the Alert club of Rochester , New York ( who had played the Forest Citys twice in 1869 ) , and then joined the Philadelphia Athletics in 1873 after the Cleveland club failed . As third baseman for each he had the unique distinction of playing in both the first National Association game on May 4 , 1871 and the first National League game on April 22 , 1876 . But his main team was the Boston Red Caps ( later redubbed the Beaneaters ) where he won pennants in 1877 , 1878 , and 1883 .

  "/wiki/Third_baseman": "A third baseman , abbreviated 3B , is the player in baseball whose responsibility is to defend the area nearest to third base - the third of four bases a baserunner must touch in succession to score a run . In the scoring system used to record defensive plays , the third baseman is assigned the number ' 5 ' . The third baseman requires good reflexes in reacting to batted balls , as he is often the closest infielder ( roughly 90-120 feet ) to the batter . The third base position requires a strong and accurate arm , as the third baseman often makes long throws to first base . The third baseman sometimes must throw quickly to second base in time to start a double play . The third baseman must also field fly balls in fair and foul territory . Third base is known as the hot corner , because the third baseman is relatively close to the batter and most right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball hard in this direction . A third baseman must possess good hand-eye coordination and quick reactions in order to catch hard line drives sometimes in excess of 125 miles per hour ( 201 km/h ) . Third basemen often must begin in a position even closer to the batter if a bunt is expected , creating a hazard if the ball is instead hit sharply . As with middle infielders , right-handed throwing players are standard at the position because they do not need to turn their body before throwing across the infield to first base . Mike Squires , who played fourteen games at third base in 1982 and 1983 , is a very rare example of a third baseman who threw lefty . Some third basemen have been converted from middle infielders or outfielders because the position does not require them to run as fast .",
  "/wiki/Charlie_Sweasy": "Charles James Sweasy ( November 2 , 1847 - March 30 , 1908 ) , born Swasey , played second base for the original Cincinnati Red Stockings , the first fully professional baseball team . He returned to Cincinnati in 1876 , hired by the new club that was a charter member of the National League . In the meantime he played for six teams during the five seasons of the National Association , so he may be considered one of the first journeyman ballplayers . A right-handed thrower and batter , he almost exclusively played second base . Born 1847 in Newark , New Jersey , Sweasy 's debut with a major team was in 1866 with the New Jersey Irvingtons that hailed from Irvington , New Jersey about 20 miles inland . Irvington was a new member of the National Association of Base Ball Players , with many other clubs as the association tripled in size to more than 90 in its first post-war season . The Irvingtons frightened the champion Brooklyn Atlantics by winning their first meeting on June 14 and losing their third one only in extra innings on October 29 . Several team members would later play professionally including Sweasy and Andy Leonard , also of Newark .",
  "/wiki/Deacon_White": "James Laurie Deacon White ( December 2 , 1847 - July 7 , 1939 ) was an American baseball player who was one of the principal stars during the first two decades of the sport 's professional era . The outstanding catcher of the 1870s during baseball 's barehanded period , he caught more games than any other player during the decade , and was a major figure on five consecutive championship teams from 1873 to 1877 - three in the National Association ( NA ) , in which he played throughout its five-year existence from 1871 to 1875 , and two in the National League ( NL ) , which was formed as the first fully recognized major league in 1876 , partially as a result of White and three other stars moving from the powerhouse Boston Red Stockings to the Chicago White Stockings . Although he was already 28 when the NL was established , White played 15 seasons in the major leagues , completing a 23-year career at the top levels of the sport . In 1871 , White was the first batter to come to the plate in the National Association , the first professional baseball league . After compiling a .347 batting average over five NA seasons , he led the NL in runs batted in ( RBI ) in its first two seasons of play , and also led the league in batting ( .387 ) , slugging average , hits , triples and total bases in a brief shift to first base in 1877 . For three years afterward , he joined his younger brother Will , a successful pitcher , with the Cincinnati Reds and Cincinnati Stars . In his mid-30s he became an effective third baseman when the toil of catching had become too great , and was a major force on the championship Detroit Wolverines team of 1887 , batting .303 at age 39 . Over the 20-year period of his career , White batted .312 and had more RBI ( 988 ) than any player except Cap Anson . Upon his retirement , he was among baseball 's all-time leaders in career games , at bats , hits and total bases . He ranked fourth in career total chances at third base , fifth in assists , and sixth in putouts and double plays . White was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2013 .",
  "/wiki/Catcher": "Catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player . When a batter takes his/her turn to hit , the catcher crouches behind home plate , in front of the ( home ) umpire , and receives the ball from the pitcher . In addition to this primary duty , the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well . The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket , but in cricket , wicketkeepers are increasingly known for their batting abilities . Positioned behind home plate , the catcher can see the whole field , and is therefore in the best position to direct and lead the other players in a defensive play . The catcher typically calls for pitches using hand signals . The calls are based on the pitcher 's mechanics and strengths , as well as the batter 's tendencies and weaknesses . Foul tips , bouncing balls in the dirt , and contact with runners during plays at the plate are all events to be handled by the catcher , necessitating the use of protective equipment . This includes a mask , chest and throat protectors , shin guards , and a heavily padded catcher 's mitt . Because the position requires a comprehensive understanding of the game 's strategies , the pool of former catchers yields a disproportionate number of managers in both Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball , including such prominent examples as Connie Mack , Steve O'Neill , Al L\u00f3pez , Mike Scioscia , and Joe Torre . The physical and mental demands of being involved on every defensive play can wear catchers down over a long season , and can have a negative effect on their offensive output . Because of the strategic defensive importance of catching , if a catcher has exceptional defensive skills , teams are often willing to overlook their relative offensive weaknesses .",

  "/wiki/Relief_pitcher": "In baseball and softball , a relief pitcher or reliever is a pitcher who enters the game after the starting pitcher is removed due to injury , ineffectiveness , fatigue , ejection , or for other strategic reasons , such as inclement weather delays or pinch hitter substitutions . Relief pitchers are further divided informally into various roles , such as closers , setup men , middle relief pitchers , left/right-handed specialists , and long relievers . Whereas starting pitchers usually rest several days before pitching in a game again due to the number of pitches thrown , relief pitchers are expected to be more flexible and typically pitch more games but with fewer innings pitched . A team 's staff of relievers is normally referred to metonymically as a team 's bullpen , which refers to the area where the relievers sit during games , and where they warm-up prior to entering the game ."
