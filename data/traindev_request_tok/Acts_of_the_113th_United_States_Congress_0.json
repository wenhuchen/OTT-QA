The Act amended the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to increase from $ 20.725 billion to $ 30.425 billion the total amount of notes and obligations ( i.e . federal borrowing authority ) which may be issued by the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) , with the President 's approval , for the National Flood Insurance Program .",
  "/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency": "The Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) is an agency of the United States Department of Homeland Security , initially created by Presidential Reorganization Plan No . 3 of 1978 and implemented by two Executive Orders on April 1 , 1979 . The agency 's primary purpose is to coordinate the response to a disaster that has occurred in the United States and that overwhelms the resources of local and state authorities . The governor of the state in which the disaster occurs must declare a state of emergency and formally request from the president that FEMA and the federal government respond to the disaster . The only exception to the state 's gubernatorial declaration requirement occurs when an emergency or disaster takes place on federal property or to a federal asset - for example , the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City , Oklahoma , or the Space Shuttle Columbia in the 2003 return-flight disaster . While on-the-ground support of disaster recovery efforts is a major part of FEMA 's charter , the agency provides state and local governments with experts in specialized fields and funding for rebuilding efforts and relief funds for infrastructure by directing individuals to access low-interest loans , in conjunction with the Small Business Administration . In addition to this , FEMA provides funds for training of response personnel throughout the United States and its territories as part of the agency 's preparedness effort .",
  "/wiki/National_Flood_Insurance_Program": "The National Flood Insurance Program ( NFIP ) is a program created by the Congress of the United States in 1968 through the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 ( P.L . 90-448 ) . U.S. Congress has the twofold purposes of the NFIP to share the risk of flood losses through flood insurance and to reduce flood damages by restricting floodplain development . The program enables property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance protection , administered by the government , against losses from flooding , and requires flood insurance for all loans or lines of credit that are secured by existing buildings , manufactured homes , or buildings under construction , that are located in the Special Flood Hazard Area in a community that participates in the NFIP . U.S. Congress limits the availability of National Flood Insurance to communities that adopt adequate land use and control measures with effective enforcement provisions to reduce flood damages by restricting development in areas exposed to flooding . This NFIP is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods . As of August 2017 , the program insured about 5 million homes ( down from about 5.5 million homes in April 2010 ) , the majority of which are in Texas and Florida . The cost of the insurance program was fully covered by its premiums until the end of 2004 , but has had to steadily borrow funds since ( primarily due to Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy ) , accumulating $ 25 billion of debt by August 2017 .",

  "/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy": "Hurricane Sandy ( unofficially referred to as Superstorm Sandy ) was the deadliest and most destructive , as well as the strongest , hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season . Inflicting nearly $ 70 billion ( 2012 USD ) in damage , it was the second-costliest hurricane on record in the United States until surpassed by Hurricanes Harvey and Maria in 2017 . The eighteenth named storm , tenth hurricane , and second major hurricane of the year , Sandy was a Category 3 storm at its peak intensity when it made landfall in Cuba . While it was a Category 2 hurricane off the coast of the Northeastern United States , the storm became the largest Atlantic hurricane on record ( as measured by diameter , with tropical-storm-force winds spanning 900 miles ( 1,400 km ) ) . At least 233 people were killed along the path of the storm in eight countries . Sandy developed from a tropical wave in the western Caribbean Sea on October 22 , quickly strengthened , and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Sandy six hours later . Sandy moved slowly northward toward the Greater Antilles and gradually intensified . On October 24 , Sandy became a hurricane , made landfall near Kingston , Jamaica , re-emerged a few hours later into the Caribbean Sea and strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane . On October 25 , Sandy hit Cuba as a Category 3 hurricane , then weakened to a Category 1 hurricane . Early on October 26 , Sandy moved through the Bahamas . On October 27 , Sandy briefly weakened to a tropical storm and then restrengthened to a Category 1 hurricane . Early on October 29 , Sandy curved west-northwest ( the left turn or left hook ) and then moved ashore near Brigantine , New Jersey , just to the northeast of Atlantic City , as a post-tropical cyclone with hurricane-force winds .",

Together with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 amendment , it represents the U.S. healthcare system 's most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 . PPACA 's major provisions came into force in 2014 . By 2016 , the uninsured share of the population had roughly halved , with estimates ranging from 20 to 24 million additional people covered . The law also enacted a host of delivery system reforms intended to constrain healthcare costs and improve quality . After the law went into effect , increases in overall healthcare spending slowed , including premiums for employer-based insurance plans . The increased coverage was due , roughly equally , to an expansion of Medicaid eligibility and to changes to individual insurance markets . Both received new spending , funded through a combination of new taxes and cuts to Medicare provider rates and Medicare Advantage . Several Congressional Budget Office reports said that overall these provisions reduced the budget deficit , that repealing PPACA would increase the deficit , and that the law reduced income inequality by taxing primarily the top 1% to fund roughly $ 600 in benefits on average to families in the bottom 40% of the income distribution . The act largely retained the existing structure of Medicare , Medicaid and the employer market , but individual markets were radically overhauled . Insurers were made to accept all applicants and charge the same rates regardless of pre-existing conditions or demographic status ( except age ) . To combat the resultant adverse selection , the act mandated that individuals buy insurance ( or pay a fine/tax ) and that insurers cover a list of essential health benefits .",

A principal author of this law was Royal S. Copeland , a three-term U.S . Senator from New York . In 1968 , the Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions were added to the FD & C .

Clark constructed the Hall of Fame 's building , and it was dedicated on June 12 , 1939 .

Four members of a local Ku Klux Klan chapter planted at least 15 sticks of dynamite attached to a timing device beneath the steps located on the east side of the church . Described by Martin Luther King Jr. as one of the most vicious and tragic crimes ever perpetrated against humanity the explosion at the church killed four girls and injured 22 other people . Although the FBI had concluded in 1965 that the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing had been committed by four known Klansmen and segregationists : Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr. , Herman Frank Cash , Robert Edward Chambliss , and Bobby Frank Cherry , no prosecutions were conducted until 1977 , when Robert Chambliss was tried and convicted of the first-degree murder of one of the victims , 11-year-old Carol Denise McNair . In a revival of effort by states and the federal government to prosecute cold cases from the civil rights era , the state conducted trials in the early 21st century of Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr. and Bobby Cherry , who were each convicted of four counts of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2001 and 2002 , respectively . Herman Cash had died in 1994 , and was never charged with his alleged involvement in the bombing .

  "/wiki/Civil_Rights_Movement": "The civil rights movement ( also known as the American civil rights movement and other terms ) [ b ] in the United States was a decades-long struggle by African Americans to end legalized racial discrimination , disenfranchisement and racial segregation in the United States . The movement has its origins in the Reconstruction era during the late 19th century , although the movement achieved its largest legislative gains in the mid-1960s after years of direct actions and grassroots protests . The social movement 's major nonviolent resistance campaigns eventually secured new protections in federal law for the human rights of all Americans . After the American Civil War and the abolition of slavery in the 1860s , the Reconstruction Amendments to the United States Constitution granted emancipation and constitutional rights of citizenship to all African Americans , most of whom had recently been enslaved . For a period , African Americans voted and held political office , but they were increasingly deprived of civil rights , often under Jim Crow laws , and subjected to discrimination and sustained violence by whites in the South . Over the following century , various efforts were made by African Americans to secure their legal rights . In 1954 , the separate but equal policy which aided the enforcement of Jim Crow laws was weakened with the United States Supreme Court 's Brown v. Board of Education ruling and other subsequent rulings which followed . Between 1955 and 1968 , acts of nonviolent protest and civil disobedience produced crisis situations and productive dialogues between activists and government authorities . Federal , state , and local governments , businesses , and communities often had to respond immediately to these situations , which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans across the country . The lynching of Chicago teenager Emmett Till in Mississippi , and the outrage generated by seeing how he had been abused , when his mother decided to have an open-casket funeral , mobilized the African-American community nationwide . Forms of protest and/or civil disobedience included boycotts , such as the successful Montgomery bus boycott ( 1955-56 ) in Alabama ; sit-ins such as the Greensboro sit-ins ( 1960 ) in North Carolina and successful Nashville sit-ins in Tennessee ; marches , such as the 1963 Birmingham Children 's Crusade and 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches ( 1965 ) in Alabama ; and a wide range of other nonviolent activities . At the culmination of a legal strategy pursued by African Americans , the U.S. Supreme Court began , in 1954 under the leadership of Earl Warren , to find unconstitutional many of the laws that had allowed racial segregation and discrimination to be legal in the United States .",

A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom .
