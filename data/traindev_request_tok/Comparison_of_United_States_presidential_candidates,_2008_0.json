  "/wiki/Ralph_Nader": "Ralph Nader ( /\u02c8ne\u026ad\u0259r/ ; born February 27 , 1934 ) is an American political activist , author , lecturer , and attorney , noted for his involvement in consumer protection , environmentalism and government reform causes . The son of Lebanese immigrants to the United States , Nader was educated at Princeton and Harvard and first came to prominence in 1965 with the publication of the bestselling book Unsafe at Any Speed , a highly influential critique of the safety record of American automobile manufacturers . Following the publication of Unsafe at Any Speed , Nader led a group of volunteer law students - dubbed Nader 's Raiders - in an investigation of the Federal Trade Commission , leading directly to that agency 's overhaul and reform . In the 1970s , Nader leveraged his growing popularity to establish a number of advocacy and watchdog groups including the Public Interest Research Group , the Center for Auto Safety , and Public Citizen . Two of Nader 's most notable targets were the Chevy Corvair and the Ford Pinto . Nader 's activism has been directly credited with the passage of several landmark pieces of American consumer protection legislation including the Clean Water Act , the Freedom of Information Act , the Consumer Product Safety Act , the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act , the Whistleblower Protection Act , and the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act . [ citation needed ] He has been repeatedly named to lists of the 100 Most Influential Americans , including those published by Life , Time , and The Atlantic . He ran for President of the United States on several occasions as an independent and third party candidate , using the campaigns to highlight under-reported issues and a perceived need for electoral reform . His 2000 candidacy stirred controversy , with several studies suggesting that Nader 's candidacy helped Republican George W. Bush win a close election against Democrat Al Gore . During the election , Nader had stated that he preferred Bush to win over Gore , though the Nader campaign later clarified that the statement was not meant to indicate Bush was a better choice over Gore . A two-time Nieman Fellow , Nader is the author or co-author of more than two dozen books , and was the subject of a documentary film on his life and work , An Unreasonable Man , which debuted at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival .",

  "/wiki/United_States_Democratic_Party": "The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States , along with its main rival , the Republican Party . Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison 's Democratic-Republican Party , the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson , making it the world 's oldest active political party . In its early years , the Party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s , the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform . Well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings ; following the New Deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South . The New Deal Coalition of 1932-1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction - many of whom were Catholics based in the cities . After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the core bases of the two parties shifted , with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic . The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s . White evangelicals and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local levels since the 1990s . People living in urban areas , women , college graduates , sexual and gender minorities , millennials , and black , Latino , Jewish , Muslim and Asian Americans tend to support the Democratic Party . The Democratic Party 's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality , along with the welfare state . It seeks to provide government regulation in the economy .",

Perot , who received 18.9 percent of the popular vote as an independent candidate in the 1992 presidential election and wanted to participate also in the 1996 presidential election , thought Americans were disillusioned with the state of politics as being corrupt and unable to deal with vital issues .

Although he did not receive a single electoral vote , no other third-party or independent candidate has since managed to receive as high a share of the vote . The party has nominated several notable candidates over the years , including Perot himself , Pat Buchanan , and Ralph Nader . Its most significant victory came when Jesse Ventura was elected Governor of Minnesota in 1998 , although he left the party shortly into his term .
