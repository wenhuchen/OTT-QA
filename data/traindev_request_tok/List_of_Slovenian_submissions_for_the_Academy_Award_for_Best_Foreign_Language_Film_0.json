He immediately joined local punkers who formed a band . Because punk rock in Yugoslavia was not tolerated some of them quickly fell into trouble . Authorities were on high alert because Tito got seriously ill and was admitted to University Medical Centre Ljubljana . Sead spent a lot of time with his new friends because his father was devoted only to the army and wanted Sead to join the army school to become an officer or a pilot . Sead fell in love with Metka , a girl from his class , so he also began spending his time with her . Then several things occurred : one of his friends was beaten by the Police and put to prison , he was punished by his father for not being devoted enough to the ideas of socialism , Metka got pregnant and they were again forced to move , so Sead should leave his life behind and start it anew .
