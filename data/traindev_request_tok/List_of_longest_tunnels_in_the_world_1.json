China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty . China , as a whole , was ravaged by feudal warlordism and Japan during World War II .",

The line is part of Line 1 , the Berlin to Palermo route , of Trans-European Transport Networks ( TEN-T ) .

Iberian cultures along with ancient Phoenician , Greek , Celtic and Carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under Roman rule around 200 BCE , after which the region was named Hispania , based on the earlier Phoenician name Sp ( a ) n or Spania . At the end of the Western Roman Empire the Germanic tribal confederations migrated from Central Europe , invaded the Iberian peninsula and established relatively independent realms in its western provinces , including the Suebi , Alans and Vandals .",
  "/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)": "The Mass Rapid Transit , abbreviated and referred to in local parlance as the MRT , is a heavy rail rapid transit system that constitutes the bulk of the railway network in Singapore , spanning - with the exception of the forested core and the island 's rural northwest - the length and width of the city-state 's main island . [ note 1 ] The first section of the MRT opened on 7 November 1987 , and the network has since grown rapidly in accordance with Singapore 's aim of developing a comprehensive rail network as the backbone of the country 's public transportation system , with an average daily ridership of 3.384 million in 2019 , [ note 2 ] approximately 83% of the bus network 's 4.099 million in the same period . Singapore 's MRT infrastructure is built , operated , and managed in accordance with a hybridised quasi-nationalised regulatory framework called the New Rail Financing Framework ( NRFF ) , in which the lines are constructed and the assets owned by the Land Transport Authority , a statutory board of the Government of Singapore . The Land Transport Authority allocates operating concessions to two for-profit private corporations , namely SMRT and SBS Transit , both of which are responsible for asset maintenance on their respective lines . These operators also run bus and taxi services , thus facilitating the full integration of public transport services . As of January 2020 , the MRT network encompasses 203 kilometres ( 126 mi ) of route on standard gauge , with 122 stations in operation , spread across six lines set in a circle-radial topology . The network is expected to double to a total length of almost 400 kilometres ( 250 mi ) by 2040 as a result of ongoing expansion works to its six existing lines and the construction of three new lines . The network is complemented by a small number of local Light Rail Transit ( LRT ) networks in the suburban towns of Bukit Panjang , Sengkang , and Punggol that link MRT stations with HDB public housing estates , bringing the combined length of the domestic heavy and light rail network to 231.6 kilometres ( 143.9 mi ) , with a total of 159 stations in operation . [ note 3 ] The MRT is the oldest , busiest , and most comprehensive rapid transit system ( both by length and number of stations ) in Southeast Asia . [ note 4 ] More than S $ 85 billion ( US $ 63 billion ) has been spent on the construction of all currently operational lines in the network , the procurement of rolling stock and other rail assets , and the periodical renewal of assets , making the MRT one of the costliest rapid transit networks and public transportation projects in the world on both a per-kilometre and absolute basis . [ note 5 ] The system has the added distinctions of having the longest fully automated and driverless network in the world , as well as some of the longest and deepest subway tunnel sections in the world . The MRT is also unique in that the vast majority of underground stations in the network double as purpose-built Singapore Civil Defence Force bunkers and air raid shelters , being built with hardened boundary walls , reinforced concrete floor and roof slabs , and concrete or steel doors for the purpose of withstanding conventional aerial bomb and chemical attacks .",

Singapore is located about one degree ( 137 kilometres or 85 miles ) north of the equator , and is situated off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula , and by extension , the southernmost extremity of continental Asia . The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia 's Riau Islands , its northern , western , and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia , and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east . It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south , and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans , being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east . The country 's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets , the combined area of which has increased by almost 25% since the country 's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects . Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history , modern Singapore , then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate , was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles , a British colonial officer , established a trading post of the East India Company on the island . In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond . During the Second World War , Imperial Japan successfully invaded Singapore , resulting in an interregnum of British rule corresponding with a brief Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 . Following Japan 's surrender in 1945 , the Straits Settlements were dissolved , with Singapore being returned to British control as a standalone crown colony in 1946 .",

About one quarter of its population of 463,746 ( 2018 ) lives in the capital , Le\u00f3n . The climate is dry , cold in winter and hot in summer . This creates the perfect environment for wine and all types of cold meats and sausages like the leonese Morcilla and the Cecina . There are two famous Roman Catholic cathedrals in the province , the main one in Le\u00f3n and another in Astorga . The province shares the Picos de Europa National Park ( in the Picos de Europa mountain range ) with Cantabria and Asturias . It has 211 municipalities .",
  "/wiki/Water_table": "The water table is the upper surface of the zone of saturation . The zone of saturation is where the pores and fractures of the ground are saturated with water . The water table is the surface where the water pressure head is equal to the atmospheric pressure ( where gauge pressure = 0 ) . It may be visualized as the surface of the subsurface materials that are saturated with groundwater in a given vicinity . The groundwater may be from precipitation or from groundwater flowing into the aquifer . In areas with sufficient precipitation , water infiltrates through pore spaces in the soil , passing through the unsaturated zone . At increasing depths , water fills in more of the pore spaces in the soils , until a zone of saturation is reached . Below the water table , in the phreatic zone ( zone of saturation ) , layers of permeable rock that yield groundwater are called aquifers . In less permeable soils , such as tight bedrock formations and historic lakebed deposits , the water table may be more difficult to define . The water table should not be confused with the water level in a deeper well . If a deeper aquifer has a lower permeable unit that confines the upward flow , then the water level in this aquifer may rise to a level that is greater or less than the elevation of the actual water table . The elevation of the water in this deeper well is dependent upon the pressure in the deeper aquifer and is referred to as the potentiometric surface , not the water table .",

Chiang Mai ( meaning New City in Thai ) was founded in 1296 as the new capital of Lan Na , succeeding the former capital , Chiang Rai . :208-209 The city 's strategic location on the Ping River ( a major tributary of the Chao Phraya River ) and its proximity to major trading routes contributed to its historic importance . Although the city ( thesaban nakhon , city municipality ) of Chiang Mai only officially covers most parts of the Mueang Chiang Mai District , with a population of 160,000 , the city 's sprawl extends into several neighboring districts . The Chiang Mai metropolitan area has a population of nearly one million people , more than half the total of Chiang Mai Province . The city is subdivided into four khwaeng ( electoral wards ) : Nakhon Ping , Srivijaya , Mengrai , and Kawila . The first three are on the west bank of the Ping River , and Kawila is on the east bank . Nakhon Ping District includes the northern part of the city . Srivijaya , Mengrai , and Kawila consist of the western , southern , and eastern parts , respectively . The city center - within the city walls - is mostly within Srivijaya ward .",
  "/wiki/Thailand": "Thailand , [ a ] officially the Kingdom of Thailand and formerly known as Siam , [ b ] is a country at the centre of the Southeast Asian Indochinese Peninsula composed of 76 provinces . At 513,120 km2 ( 198,120 sq mi ) and over 68 million people , Thailand is the world 's 50th-largest country by total area and the 21st-most-populous country . The capital and largest city is Bangkok , a special administrative area . Thailand is bordered to the north by Myanmar and Laos , to the east by Laos and Cambodia , to the south by the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia , and to the west by the Andaman Sea and the southern extremity of Myanmar . Its maritime boundaries include Vietnam in the Gulf of Thailand to the southeast , and Indonesia and India on the Andaman Sea to the southwest . It is a unitary state . Although nominally the country is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy , the most recent coup , in 2014 , established a de facto military dictatorship under a junta . Tai peoples migrated from southwestern China to mainland Southeast Asia from the 11th century ; the oldest known mention of their presence in the region by the exonym Siamese dates to the 12th century . Various Indianised kingdoms such as the Mon kingdoms , Khmer Empire and Malay states ruled the region , competing with Thai states such as the Kingdoms of Ngoenyang , Sukhothai , Lan Na and Ayutthaya , which rivaled each other . Documented European contact began in 1511 with a Portuguese diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya , now one of the great powers in the region . Ayutthaya reached its peak during cosmopolitan Narai 's reign ( 1656-1688 ) , gradually declining thereafter until being ultimately destroyed in the 1767 Burmese-Siamese War . Taksin ( r. 1767-1782 ) quickly reunified the fragmented territory and established the short-lived Thonburi Kingdom .",
  "/wiki/Follo_Line": "The Follo Line ( Norwegian : Follobanen ) is a planned 22.5-kilometer ( 14.0 mi ) high-speed railway between Oslo and Ski , Norway . Running parallel to the \u00d8stfold Line , it will be engineered for 250 km/h ( 155 mph ) . Terminal stations will be Oslo Central Station and Ski Station . Most of the line , 19 kilometres ( 12 mi ) , will be in a single tunnel , which will be the longest railway tunnel in the country . Construction started in 2014 , and is estimated to be completed by December 2022 . The Follo Line will increase capacity from twelve to forty trains per hour along the South Corridor , and will allow express and regional trains to decrease travel time from Ski to Oslo from 22 to 11 minutes . The line was prospected to cost over 26 billion Norwegian krone ( NOK ) in 2014 . The project is a continuation of the Norwegian National Rail Administration 's plan to build four tracks along the three main corridors out of Oslo ; the Gardermoen Line was completed in 1998 , and the Asker Line was completed in 2011 . Between 1989 and 1996 , the \u00d8stfold Line south of Ski to Moss was upgraded to double track and higher speeds . To take full advantage of this and allow the rest of the \u00d8stfold Line to be upgraded for high speeds , it is necessary to increase capacity through the bottleneck from Oslo to Ski . The first plans for the Follo Line were launched in 1995 , and also included an intermediate station at Vevelstad and Kolbotn . The new line is predicted to increase rush hour rail ridership 63% , and increased freight on rail would remove 750 trucks daily from European Route E18 .",

It constitutes both a county and a municipality . During the Viking Age the area was part of Viken , the northernmost Danish province . Oslo was founded as a city at the end of the Viking Age in the year 1040 under the name \u00c1nslo , and established as a kaupstad or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada . The city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300 . Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 reduced its influence . After being destroyed by a fire in 1624 , during the reign of King Christian IV , a new city was built closer to Akershus Fortress and named Christiania in the king 's honour . It was established as a municipality ( formannskapsdistrikt ) on 1 January 1838 . The city functioned as the capital of Norway during the 1814-1905 union between Sweden and Norway . From 1877 , the city 's name was spelled Kristiania in government usage , a spelling that was adopted by the municipal authorities only in 1897 . In 1925 the city , after incorporating the village retaining its former name , was renamed Oslo . In 1948 Oslo merged with Aker , a municipality which surrounded the capital and which was 27 times larger , thus creating the modern , vastly enlarged Oslo municipality .",

Sydney is made up of 658 suburbs , 40 local government areas and 15 contiguous regions . Residents of the city are known as Sydneysiders . As of June 2017 , Sydney 's estimated metropolitan population was 5,230,330 and is home to approximately 65% of the state 's population . Indigenous Australians have inhabited the Sydney area for at least 30,000 years , and thousands of engravings remain throughout the region , making it one of the richest in Australia in terms of Aboriginal archaeological sites . During his first Pacific voyage in 1770 , Lieutenant James Cook and his crew became the first Europeans to chart the eastern coast of Australia , making landfall at Botany Bay and inspiring British interest in the area . In 1788 , the First Fleet of convicts , led by Arthur Phillip , founded Sydney as a British penal colony , the first European settlement in Australia . Phillip named the city Sydney in recognition of Thomas Townshend , 1st Viscount Sydney . Penal transportation to New South Wales ended soon after Sydney was incorporated as a city in 1842 . A gold rush occurred in the colony in 1851 , and over the next century , Sydney transformed from a colonial outpost into a major global cultural and economic centre . After World War II , it experienced mass migration and became one of the most multicultural cities in the world .",

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories .
