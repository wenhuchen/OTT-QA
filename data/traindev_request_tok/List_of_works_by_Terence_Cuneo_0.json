It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages , but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City 's borders . The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London , though it remains a notable part of central London . Administratively , it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London ; however , the City of London is not a London borough , a status reserved for the other 32 districts ( including London 's only other city , the City of Westminster ) . It is also a separate ceremonial county , being an enclave surrounded by Greater London , and is the smallest county in the United Kingdom . The City of London is widely referred to simply as the City ( differentiated from the phrase the city of London by capitalising City ) and is also colloquially known as the Square Mile , as it is 1.12 sq mi ( 716.80 acres ; 2.90 km2 ) in area . Both of these terms are also often used as metonyms for the United Kingdom 's trading and financial services industries , which continue a notable history of being largely based in the City . The name London is now ordinarily used for a far wider area than just the City . London most often denotes the sprawling London metropolis , or the 32 London boroughs , in addition to the City of London itself . This wider usage of London is documented as far back as 1888 , when the County of London was created . The local authority for the City , namely the City of London Corporation , is unique in the UK and has some unusual responsibilities for a local council , such as being the police authority . It is also unusual in having responsibilities and ownerships beyond its boundaries .",

Its two largest cities , Southampton and Portsmouth , are administered separately as unitary authorities ; the rest of the county is governed by Hampshire County Council . First settled about 14,000 years ago , Hampshire 's history dates to Roman Britain , when its chief town was Winchester . When the Romans left Britain , the area was infiltrated by tribes from Scandinavia and mainland Europe , principally in the river valleys . The county was recorded in the 11th century Domesday Book , divided into 44 hundreds . From the 12th century , the ports grew in importance , fuelled by trade with the continent , wool and cloth manufacture in the county , and the fishing industry , and a shipbuilding industry was established . By the 16th century , the population of Southampton had outstripped that of Winchester . By the mid-19th century , with the county 's population at 219,210 ( double that at the beginning of the century ) in more than 86,000 dwellings , agriculture was the principal industry and 10 per cent of the county was still forest . Hampshire played a crucial military role in both World Wars . The Isle of Wight , historically part of Hampshire , became a separate ceremonial county in 1974 .",

The couple and their daughters embodied traditional ideas of family and public service . She undertook a variety of public engagements and became known for her consistently cheerful countenance . In 1936 , her husband unexpectedly became king when his older brother , Edward VIII , abdicated in order to marry the American divorc\u00e9e Wallis Simpson . Elizabeth then became queen . She accompanied her husband on diplomatic tours to France and North America before the start of the Second World War .

  "/wiki/Colours,_standards_and_guidons": "In military organizations , the practice of carrying colours , standards or guidons , both to act as a rallying point for troops and to mark the location of the commander , is thought to have originated in Ancient Egypt some 5,000 years ago . The Roman Empire also made battle standards a part of their vast armies . It was formalized in the armies of Europe in the High Middle Ages , with standards being emblazoned with the commander 's coat of arms .",
  "/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster": "The Palace of Westminster serves as the meeting place for both the House of Commons and the House of Lords , the two houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom . Commonly known as the Houses of Parliament after its occupants , the Palace lies on the north bank of the River Thames in the City of Westminster , in central London , England . Its name , which derives from the neighbouring Westminster Abbey , may refer to either of two structures : the Old Palace , a medieval building-complex destroyed by fire in 1834 , or its replacement , the New Palace that stands today . The palace is owned by the monarch in right of the Crown and , for ceremonial purposes , retains its original status as a royal residence . Committees appointed by both houses manage the building and report to the Speaker of the House of Commons and to the Lord Speaker . The first royal palace constructed on the site dated from the 11th century , and Westminster became the primary residence of the Kings of England until fire destroyed much of the complex in 1512 . After that , it served as the home of the Parliament of England , which had met there since the 13th century , and also as the seat of the Royal Courts of Justice , based in and around Westminster Hall . In 1834 an even greater fire ravaged the heavily rebuilt Houses of Parliament , and the only significant medieval structures to survive were Westminster Hall , the Cloisters of St Stephen 's , the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft , and the Jewel Tower . In the subsequent competition for the reconstruction of the Palace , the architect Charles Barry won with a design for new buildings in the Gothic Revival style , specifically inspired by the English Perpendicular Gothic style of the 14th-16th centuries . The remains of the Old Palace ( except the detached Jewel Tower ) were incorporated into its much larger replacement , which contains over 1,100 rooms organised symmetrically around two series of courtyards and which has a floor area of 112,476 m2 ( 1,210,680 sq ft ) . Part of the New Palace 's area of 3.24 hectares ( 8 acres ) was reclaimed from the River Thames , which is the setting of its nearly 300-metre long ( 980 ft ) fa\u00e7ade , called the River Front . Augustus Pugin , a leading authority on Gothic architecture and style , assisted Barry and designed the interior of the Palace .",
  "/wiki/Winston_Churchill": "Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill ( 30 November 1874 - 24 January 1965 ) was a British politician , army officer , and writer . He was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 , when he led Britain to victory in the Second World War , and again from 1951 to 1955 . Churchill represented five constituencies during his career as a Member of Parliament ( MP ) . Ideologically an economic liberal and imperialist , for most of his career he was a member of the Conservative Party , which he led from 1940 to 1955 , but from 1904 to 1924 was a member of the Liberal Party . Of mixed English and American parentage , Churchill was born in Oxfordshire to a wealthy , aristocratic family . He joined the British Army in 1895 , and saw action in British India , the Anglo-Sudan War , and the Second Boer War , gaining fame as a war correspondent and writing books about his campaigns . Elected an MP in 1900 , initially as a Conservative , he defected to the Liberals in 1904 . In H. H. Asquith 's Liberal government , Churchill served as President of the Board of Trade , Home Secretary , and First Lord of the Admiralty , championing prison reform and workers ' social security . During the First World War , he oversaw the Gallipoli Campaign ; after it proved a disaster , he resigned from government and served in the Royal Scots Fusiliers on the Western Front . In 1917 , he returned to government under David Lloyd George as Minister of Munitions , then as Secretary of State for War and Air , and finally for the Colonies , overseeing the Anglo-Irish Treaty and Britain 's Middle East policy . After two years out of Parliament , he served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in Stanley Baldwin 's Conservative government , returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the gold standard at its pre-war parity , a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure and depressing the UK economy . Out of office during the 1930s , Churchill took the lead in calling for British rearmament to counter the growing threat from Nazi Germany .",

  "/wiki/George_V": "George V ( George Frederick Ernest Albert ; 3 June 1865 - 20 January 1936 ) was King of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions , and Emperor of India , from 6 May 1910 until his death in 1936 . Born during the reign of his grandmother Queen Victoria , George was third in the line of succession behind his father , Prince Albert Edward , and his own elder brother , Prince Albert Victor . From 1877 to 1891 , George served in the Royal Navy , until the unexpected death of his elder brother in early 1892 put him directly in line for the throne . On the death of his grandmother in 1901 , George 's father ascended the throne as Edward VII , and George was created Prince of Wales . He became king-emperor on his father 's death in 1910 . George V 's reign saw the rise of socialism , communism , fascism , Irish republicanism , and the Indian independence movement , all of which radically changed the political landscape . The Parliament Act 1911 established the supremacy of the elected British House of Commons over the unelected House of Lords . As a result of the First World War ( 1914-1918 ) , the empires of his first cousins Nicholas II of Russia and Wilhelm II of Germany fell , while the British Empire expanded to its greatest effective extent . In 1917 , George became the first monarch of the House of Windsor , which he renamed from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha as a result of anti-German public sentiment . In 1924 he appointed the first Labour ministry and in 1931 the Statute of Westminster recognised the dominions of the Empire as separate , independent states within the British Commonwealth of Nations . He had smoking-related health problems throughout much of his later reign and at his death was succeeded by his eldest son , Edward VIII ."
