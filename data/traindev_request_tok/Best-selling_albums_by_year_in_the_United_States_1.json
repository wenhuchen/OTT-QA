Nonetheless , Nesmith composed and produced some songs from the beginning , and Tork contributed limited guitar work on the sessions produced by Nesmith . All four contributed lead vocals to various tracks . They eventually fought for the right to collectively supervise all musical output under the band 's name , acting as musicians , singers , songwriters , and producers . Following the television show 's cancellation in 1968 , the Monkees continued to record music until 1971 , after which the group broke up .
