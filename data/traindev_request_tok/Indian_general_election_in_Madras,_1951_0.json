This tradition is considered as a part of the number of other traditions that led to amalgamation in a later stage of the historical development and culminate in worship of Radha Krishna as Svayam bhagavan . Other monotheist traditions are Bhagavatism and Cult of Gopala , that along with Cult of Krishna-Vasudeva form the basis of the current tradition of the monotheistic Krishna religion . The worship of Balakrishna , the divine child , while a significant feature of the Krishna religion , often receives less attention , however it is one of the most popular deities of Krishna in many parts of India today . Early evidence of such worship can be found or as early as the 4th century BC according to evidence in Megasthenes and in the Arthashastra of Kautilya , when V\u0101sudeva ( as the son of Vasudeva was worshiped as supreme Deity in a strongly monotheistic format , where the supreme Being was perfect , eternal and full of grace . Some of the miraculous acts of the form are notable . It is believed that Putana , a huge monster , was killed when the baby Krishna sucked her life from her by taking the poisoned breast she offered him . Bala-Krishna is often depicted as a small child crawling on his hands , and knees or dancing with a piece of butter in his hand . In the Bhagavad Gita , it appears Krishna is teaching a universal monotheistic religion of personal God and reveals himself to be all-God , svayam bhagavan . The childhood episodes of Krishna 's legend became the focus of the medieval devotional cults that started to develop in a number of movements in medieval India .",
