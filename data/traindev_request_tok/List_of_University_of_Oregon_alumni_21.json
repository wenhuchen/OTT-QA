The Hall 's motto is Preserving History , Honoring Excellence , Connecting Generations . The word Cooperstown is often used as shorthand ( or a metonym ) for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum , similar to Canton for the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton , Ohio . The Hall of Fame was established in 1939 by Stephen Carlton Clark , an heir to the Singer Sewing Machine fortune . Clark sought to bring tourists to a city hurt by the Great Depression , which reduced the local tourist trade , and Prohibition , which devastated the local hops industry . Clark constructed the Hall of Fame 's building , and it was dedicated on June 12 , 1939 . ( His granddaughter , Jane Forbes Clark , is the current chairman of the Board of Directors . ) The erroneous claim that Civil War hero Abner Doubleday invented baseball in Cooperstown was instrumental in the early marketing of the Hall . An expanded library and research facility opened in 1994 . Dale Petroskey became the organization 's president in 1999 . In 2002 , the Hall launched Baseball As America , a traveling exhibit that toured ten American museums over six years .",

  "/wiki/North_Pole": "The North Pole , also known as the Geographic North Pole or Terrestrial North Pole , is ( subject to the caveats explained below ) defined as the point in the Northern Hemisphere where the Earth 's axis of rotation meets its surface . The North Pole is the northernmost point on the Earth , lying diametrically opposite the South Pole . It defines geodetic latitude 90\u00b0 North , as well as the direction of true north . At the North Pole all directions point south ; all lines of longitude converge there , so its longitude can be defined as any degree value . Along tight latitude circles , counterclockwise is east and clockwise is west . The North Pole is at the center of the Northern Hemisphere . The nearest land is usually said to be Kaffeklubben Island , off the northern coast of Greenland about 700 km ( 430 mi ) away , though some perhaps semi-permanent gravel banks lie slightly closer . The nearest permanently inhabited place is Alert in the Qikiqtaaluk Region , Nunavut , Canada , which is located 817 km ( 508 mi ) from the Pole . While the South Pole lies on a continental land mass , the North Pole is located in the middle of the Arctic Ocean amid waters that are almost permanently covered with constantly shifting sea ice . The sea depth at the North Pole has been measured at 4,261 m ( 13,980 ft ) by the Russian Mir submersible in 2007 and at 4,087 m ( 13,409 ft ) by USS Nautilus in 1958 . This makes it impractical to construct a permanent station at the North Pole ( unlike the South Pole ) . However , the Soviet Union , and later Russia , constructed a number of manned drifting stations on a generally annual basis since 1937 , some of which have passed over or very close to the Pole .",

The first event was held in 1993 at the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver , Colorado . The purpose of the early Ultimate Fighting Championship competitions was to identify the most effective martial art in a contest with minimal rules and no weight classes between competitors of different fighting disciplines like boxing , kickboxing , Brazilian jiu-jitsu , sambo , wrestling , Muay Thai , karate , and judo . In subsequent events , fighters began adopting effective techniques from more than one discipline , which indirectly helped create a separate style of fighting known as present-day mixed martial arts . In 2016 , UFC 's parent company , Zuffa , was sold to a group led by William Morris Endeavor ( WME-IMG ) , including Silver Lake Partners , Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and MSD Capital for US $ 4.025 billion . With a TV deal and expansion in Australia , Asia , Europe , and new markets within the United States , the UFC has increased in popularity , and has achieved greater mainstream media coverage ; the promotion brought in a total revenue of US $ 609 million in 2015 , and its next domestic media rights agreement with ESPN was valued at $ 1.5 billion over a five-year term .",
