  "/wiki/Television_channel": "A television channel is a terrestrial frequency or virtual number over which a television station or television network is distributed . For example , in North America , channel 2 refers to the terrestrial or cable band of 54 to 60 MHz , with carrier frequencies of 55.25 MHz for NTSC analog video ( VSB ) and 59.75 MHz for analog audio ( FM ) , or 55.31 MHz for digital ATSC ( 8VSB ) . Channels may be shared by many different television stations or cable-distributed channels depending on the location and service provider Depending on the multinational bandplan for a given regional n , analog television channels are typically 6 , 7 , or 8 MHz in bandwidth , and therefore television channel frequencies vary as well . Channel numbering is also different . Digital terrestrial television channels are the same as their analog predecessors for legacy reasons , however through multiplexing , each physical radio frequency ( RF ) channel can carry several digital subchannels . On satellites , each transponder normally carries one channel , however multiple small , independent channels can be on one transponder , with some loss of bandwidth due to the need for guard bands between unrelated transmissions . ISDB , used in Japan and Brazil , has a similar segmented mode . Preventing interference between terrestrial channels in the same area is accomplished by skipping at least one channel between two analog stations ' frequency allocations . Where channel numbers are sequential , frequencies are not contiguous , such as channel 6 to 7 skip from VHF low to high band , and channel 13 to 14 jump to UHF . On cable TV , it is possible to use adjacent channels only because they are all at the same power , something which could only be done terrestrially if the two stations were transmitted at the same power and height from the same location . For DTT , selectivity is inherently better , therefore channels adjacent ( either to analog or digital stations ) can be used even in the same area .",
  "/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time": "Greenwich Mean Time ( GMT ) is the mean solar time at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich , London , reckoned from midnight . At different times in the past , it has been calculated in different ways , including being calculated from noon ; as a consequence , it can not be used to specify a precise time unless a context is given . English speakers often use GMT as a synonym for Coordinated Universal Time ( UTC ) . For navigation , it is considered equivalent to UT1 ( the modern form of mean solar time at 0\u00b0 longitude ) ; but this meaning can differ from UTC by up to 0.9 s. The term GMT should not thus be used for certain technical purposes requiring precision . Because of Earth 's uneven angular velocity in its elliptical orbit and its axial tilt , noon ( 12:00:00 ) GMT is rarely the exact moment the Sun crosses the Greenwich meridian and reaches its highest point in the sky there . This event may occur up to 16 minutes before or after noon GMT , a discrepancy calculated by the equation of time . Noon GMT is the annual average ( i.e . mean ) moment of this event , which accounts for the word mean in Greenwich Mean Time . Originally , astronomers considered a GMT day to start at noon , while for almost everyone else it started at midnight . To avoid confusion , the name Universal Time was introduced to denote GMT as counted from midnight . Astronomers preferred the old convention to simplify their observational data , so that each night was logged under a single calendar date . Today , Universal Time usually refers to UTC or UT1 .",
