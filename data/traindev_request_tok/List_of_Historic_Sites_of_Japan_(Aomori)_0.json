The site was discovered in 1992 , when Aomori Prefecture started surveying a site for a planned baseball stadium . Archaeologists have used this site to further their understanding of the transition to sedentism and the life of the J\u014dmon people . Excavation has led to the discovery of storage pits , above ground storage and long houses . These findings demonstrate a change in the structure of the community , architecture , and organizational behaviors of these people . Because of the extensive information and importance , this site was designated as a Special National Historical Site of Japan in 2000 . Today the public can visit this site and its many reconstructions .",

It was controlled by the Nanbu clan for several generations , and was rebuilt extensively towards the end of the Sengoku period .

Since the 1980s , scholars have argued that a period previously classified as a transition from the J\u014dmon period should be reclassified as Early Yayoi . The date of the beginning of this transition is controversial , with estimates ranging from the 10th to the 6th centuries BC . The period is named after the neighborhood of Tokyo where archaeologists first uncovered artifacts and features from that era . Distinguishing characteristics of the Yayoi period include the appearance of new Yayoi pottery styles and the start of an intensive rice agriculture in paddy fields . A hierarchical social class structure dates from this period and has its origin in China . Techniques in metallurgy based on the use of bronze and iron were also introduced from China over Korea to Japan in this period . The Yayoi followed the J\u014dmon period ( 14,000-1,000 BC ) and Yayoi culture flourished in a geographic area from southern Ky\u016bsh\u016b to northern Honsh\u016b . Archaeological evidence supports the idea that during this time , an influx of farmers ( Yayoi people ) from the Asian continent to Japan overwhelmed and displaced the native hunter-gatherer population .
