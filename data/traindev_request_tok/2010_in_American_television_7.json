  "/wiki/Shot_Heard_'Round_the_World_(baseball)": "In baseball , the Shot Heard 'Round the World was a game-winning home run by New York Giants outfielder and third baseman Bobby Thomson off Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Ralph Branca at the Polo Grounds in New York City on October 3 , 1951 , to win the National League ( NL ) pennant . Thomson 's dramatic three-run homer came in the ninth inning of the decisive third game of a three-game playoff for the pennant in which the Giants trailed , 4-1 . The game - the first ever televised nationally - was seen by millions of viewers across America and heard on radio by millions more , including thousands of American servicemen stationed in Korea , listening on Armed Forces Radio . The classic drama of snatching victory from defeat to secure a pennant was intensified by the epic cross-town rivalry between the Giants and Dodgers , and by a remarkable string of victories in the last weeks of the regular season by the Giants , who won 37 of their last 44 games to catch the first-place Dodgers and force a playoff series to decide the NL champion . The Giants ' late-season rally and 2-to-1-game playoff victory , capped by Thomson 's moment of triumph , are collectively known in baseball lore as The Miracle of Coogan 's Bluff , a descriptor coined by the legendary sports columnist Red Smith . The phrase shot heard 'round the world is from the poem Concord Hymn ( 1837 ) by Ralph Waldo Emerson about the first clash of the American Revolutionary War . It later became popularly associated with Thomson 's homer and several other dramatic historical moments .",

Honorees ( if living ) give a speech at the Hall of Fame during induction weekend , and their names are added to a plaque in the Hall 's library . For several years in the early 2000s , Frick Award honorees also became life members of the Veterans Committee , which considers candidates for Hall of Fame induction who are not eligible for the regular voting by the Baseball Writers ' Association of America - specifically , players no longer on the BBWAA ballot and all non-players . However , starting with the 2008 elections , voting for players on the main Veterans Committee ballot was restricted to Hall of Fame members . After further changes announced for the 2011 elections , Frick Award winners are eligible to serve on the voting bodies that replaced the Veterans Committee ( currently four ) that consider candidates from different eras of baseball . From 2004 to 2016 , fans were allowed to vote for three of the award 's ten annual nominees ; in the final years of fan voting , it was conducted on the Hall 's Facebook page . Through 2013 , seven candidates were selected by a committee consisting of previous Frick Award winners and broadcast historians and columnists , which also determined the final recipient .
