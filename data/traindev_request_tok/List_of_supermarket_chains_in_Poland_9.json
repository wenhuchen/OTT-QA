  "/wiki/Clothing": "Clothing ( also known as clothes , apparel and attire ) is items worn on the body . Clothing is typically made of fabrics or textiles but over time has included garments made from animal skin or other thin sheets of materials put together . The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to human beings and is a feature of all human societies . The amount and type of clothing worn depends on gender , body type , social , and geographic considerations . Clothing serves many purposes : it can serve as protection from the elements , rough surfaces , rash-causing plants , insect bites , splinters , thorns and prickles by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment . Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions , and they can provide a hygienic barrier , keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body . Clothing also provides protection from ultraviolet radiation . Wearing clothes is also a social norm , and being deprived of clothing in front of others may be embarrassing . In most parts of the world , not wearing clothes in public so that genitals , breasts or buttocks are visible could be considered indecent exposure .",

  "/wiki/Shoes": "A shoe is an item of footwear intended to protect and comfort the human foot . Shoes are also used as an item of decoration and fashion . The design of shoes has varied enormously through time and from culture to culture , with appearance originally being tied to function . Additionally , fashion has often dictated many design elements , such as whether shoes have very high heels or flat ones . Contemporary footwear in the 2010s varies widely in style , complexity and cost . Basic sandals may consist of only a thin sole and simple strap and be sold for a low cost . High fashion shoes made by famous designers may be made of expensive materials , use complex construction and sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars a pair . Some shoes are designed for specific purposes , such as boots designed specifically for mountaineering or skiing . Traditionally , shoes have been made from leather , wood or canvas , but in the 2010s , they are increasingly made from rubber , plastics , and other petrochemical-derived materials . Though the human foot is adapted to varied terrain and climate conditions , it is still vulnerable to environmental hazards such as sharp rocks and temperature extremes , which shoes protect against . Some shoes are worn as safety equipment , such as steel-soled boots which are required on construction sites .",

  "/wiki/Sport": "Sport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which , through casual or organised participation , at least in part aim to use , maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants , and in some cases , entertainment for spectators . Hundreds of sports exist , from those between single contestants , through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants , either in teams or competing as individuals . In certain sports such as racing , many contestants may compete , simultaneously or consecutively , with one winner ; in others , the contest ( a match ) is between two sides , each attempting to exceed the other . Some sports allow a tie or draw , in which there is no single winner ; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser . A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion . Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season , followed in some cases by playoffs . Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity , with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition , and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports . However , a number of competitive , but non-physical , activities claim recognition as mind sports . The International Olympic Committee ( through ARISF ) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports , and SportAccord , the international sports federation association , recognises five non-physical sports : bridge , chess , draughts ( checkers ) , Go and xiangqi , and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports . Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs , which serve to ensure fair competition , and allow consistent adjudication of the winner . Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first . It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance , including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression .",
