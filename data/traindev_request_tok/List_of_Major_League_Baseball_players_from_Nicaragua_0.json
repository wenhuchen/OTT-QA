In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the first baseman is assigned the number 3 . Also called first sacker or cornerman , the first baseman is ideally a tall player who throws left-handed and possesses good flexibility and quick reflexes . Flexibility is needed because the first baseman receives throws from the other infielders , the catcher and the pitcher after they have fielded ground balls . In order for the runner to be called out , the first baseman must be able to stretch towards the throw and catch it before the runner reaches first base . First base is often referred to as the other hot corner - the hot corner being third base - and therefore , like the third baseman , he must have quick reflexes to field the hardest hit balls down the foul line , mainly by left-handed pull hitters and right-handed hitters hitting to the opposite field .

Though one of only two MLB franchises to have never won a division title ( the other being the Colorado Rockies ) , the Marlins have won two World Series championships as a wild card team . The team began play as an expansion team in the 1993 season as the Florida Marlins and played home games from their inaugural season to the 2012 season at what was originally called Joe Robbie Stadium , which they shared with the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League ( NFL ) . Since the 2012 season , they have played at Marlins Park in downtown Miami , on the site of the former Orange Bowl . The new park , unlike their previous home ( which was criticized in its baseball configuration for poor sight lines in some locations ) , was designed foremost as a baseball park . Per an agreement with the city and Miami-Dade County ( which owns the park ) , the Marlins officially changed their name to the Miami Marlins on November 11 , 2011 . They also adopted a new logo , color scheme , and uniforms . The Marlins have the distinction of winning a World Series championship in every postseason they have qualified for to date , having won the World Series in 1997 and 2003 as National League wild card team . They also have the distinction of being the only franchise in the major four North American professional sports leagues ( MLB , NBA , NFL , NHL ) to have never lost a playoff round . They defeated the American League ( AL ) champion Cleveland Indians in the 1997 World Series , with shortstop \u00c9dgar Renter\u00eda driving in second baseman Craig Counsell for the series-clinching run in the 11th inning of the seventh and deciding game .",

The Tampa Bay Devil Rays began play in the 1998 Major League Baseball season . Their first decade of play , however , was marked by futility ; they finished in last place in the AL East in all but the 2004 season , when they finished second to last . Following the 2007 season , Stuart Sternberg , who had purchased controlling interest in the team from Vince Naimoli two years earlier , changed the team 's name from Devil Rays to Rays , now meant to primarily refer to a burst of sunshine rather than a manta ray , though a manta ray logo remains on the uniform sleeves . The 2008 season saw the Tampa Bay Rays post their first winning season , their first AL East championship , and their first pennant ( defeating the rival Boston Red Sox in the ALCS ) , though they lost to the Philadelphia Phillies in that year 's World Series .

  "/wiki/Third_baseman": "A third baseman , abbreviated 3B , is the player in baseball whose responsibility is to defend the area nearest to third base - the third of four bases a baserunner must touch in succession to score a run . In the scoring system used to record defensive plays , the third baseman is assigned the number ' 5 ' . The third baseman requires good reflexes in reacting to batted balls , as he is often the closest infielder ( roughly 90-120 feet ) to the batter . The third base position requires a strong and accurate arm , as the third baseman often makes long throws to first base . The third baseman sometimes must throw quickly to second base in time to start a double play . The third baseman must also field fly balls in fair and foul territory . Third base is known as the hot corner , because the third baseman is relatively close to the batter and most right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball hard in this direction . A third baseman must possess good hand-eye coordination and quick reactions in order to catch hard line drives sometimes in excess of 125 miles per hour ( 201 km/h ) . Third basemen often must begin in a position even closer to the batter if a bunt is expected , creating a hazard if the ball is instead hit sharply . As with middle infielders , right-handed throwing players are standard at the position because they do not need to turn their body before throwing across the infield to first base . Mike Squires , who played fourteen games at third base in 1982 and 1983 , is a very rare example of a third baseman who threw lefty . Some third basemen have been converted from middle infielders or outfielders because the position does not require them to run as fast .",
  "/wiki/Second_baseman": "In baseball and softball , second baseman is a fielding position in the infield , between second and first base . The second baseman often possesses quick hands and feet , needs the ability to get rid of the ball quickly , and must be able to make the pivot on a double play . In addition , second basemen are usually right-handed ; only four left-handed throwing players have ever played second base in Major League Baseball since 1950 . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the second baseman is assigned the number 4 . Good second basemen need to have very good range since they have to field balls closer to the first baseman who is often holding runners on , or moving towards the base to cover . On a batted ball to right field , the second baseman goes out towards the ball for the relay . Due to these requirements , second base is sometimes a primarily defensive position in the modern game , but there are hitting stars as well .",
  "/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals": "The Kansas City Royals are an American professional baseball team based in Kansas City , Missouri . They compete in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) as a member team of the American League ( AL ) Central division . The team was founded as an expansion franchise in 1969 , and has participated in four World Series , winning in 1985 and 2015 , and losing in 1980 and 2014 . The name Royals pays homage to the American Royal , a livestock show , horse show , rodeo , and championship barbeque competition held annually in Kansas City since 1899 as well as the identical names of two former negro league baseball teams that played in the first half of the 20th century ( one a semi-pro team based in Kansas City in the 1910s and 1920s that toured the Midwest and a California Winter League team based in Los Angeles in the 1940s that was managed by Chet Brewer and included Satchel Paige and Jackie Robinson on its roster ) . The Los Angeles team had personnel connections to the Monarchs but could not use the Monarchs name . The name also fits into something of a theme for other professional sports franchises in the city , including the Kansas City Chiefs of the NFL , the former Kansas City Kings of the NBA , and the former Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro National League . In 1968 , the team held a name-the-team contest that received more than 17,000 entries . Sanford Porte , a bridge engineer from the suburb of Overland Park , Kansas was named the winner for his Royals entry . His reason had nothing to do with royalty . Kansas Citys new baseball team should be called the Royals because of Missouris billion-dollar livestock income , Kansas Citys position as the nations leading stocker and feeder market and the nationally known American Royal parade and pageant , Porte wrote . The team 's board voted 6-1 on the name , with the only opposition coming from team owner Ewing Kauffman , who eventually changed his vote and said the name had grown on him . Entering the American League in 1969 along with the Seattle Pilots , the club was founded by Kansas City businessman Ewing Kauffman .",
