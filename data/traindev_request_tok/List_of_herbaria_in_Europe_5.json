  "/wiki/Estonia": "Estonia ( Estonian : Eesti [ \u02c8e\u02d0s\u02b2ti ] ( listen ) ) , officially the Republic of Estonia ( Estonian : Eesti Vabariik ) , is a country on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea in Northern Europe . It is bordered to the north by the Gulf of Finland with Finland on the other side , to the west by the Baltic Sea with Sweden on the other side , to the south by Latvia ( 343 km ) , and to the east by Lake Peipus and Russia ( 338.6 km ) . The territory of Estonia consists of the mainland and of 2,222 islands in the Baltic Sea , covering a total area of 45,227 km2 ( 17,462 sq mi ) , water 2,839 km2 ( 1,096 sq mi ) , land area 42,388 km2 ( 16,366 sq mi ) , and is influenced by a humid continental climate . The official language of the country , Estonian , is the second-most-spoken Finnic language . The territory of Estonia has been inhabited since at least 9,000 BC . Ancient Estonians became some of the last European pagans to adopt Christianity - following the Livonian Crusade in the 13th century . After centuries of successive rule by Germans , Danes , Swedes , Poles and Russians , a distinct Estonian national identity began to emerge in the 19th and early 20th centuries . This culminated in independence from Russia in 1920 after a brief War of Independence at the end of World War I . Initially democratic prior to the Great Depression , Estonia experienced authoritarian rule from 1934 during the Era of Silence . During World War II ( 1939-1945 ) , Estonia was repeatedly contested and occupied by the Soviet Union and Germany , ultimately being incorporated into the former . After the loss of its de facto independence , Estonia 's de jure state continuity was preserved by diplomatic representatives and the government-in-exile . In 1987 the peaceful Singing Revolution began against Soviet rule , resulting in the restoration of de facto independence on 20 August 1991 .",

  "/wiki/Vilnius_University": "Vilnius University ( Lithuanian : Vilniaus universitetas ; former names exist ) is the oldest university in the Baltic states , one of the oldest and most famous in Central Europe , preceded only by the universities of Prague , Krak\u00f3w , P\u00e9cs , Budapest , Bratislava and K\u00f6nigsberg . Founded in the 16th century , it was the easternmost university in the world . Today it is the largest university in Lithuania . The university was founded in 1579 as the Jesuit Academy ( College ) of Vilnius by Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland , Stephen B\u00e1thory . It was the third oldest university ( after the Cracow Academy and the Albertina ) in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth . In the aftermath of the Third Partition of Poland ( 1795 ) and the November Uprising ( 1830-1831 ) , the university was closed down and suspended its operation until 1919 . In the aftermath of World War I the university saw failed attempts to restart it by Lithuania ( December 1918 ) and invading Soviet forces ( March 1919 ) . It finally resumed operations as Stefan Batory University in Poland ( August 1919 ) , a period followed by another Soviet occupation in 1920 , and the less than two-years of the Republic of Central Lithuania , incorporated into Poland in 1922 . Following the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939 , the university was briefly administered by the Lithuanian authorities ( from October 1939 ) , and then after Soviet annexation of Lithuania ( June 1940 ) , punctuated by a period of German occupation after German invasion of the Soviet Union ( 1941-1944 ) , administrated as Vilnius State University by the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic . In 1945 the Polish community of students and scholars of Stefan Batory University was transferred to Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru\u0144 .

The wide-ranging Vilnius University ensemble represents all major architectural styles that predominated in Lithuania : Gothic , Renaissance , Baroque and Classicism .",
  "/wiki/Lithuania": "The first known record of the name of Lithuania ( Lithuanian : Lietuva ) is in a 9 March 1009 story of Saint Bruno in the Quedlinburg Chronicle . The Chronicle recorded a Latinized form of the name Lietuva : Litua ( pronounced [ litua ] ) . Due to the lack of reliable evidence , the true meaning of the name is unknown . Nowadays , scholars still debate the meaning of the word and there are a few plausible versions . Since Lietuva has a suffix ( -uva ) , the original word should have no suffix . [ citation needed ] A likely candidate is Liet\u0101 . Because many Baltic ethnonyms originated from hydronyms , linguists have searched for its origin among local hydronyms . Usually , such names evolved through the following process : hydronym \u2192 toponym \u2192 ethnonym . Lietava , a small river not far from Kernav\u0117 , the core area of the early Lithuanian state and a possible first capital of the eventual Grand Duchy of Lithuania , is usually credited as the source of the name . However , the river is very small and some find it improbable that such a small and local object could have lent its name to an entire nation . On the other hand , such naming is not unprecedented in world history . Art\u016bras Dubonis proposed another hypothesis , that Lietuva relates to the word lei\u010diai ( plural of leitis ) .",

The country 's de facto independence was interrupted at the outset of World War II , beginning with Latvia 's forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union , followed by the invasion and occupation by Nazi Germany in 1941 , and the re-occupation by the Soviets in 1944 ( Courland Pocket in 1945 ) to form the Latvian SSR for the next 45 years . The peaceful Singing Revolution , starting in 1987 , called for Baltic emancipation from Soviet rule and condemning the Communist regime 's illegal takeover . It ended with the Declaration on the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia on 4 May 1990 and restoring de facto independence on 21 August 1991 . Latvia is a democratic sovereign state , parliamentary republic and a very highly developed country according to the United Nations Human Development Index .",
