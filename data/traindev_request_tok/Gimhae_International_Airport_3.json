Vietnam Airlines is headquartered in Long Bi\u00ean District , Hanoi , with hubs at Noi Bai International Airport and Tan Son Nhat International Airport . The airline flies to 64 destinations in 17 countries , excluding codeshared services . From its inception until the early 1990s , Vietnam Airlines was a minor carrier within the aviation industry as it was hampered by a variety of factors including the socio-economic and political situation of the country . With the government 's normalization of relations with the United States , the airline was able to expand , improve its products and services , and modernize its ageing fleet . In 1996 , the Vietnamese government brought together 20 service companies to form Vietnam Airlines Corporation , with the airline itself as the centrepiece . In 2010 , the corporation was restructured into a limited liability company and renamed Vietnam Airlines Company Limited . A seven-seat management board , members of which are appointed by the Vietnamese Prime Minister , oversees the company . As passenger transport constitutes its core activity , Vietnam Airlines plays a crucial role in the economic development of the country . It owns 100% of Vietnam Air Service Company - a regional airline in southern Vietnam , 70% of the low-cost carrier Jetstar Pacific Airlines , and 49% of the Cambodian national airline Cambodia Angkor Air .",
