  "/wiki/Caliber": "In guns , particularly firearms , caliber ( or calibre in British English ) is the specified nominal internal diameter of the gun barrel bore regardless of how or where the bore is measured and whether or not the finished bore matches that specification . It is measured in inches to an accuracy of hundredths or thousandths of an inch or in millimeters . For example , a .45 caliber firearm has a barrel diameter of roughly 0.45 inches ( 11 mm ) . Barrel diameters can also be expressed using metric dimensions . For example , a 9 mm pistol has a barrel diameter of about 9 millimeters . Due to the inaccuracy and imprecision of imperial dimensions converted to metric units , metric designations are typically far out of specifications published in decimal inches . True caliber specifications require imperial measure , and even when cartridge designations ( often mistakenly referred to as caliber ) only specify caliber to even tenths or hundredths of an inch , actual barrel/chamber/projectile dimensions are published to at least thousandths of an inch and frequently tolerances extend into ten-thousandths of an inch . In a rifled barrel , the distance is measured between opposing lands or between opposing grooves ; groove measurements are common in cartridge designations originating in the United States , while land measurements are more common elsewhere in the world . Measurements across the grooves are used for maximum precision because rifling and the specific caliber so-measured is the result of final machining process which cuts grooves into the rough bore leaving the lands behind . Good performance requires a concentric , straight bore that accurately centers the projectile within , in preference to a tight fit which can be achieved even with off-center , crooked bores that cause excessive friction , fouling and an out-of-balance , wobbling projectile in flight . While modern firearms are generally referred to by the name of the cartridge the gun is chambered for , they are still categorized together based on bore diameter . For example , a firearm might be described as a 30 caliber rifle , which could be any of a wide range of cartridges using a roughly 0.30 inches ( 7.6 mm ) projectile ; or a 22 rimfire , referring to any rimfire firearms firing cartridges with a .22 caliber projectile .",

  "/wiki/German_Empire": "The German Empire ( German : Deutsches Kaiserreich , officially Deutsches Reich ) , sometimes referred to as Imperial Germany , was the German nation state that existed from the unification of Germany in 1871 until the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II in 1918 . It was founded on 1 January 1871 when the south German states , except for Austria , joined the North German Confederation and the new constitution came into force changing the name of the federal state to the German Empire and introduced the title of German Emperor for Wilhelm I , King of Prussia from the House of Hohenzollern . Berlin remained its capital , and Otto , Prince of Bismarck , Minister-President of Prussia became Chancellor , the head of government . As these events occurred , the Prussian-led North German Confederation and its southern German allies were still engaged in the Franco-Prussian War . The German Empire consisted of 26 states , most of them ruled by royal families . They included four kingdoms , six grand duchies , five duchies ( six before 1876 ) , seven principalities , three free Hanseatic cities , and one imperial territory . Although Prussia was one of several kingdoms in the realm , it contained about two thirds of Germany 's population and territory . Prussian dominance had also been established constitutionally . After 1850 , the states of Germany had rapidly become industrialized , with particular strengths in coal , iron ( and later steel ) , chemicals , and railways . In 1871 , Germany had a population of 41 million people ; by 1913 , this had increased to 68 million . A heavily rural collection of states in 1815 , the now united Germany became predominantly urban . During its 47 years of existence , the German Empire was an industrial , technological , and scientific giant , gaining more Nobel Prizes in science than any other country .",

Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people .

Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD .

The official name of the state was Deutsches Reich ( German Reich ) until 1943 and Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich ( Greater German Reich ) from 1943 to 1945 . Nazi Germany is also known as the Third Reich ( Drittes Reich ) , meaning Third Realm or Third Empire , the first two being the Holy Roman Empire ( 800-1806 ) and the German Empire ( 1871-1918 ) . The Nazi regime ended after the Allies defeated Germany in May 1945 , ending World War II in Europe . Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by the President of the Weimar Republic , Paul von Hindenburg , on 30 January 1933 . The NSDAP then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power . Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the offices and powers of the Chancellery and Presidency . A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole F\u00fchrer ( leader ) of Germany . All power was centralised in Hitler 's person and his word became the highest law .

  "/wiki/3.7_cm_PaK_36": "The Pak 36 ( Panzerabwehrkanone 36 ) is a 3.7 cm caliber German anti-tank gun used during the Second World War . It was the main anti-tank weapon of Wehrmacht Panzerj\u00e4ger units until 1942 . Developed by Rheinmetall in 1933 , it was first issued to the German Army in 1936 , with 9,120 being available by the beginning of the war in September 1939 and a further 5,339 produced during the war . As the predominant anti-tank gun design in the world during the late 1930s , demand was high for the Pak 36 , with another 6,000 examples produced for export and the design being copied by the Soviet Union as the 45 mm anti-tank gun M1932 ( 19-K ) and by other nations such as Japan . It first saw service during the Spanish Civil War in 1936 , where it performed well against the light tanks of the conflict . It was first used during the Second World War against Poland in 1939 and had little difficulty with any of the Polish tanks . The Battle of France in 1940 revealed its inadequate penetration capability against French and British heavy tanks , receiving the derisive door-knocker nickname from its crews , but it sufficed to defeat the bulk of the Allied armor in the campaign . The invasion of the Soviet Union brought the Pak 36 face to face with large numbers of T-34 and KV-1 tanks , which were invulnerable to its fire . However , 91% of the Soviet tank forces in 1941 consisted of lighter types that lacked sufficient armor to defeat the gun , and the Pak 36 knocked out thousands of such tanks . The Pak 36 was replaced from late 1940 onward by the 5 cm Pak 38 anti-tank gun and from November 1941 by the 7.5 cm Pak 40 . This process was accelerated by the engagements with the modern Soviet tanks , and Pak 36 production ceased entirely in early 1942 . The introduction in 1943 of the Stielgranate 41 shaped charge gave it the ability to punch through the armor of any Allied tank , but the ammunition 's short range made the Pak 36 crews vulnerable to enemy fire and could not solve the gun 's basic obsolescence .",
