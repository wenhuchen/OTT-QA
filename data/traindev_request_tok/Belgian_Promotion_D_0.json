The province was separated from the neighbouring Luxembourg by the Third Partition of Luxembourg , de jure in 1830-31 by the Conference of London dealing with the consequences of the Belgian Revolution of 1830 , de facto in 1839 , after William I , King of the Netherlands and Grand-Duke of Luxembourg , agreed to its decisions and thus the province was given to the newly created Kingdom of Belgium .",
