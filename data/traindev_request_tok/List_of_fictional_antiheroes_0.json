Several works , such as The Confidential Agent , The Quiet American , Our Man in Havana , The Human Factor , and his screenplay for The Third Man , also show Greene 's avid interest in the workings and intrigues of international politics and espionage .

  "/wiki/Stephen_Dedalus": "Stephen Dedalus is James Joyce 's literary alter ego , appearing as the protagonist and antihero of his first , semi-autobiographical novel of artistic existence A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and an important character in Joyce 's Ulysses . In Stephen Hero , an early version of what became Portrait , Stephen 's surname is spelled Daedalus in more precise allusion to Daedalus , the architect in Greek myth who was contracted by King Minos to build the Labyrinth in which he would imprison his wife 's son the Minotaur . Buck Mulligan makes reference to the mythological namesake in Ulysses , telling Stephen , Your absurd name , an ancient Greek ! In revising the mammoth Stephen Hero into the considerably more compact Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man , Joyce shortened the name to Dedalus . Stephen Dedalus appears in Ulysses as the character who corresponds to Telemachus ; less overtly , he embodies aspects of Hamlet . He is the protagonist of the first three chapters . Subsequently , Leopold Bloom is introduced , and Stephen 's interactions with Bloom and his wife , Molly , form much of the final chapters ' substance . Mirroring his mythological namesake , Daedalus ( or Daidalos in the Greek pronunciation and transliteration ) , whom Ovid described in the Metamorphoses ( VIII:183-235 ) as being shut up in a tower to prevent his knowledge of the labyrinth from spreading to the public , Stephen is introduced taking breakfast in the Sandycove Martello tower in Dublin on the morning of 16 June 1904 . Stephen shares his opinions about religion , especially as they relate to the recent death of his mother , with his quasi-friend Buck Mulligan , who manages to offend Stephen before making plans to go drinking later that evening as they part ways . In the second chapter Stephen teaches a class of boys a history lesson on ancient Rome . In the Proteus chapter ( in Greek myth Proteus was the old man of the sea and the shepherd of sea animals who knew all things past , present , and future but disliked telling what he knew ) , Stephen ambles along the strand as his thoughts are related in the form of an internal monologue . Following several chapters concerning Bloom , Stephen returns to the fore of the novel in the library episode , in which he expounds at length to some acquaintances his theory of the obscurely autobiographical nature of Shakespeare 's works and questions the institution of fatherhood , deeming it to be a fiction .",
  "/wiki/A_Portrait_of_the_Artist_as_a_Young_Man": "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is the first novel of Irish writer James Joyce . A K\u00fcnstlerroman in a modernist style , it traces the religious and intellectual awakening of young Stephen Dedalus , a fictional alter ego of Joyce and an allusion to Daedalus , the consummate craftsman of Greek mythology . Stephen questions and rebels against the Catholic and Irish conventions under which he has grown , culminating in his self-exile from Ireland to Europe . The work uses techniques that Joyce developed more fully in Ulysses ( 1922 ) and Finnegans Wake ( 1939 ) . A Portrait began life in 1904 as Stephen Hero - a projected 63-chapter autobiographical novel in a realistic style . After 25 chapters , Joyce abandoned Stephen Hero in 1907 and set to reworking its themes and protagonist into a condensed five-chapter novel , dispensing with strict realism and making extensive use of free indirect speech that allows the reader to peer into Stephen 's developing consciousness . American modernist poet Ezra Pound had the novel serialised in the English literary magazine The Egoist in 1914 and 1915 , and published as a book in 1916 by B. W. Huebsch of New York .

It is considered one of the most important works of modernist literature and has been called a demonstration and summation of the entire movement . According to Declan Kiberd , Before Joyce , no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking . Ulysses chronicles the peripatetic appointments and encounters of Leopold Bloom in Dublin in the course of an ordinary day , 16 June 1904 . Ulysses is the Latinised name of Odysseus , the hero of Homer 's epic poem the Odyssey , and the novel establishes a series of parallels between the poem and the novel , with structural correspondences between the characters and experiences of Leopold Bloom and Odysseus , Molly Bloom and Penelope , and Stephen Dedalus and Telemachus , in addition to events and themes of the early 20th-century context of modernism , Dublin , and Ireland 's relationship to Britain . The novel is highly allusive and also imitates the styles of different periods of English literature . Since its publication , the book has attracted controversy and scrutiny , ranging from an obscenity trial in the United States in 1921 , to protracted textual Joyce Wars . The novel 's stream-of-consciousness technique , careful structuring , and experimental prose - replete with puns , parodies , and allusions - as well as its rich characterisation and broad humour , have led it to be regarded as one of the greatest literary works in history ; Joyce fans worldwide now celebrate 16 June as Bloomsday .",

In 1970 , he wrote an unconventional magazine feature titled The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved for Scanlan 's Monthly which both raised his profile and established him as a writer with counterculture credibility . It also set him on a path to establishing his own sub-genre of New Journalism which he called Gonzo , which was essentially an ongoing experiment in which the writer becomes a central figure and even a participant in the events of the narrative . Thompson remains best known for Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas ( 1971 ) , a book first serialized in Rolling Stone in which he grapples with the implications of what he considered the failure of the 1960s counterculture movement . It was adapted on film twice : loosely in Where the Buffalo Roam starring Bill Murray as Thompson in 1980 , and directly in 1998 by director Terry Gilliam in a film starring Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro . The Doonesbury cartoon character Duke - who was modeled after Thompson - pens an essay about my shoplifting conviction titled Fear and Loathing at Macy 's Menswear , a reference to Thompson 's book . Politically minded , Thompson ran unsuccessfully for sheriff of Pitkin County , Colorado in 1970 on the Freak Power ticket . He became well known for his dislike of Richard Nixon , who he claimed represented that dark , venal , and incurably violent side of the American character . He covered Nixon 's 1972 reelection campaign for Rolling Stone and later collected the stories in book form as Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72 . Thompson 's output notably declined from the mid-1970s , as he struggled with the consequences of fame , and he complained that he could no longer merely report on events as he was too easily recognized . He was also known for his lifelong use of alcohol and illegal narcotics , his love of firearms , and his iconoclastic contempt for authoritarianism .",

He served an apprenticeship with a printer and then worked as a typesetter , contributing articles to the newspaper of his older brother Orion Clemens . He later became a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River before heading west to join Orion in Nevada . He referred humorously to his lack of success at mining , turning to journalism for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise .

The short story brought international attention and was even translated into French . His wit and satire , in prose and in speech , earned praise from critics and peers , and he was a friend to presidents , artists , industrialists , and European royalty . Twain earned a great deal of money from his writings and lectures , but he invested in ventures that lost most of it - such as the Paige Compositor , a mechanical typesetter that failed because of its complexity and imprecision .

  "/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby": "The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional towns of West Egg and East Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922 . The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession with the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan . Considered to be Fitzgerald 's magnum opus , The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence , idealism , resistance to change , social upheaval and excess , creating a portrait of the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary [ a ] tale regarding the American Dream . Fitzgerald - inspired by the parties he had attended while visiting Long Island 's North Shore - began planning the novel in 1923 , desiring to produce , in his words , something new - something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned . Progress was slow , with Fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the French Riviera in 1924 . His editor , Maxwell Perkins , felt the book was vague and persuaded the author to revise over the following winter . Fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the book 's title and he considered a variety of alternatives , including titles that referred to the Roman character Trimalchio ; the title he was last documented to have desired was Under the Red , White , and Blue . First published by Scribner 's in April 1925 , The Great Gatsby received mixed reviews and sold poorly . In its first year , the book sold only 20,000 copies . Fitzgerald died in 1940 , believing himself to be a failure and his work forgotten .

  "/wiki/Hamlet": "The Tragedy of Hamlet , Prince of Denmark , often shortened to Hamlet ( /\u02c8h\u00e6ml\u026at/ ) , is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare sometime between 1599 and 1601 . It is Shakespeare 's longest play with 30,557 words . Set in Denmark , the play depicts Prince Hamlet and his revenge against his uncle , Claudius , who has murdered Hamlet 's father in order to seize his throne and marry Hamlet 's mother . Hamlet is Shakespeare 's longest play and is considered among the most powerful and influential works of world literature , with a story capable of seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others . It was one of Shakespeare 's most popular works during his lifetime and still ranks among his most performed , topping the performance list of the Royal Shakespeare Company and its predecessors in Stratford-upon-Avon since 1879 . It has inspired many other writers - from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Charles Dickens to James Joyce and Iris Murdoch - and has been described as the world 's most filmed story after Cinderella . The story of Shakespeare 's Hamlet was derived from the legend of Amleth , preserved by 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum , as subsequently retold by the 16th-century scholar Fran\u00e7ois de Belleforest . Shakespeare may also have drawn on an earlier Elizabethan play known today as the Ur-Hamlet , though some scholars believe Shakespeare wrote the Ur-Hamlet , later revising it to create the version of Hamlet we now have . He almost certainly wrote his version of the title role for his fellow actor , Richard Burbage , the leading tragedian of Shakespeare 's time . In the 400 years since its inception , the role has been performed by numerous highly acclaimed actors in each successive century . Three different early versions of the play are extant : the First Quarto ( Q1 , 1603 ) ; the Second Quarto ( Q2 , 1604 ) ; and the First Folio ( F1 , 1623 ) . Each version includes lines and entire scenes missing from the others .",

He is often called England 's national poet and the Bard of Avon ( or simply the Bard ) . [ b ] His extant works , including collaborations , consist of some 39 plays , [ c ] 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613 . [ d ] His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres .",
