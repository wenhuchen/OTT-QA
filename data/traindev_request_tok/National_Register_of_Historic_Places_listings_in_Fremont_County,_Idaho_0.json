  "/wiki/U.S._Route_20": "U.S. Route 20 or U.S. Highway 20 ( US 20 ) is an east-west United States highway that stretches from the Pacific Northwest all the way to New England . The 0 in its route number indicates that US 20 is a coast-to-coast route and major route . Spanning 3,365 miles ( 5,415 km ) , it is the longest road in the United States , and the route is roughly parallel to that of the newer Interstate 90 ( I-90 ) , which is in turn the longest Interstate Highway in the U.S . There is a discontinuity in the official designation of US 20 through Yellowstone National Park , with unnumbered roads used to traverse the park . US 20 and US 30 break the general U.S. Route numbering rules in Oregon , since US 30 actually starts north of US 20 in Astoria , and runs parallel to the north throughout the state ( the Columbia River and Interstate 84 ) . The two run concurrently and continue in the correct positioning near Caldwell , Idaho . This is because US 20 was not a planned coast-to-coast route while US 30 was . US 20 originally ended at the eastern entrance of Yellowstone Park ; it was extended in 1940 . The highway 's eastern terminus is in Boston , Massachusetts , at Kenmore Square , where it meets Route 2 .
