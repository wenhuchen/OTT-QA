  "/wiki/Call_to_the_Bar": "The call to the bar is a legal term of art in most common law jurisdictions where persons must be qualified to be allowed to argue in court on behalf of another party and are then said to have been called to the bar or to have received a call to the bar . The bar is now used as a collective noun for barristers , but literally referred to the wooden barrier in old courtrooms , which separated the often crowded public area at the rear from the space near the judges reserved for those having business with the Court . Barristers would sit or stand immediately behind it , facing the judge , and could use it as a table for their briefs . Like many other common law terms , the term originated in England in the Middle Ages , and the call to the bar refers to the summons issued to one found fit to speak at the 'bar ' of the royal courts . In time , English judges allowed only legally qualified men to address them on the law and later delegated the qualification and admission of barristers to the four Inns of Court . Once an Inn calls one of its members to its bar , they are thereafter a barrister . They may not , however , practise as a barrister until they have completed ( or been exempted from ) an apprenticeship called pupillage . After completing pupillage , they are considered to be a practising barrister with a right of audience before all courts . England and Wales and some other jurisdictions distinguish two types of lawyers , who are regulated by different bodies , with separate training , examinations , regulation and traditions :",

The present diocese covers the county of Lincolnshire and the unitary authority areas of North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire . The bishop 's seat ( cathedra ) is located in the Cathedral Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the city of Lincoln . The cathedral was originally a minster church founded around 653 and refounded as a cathedral in 1072 . Until the 1530s the bishops were in full communion with the Roman Catholic Church . The historic medieval Bishop 's Palace lies immediately to the south of the cathedral in Palace Yard ; managed by English Heritage , it is open to visitors . A later residence ( first used by Bishop Edward King in 1885 ) on the same site was converted from office accommodation to reopen in 2009 as a 16-bedroom conference centre and wedding venue . It is now known as Edward King House and provides offices for the bishops , archdeacons and diocesan staff . A 14-bedroom house ( Bishop 's House ) on Eastgate was the official residence in use from 1948 until 2011 , when the bishop 's office staff and home were separated , allowing the incoming bishop , Christopher Lowson , to live in a modern five-bedroom house . A further residence of the mediaeval Bishops of Lincoln was Banbury Castle , built in 1135 by Alexander of Lincoln , Bishop of Lincoln and retained by the see until 1547 .",

  "/wiki/Bishop_of_Winchester": "The Bishop of Winchester is the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Winchester in the Church of England . The bishop 's seat ( cathedra ) is at Winchester Cathedral in Hampshire . During the Middle Ages , it was one of the wealthiest English sees , and its bishops have included a number of politically prominent Englishmen , notably the 9th century Saint Swithun and medieval magnates including William of Wykeham and Henry of Blois . The Bishop of Winchester is appointed by the Crown , and is one of five Church of England bishops who sit ex officio among the 26 Lords Spiritual in the House of Lords , regardless of their length of service . The Diocese of Winchester is one of the oldest and most important in England . Originally it was the episcopal see of the kingdom of Wessex or the West Saxons , with its cathedra at Dorchester Cathedral under Saints Birinus and Agilbert . The cathedral at Dorchester was founded in AD 634 by Birinius , a Roman missionary . The see was transferred to Winchester in AD 660 . Winchester was divided in AD 909 , with Wiltshire and Berkshire transferring to the new See of Ramsbury . Nevertheless , the domains of the Bishop of Winchester ran from the south coast to the south bank of the River Thames at Southwark , where the bishop had one of his palaces , making it one of the largest as well as one of the richest sees in the land . In more modern times , the former extent of the Diocese of Winchester was reduced by the formation of a new diocese of Southwark in south London , a new diocese of Guildford in Surrey and a new diocese of Portsmouth in Hampshire . The most recent loss of territory was in 2014 when the Channel Islands were removed from the diocese of Winchester after a dispute with Bishop Tim Dakin led to a breakdown in relations .",

  "/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury": "The Archbishop of Canterbury is the senior bishop and principal leader of the Church of England , the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion and the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Canterbury . The current archbishop is Justin Welby , who was enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral on 21 March 2013 . Welby is the 105th in a line which goes back more than 1400 years to Augustine of Canterbury , the Apostle to the English , sent from Rome in the year 597 . Welby succeeded Rowan Williams . From the time of Augustine until the 16th century , the archbishops of Canterbury were in full communion with the See of Rome and usually received the pallium from the Pope . During the English Reformation , the Church of England broke away from the authority of the Pope . Thomas Cranmer became the first holder of the office following the English Reformation in 1533 , while Reginald Pole was the last Roman Catholic in the position , serving from 1556 to 1558 during the Counter-Reformation . In the Middle Ages there was considerable variation in the methods of nomination of the Archbishop of Canterbury and other bishops . At various times the choice was made by the canons of Canterbury Cathedral , the Pope , or the King of England . Since the English Reformation , the Church of England has been more explicitly a state church and the choice is legally that of the Crown ; today it is made by the reigning monarch on the advice of the British prime minister , who in turn receives a shortlist of two names from an ad hoc committee called the Crown Nominations Commission .",

Laudianism refers to a collection of rules on matters of ritual , in particular , that were enforced by Laud in order to maintain uniform worship in England and Wales , in line with the king 's preferences . They were precursors to later High Church views . In theology , Laud was accused of being an Arminian and opponent of Calvinism , as well as covertly favouring Roman Catholic doctrines ( see Arminianism in the Church of England ) . On all three grounds , he was regarded by Puritan clerics and laymen as a formidable and dangerous opponent . Laud favoured scholars , and was a major collector of manuscripts .
