  "/wiki/Rudraveena": "Rudra veena ( also spelled Rudra vina , and also called B\u012bn in North India ) , is a large plucked string instrument , originating from the Indian subcontinent , used in Hindustani classical music , one of the major types of veena played in Indian classical music . It has a long tubular body made of wood or bamboo with a length between 54 and 62 inches . Two large , round resonators , made of dried and hollowed gourds , are attached under the tube . Twenty-four brass-fitted raised wooden frets are fixed on the tube with the help of wax . There are 4 main strings and 3 chikari strings . As Rudra is a name for the Hindu god Shiva , rudra vina literally means the veena dear to Shiva . Shiva is also said to have created the Rudraveena , inspired by his wife , Parvati . It is an ancient instrument rarely played today . The rudra veena declined in popularity in part due to the introduction in the early 19th century of the surbahar , which allowed sitarists to more easily present the alap sections of slow dhrupad-style ragas . In the 20th century , Zia Mohiuddin Dagar modified and redesigned the rudra veena to use bigger gourds , a thicker tube ( dandi ) , thicker steel playing strings ( 0.45-0.47 mm ) and closed javari that . This produced a soft and deep sound when plucked without the use of any plectrum ( mizrab ) . The instrument was further modified as the shruti veena by Lalmani Misra to establish Bharat 's Shadja Gram and obtain the 22 shrutis .",
