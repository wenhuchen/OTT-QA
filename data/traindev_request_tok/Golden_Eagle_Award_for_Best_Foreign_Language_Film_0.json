It also draws on pious accounts such as the Friday of Sorrows along with other devotional writings , such as the reputed Marian apparitions attributed to Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich . The film primarily covers the final twelve hours before Jesus ' death , consisting of the Passion , hence the title of the film . It begins with the Agony in the Garden in the Garden of Olives ( or Gethsemane ) , the betrayal of Judas Iscariot , the brutal Scourging at the Pillar , the suffering of the Blessed Virgin Mary as prophesied by Simeon , the crucifixion and death of Christ , and ends with a brief depiction of His Resurrection . However , the film also has flashbacks to particular moments in Christ 's life , some of which are Biblically based , such as The Last Supper and The Sermon on the Mount , and others that are artistic license , such as when Mary comforts Jesus and the scene where Jesus is crafting a table . It was , for the most part , shot in Italy . The dialogue is entirely in Hebrew , Latin , and reconstructed Aramaic . And , although Mel Gibson was initially against it , the film also has subtitles .
