He became notable for his Kon-Tiki expedition in 1947 , in which he sailed 8,000 km ( 5,000 mi ) across the Pacific Ocean in a hand-built raft from South America to the Tuamotu Islands . The expedition was designed to demonstrate that ancient people could have made long sea voyages , creating contacts between separate cultures . This was linked to a diffusionist model of cultural development . Heyerdahl subsequently made other voyages designed to demonstrate the possibility of contact between widely separated ancient people , notably the Ra II expedition of 1970 , when he sailed from the west coast of Africa to Barbados in a papyrus reed boat . He was appointed a government scholar in 1984 . In May 2011 , the Thor Heyerdahl Archives were added to UNESCO 's Memory of the World Register . At the time , this list included 238 collections from all over the world . The Heyerdahl Archives span the years 1937 to 2002 and include his photographic collection , diaries , private letters , expedition plans , articles , newspaper clippings , original book , and article manuscripts .
