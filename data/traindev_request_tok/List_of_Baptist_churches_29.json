  "/wiki/Brooklyn,_New_York": "Brooklyn ( /\u02c8br\u028akl\u026an/ ) is a borough of New York City , coterminous with Kings County , located in the U.S. state of New York , the most populous county in the state , and the second-most densely populated county in the United States . It is New York City 's most populous borough , with an estimated 2,504,700 residents in 2010 . Named after the Dutch village of Breukelen , it shares a land border with the borough of Queens at the western end of Long Island . Brooklyn has several bridge and tunnel connections to the borough of Manhattan across the East River , and the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge connects it with Staten Island . With a land area of 70.82 square miles ( 183.4 km2 ) and water area of 26 square miles ( 67 km2 ) , Kings County is New York state 's fourth-smallest county by land area and third-smallest by total area , though it is the second-largest among the city 's five boroughs . If each borough were ranked as a city , Brooklyn would rank as the third-most populous in the U.S. , after Los Angeles and Chicago . Brooklyn was an independent incorporated city ( and previously an authorized village and town within the provisions of the New York State Constitution ) until January 1 , 1898 , when , after a long political campaign and public relations battle during the 1890s , according to the new Municipal Charter of Greater New York , Brooklyn was consolidated with the other cities , boroughs , and counties to form the modern City of New York , surrounding the Upper New York Bay with five constituent boroughs . The borough continues , however , to maintain a distinct culture . Many Brooklyn neighborhoods are ethnic enclaves . Brooklyn 's official motto , displayed on the Borough seal and flag , is Eendraght Maeckt Maght , which translates from early modern Dutch as Unity makes strength . In the first decades of the 21st century , Brooklyn has experienced a renaissance as an avant-garde destination for hipsters , with concomitant gentrification , dramatic house price increases and a decrease in housing affordability . Since the 2010s , Brooklyn has evolved into a thriving hub of entrepreneurship , high technology startup firms , postmodern art and design .",

The Buffalo area was inhabited before the 17th century by the Native American Iroquois tribe and later by French colonizers . The city grew significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of immigration , the construction of the Erie Canal and rail transportation , and its close proximity to Lake Erie . This growth provided an abundance of fresh water and an ample trade route to the Midwestern United States while grooming its economy for the grain , steel and automobile industries that dominated the city 's economy in the 20th century . Since the city 's economy relied heavily on manufacturing , deindustrialization in the latter half of the 20th century led to a steady decline in population .
