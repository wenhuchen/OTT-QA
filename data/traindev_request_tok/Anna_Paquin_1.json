  "/wiki/Irena_Sendler": "Irena Stanis\u0142awa Sendler ( n\u00e9e Krzy\u017canowska ) , also referred to as Irena Sendlerowa in Poland , nom de guerre Jolanta ( 15 February 1910 - 12 May 2008 ) , was a Polish humanitarian , social worker , and nurse who served in the Polish Underground Resistance during World War II in German-occupied Warsaw . From October 1943 she was head of the children 's section of \u017begota , the Polish Council to Aid Jews ( Polish : Rada Pomocy \u017bydom ) . In the 1930s , Sendler conducted her social work as one of the activists connected to the Free Polish University . From 1935 to October 1943 , she worked for the Department of Social Welfare and Public Health of the City of Warsaw . She also pursued informally , and during the war , conspiratorial activities such as rescuing Jews , primarily as part of the network of workers and volunteers from that department , mostly women . Sendler participated , with dozens of others , in smuggling Jewish children out of the Warsaw Ghetto and then providing them with false identity documents and shelter with willing Polish families or in orphanages and other care facilities , including Catholic nun convents , saving those children from the Holocaust . The German occupiers suspected Sendler 's involvement in the Polish Underground and in October 1943 she was arrested by the Gestapo , but she managed to hide the list of the names and locations of the rescued Jewish children , preventing this information from falling into the hands of the Gestapo . Withstanding torture and imprisonment , Sendler refused to reveal anything about her work or the location of the saved children . She was sentenced to death but narrowly escaped on the day of her scheduled execution , after \u017begota bribed German leaders to obtain her release . In post-war communist Poland , Sendler continued her social activism but also pursued a government career . In 1965 , she was recognised by the State of Israel as Righteous Among the Nations . Among the many decorations Sendler received were the Gold Cross of Merit granted her in 1946 for the saving of Jews and the Order of the White Eagle , Poland 's highest honour , awarded late in Sendler 's life for her wartime humanitarian efforts .",
  "/wiki/Phineas_and_Ferb": "Phineas and Ferb is an American animated musical comedy television series produced by Disney Television Animation . Originally broadcast as a one-episode preview on August 17 , 2007 , and again previewed on September 28 , 2007 , the series officially premiered on February 1 , 2008 , on Disney Channel , running until June 12 , 2015 . The program follows Phineas Flynn and his stepbrother Ferb Fletcher on summer vacation . Every day , the boys embark on some grand new project ; these are usually unrealistic given the protagonists ' ages ( and are sometimes downright physically impossible ) , which annoys their controlling sister , Candace , who frequently tries to reveal their shenanigans to her and Phineas ' mother , Linda Flynn-Fletcher , and less frequently to Ferb 's father , Lawrence Fletcher . The series follows a standard plot system : running gags occur every episode , and the b-plot almost always features Phineas and Ferb 's pet platypus Perry the Platypus working as a spy ( named Agent P ) for OWCA ( the Organization Without a Cool Acronym ) , to defeat the latest scheme of Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz , a mad scientist driven largely by a need to assert his evilness ( although he is not especially evil and has a good heart in some situations ) . The two plots intersect at the end to erase all traces of the boys ' project just before Candace can show it to their mother . This usually leaves Candace very frustrated . Creators Dan Povenmire and Jeff Swampy Marsh had previously worked together on Fox 's The Simpsons and Nickelodeon 's Rocko 's Modern Life . The creators also voice two of the main B-plot characters : Major Monogram and Dr. Doofenshmirtz . Phineas and Ferb was conceived after Povenmire sketched a triangular boy - the prototype for Phineas - in a restaurant . Povenmire and Marsh developed the series concept together and pitched it to networks for 16 years before securing a run on Disney Channel .",
