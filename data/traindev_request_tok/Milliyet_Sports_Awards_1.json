  "/wiki/Politics": "Politics is the set of activities that are associated with the governance of a country , state or an area . It involves making decisions that apply to groups of members . It refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance - organized control over a human community , particularly a state . The academic study focusing on just politics , which is therefore more targeted than general political science , is sometimes referred to as politology ( not to be confused with politicology , a synonym for political science ) . In modern nation-states , people often form political parties to represent their ideas . Members of a party often agree to take the same position on many issues and agree to support the same changes to law and the same leaders . An election is usually a competition between different parties . Some examples of political parties worldwide are : the African National Congress ( ANC ) in South Africa , the Democratic Party ( D ) in the United States , the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom , the Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) in Germany and the Indian National Congress in India which has the highest number of political parties in the world ( 2546 political parties ) . Politics is a multifaceted word . It has a set of fairly specific meanings that are descriptive and nonjudgmental ( such as the art or science of government and political principles ) , but does often colloquially carry a negative connotation . The word has been used negatively for many years : the British national anthem as published in 1745 calls on God to Confound their politics , and the phrase play politics , for example , has been in use since at least 1853 , when abolitionist Wendell Phillips declared : We do not play politics ; anti-slavery is no half-jest with us . A variety of methods are deployed in politics , which include promoting one 's own political views among people , negotiation with other political subjects , making laws , and exercising force , including warfare against adversaries .",

  "/wiki/Commissioner": "A commissioner is , in principle , a member of a commission or an individual who has been given a commission ( official charge or authority to do something ) . In practice , the title of commissioner has evolved to include a variety of senior officials , often sitting on a specific commission . In particular , commissioner frequently refers to senior police or government officials . A High Commissioner is equivalent to an ambassador , originally between the United Kingdom and the Dominions and now between all Commonwealth states , whether Commonwealth realms , republics , or countries having a monarch other than that of the realms . The title is sometimes given to senior officials in the private sector ; for instance , many North American sports leagues . There is some confusion between commissioners and commissaries , because other European languages use the same word for both . Therefore titles such as commissaire in French , Kommissar in German and comisario in Spanish or commissario in Italian , can mean either commissioner or commissary in English , depending on the context .",

He or she is the final decision-making authority on all facts connected with play , and is the only official on the pitch with the authority to start and stop play and impose disciplinary action against players during a match . At most levels of play the referee is assisted by two assistant referees ( formerly known as linesmen ) , who are empowered to advise the referee in certain situations such as the ball leaving play or infringements of the Laws of the Game occurring out of the view of the referee ; however , the assistant referees ' decisions are not binding and the referee has authority to overrule an assistant referee . At higher levels of play the referee may also be assisted by a fourth official who supervises the teams ' technical areas and assists the referee with administrative tasks , and , at the very highest levels , additional assistant referees and/or video assistant referees . The International Football Association Board ( IFAB ) determines the Laws of the Game . Referees and other game officials are licensed and trained by its member national organisations . Referees ' remuneration for their services varies between leagues . Many are wholly amateur , some may be paid a small fee or reimbursed for expenses , and , in some countries , a limited number of referees - mainly those who officiate in their country 's top league - are employed full-time by their national associations and receive a retainer at the start of every season plus match fees . Each national organisation recommends its top officials to FIFA to have the additional honour of being included on the FIFA International Referees List . International games between national teams require FIFA officials . Otherwise , the local national organisation determines the manner of training , ranking and advancement of officials from the youngest youth games through professional matches .",
