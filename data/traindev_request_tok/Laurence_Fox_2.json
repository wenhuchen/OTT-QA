He was a grandee and one of the wealthiest peers of the court of Elizabeth I . Under James I , Northumberland was a long-term prisoner in the Tower of London , due to the suspicion that he was complicit in the Gunpowder Plot . He is known for the circles he moved in as well as for his own achievements . He acquired the sobriquet The Wizard Earl ( also given to Gerald FitzGerald , 11th Earl of Kildare ) , from his scientific and alchemical experiments , his passion for cartography , and his large library . His mild deafness and slight speech impediment did not prevent him from becoming an important intellectual and cultural figure of his generation .",
  "/wiki/The_Wild_Duck": "The Wild Duck ( original Norwegian title : Vildanden ) is an 1884 play by the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen . It is considered the first modern masterpiece in the genre of tragicomedy . The Wild Duck and Rosmersholm are often to be observed in the critics ' estimates vying with each other as rivals for the top place among Ibsen 's works .",
  "/wiki/Henrik_Ibsen": "Henrik Johan Ibsen ( /\u02c8\u026abs\u0259n/ ; Norwegian : [ \u02c8h\u025b\u0300nr\u026ak \u02c8\u026a\u0300psn\u0329 ] ; 20 March 1828 - 23 May 1906 ) was a Norwegian playwright and theatre director . As one of the founders of modernism in theatre , Ibsen is often referred to as the father of realism and one of the most influential playwrights of his time . His major works include Brand , Peer Gynt , An Enemy of the People , Emperor and Galilean , A Doll 's House , Hedda Gabler , Ghosts , The Wild Duck , When We Dead Awaken , Rosmersholm , and The Master Builder . He is the most frequently performed dramatist in the world after Shakespeare , and A Doll 's House was the world 's most performed play in 2006 . Ibsen 's early poetic and cinematic play Peer Gynt has strong surreal elements . After Peer Gynt Ibsen abandoned verse and wrote in realistic prose . Several of his later dramas were considered scandalous to many of his era , when European theatre was expected to model strict morals of family life and propriety . Ibsen 's later work examined the realities that lay behind the facades , revealing much that was disquieting to a number of his contemporaries . He had a critical eye and conducted a free inquiry into the conditions of life and issues of morality . In many critics ' estimates The Wild Duck and Rosmersholm are vying with each other as rivals for the top place among Ibsen 's works ; Ibsen himself regarded Emperor and Galilean as his masterpiece . Ibsen is often ranked as one of the most distinguished playwrights in the European tradition . Richard Hornby describes him as a profound poetic dramatist - the best since Shakespeare .",
  "/wiki/Titus_Andronicus": "Titus Andronicus is a tragedy by William Shakespeare , believed to have been written between 1588 and 1593 , probably in collaboration with George Peele . It is thought to be Shakespeare 's first tragedy and is often seen as his attempt to emulate the violent and bloody revenge plays of his contemporaries , which were extremely popular with audiences throughout the 16th century . The play is set during the latter days of the Roman Empire and tells the fictional story of Titus , a general in the Roman army , who is engaged in a cycle of revenge with Tamora , Queen of the Goths . It is Shakespeare 's bloodiest and most violent work . It has traditionally been regarded as one of his least respected plays . Extremely popular in its day , it had fallen out of favor by the later 17th century . Victorian era disapproved of it largely because of what was regarded as its distasteful graphic violence . However , beginning around the middle of the 20th century , its reputation began to improve .",
  "/wiki/William_Shakespeare": "William Shakespeare ( bapt . 26 April 1564 - 23 April 1616 ) [ a ] was an English poet , playwright , and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's greatest dramatist . He is often called England 's national poet and the Bard of Avon ( or simply the Bard ) . [ b ] His extant works , including collaborations , consist of some 39 plays , [ c ] 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613 . [ d ] His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres .",
  "/wiki/Ulysses_(novel)": "Ulysses is a modernist novel by Irish writer James Joyce . It was first serialised in parts in the American journal The Little Review from March 1918 to December 1920 and then published in its entirety in Paris by Sylvia Beach on 2 February 1922 , Joyce 's 40th birthday . It is considered one of the most important works of modernist literature and has been called a demonstration and summation of the entire movement . According to Declan Kiberd , Before Joyce , no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking . Ulysses chronicles the peripatetic appointments and encounters of Leopold Bloom in Dublin in the course of an ordinary day , 16 June 1904 . Ulysses is the Latinised name of Odysseus , the hero of Homer 's epic poem the Odyssey , and the novel establishes a series of parallels between the poem and the novel , with structural correspondences between the characters and experiences of Leopold Bloom and Odysseus , Molly Bloom and Penelope , and Stephen Dedalus and Telemachus , in addition to events and themes of the early 20th-century context of modernism , Dublin , and Ireland 's relationship to Britain . The novel is highly allusive and also imitates the styles of different periods of English literature . Since its publication , the book has attracted controversy and scrutiny , ranging from an obscenity trial in the United States in 1921 , to protracted textual Joyce Wars . The novel 's stream-of-consciousness technique , careful structuring , and experimental prose - replete with puns , parodies , and allusions - as well as its rich characterisation and broad humour , have led it to be regarded as one of the greatest literary works in history ; Joyce fans worldwide now celebrate 16 June as Bloomsday .",
  "/wiki/James_Joyce": "James Augustine Aloysius Joyce ( 2 February 1882 - 13 January 1941 ) was an Irish novelist , short story writer , poet , teacher , and literary critic . He contributed to the modernist avant-garde and is regarded as one of the most influential and important authors of the 20th century . Joyce is best known for Ulysses ( 1922 ) , a landmark work in which the episodes of Homer 's Odyssey are paralleled in a variety of literary styles , most famously stream of consciousness . Other well-known works are the short-story collection Dubliners ( 1914 ) , and the novels A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man ( 1916 ) and Finnegans Wake ( 1939 ) . His other writings include three books of poetry , a play , his published letters and occasional journalism . Joyce was born in Dublin into a middle-class family . A brilliant student , he briefly attended the Christian Brothers-run O'Connell School before excelling at the Jesuit schools Clongowes and Belvedere , despite the chaotic family life imposed by his father 's unpredictable finances . He went on to attend University College Dublin . In 1904 , in his early twenties , Joyce emigrated to continental Europe with his partner ( and later wife ) Nora Barnacle . They lived in Trieste , Paris , and Z\u00fcrich . Although most of his adult life was spent abroad , Joyce 's fictional universe centres on Dublin and is populated largely by characters who closely resemble family members , enemies and friends from his time there . Ulysses in particular is set with precision in the streets and alleyways of the city .",
  "/wiki/Stephen_Daedalus": "Stephen Dedalus is James Joyce 's literary alter ego , appearing as the protagonist and antihero of his first , semi-autobiographical novel of artistic existence A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and an important character in Joyce 's Ulysses . In Stephen Hero , an early version of what became Portrait , Stephen 's surname is spelled Daedalus in more precise allusion to Daedalus , the architect in Greek myth who was contracted by King Minos to build the Labyrinth in which he would imprison his wife 's son the Minotaur . Buck Mulligan makes reference to the mythological namesake in Ulysses , telling Stephen , Your absurd name , an ancient Greek ! In revising the mammoth Stephen Hero into the considerably more compact Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man , Joyce shortened the name to Dedalus . Stephen Dedalus appears in Ulysses as the character who corresponds to Telemachus ; less overtly , he embodies aspects of Hamlet . He is the protagonist of the first three chapters . Subsequently , Leopold Bloom is introduced , and Stephen 's interactions with Bloom and his wife , Molly , form much of the final chapters ' substance . Mirroring his mythological namesake , Daedalus ( or Daidalos in the Greek pronunciation and transliteration ) , whom Ovid described in the Metamorphoses ( VIII:183-235 ) as being shut up in a tower to prevent his knowledge of the labyrinth from spreading to the public , Stephen is introduced taking breakfast in the Sandycove Martello tower in Dublin on the morning of 16 June 1904 . Stephen shares his opinions about religion , especially as they relate to the recent death of his mother , with his quasi-friend Buck Mulligan , who manages to offend Stephen before making plans to go drinking later that evening as they part ways . In the second chapter Stephen teaches a class of boys a history lesson on ancient Rome . In the Proteus chapter ( in Greek myth Proteus was the old man of the sea and the shepherd of sea animals who knew all things past , present , and future but disliked telling what he knew ) , Stephen ambles along the strand as his thoughts are related in the form of an internal monologue . Following several chapters concerning Bloom , Stephen returns to the fore of the novel in the library episode , in which he expounds at length to some acquaintances his theory of the obscurely autobiographical nature of Shakespeare 's works and questions the institution of fatherhood , deeming it to be a fiction .",
  "/wiki/The_Wild_Goose_Chase": "The Wild Goose Chase is a late Jacobean stage play , a comedy written by John Fletcher , first performed in 1621 . It is often classed among Fletcher 's most effective and best-constructed plays ; Edmund Gosse called it one of the brightest and most coherent of Fletcher 's comedies , a play which it is impossible to read and not be in a good humour . The drama 's wit , sparkle , and urbanity anticipated and influenced the Restoration comedy of the later decades of the seventeenth century . The term wild-goose chase is first documented when used by Shakespeare in the early 1590s , but appears as a term with which his audience would be familiar , as there is no attempt to define its meaning .",
  "/wiki/John_Fletcher_(playwright)": "John Fletcher ( 1579-1625 ) was a Jacobean playwright . Following William Shakespeare as house playwright for the King 's Men , he was among the most prolific and influential dramatists of his day ; during his lifetime and in the early Restoration , his fame rivalled Shakespeare 's . He collaborated on writing plays with Francis Beaumont , and also with William Shakespeare on two plays . Though his reputation has been far eclipsed since , Fletcher remains an important transitional figure between the Elizabethan popular tradition and the popular drama of the Restoration .",
  "/wiki/The_Provoked_Wife": "The Provoked Wife ( 1697 ) is the second original comedy written by John Vanbrugh . It made its first appearance in Lincoln 's Inn Fields in May , 1697 . The often-repeated claim that Vanbrugh wrote part of his comedy The Provoked Wife in the Bastille is based on allusions in a couple of much later memoirs , but is regarded with some doubt by modern scholars ( see McCormick ) . It is different in tone from his first play , the largely farcical The Relapse , and adapted to the greater acting skills of the new company of actors chosen for its premiere , who walked out not long before in a dispute with management . The actors ' cooperative boasted the established star performers of the age , and Vanbrugh tailored The Provoked Wife to their specialties . While The Relapse had been robustly phrased to be suitable for amateurs and minor acting talents , he could count on versatile professionals like Thomas Betterton , Elizabeth Barry , and the rising young star Anne Bracegirdle to do justice to characters of depth and nuance .",
  "/wiki/John_Vanbrugh": "Sir John Vanbrugh ( /\u02c8v\u00e6nbr\u0259/ ; 24 January 1664 ( baptised ) - 26 March 1726 ) was an English architect , dramatist and herald , perhaps best known as the designer of Blenheim Palace and Castle Howard . He wrote two argumentative and outspoken Restoration comedies , The Relapse ( 1696 ) and The Provoked Wife ( 1697 ) , which have become enduring stage favourites but originally occasioned much controversy . He was knighted in 1714 . Vanbrugh was in many senses a radical throughout his life . As a young man and a committed Whig , he was part of the scheme to overthrow James II and put William III on the throne . He was imprisoned by the French as a political prisoner . In his career as a playwright , he offended many sections of Restoration and 18th century society , not only by the sexual explicitness of his plays , but also by their messages in defence of women 's rights in marriage . He was attacked on both counts , and was one of the prime targets of Jeremy Collier 's Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage . In his architectural career , he created what came to be known as English Baroque . His architectural work was as bold and daring as his early political activism and marriage-themed plays , and jarred conservative opinions on the subject .",
  "/wiki/Hobson's_Choice_(play)": "Hobson 's Choice is a play by Harold Brighouse , the title taken from the popular expression , Hobson 's choice - meaning no choice at all ( from Thomas Hobson 1545-1631 who ran a thriving livery stable in Cambridge ) .

It then transferred to London on 24 June 1916 at the Apollo Theatre , before moving to the Prince of Wales Theatre on 20 November 1916 ( starring Norman McKinnel , as Henry Hobson , Edyth Goodall as Maggie Hobson and Joe Nightingale as Willie Mossop ) . It was performed by the National Theatre at the Old Vic , London in 1964 ( starring Michael Redgrave , Joan Plowright and Frank Finlay . ) The play was adapted for film several times and as a Broadway musical . The Crucible Theatre Sheffield staged a revival in June 2011 directed by Christopher Luscombe and starring Barrie Rutter , Zoe Waites and Philip McGinley . The story is set in Salford in 1880 . It bears many resemblances to the stories of Cinderella and King Lear including a deceased mother ; three daughters , two of whom are pretty and frivolous , the third of whom is clever and hardworking ; and a fairy godmother ( Mrs. Hepworth ) .",

  "/wiki/Mrs_Warren's_Profession": "Mrs. Warren 's Profession is a play written by George Bernard Shaw in 1893 , and first performed in London in 1902 . The play is about a former prostitute , now a madam ( brothel proprietor ) , who attempts to come to terms with her disapproving daughter . It is a problem play , offering social commentary to illustrate Shaw 's belief that the act of prostitution was not caused by moral failure but by economic necessity . Elements of the play were borrowed from Shaw 's 1882 novel Cashel Byron 's Profession , about a man who becomes a boxer due to limited employment opportunities .",
  "/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw": "George Bernard Shaw ( /\u02c8b\u0259rn\u0251\u02d0rd/ ; 26 July 1856 - 2 November 1950 ) , known at his insistence simply as Bernard Shaw , was an Irish playwright , critic , polemicist and political activist . His influence on Western theatre , culture and politics extended from the 1880s to his death and beyond . He wrote more than sixty plays , including major works such as Man and Superman ( 1902 ) , Pygmalion ( 1912 ) and Saint Joan ( 1923 ) . With a range incorporating both contemporary satire and historical allegory , Shaw became the leading dramatist of his generation , and in 1925 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature . Born in Dublin , Shaw moved to London in 1876 , where he struggled to establish himself as a writer and novelist , and embarked on a rigorous process of self-education . By the mid-1880s he had become a respected theatre and music critic . Following a political awakening , he joined the gradualist Fabian Society and became its most prominent pamphleteer . Shaw had been writing plays for years before his first public success , Arms and the Man in 1894 . Influenced by Henrik Ibsen , he sought to introduce a new realism into English-language drama , using his plays as vehicles to disseminate his political , social and religious ideas . By the early twentieth century his reputation as a dramatist was secured with a series of critical and popular successes that included Major Barbara , The Doctor 's Dilemma and Caesar and Cleopatra . Shaw 's expressed views were often contentious ; he promoted eugenics and alphabet reform , and opposed vaccination and organised religion . He courted unpopularity by denouncing both sides in the First World War as equally culpable , and although not a republican , castigated British policy on Ireland in the postwar period .",
