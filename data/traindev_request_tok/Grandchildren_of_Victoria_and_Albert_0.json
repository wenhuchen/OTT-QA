  "/wiki/Victoria,_Princess_Royal": "Victoria , Princess Royal ( Victoria Adelaide Mary Louisa ; 21 November 1840 - 5 August 1901 ) was German Empress and Queen of Prussia by marriage to German Emperor Frederick III . She was the eldest child of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha , and was created Princess Royal in 1841 . She was the mother of Wilhelm II , German Emperor . Educated by her father in a politically liberal environment , Victoria was betrothed at the age of sixteen to Prince Frederick of Prussia and supported him in his views that Prussia and the later German Empire should become a constitutional monarchy on the British model . Criticised for this attitude and for her English origins , Victoria suffered ostracism by the Hohenzollerns and the Berlin court . This isolation increased after the rise to power of Otto von Bismarck ( one of her most staunch political opponents ) in 1862 . Victoria was empress for only a few months , during which she had opportunity to influence the policy of the German Empire . Frederick III died in 1888 - just 99 days after his accession - from laryngeal cancer and was succeeded by their son William II , who had much more conservative views than his parents . After her husband 's death , she became widely known as Empress Frederick ( German : Kaiserin Friedrich ) . The empress dowager then settled in Kronberg im Taunus , where she built Friedrichshof , a castle , named in honour of her late husband . Increasingly isolated after the weddings of her younger daughters , Victoria died of breast cancer on 5 August 1901 , not long after her mother 's death on 22 January 1901 . The correspondence between Victoria and her parents has been preserved almost completely : 3,777 letters from Queen Victoria to her eldest daughter , and about 4,000 letters from the empress to her mother are preserved and catalogued .",
  "/wiki/Princess_Royal": "Princess Royal is a substantive title customarily ( but not automatically ) awarded by a British monarch to his or her eldest daughter . There have been seven Princesses Royal . Princess Anne is the current Princess Royal . Queen Elizabeth II was never known as the Princess Royal because her aunt , Princess Mary , was in possession of the title . The title Princess Royal came into existence when Queen Henrietta Maria ( 1609-1669 ) , daughter of Henry IV , King of France , and wife of King Charles I ( 1600-1649 ) , wanted to imitate the way the eldest daughter of the King of France was styled Madame Royale . Thus Princess Mary ( born 1631 ) , the daughter of Henrietta Maria and Charles , became the first Princess Royal in 1642 . Princess Mary ( later Queen Mary II ) ( 1662-1694 ) , eldest daughter of King James II and VII , and Princess Sophia Dorothea ( 1687-1757 ) , only daughter of King George I , were eligible for this honour but did not receive it . At the time she became eligible for the title , Princess Mary was already Princess of Orange , while Sophia Dorothea was already Queen in Prussia when she became eligible for the title . Princess Louisa Maria ( 1692-1712 ) , the youngest daughter of King James II ( died 1701 ) , born after he lost his crown in the Glorious Revolution of 1688-1689 , was considered to be Princess Royal during James 's exile by Jacobites at Saint-Germain-en-Laye and was so called by Jacobites , even though she was not James 's eldest living daughter at any time during her life . Even before the title of Princess Royal came into use in England , the eldest daughter of the King or Queen of England had a special status in law . For instance , according to Magna Carta , the barons of the realm owed aids to finance the first wedding of the king 's eldest daughter , and by a statute of the 25th year of King Edward III , sleeping with the king 's eldest daughter before her marriage constitutes an act of high treason punishable by death .",
  "/wiki/Frederick_III,_German_Emperor": "Frederick III ( German : Friedrich III . ; 18 October 1831 - 15 June 1888 ) was German Emperor and King of Prussia for ninety-nine days in 1888 , the Year of the Three Emperors . Known informally as Fritz , he was the only son of Emperor Wilhelm I and was raised in his family 's tradition of military service . Although celebrated as a young man for his leadership and successes during the Second Schleswig , Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian wars , he nevertheless professed a hatred of warfare and was praised by friends and enemies alike for his humane conduct . Following the unification of Germany in 1871 his father , then King of Prussia , became the German Emperor . Upon Wilhelm 's death at the age of ninety on 9 March 1888 , the thrones passed to Frederick , who had by then been German Crown Prince for seventeen years and Crown Prince of Prussia for twenty-seven years . Frederick was suffering from cancer of the larynx when he died , aged fifty-six , following unsuccessful medical treatments for his condition . Frederick married Victoria , Princess Royal , eldest daughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom . The couple were well-matched ; their shared liberal ideology led them to seek greater representation for commoners in the government . Frederick , in spite of his conservative militaristic family background , had developed liberal tendencies as a result of his ties with Britain and his studies at the University of Bonn . As the Crown Prince , he often opposed the conservative Chancellor Otto von Bismarck , particularly in speaking out against Bismarck 's policy of uniting Germany through force , and in urging that the power of the Chancellorship be curbed . Liberals in both Germany and Britain hoped that as emperor , Frederick III would move to liberalize the German Empire .",
  "/wiki/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor": "Wilhelm II or William II ( German : Friedrich Wilhelm Viktor Albert ; 27 January 1859 - 4 June 1941 ) was the last German Emperor ( Kaiser ) and King of Prussia . He reigned from 15 June 1888 until his abdication on 9 November 1918 shortly before Germany 's defeat in World War I . The eldest grandchild of Queen Victoria , Wilhelm 's first cousins included King George V of the United Kingdom and many princesses who , along with Wilhelm 's sister Sophia , became European consorts . For most of his life before becoming emperor , he was second in line to succeed his grandfather Wilhelm I on the German and Prussian thrones after his father , Crown Prince Frederick . His grandfather and father both died in 1888 , the Year of Three Emperors , making Wilhelm emperor and king . He dismissed the country 's longtime chancellor , Otto von Bismarck , in 1890 . Upon consolidating power as emperor , Wilhelm launched Germany on a bellicose New Course to cement its status as a respected world power . However , he frequently undermined this aim by making tactless , alarming public statements without consulting his ministers . He also did much to alienate his country from the other Great Powers by initiating a massive build-up of the German Navy , challenging French control over Morocco , and backing the Austrian annexation of Bosnia in 1908 . His turbulent reign ultimately culminated in his guarantee of military support to Austria-Hungary during the crisis of July 1914 , resulting in the outbreak of World War I . A lax wartime leader , he left virtually all decision-making regarding military strategy and organisation of the war effort in the hands of the German General Staff . This broad delegation of authority gave rise to a de facto military dictatorship whose belligerent foreign policy led to the United States ' entry into the war on 6 April 1917 .",
  "/wiki/Sophia_of_Prussia": "Sophia of Prussia ( Sophie Dorothea Ulrike Alice ; 14 June 1870 - 13 January 1932 ) was Queen consort of Greece during 1913-1917 and 1920-1922 . A member of the House of Hohenzollern and daughter of Frederick III , German Emperor , Sophia received a liberal and anglophile education , under the supervision of her mother , Victoria , Princess Royal . In 1889 , less than a year after the death of her father , she married her third cousin Constantine , heir apparent to the Greek throne . After a difficult period of adaptation in her new country , Sophia gave birth to six children and became involved in the assistance to the poor , following in the footsteps of her mother-in-law , Queen Olga . However , it was during the wars which Greece faced during the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century that Sophia showed the most social activity : she founded field hospitals , oversaw the training of Greek nurses , and healed wounded soldiers . However , Sophia was hardly rewarded for her actions , even after her grandmother Queen Victoria decorated her with the Royal Red Cross after the Thirty Days ' War : the Greeks criticized her links with Germany . Her brother Emperor William II was indeed an ally of the Ottoman Empire and openly opposed the construction of the Megali Idea , which could establish a Greek state that would encompass all ethnic Greek-inhabited areas . During World War I , the blood ties between Sophia and the German Emperor also aroused the suspicion of the Triple Entente , which criticized Constantine I for his neutrality in the conflict . After imposing a blockade of Greece and supporting the rebel government of Eleftherios Venizelos , causing the National Schism , France and its allies deposed Constantine I in June 1917 . Sophia and her family then went into exile in Switzerland , while the second son of the royal couple replaced his father on the throne under the name of Alexander I . At the same time , Greece entered the war alongside the Triple Entente , which allowed it to grow considerably . After the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in 1919 and the untimely death of Alexander I the following year , the Venizelists abandoned power , allowing the royal family 's return to Athens .",

One of the last Welsh princes , Llywelyn ap Gruffudd , was killed in battle in 1282 by Edward I , King of England , whose son Edward ( born in Caernarfon Castle in 1284 ) was invested as the first English Prince of Wales in 1301 . Since the 14th century , the title has been a dynastic title granted to the heir apparent to the English or British monarch , but the failure to be granted the title does not affect the rights to royal succession . The title is granted to the heir apparent as a personal honour or dignity , and is not heritable , merging with the Crown on accession to the throne . The title Earl of Chester is always given in conjunction with that of Prince of Wales . The Prince of Wales usually has other titles and honours . The current and longest-serving Prince of Wales is Prince Charles , the eldest son of Elizabeth II , who is Queen of the United Kingdom and 15 other independent Commonwealth realms as well as Head of the 53-member Commonwealth of Nations . The wife of the Prince of Wales is entitled to the title Princess of Wales . Prince Charles 's first wife , Diana , used that title , but his second wife , Camilla , uses only the title Duchess of Cornwall ( or of Rothesay when in Scotland ) because the other title has become so popularly associated with Diana .",

The eldest son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha , Edward was related to royalty throughout Europe . He was Prince of Wales and heir apparent to the British throne for almost 60 years . During the long reign of his mother , he was largely excluded from political power , and came to personify the fashionable , leisured elite . He travelled throughout Britain performing ceremonial public duties , and represented Britain on visits abroad . His tours of North America in 1860 and the Indian subcontinent in 1875 were popular successes , but despite public approval his reputation as a playboy prince soured his relationship with his mother . As king , Edward played a role in the modernisation of the British Home Fleet and the reorganisation of the British Army after the Second Boer War . He reinstituted traditional ceremonies as public displays and broadened the range of people with whom royalty socialised . He fostered good relations between Britain and other European countries , especially France , for which he was popularly called Peacemaker , but his relationship with his nephew , the German Emperor Wilhelm II , was poor . The Edwardian era , which covered Edward 's reign and was named after him , coincided with the start of a new century and heralded significant changes in technology and society , including steam turbine propulsion and the rise of socialism . He died in 1910 in the midst of a constitutional crisis that was resolved the following year by the Parliament Act 1911 , which restricted the power of the unelected House of Lords .",

Alexandra 's family had been relatively obscure until 1852 , when her father , Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg , was chosen with the consent of the major European powers to succeed his distant cousin , Frederick VII of Denmark . At the age of sixteen , she was chosen as the future wife of Albert Edward , Prince of Wales , the heir apparent of Queen Victoria . They married eighteen months later in 1863 , the same year her father became King Christian IX of Denmark and her brother was appointed as King George I of Greece . She was Princess of Wales from 1863 to 1901 , the longest anyone has ever held that title , and became generally popular ; her style of dress and bearing were copied by fashion-conscious women . Largely excluded from wielding any political power , she unsuccessfully attempted to sway the opinion of British ministers and her husband 's family to favour Greek and Danish interests . Her public duties were restricted to uncontroversial involvement in charitable work . On the death of Queen Victoria in 1901 , Albert Edward became king-emperor as Edward VII , with Alexandra as queen-empress . She held the status until Edward 's death in 1910 .

Born during the reign of his grandmother Queen Victoria , George was third in the line of succession behind his father , Prince Albert Edward , and his own elder brother , Prince Albert Victor . From 1877 to 1891 , George served in the Royal Navy , until the unexpected death of his elder brother in early 1892 put him directly in line for the throne . On the death of his grandmother in 1901 , George 's father ascended the throne as Edward VII , and George was created Prince of Wales . He became king-emperor on his father 's death in 1910 . George V 's reign saw the rise of socialism , communism , fascism , Irish republicanism , and the Indian independence movement , all of which radically changed the political landscape . The Parliament Act 1911 established the supremacy of the elected British House of Commons over the unelected House of Lords . As a result of the First World War ( 1914-1918 ) , the empires of his first cousins Nicholas II of Russia and Wilhelm II of Germany fell , while the British Empire expanded to its greatest effective extent . In 1917 , George became the first monarch of the House of Windsor , which he renamed from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha as a result of anti-German public sentiment . In 1924 he appointed the first Labour ministry and in 1931 the Statute of Westminster recognised the dominions of the Empire as separate , independent states within the British Commonwealth of Nations . He had smoking-related health problems throughout much of his later reign and at his death was succeeded by his eldest son , Edward VIII .",

Following his death , Queen Victoria entered a period of intense mourning and Alice spent the next six months acting as her mother 's unofficial secretary . On 1 July 1862 , while the court was still at the height of mourning , Alice married the minor German Prince Louis of Hesse , heir to the Grand Duchy of Hesse . The ceremony - conducted privately and with unrelieved gloom at Osborne House - was described by the Queen as more of a funeral than a wedding . The Princess 's life in Darmstadt was unhappy as a result of impoverishment , family tragedy and worsening relations with her husband and mother .

  "/wiki/Stillbirth": "Stillbirth is typically defined as fetal death at or after 20 to 28 weeks of pregnancy ( depending on the source ) . It results in a baby born without signs of life . A stillbirth can result in the feeling of guilt or grief in the mother .

Causes may include pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia and birth complications , problems with the placenta or umbilical cord , birth defects , infections such as malaria and syphilis , and poor health in the mother . Risk factors include a mother 's age over 35 , smoking , drug use , use of assisted reproductive technology , and first pregnancy . Stillbirth may be suspected when no fetal movement is felt . Confirmation is by ultrasound . Worldwide prevention of most stillbirths is possible with improved health systems . About half of stillbirths occur during childbirth , with this being more common in the developing than developed world .
