Frangula purshiana , Rhamnus purshianus ) is a species of plant in the family Rhamnaceae . It is native to western North America from southern British Columbia south to central California , and eastward to northwestern Montana . The dried bark of cascara was used as a laxative in folk medicine by the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest .",
  "/wiki/Anthraquinone": "Anthraquinone , also called anthracenedione or dioxoanthracene , is an aromatic organic compound with formula C14H8O2 . Isomers include various quinone derivatives . The term anthraquinone , however refers to the isomer , 9,10-anthraquinone ( IUPAC : 9,10-dioxoanthracene ) wherein the keto groups are located on the central ring . It is a building block of many dyes and is used in bleaching pulp for papermaking . It is a yellow , highly crystalline solid , poorly soluble in water but soluble in hot organic solvents . It is almost completely insoluble in ethanol near room temperature but 2.25 g will dissolve in 100 g of boiling ethanol .",
  "/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)": "The large intestine , also known as the large bowel , is the last part of the gastrointestinal tract and of the digestive system in vertebrates . Water is absorbed here and the remaining waste material is stored as feces before being removed by defecation . The colon is the largest portion of the large intestine , so many mentions of the large intestine and colon overlap in meaning whenever precision is not the focus . Most sources define the large intestine as the combination of the cecum , colon , rectum , and anal canal . Some other sources exclude the anal canal . In humans , the large intestine begins in the right iliac region of the pelvis , just at or below the waist , where it is joined to the end of the small intestine at the cecum , via the ileocecal valve . It then continues as the colon ascending the abdomen , across the width of the abdominal cavity as the transverse colon , and then descending to the rectum and its endpoint at the anal canal . Overall , in humans , the large intestine is about 1.5 metres ( 5 ft ) long , which is about one-fifth of the whole length of the gastrointestinal tract .",
  "/wiki/Buckthorn": "Rhamnus is a genus of about 110 accepted species of shrubs or small trees , commonly known as buckthorns , in the family Rhamnaceae . Its species range from 1 to 10 meters ( 3'-30 ' ) tall ( rarely to 15 metres , 50 ' ) and are native mainly in east Asia and North America , but found throughout the temperate and subtropical Northern Hemisphere , and also more locally in the subtropical Southern Hemisphere in parts of Africa and South America . Both deciduous and evergreen species occur . The leaves are simple , 3 to 15 centimeters ( 1- 6 ) long , and arranged alternately , in opposite pairs , or almost paired ( subopposite ) . One distinctive character of many buckthorns is the way the veination curves upward towards the tip of the leaf . The plant bears fruits which are black or red berry-like drupes . The name is due to the woody spine on the end of each twig in many species .",
  "/wiki/Senna_(herb)": "Senna , the sennas , is a large genus of flowering plants in the legume family ( Fabaceae , subfamily Caesalpinioideae , tribe Cassieae ) . This diverse genus is native throughout the tropics , with a small number of species in temperate regions . The number of species is estimated to be from about 260 to 350 . The type species for the genus is Senna alexandrina . About 50 species of Senna are known in cultivation .",
  "/wiki/Senna_glycoside": "Senna glycoside , also known as sennoside or senna , is a medication used to treat constipation and empty the large intestine before surgery . The medication is taken by mouth or via the rectum . It typically begins working in minutes when given by rectum and within twelve hours when given by mouth . It is a weaker laxative than bisacodyl or castor oil . Common side effects of senna glycoside include abdominal cramps . It is not recommended for long-term use , as it may result in poor bowel function or electrolyte problems . While no harm has been found to result from use while breastfeeding , such use is not typically recommended . It is not typically recommended in children . Senna may change urine to a somewhat reddish color . Senna derivatives are a type of stimulant laxative and are of the anthraquinone type . While its mechanism of action is not entirely clear , senna is thought to act by increasing fluid secretion within and contraction of the large intestine . It is on the World Health Organization 's List of Essential Medicines , the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system .",
  "/wiki/Aloe_vera": "Aloe vera ( /\u02c8\u00e6lo\u028ai\u02d0/ or /\u02c8\u00e6lo\u028a/ ) is a succulent plant species of the genus Aloe . An evergreen perennial , it originates from the Arabian Peninsula , but grows wild in tropical , semi-tropical , and arid climates around the world . It is cultivated for agricultural and medicinal uses . The species is also used for decorative purposes and grows successfully indoors as a potted plant . It is found in many consumer products including beverages , skin lotion , cosmetics , or ointments for minor burns and sunburns . There is little clinical evidence for the effectiveness or safety of Aloe vera extract as a cosmetic or medicine .",
  "/wiki/Aloin": "Aloin , also known as barbaloin , is a bitter , yellow-brown colored compound noted in the exudate of at least 68 Aloe species at levels from 0.1 to 6.6% of leaf dry weight ( making between 3% and 35% of the total exudate ) ( Groom & Reynolds , 1987 ) , and in another 17 species at indeterminate levels [ Reynolds , 1995b ] . It is used as a stimulant-laxative , treating constipation by inducing bowel movements . The compound is present in what is commonly referred to as the aloe latex that exudes from cells adjacent to the vascular bundles , found under the rind of the leaf and in between it and the gel . When dried , it has been used as a bittering agent in commerce ( alcoholic beverages ) [ 21 CFR 172.510 . Scientific names given include Aloe perryi , A. barbadensis ( = A. vera ) , A. ferox , and hybrids of A. ferox with A. africana and A . spicata. ] . Aloe is listed in federal regulations as a natural substance that may be safely used in food when used in the minimum quantity required to produce their intended physical or technical effect and in accordance with all the principles of good manufacturing practice . This food application is generally limited to use in quite small quantities as a flavoring in alcoholic beverages and may usually be identified only as a natural flavor . In May 2002 , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) issued a ruling that aloe laxatives are no longer generally recognized as safe ( GRAS ) and effective , meaning that aloin-containing products are no longer available in over-the-counter drug products in the United States , because they may be carcinogenic and more data is needed to establish otherwise . Aloe vera leaf latex is a concentrate of an herb or other botanical , and so meets the statutory description of an ingredient that may be used in dietary supplements .",
  "/wiki/Phenolphthalein": "Phenolphthalein is a chemical compound with the formula C20H14O4 and is often written as HIn or phph in shorthand notation . Phenolphthalein is often used as an indicator in acid-base titrations . For this application , it turns colorless in acidic solutions and pink in basic solutions . It belongs to the class of dyes known as phthalein dyes . Phenolphthalein is slightly soluble in water and usually is dissolved in alcohols for use in experiments . It is a weak acid , which can lose H+ ions in solution . The phenolphthalein molecule is colorless , and the phenolphthalein ion is pink . When a base is added to the phenolphthalein , the equilibrium shifts , leading to more ionization as H+ ions are removed . This is predicted by Le Chatelier 's principle .",
  "/wiki/Triphenylmethane": "Triphenylmethane , or triphenyl methane , is the hydrocarbon with the formula ( C6H5 ) 3CH . This colorless solid is soluble in nonpolar organic solvents and not in water . Triphenylmethane is the basic skeleton of many synthetic dyes called triarylmethane dyes , many of them are pH indicators , and some display fluorescence . A trityl group in organic chemistry is a triphenylmethyl group Ph3C , e.g . triphenylmethyl chloride ( trityl chloride ) and the triphenylmethyl radical ( trityl radical ) .",
  "/wiki/Bisacodyl": "Bisacodyl ( INN ) is an organic compound that is used as a stimulant laxative drug . It works directly on the colon to produce a bowel movement . It is typically prescribed for relief of episodic and chronic constipation and for the management of neurogenic bowel dysfunction , as well as part of bowel preparation before medical examinations , such as for a colonoscopy . Bisacodyl is a derivative of triphenylmethane . It was first used as a laxative in 1953 because of its structural similarity to phenolphthalein .",
  "/wiki/Oral_administration": "Oral administration is a route of administration where a substance is taken through the mouth . Per os ( P.O . ) is sometimes used as an abbreviation for medication to be taken orally . Many medications are taken orally because they are intended to have a systemic effect , reaching different parts of the body via the bloodstream , for example .",
  "/wiki/Ricinoleic_acid": "Ricinoleic acid , formally called 12-hydroxy-9-cis-octadecenoic acid is a fatty acid . It is an unsaturated omega-9 fatty acid and a hydroxy acid . It is a major component of the seed oil obtained from mature Castor plant ( Ricinus communis L. , Euphorbiaceae ) seeds or in sclerotium of ergot ( Claviceps purpurea Tul. , Clavicipitaceae ) . About 90% of the fatty acid content in castor oil is the triglyceride formed from ricinoleic acid ."
