  "/wiki/Museum_of_Appalachia": "The Museum of Appalachia , located in Norris , Tennessee , 20 miles ( 32 km ) north of Knoxville , is a living history museum that interprets the pioneer and early 20th-century period of the Southern Appalachian region of the United States . Recently named an Affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution , the museum is a collection of more than 30 historic buildings rescued from neglect and decay and gathered onto 63 acres ( 250,000 m2 ) of picturesque pastures and fields . The museum also preserves and displays thousands of authentic relics , maintains one of the nation 's largest folk art collections , and hosts performances of traditional Appalachian music and annual demonstrations by hundreds of regional craftsmen . The museum was established in the 1960s by John Rice Irwin , an East Tennessee educator and businessman , who has followed the basic philosophy of preserving not only structures and artifacts relevant to the region 's history , but also preserving each item 's individual history - who owned it , when and how it was created or obtained , and how it was used . These oral histories and recollections are housed , along with thousands of photographs , in the museum 's archives . Starting from a single log structure , the museum has grown over four decades to include buildings such as the National Register of Historic Places-listed Arnwine Cabin , a rare Appalachian cantilever barn , and a cabin once inhabited by the parents of author Mark Twain . Relics on display include items owned by several notable or colorful Appalachian natives and thousands of tools detailing all aspects of rural life in Southern Appalachia . The museum 's grounds mimic a working pioneer Appalachian farm , with gardens growing typical crops and animals such as goats , chickens , turkeys , and peacocks roaming the grounds freely . What better way is there to know a people , Irwin asked , than to study the everyday things they made , used , mended , and cherished . . . And cared for with loving hands .",

The church was used as a temporary jail for prisoners in the aftermath of the Coal Creek War , a labor uprising that began with the seizure of a convict stockade in Briceville in 1891 .

  "/wiki/Coal_Creek_War": "The Coal Creek War was an early 1890s armed labor uprising in the southeastern United States that took place primarily in Anderson County , Tennessee . This labor conflict ignited during 1891 when coal mine owners in the Coal Creek watershed began to remove and replace their company-employed , private coal miners then on the payroll with convict laborers leased out by the Tennessee state prison system . These former wage-earning Coal Creek coal miners repeatedly attacked and burned both state prison stockades and mine properties , all while releasing hundreds of the state convict laborers from their bondage to the mine companies . Many of these same Coal Creek coal miners were also wounded or killed in small-arms skirmishes during the Coal Creek War , along with dozens of Tennessee state militiamen . One historian describes the Coal Creek War as one of the most dramatic and significant episodes in all American labor history . The Coal Creek War was itself part of a greater labor struggle across Tennessee that was launched against the state government 's controversial convict-leasing system , which allowed the state prison system to lease convict labor to mining companies ( and other business enterprises ) with the effect of suppressing employee wages in the open market across the state . The outbreak of this labor conflict touched off a partisan media firestorm between the miners ' supporters and detractors and brought the issue of convict leasing to the public debate . Although the Coal Creek War essentially ended with the arrests of hundreds of former company coal miners during 1892 . The adverse exposure that this state conflict with private labor generated nationwide led to the downfall of Governor John P. Buchanan , and forced the Tennessee General Assembly to reconsider its state convict labor-leasing system . The Tennessee state government later refused to renew its convict labor-lease contracts with private businesses upon the arrival at the 1896 expiration dates , making Tennessee one of the first states within the southern United States to end this controversial practice .",
