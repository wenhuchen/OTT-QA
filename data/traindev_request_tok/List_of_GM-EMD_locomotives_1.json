  "/wiki/AAR_wheel_arrangement": "The AAR wheel arrangement system is a method of classifying locomotive ( or unit ) wheel arrangements that was developed by the Association of American Railroads . It is essentially a simplification of the European UIC classification , and it is widely used in North America to describe diesel and electric locomotives . It is not used for steam locomotives which use the Whyte notation instead . The AAR system counts axles instead of wheels . Letters refer to powered axles , and numbers to unpowered ( or idler ) axles . A refers to one powered axle , B to two powered axles in a row , C to three powered axles in a row , and D to four powered axles in a row . 1 refers to one idler axle , and 2 to two idler axles in a row . A dash ( - ) separates trucks , or wheel assemblies . A plus sign ( + ) refers to articulation , either by connecting bogies with span bolsters or by connecting individual locomotives via solid drawbars instead of couplers .",
  "/wiki/Prime_mover_(locomotive)": "In engineering , a prime mover is an engine that converts fuel to useful work . In locomotives , the prime mover is thus the source of power for its propulsion . In an engine-generator set , the engine is the prime mover , as distinct from the generator .",
  "/wiki/Horsepower": "Horsepower ( hp ) is a unit of measurement of power , or the rate at which work is done , usually in reference to the output of engines or motors . There are many different standards and types of horsepower . Two common definitions being used today are the mechanical horsepower ( or imperial horsepower ) , which is about 745.7 watts , and the metric horsepower , which is approximately 735.5 watts . The term was adopted in the late 18th century by Scottish engineer James Watt to compare the output of steam engines with the power of draft horses . It was later expanded to include the output power of other types of piston engines , as well as turbines , electric motors and other machinery . The definition of the unit varied among geographical regions . Most countries now use the SI unit watt for measurement of power . With the implementation of the EU Directive 80/181/EEC on January 1 , 2010 , the use of horsepower in the EU is permitted only as a supplementary unit .",

A total of seven were built for the Great Northern Railway , the sole original purchaser ; they were originally numbered # 5400-5406 and later renumbered # 175-181 . The locomotive fundamentally consists of an NW2 hood , prime mover ( a V12 EMD 567 diesel engine ) and main generator on a long frame with road trucks ( Blomberg Bs ) . The extra length was used for a large cab and an additional , full-width hood section , which contained a steam generator for passenger service . The boiler 's exhaust was in the front center of the cab , between the front windows and exiting at the middle of the roof front . The locomotives were delivered in GN 's black diesel paint scheme of the time , but were later repainted in the bright , orange and green Empire Builder scheme . The short exhaust stacks as delivered were at some point replaced by standard conical EMD switcher stacks . The first four locomotives were traded in by GN to EMD on new locomotives in 1965 . The remaining three locomotives were sold to other railroads : # 179 was sold to A.E . Staley Co. of Morrisville , Pennsylvania , keeping the same number ; then locomotive # 179 was purchased by Locomotive Trouble Shooters , from Fairless Hills , PA 19030 and the engine was replaced , # 180 was sold to the Clinchfield Railroad as their # 361 ; # 181 went to Anaconda Aluminum as their # 100 . The Clinchfield locomotive was scrapped ; the Anaconda Aluminum unit is on display at the Whitefish , Montana depot in its GN Empire Builder colors , locomotive # 179 was still in service in Morrisville , Pennsylvania as of 2018 [ update ] .

  "/wiki/Cow-calf": "In North American railroading , a cow-calf ( also cow and calf ) locomotive is a set of switcher-type diesel locomotives . The set usually is a pair ; some 3-unit sets ( with two calves ) were built , but this was rare . A cow is equipped with a driving cab ; a calf is not . The two are coupled together ( either with regular couplers or a semi-permanent drawbar ) and are connected with MU cables and brake lines so that both locomotive units can be operated from a single cab . Cows are analogous to A units and calves to B unit road locomotives . Both have prime movers . Like the early EMD FT locomotives , the Cow-calf sets were typically built as mated pairs , with the Cow ( or cabbed unit ) and calf ( or cabless unit ) sharing a number . However this was not always the case , with over time many of the sets being broken up and couplers added to aid with versatility . Most cow-calf sets were built between the 1930s and the 1950s . They were built by several different makers , although General Motors ' Electro-Motive Division built far more than the others . As originally constructed , the cow-calf units were typically used in hump yards where they spent much of their life pushing long trains over the hump for classification . There were , however , a few notable cases where this was not so , with some industrial railroads using non mated pairs as light road switcher locomotives .",

Two pairs were built for the Illinois Central Railroad , the only purchaser . The locomotive units strongly resembled the EMD NW3 , with a long frame , Blomberg B road trucks , and a large cab connected to a wide area of hood that tapered going forward . The locomotives incorporated the machinery of the EMD FT in switcher bodywork ; a V16 EMD 567 diesel engine of 1,350 horsepower ( 1,010 kW ) in each unit . The cow and calf units were semipermanently coupled together with a drawbar instead of couplers , in similar fashion to the FT 's twin-unit sets . The two locomotive pairs were numbered 9250A & B and 9251A & B , later renumbered 1350A & B and 1351A & B . They initially were assigned to Markham Yard south of Chicago , IL , but by the early 1950s had been reassigned to the yard at East St. Louis , IL . Both remained in this service until they were retired in 1966 and traded in to EMD in part exchange for new EMD GP40 locomotives .",
