  "/wiki/NY_74": "New York State Route 74 ( NY 74 ) and Vermont Route 74 ( VT 74 ) are state highways in the northeastern United States , connected by one of the last remaining cable ferries in North America . Together they extend for 34 miles ( 55 km ) through Essex County , New York , and Addison County , Vermont . NY 74 begins at exit 28 off Interstate 87 ( I-87 ) in the hamlet of Severance in the Adirondack Mountains region of the northern part of New York State . It extends 20.44 miles ( 32.89 km ) to the western shore of Lake Champlain in Ticonderoga . There , the seasonal Fort Ticonderoga-Larrabees Point Ferry carries cars across the state border into Vermont , where VT 74 starts at the lake 's eastern shore and terminates 13.26 miles ( 21.34 km ) later at a junction with VT 30 in the town of Cornwall . NY 74 is a descendant of the historic Ticonderoga and Schroon Turnpike , which was a privately owned highway chartered in 1832 , and segments of it follow the alignment of the original 19th-century turnpike . The connecting ferry route , predating both NY 74 and VT 74 , began operation in 1759 on an informal basis . The ferry operation was formalized at the close of the 18th century and upgraded to a cable system in 1946 . Due to extensive changes in designations in both states during the 20th century , the entire length of the present highway consists of renamed segments from other highways . The New York portion of the cross-state Route 74 west of Ticonderoga was designated as part of NY 73 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , while the Vermont section carried several different designations from the 1920s to the late 1930s , when it became solely part of Vermont Route F-9 . NY 73 was extended east to Lake Champlain in the 1950s - replacing New York State Route 347 - and VT F-9 was split into VT 73 and VT 74 shortly afterward . The Schroon-Ticonderoga highway was redesignated as NY 74 c. 1973 after NY 73 was cut back to its current eastern terminus in Elizabethtown .",

  "/wiki/NY_9N": "New York State Route 9N ( NY 9N ) is a north-south state highway in northeastern New York in the United States . It extends from an intersection with U.S. Route 9 ( US 9 ) , NY 29 , and NY 50 in the city of Saratoga Springs to a junction with US 9 and NY 22 in the Clinton County hamlet of Keeseville . At 143.49 miles ( 230.92 km ) in total length , NY 9N is the longest letter-suffixed route in the state . It is concurrent with its parent route for 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) in the village of Lake George and for three blocks in the hamlet of Elizabethtown . Much of NY 9N runs alongside either a river or a lake . It follows the Hudson River through northern Saratoga County and southern Warren County , the entirety of Lake George 's western shoreline , the west edge of Lake Champlain between Ticonderoga and Westport , and the Ausable River from Keene to Keeseville . The other portions of NY 9N pass through predominantly rural and mountainous regions of the Adirondack Mountains . The NY 9N designation was originally created as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to replace New York State Route 9W , a route assigned to an alternate routing of US 9 from Elizabethtown to Keeseville . NY 9N was extended southward to Lake George in March 1936 and to Saratoga Springs in the early 1950s , supplanting several other routes ( including New York State Route 9K ) in the process .",
  "/wiki/NY_22": "New York State Route 22 ( NY 22 ) is a north-south state highway that parallels the eastern border of the U.S. state of New York , from the outskirts of New York City to the hamlet of Mooers in Clinton County near the Canadian border . At 337 miles ( 542 km ) , it is the state 's longest north-south route and the third longest state route overall , after NY 5 and NY 17 . [ a ] Many of the state 's major east-west roads intersect with , and often join , NY 22 just before crossing into the neighboring New England states , where U.S. Route 7 ( US 7 ) , which originally partially followed NY 22 's alignment , similarly parallels the New York state line . Almost all of NY 22 is a two-lane rural road through small villages and hamlets . The exceptions are its southern end in the heavily populated Bronx and lower Westchester County , and a section that runs through the city of Plattsburgh near the northern end . The rural landscape that the road passes through varies from horse country and views of the reservoirs of the New York City watershed in the northern suburbs of the city , to dairy farms further upstate in the Taconic and Berkshire mountains , to the undeveloped , heavily forested Adirondack Park along the shores of Lake Champlain . An 86-mile ( 138 km ) section from Fort Ann to Keeseville is part of the All-American Road known as the Lakes to Locks Passage . The oldest portions of today 's NY 22 , in Westchester County and along the Lake Champlain shoreline , were Native American trails . Dutch , and after them English , settlers continued to use the road to get their farm products to market , with the southernmost portion eventually becoming the White Plains Post Road in the 18th and 19th centuries . In the early 20th century , as automobile use became widespread , the state paved the more heavily used sections and built new roads to create the current highway , first designated as NY 22 in 1930 . In its early years the highway began in Manhattan ; until 2008 its northern end was the Canadian border .",
