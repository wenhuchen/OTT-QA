  "/wiki/Karate": "Karate ( \u7a7a\u624b ) ( /k\u0259\u02c8r\u0251\u02d0ti/ ; Japanese pronunciation : [ ka\u027eate ] ( listen ) ; Okinawan pronunciation : [ ka\u027dati ] ) is a martial art developed in the Ryukyu Kingdom . It developed from the indigenous Ryukyuan martial arts ( called te ( \u624b ) , hand ; tii in Okinawan ) under the influence of Kung Fu , particularly Fujian White Crane . Karate is now predominantly a striking art using punching , kicking , knee strikes , elbow strikes and open-hand techniques such as knife-hands , spear-hands and palm-heel strikes . Historically , and in some modern styles , grappling , throws , joint locks , restraints and vital-point strikes are also taught . A karate practitioner is called a karateka ( \u7a7a\u624b\u5bb6 ) , and its plural is karateka or karatekas . The Empire of Japan annexed the Ryukyu Kingdom in 1879 . Karate came to the Japanese archipelago in the early 20th century during a time of migration as Ryukyuans , especially from Okinawa , looked for work in Japan . It was systematically taught in Japan after the Taish\u014d era of 1912-1926 . In 1922 the Japanese Ministry of Education invited Gichin Funakoshi to Tokyo to give a karate demonstration . In 1924 Keio University established the first university karate club in mainland Japan , and by 1932 major Japanese universities had karate clubs . In this era of escalating Japanese militarism , the name was changed [ by whom ? ] from \u5510\u624b ( Chinese hand or Tang hand ) to \u7a7a\u624b ( empty hand ) - both of which are pronounced karate in Japanese - to indicate that the Japanese wished to develop the combat form in Japanese style .",

  "/wiki/Powerlifting": "Powerlifting is a strength sport that consists of three attempts at maximal weight on three lifts : squat , bench press , and deadlift . As in the sport of Olympic weightlifting , it involves the athlete attempting a maximal weight single lift of a barbell loaded with weight plates . Powerlifting evolved from a sport known as odd lifts , which followed the same three-attempt format but used a wider variety of events , akin to strongman competition . Eventually odd lifts became standardized to the current three . In competition , lifts may be performed equipped or un-equipped ( typically referred to as 'raw ' lifting or 'classic ' in the IPF specifically ) . Equipment in this context refers to a supportive bench shirt or squat/deadlift suit or briefs . In some federations , knee wraps are permitted in the equipped but not un-equipped division ; in others , they may be used in both equipped and un-equipped lifting . Weight belts , knee sleeves , wrist wraps and special footwear may also be used , but are not considered when distinguishing equipped from un-equipped lifting . Competitions take place across the world . Powerlifting has been a Paralympic sport ( bench press only ) since 1984 and , under the IPF , is also a World Games sport . Local , national and international competitions have also been sanctioned by other federations operating independently of the IPF .",
