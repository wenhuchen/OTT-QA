  "/wiki/Henry_Jermyn,_1st_Baron_Dover": "Henry Jermyn , 3rd Baron Jermyn and 1st Baron Dover , 1st Jacobite Earl of Dover PC ( c. 1636-1708 ) was an English peer and supporter of James II . Jermyn was the second son of Sir Thomas Jermyn , of Rushbrooke , Suffolk , who died in 1659 , and his wife Rebecca Rodway , who married secondly Henry , 3rd Viscount Brouncker . He surpassed his uncle , Lord St Albans , in reputation for profligacy , figuring frequently as the little Jermyn in the Grammont Memoirs , as the lover of Lady Castlemaine , Lady Shrewsbury , Miss Jennings and other beauties of the court of Charles II of England . According to rumour his most notable conquest was Charles 's widowed sister Mary of Orange , whom he met several times during her brother 's exile , and there were even stories that they were secretly married . Historians generally discount these rumours , but Charles II took them seriously , and reprimanded his sister for her lack of discretion , but with no effect : Mary sharply reminded her brother that his own love affairs hardly entitled him to judge her moral conduct . Charles was especially angry because of the similar rumours that Jermyn 's uncle Lord St Albans had secretly married the Queen Dowager Henrietta Maria . As John Phillipps Kenyon remarked , to have one Jermyn as an in-law would have been bad enough ; to have two would be intolerable . He was a noted duelist and a lifelong gambler . In a notorious duel with Colonel Thomas Howard , ( younger brother of Charles Howard , 1st Earl of Carlisle ) , in August 1662 , which Samuel Pepys refers to in his Diary , Jermyn was left for dead . He recovered , but his second Giles Rawlings was killed by Howard 's second Colonel Carey Dillon , later the 5th Earl of Roscommon : the cause is said to have been the rivalry between Jermyn and Howard for the affections of Lady Shrewsbury , who was notorious for the number of her lovers . While the court was in exile , he obtained a post in the household of the Duke of York , despite the strong disapproval of Charles II , and he became James 's master of the horse at the English Restoration , and rode a horse at the Coronation of Charles II . Having previously offended the king by courting his sister Mary , he proceeded to give further offence by having an affair with Lady Castlemaine , by then the chief royal mistress , and he was banished from court for six months .",
  "/wiki/Earl_of_Dover": "The title Earl of Dover has been created twice , once in the Peerage of England and once in the Jacobite Peerage . The creation in the Peerage of England occurred in 1628 when Henry Carey , 1st Viscount Rochford , was created Earl of Dover , in the County of Kent . He was succeeded in 1666 by his son , the second Earl . He had already in 1640 been summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father 's barony of Hunsdon . However , on his death in 1677 the earldom became extinct . The creation in the Jacobite Peerage occurred in July 1689 when Henry Jermyn , 1st Baron Dover , was created Baron Jermyn of Royston , Baron Ipswich , Viscount Cheveley and Earl of Dover by the deposed King James II , these titles not being recognised by the English Government , though Dover became generally known as the Earl of Dover . He commanded a troop at the Battle of the Boyne , but shortly afterwards made his submission to King William III . He spent the rest of his life living quietly at his London townhouse , or at his country estate Cheveley , near Newmarket . He succeeded his brother Thomas as 3rd Baron Jermyn in 1703 , and died in 1708 . As he left no children by his wife , Judith , daughter of Sir Edmund Poley , of Badley , Suffolk , his titles became extinct at his death .",

  "/wiki/Duke_of_Perth": "Earl of Perth is a title in the Peerage of Scotland . It was created in 1605 for James Drummond , 4th Lord Drummond . The Drummond family claim descent from Maurice , son of George , a younger son of King Andrew I of Hungary . Maurice arrived in Scotland on the ship which brought Edgar \u00c6theling , the Saxon claimant to the crown of England after the Norman Conquest , and his sister Margaret to Scotland in 1068 . Maurice was given lands in Lennox ( Dunbartonshire ) , together with the hereditary stewardship of the county . The Hungarian Prince theory has been discounted as no evidence of any relationships exists in written records . The Red Book of the Menteiths clearly discounts the Hungarian Prince as a myth likely formed to give status to the Drummond origins . The Drummonds in the 12th Century were allied to the Menteiths their early fortunes became through the relationship . Indeed , one Johannes De Drumon , said to have died in 1301 , was buried in Inchmahome Priory which was founded by the Menteiths . His successor John Drummond , the 7th Steward , was deprived of the lands and retired into Perthshire . John Drummond , Justiciar of Scotia , was created a Lord of Parliament as Lord Drummond of Cargill in 1487/8 by King James III of Scotland .

Caryll was born at West Harting in Sussex , England . He was head of an old English Catholic and Royalist family at that time settled in West Harting , in Sussex . His father , of whom he was heir , was likewise named John ; his mother was a daughter of William , second Baron Petre . Of his education he received part at the English College of St. Omer , in Artois , part at the Venerable English College in Rome . During the reign of Charles II of England he produced several plays and poems . In poetry his chief performances were a translation of Ovid 's Epistle of Brise\u00efs to Achilles , first appearing in 1680 in a work entitled Ovid 's Epistles , translated by several hands , and afterwards separately ; also a translation of Virgil 's first Eclogue , printed in Nichol 's Select Collection of Miscellany Poems and published in 1683 . His plays , both of them brought out at the Duke of York 's Theatre , were a tragedy written in 1666 and called The English Princess , or the death of Richard III ( Samuel Pepys , who saw this piece acted 7 March 1667 , found it no more than pretty good ) , and a comedy entitled Sir Solomon Single , or the Cautious Coxcomb , which came out in 1671 , upon the pattern of Moli\u00e8re 's The School for Wives . In 1679 , during the so-called Popish Plot , Caryll , as a Catholic of distinction , was committed to the Tower of London , but was soon let out on bail . When James II of England succeeded to the throne in 1685 , he sent Caryll as his agent to the court of Pope Innocent XI , withdrawing him some months later upon the Earl of Castlemaine 's appointment to that post . Caryll was then appointed secretary to Mary of Modena , queen of James II , in whose service he continued after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 , when he followed the exiled royal family across the sea to Saint-Germain . From his voluntary expatriation , however , there ensued no confiscation of his property until 1696 , when , by reason of his implication in one of the plots to overthrow William of Orange ( William III ) , he having furnished money for that purpose , his estate in West Harting was declared forfeited .",
