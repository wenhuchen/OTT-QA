  "/wiki/History_of_England": "The British Isles became inhabited more than 800,000 years ago , as the discovery of stone tools and footprints at Happisburgh in Norfolk has revealed . The earliest evidence for early modern humans in North West Europe , a jawbone discovered in Devon at Kents Cavern in 1927 , was re-dated in 2011 to between 41,000 and 44,000 years old . Continuous human habitation in England dates to around 13,000 years ago ( see Creswellian ) , at the end of the last glacial period . The region has numerous remains from the Mesolithic , Neolithic and Bronze Age , such as Stonehenge and Avebury . In the Iron Age , all of Britain south of the Firth of Forth , was inhabited by the Celtic people known as the Britons , including some Belgic tribes ( e.g . the Atrebates , the Catuvellauni , the Trinovantes , etc . ) in the south east . In AD 43 the Roman conquest of Britain began ; the Romans maintained control of their province of Britannia until the early 5th century . The end of Roman rule in Britain facilitated the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain , which historians often regard as the origin of England and of the English people . The Anglo-Saxons , a collection of various Germanic peoples , established several kingdoms that became the primary powers in present-day England and parts of southern Scotland . They introduced the Old English language , which largely displaced the previous British language . The Anglo-Saxons warred with British successor states in western Britain and the Hen Ogledd ( Old North ; the Brythonic-speaking parts of northern Britain ) , as well as with each other .",

  "/wiki/The_Enlightenment": "The Age of Enlightenment ( also known as the Age of Reason or simply the Enlightenment ) [ note 1 ] was an intellectual and philosophical movement that dominated the world of ideas in Europe during the 17th to 19th century . The Enlightenment emerged out of a European intellectual and scholarly movement known as Renaissance humanism . Some consider the publication of Isaac Newton 's Principia Mathematica ( 1687 ) as the first major enlightenment work . French historians traditionally date the Enlightenment from 1715 to 1789 , from the death of Louis XIV of France until the outbreak of the French Revolution that ended the Ancien Regime . Most end it with the beginning of the 19th century . Philosophers and scientists of the period widely circulated their ideas through meetings at scientific academies , Masonic lodges , literary salons , coffeehouses and in printed books , journals , and pamphlets . The ideas of the Enlightenment undermined the authority of the monarchy and the Church and paved the way for the political revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries . A variety of 19th-century movements , including liberalism and neoclassicism , trace their intellectual heritage to the Enlightenment . The Enlightenment included a range of ideas centered on the sovereignty of reason and the evidence of the senses as the primary sources of knowledge and advanced ideals such as liberty , progress , toleration , fraternity , constitutional government and separation of church and state . In France , the central doctrines of the Enlightenment philosophers were individual liberty and religious tolerance , in opposition to an absolute monarchy and the fixed dogmas of the Roman Catholic Church . The Enlightenment was marked by an emphasis on the scientific method and reductionism , along with increased questioning of religious orthodoxy - an attitude captured by Immanuel Kant 's essay Answering the Question : What is Enlightenment , where the phrase Sapere aude ( Dare to know ) can be found .",

  "/wiki/History_of_China": "The earliest known written records of the history of China date from as early as 1250 BC , from the Shang dynasty ( c. 1600-1046 BC ) , during the king Wu Ding 's reign , who was mentioned as the twenty-first Shang king by the same . Ancient historical texts such as the Records of the Grand Historian ( c. 100 BC ) and the Bamboo Annals ( 296 BC ) describe a Xia dynasty ( c. 2070-1600 BC ) before the Shang , but no writing is known from the period , and Shang writings do not indicate the existence of the Xia . The Shang ruled in the Yellow River valley , which is commonly held to be the cradle of Chinese civilization . However , Neolithic civilizations originated at various cultural centers along both the Yellow River and Yangtze River . These Yellow River and Yangtze civilizations arose millennia before the Shang . With thousands of years of continuous history , China is one of the world 's oldest civilizations , and is regarded as one of the cradles of civilization . The Zhou dynasty ( 1046-256 BC ) supplanted the Shang , and introduced the concept of the Mandate of Heaven to justify their rule . The central Zhou government began to weaken due to external and internal pressures in the 8th century BC , and the country eventually splintered into smaller states during the Spring and Autumn period . These states became independent and warred with one another in the following Warring States period . Much of traditional Chinese culture , literature and philosophy first developed during those troubled times . In 221 BC , Qin Shi Huang conquered the various warring states and created for himself the title of Huangdi or emperor of the Qin , marking the beginning of imperial China . However , the oppressive government fell soon after his death , and was supplanted by the longer-lived Han dynasty ( 206 BC - 220 AD ) .",
  "/wiki/George_Lincoln_Burr": "George Lincoln Burr ( January 30 , 1857 - June 27 , 1938 ) was a U.S. historian , diplomat , author , and educator , best known as a Professor of History and Librarian at Cornell University , and as the closest collaborator of Andrew Dickson White , the first President of Cornell . Burr was born in Albany , New York and entered the Cortland Academy in 1869 , where he first met Andrew Dickson White , who was guest speaker for its 50th anniversary . The financial Panic of 1873 wreaked havoc on his family 's finances , and he was forced to leave school and seek employment at age 16 . After a brief stint as a schoolmaster , he apprenticed as a printer of The Standard at Cortland . After 4 years , he had saved $ 200 , sufficient for him to matriculate at Cornell in 1877 . As a sophomore , Burr audited a course for seniors taught by White on the historical development of criminal law , and received permission to sit for the exam . Prof. White was so impressed by Burr 's exam answers that he secretly appointed Burr as his examiner ( i.e. , grader ) in history . White writes in his Autobiography , Of course this was kept entirely secret ; for had the Seniors known that I had entrusted their papers to the tender mercies of a Sophomore , they would probably have mobbed me . After his graduation in 1881 , Burr accepted White 's offer to serve as an instructor and examiner in modern history , and also as White 's private secretary . This was the beginning of a literary partnership that lasted until White 's death in 1918 . Under White 's tutelage , Burr developed into a scholar of medieval history .

  "/wiki/Middle_Ages": "In the history of Europe , the Middle Ages ( or medieval period ) lasted from the 5th to the 15th century . It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery . The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history : classical antiquity , the medieval period , and the modern period . The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early , High , and Late Middle Ages . Population decline , counterurbanisation , collapse of centralized authority , invasions , and mass migrations of tribes , which had begun in Late Antiquity , continued in the Early Middle Ages . The large-scale movements of the Migration Period , including various Germanic peoples , formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire . In the 7th century , North Africa and the Middle East - once part of the Byzantine Empire - came under the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate , an Islamic empire , after conquest by Muhammad 's successors . Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures , the break with classical antiquity was not complete . The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire , Rome 's direct continuation , survived in the Eastern Mediterranean and remained a major power . The empire 's law code , the Corpus Juris Civilis or Code of Justinian , was rediscovered in Northern Italy in 1070 and became widely admired later in the Middle Ages . In the West , most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions . Monasteries were founded as campaigns to Christianise pagan Europe continued .",

  "/wiki/History_of_slavery": "The history of slavery spans many cultures , nationalities , and religions from ancient times to the present day . However the social , economic , and legal positions of slaves have differed vastly in different systems of slavery in different times and places . Slavery occurs relatively rarely among hunter-gatherer populations because it develops under conditions of social stratification . Slavery operated in the very first civilizations ( such as Sumer in Mesopotamia , which dates back as far as 3500 BCE ) . Slavery features in the Mesopotamian Code of Hammurabi ( c. 1860 BCE ) , which refers to it as an established institution . Slavery became common within much of Europe during the Early Middle Ages and it continued into the following centuries . The Byzantine-Ottoman wars ( 1265-1479 ) and the Ottoman wars in Europe ( 14th to 20th centuries ) resulted in the capture of large numbers of Christian slaves . The Dutch , French , Spanish , Portuguese , British , Arabs and a number of West African kingdoms played a prominent role in the Atlantic slave trade , especially after 1600 . The Republic of Ragusa became the first European country to ban the slave trade in 1416 . In modern times Denmark-Norway abolished the trade in 1802 . Although slavery is no longer legal anywhere in the world ( with the exception of penal labour ) , human trafficking remains an international problem and an estimated 25-40 million people were enslaved as of 2013 [ update ] , the majority in Asia . During the 1983-2005 Second Sudanese Civil War people were taken into slavery .",

Fetter notably debated Alfred Marshall , presenting a theoretical reassessment of land as capital . Fetter 's arguments have been credited with prompting mainstream economists to abandon the Georgist idea that land is a unique factor of production and hence that there is any special need for a special theory of ground rent . A proponent of the subjective theory of value , Fetter emphasized the importance of time preference and rebuffed Irving Fisher for abandoning the pure time preference theory of interest that Fisher had earlier espoused in his 1907 book , The Rate of Interest .",
  "/wiki/Political_economy": "Political economy is the study of production and trade and their relations with law , custom and government ; and with the distribution of national income and wealth . As a discipline , political economy originated in moral philosophy , in the 18th century , to explore the administration of states ' wealth , with political signifying the Greek word polity and economy signifying the Greek word okonomie ( household management ) . The earliest works of political economy are usually attributed to the British scholars Adam Smith , Thomas Malthus , and David Ricardo , although they were preceded by the work of the French physiocrats , such as Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay ( 1694-1774 ) and Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot ( 1727-1781 ) . In the late 19th century , the term economics gradually began to replace the term political economy with the rise of mathematical modelling coinciding with the publication of an influential textbook by Alfred Marshall in 1890 . Earlier , William Stanley Jevons , a proponent of mathematical methods applied to the subject , advocated economics for brevity and with the hope of the term becoming the recognised name of a science . Citation measurement metrics from Google Ngram Viewer indicate that use of the term economics began to overshadow political economy around roughly 1910 , becoming the preferred term for the discipline by 1920 . Today , the term economics usually refers to the narrow study of the economy absent other political and social considerations while the term political economy represents a distinct and competing approach . Political economy , where it is not used as a synonym for economics , may refer to very different things . From an academic standpoint , the term may reference Marxian economics , applied public choice approaches emanating from the Chicago school and the Virginia school . In common parlance , political economy may simply refer to the advice given by economists to the government or public on general economic policy or on specific economic proposals developed by political scientists . A rapidly growing mainstream literature from the 1970s has expanded beyond the model of economic policy in which planners maximize utility of a representative individual toward examining how political forces affect the choice of economic policies , especially as to distributional conflicts and political institutions . It is available as a stand-alone area of study in certain colleges and universities .",
  "/wiki/Finance": "Finance is the study of money and how it is used . Specifically , it deals with the questions of how an individual , company or government acquires the money needed - called capital in the company context - and how they then spend or invest that money . Finance is , correspondingly , often split into three areas : personal finance , corporate finance and public finance . At the same time , finance is about the overall system - i.e . the financial markets that allow the flow of money , via investments and other financial instruments , between and within these areas ; this flow is facilitated by the financial services sector . A major focus within finance is thus investment management - called money management for individuals , and asset management for institutions - and finance then includes the associated activities of securities trading , investment banking , financial engineering , and risk management . More abstractly , finance is concerned with the investment and deployment of assets and liabilities over space and time : i.e . it is about performing valuation and asset allocation today , based on risk and uncertainty of future outcomes , incorporating the time value of money ( determining the present value of these future values , discounting , requires a risk-appropriate discount rate ) . As an academic field , finance theory is studied and developed within the disciplines of management , ( financial ) economics , accountancy and applied mathematics . Correspondingly , given its wide application , there are several related professional qualifications , that can lead to the field . As the debate to whether finance is an art or a science is still open , there have been recent efforts to organize a list of unsolved problems in finance .",

In addition to the standard periodization , proponents of a long Renaissance put its beginning in the 14th century and its end in the 17th century . The traditional view focuses more on the early modern aspects of the Renaissance and argues that it was a break from the past , but many historians today focus more on its medieval aspects and argue that it was an extension of the Middle Ages . The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was its version of humanism , derived from the concept of Roman Humanitas and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy , such as that of Protagoras , who said that Man is the measure of all things . This new thinking became manifest in art , architecture , politics , science and literature . Early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the recycled knowledge of how to make concrete . Although the invention of metal movable type sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century , the changes of the Renaissance were not uniformly experienced across Europe : the very first traces appear in Italy as early as the late 13th century , in particular with the writings of Dante and the paintings of Giotto . As a cultural movement , the Renaissance encompassed innovative flowering of Latin and vernacular literatures , beginning with the 14th-century resurgence of learning based on classical sources , which contemporaries credited to Petrarch ; the development of linear perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality in painting ; and gradual but widespread educational reform . In politics , the Renaissance contributed to the development of the customs and conventions of diplomacy , and in science to an increased reliance on observation and inductive reasoning . Although the Renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual pursuits , as well as social and political upheaval , it is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo , who inspired the term Renaissance man . The Renaissance began in the 14th century in Florence , Italy . Various theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics , focusing on a variety of factors including the social and civic peculiarities of Florence at the time : its political structure , the patronage of its dominant family , the Medici , and the migration of Greek scholars and their texts to Italy following the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks .",

Numerous indigenous cultures formed , and many disappeared before 1500 . The arrival of Christopher Columbus in the year 1492 started the European colonization of the Americas . Most colonies were formed after 1600 , and the early records and writings of John Winthrop make the United States the first nation whose most distant origins are fully recorded . By the 1760s , the thirteen British colonies contained 2.5 million people along the Atlantic Coast east of the Appalachian Mountains . After defeating France , the British government imposed a series of taxes , including the Stamp Act of 1765 , rejecting the colonists ' constitutional argument that new taxes needed their approval . Resistance to these taxes , especially the Boston Tea Party in 1773 , led to Parliament issuing punitive laws designed to end self-government in Massachusetts . Armed conflict began in 1775 . In 1776 in Philadelphia , the Second Continental Congress declared the independence of the colonies as the United States . Led by General George Washington , it won the Revolutionary War with large support from France . The peace treaty of 1783 gave the land east of the Mississippi River ( except Canada and Florida ) to the new nation .

  "/wiki/History_of_science": "The history of science is the study of the development of science and scientific knowledge , including both the natural and social sciences ( the history of the arts and humanities is termed history of scholarship ) . Science is a body of empirical , theoretical , and practical knowledge about the natural world , produced by scientists who emphasize the observation , explanation , and prediction of real-world phenomena . Historiography of science , in contrast , studies the methods employed by historians of science . The English word scientist is relatively recent , first coined by William Whewell in the 19th century . Before that , investigators of nature called themselves natural philosophers . While observations of the natural world have been described since classical antiquity ( for example , by Thales and Aristotle ) , and the scientific method has been employed since the Middle Ages ( for example , by Ibn al-Haytham and Roger Bacon ) , modern science began to develop in the early modern period , and in particular in the scientific revolution of 16th- and 17th-century Europe . Traditionally , historians of science have defined science sufficiently broadly to include those earlier inquiries . From the 18th through the late 20th century , the history of science , especially of the physical and biological sciences , was often presented as a progressive accumulation of knowledge , in which true theories replaced false beliefs . More recent historical interpretations , such as those of Thomas Kuhn , tend to portray the history of science in terms of competing paradigms or conceptual systems within a wider matrix of intellectual , cultural , economic and political trends . These interpretations , however , have met with opposition for they also portray the history of science as an incoherent system of incommensurable paradigms , not leading to any actual scientific progress but only to the illusion that it has occurred .",

The earliest Homo sapiens presence in Mainland Southeast Asia can be traced back to 50,000 years ago and to at least 40,000 years ago in Maritime Southeast Asia . As early as 10,000 years ago , Hoabinhian settlers had developed a tradition and culture of distinct artefact and tool production . During the Neolithic , Austroasiatic peoples populated Indochina via land routes and sea-borne Austronesian immigrants preferably settled in insular Southeast Asia . The earliest agricultural societies that cultivated millet and wet-rice emerged around 1700 BCE in the lowlands and river floodplains of Indochina . The Phung Nguyen culture ( modern northern Vietnam ) and the Ban Chiang site ( modern Thailand ) account for the earliest use of copper by around 2,000 BCE , followed by the Dong Son culture , who by around 500 BCE had developed a highly sophisticated industry of bronze production and processing . Around the same time the first Agrarian Kingdoms emerged where territory was abundant and favourable , such as Funan at the lower Mekong and Van Lang in the Red River delta . Smaller and insular principalities increasingly engaged in and contributed to the rapidly expanding sea trade .

  "/wiki/Cold_War": "The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the Soviet Union and the United States and their respective allies , the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc , after World War II . The period is generally considered to span the 1947 Truman Doctrine to the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union . The term cold is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers , but they each supported major regional conflicts known as proxy wars . The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by the two powers , following their temporary alliance and victory against Nazi Germany in 1945 . Whilst the Western Bloc and Eastern Bloc generally espoused the economic theories of capitalism and socialism , respectively , the conflict was mostly geopolitical in nature . Each power had a nuclear strategy that discouraged a pre-emptive attack by the other side , on the basis that such an attack would lead to the total destruction of the attacker - the doctrine of mutually assured destruction ( MAD ) . Aside from the nuclear arsenal development and conventional military deployment , the struggle for dominance was expressed via psychological warfare , massive propaganda campaigns and espionage , far-reaching embargoes , rivalry at sports events and technological competitions such as the Space Race . The West was led by the United States , a federal republic with a two-party presidential system , as well as the other First World nations of the Western Bloc that were generally liberal democratic but economically and politically entwined with a network of authoritarian states , most of which were the Western Bloc 's former colonies . [ A ] The Soviet Union was a self-declared Marxist-Leninist state that had a totalitarian government ultimately led by a committee known as the Politburo . The Communist Party of the Soviet Union ( CPSU ) had influence across the Second World . The US government supported right-wing governments and uprisings across the world , while the Soviet government funded communist parties and revolutions around the world . As nearly all the colonial states achieved independence in the period 1945-1960 , they became Third World battlefields in the Cold War .",

  "/wiki/History_of_France": "The first written records for the history of France appeared in the Iron Age . What is now France made up the bulk of the region known to the Romans as Gaul . Roman writers noted the presence of three main ethno-linguistic groups in the area : the Gauls , the Aquitani , and the Belgae . The Gauls , the largest and best attested group , were Celtic people speaking what is known as the Gaulish language . Over the course of the 1st millennium BC the Greeks , Romans and Carthaginians established colonies on the Mediterranean coast and the offshore islands . The Roman Republic annexed southern Gaul as the province of Gallia Narbonensis in the late 2nd century BC , and Roman forces under Julius Caesar conquered the rest of Gaul in the Gallic Wars of 58-51 BC . Afterwards a Gallo-Roman culture emerged and Gaul was increasingly integrated into the Roman Empire . In the later stages of the Roman Empire , Gaul was subject to barbarian raids and migration , most importantly by the Germanic Franks . The Frankish king Clovis I united most of Gaul under his rule in the late 5th century , setting the stage for Frankish dominance in the region for hundreds of years . Frankish power reached its fullest extent under Charlemagne . The medieval Kingdom of France emerged from the western part of Charlemagne 's Carolingian Empire , known as West Francia , and achieved increasing prominence under the rule of the House of Capet , founded by Hugh Capet in 987 . A succession crisis following the death of the last direct Capetian monarch in 1328 led to the series of conflicts known as the Hundred Years ' War between the House of Valois and the House of Plantagenet .",
