  "/wiki/NGC_6302": "NGC 6302 , also called the Bug Nebula or Butterfly Nebula , is a bipolar planetary nebula in the constellation Scorpius . The structure in the nebula is among the most complex ever observed in planetary nebulae . The spectrum of NGC 6302 shows that its central star is one of the hottest stars known , with a surface temperature in excess of 250,000 degrees Celsius , implying that the star from which it formed must have been very large . The central star , a white dwarf , was identified in 2009 , using the upgraded Wide Field Camera 3 on board the Hubble Space Telescope . The star has a current mass of around 0.64 solar masses . It is surrounded by a dense equatorial disc composed of gas and dust . This dense disc is postulated to have caused the star 's outflows to form a bipolar structure similar to an hourglass . This bipolar structure shows features such as ionization walls , knots and sharp edges to the lobes .",
  "/wiki/RCW_Catalogue": "The RCW Catalogue ( from Rodgers , Campbell & Whiteoak ) is an astronomical catalogue of H\u03b1-emission regions in the southern Milky Way , described in ( Rodgers et al . 1960 ) . It contains 182 objects , including many of the earlier Gum catalogue ( 84 items ) objects . The later Caldwell catalogue included some objects from the RCW catalogue . There is also some overlap with the Sharpless catalogue-2 ( 312 items ) , although that primarily covered the northern hemisphere , whereas RCW and Gum primarily covered the southern hemisphere . The RCW catalogue was compiled by Alexander William Rodgers , Colin T. Campbell and John Bartlett Whiteoak . They catalogued southern nebulae while working under Bart Bok at the Mount Stromlo Observatory in Australia in the 1960s .",
  "/wiki/Gum_catalog": "The Gum catalog is an astronomical catalog of 84 emission nebulae in the southern sky . It was made by the Australian astronomer Colin Stanley Gum ( 1924-1960 ) at Mount Stromlo Observatory using wide field photography . Gum published his findings in 1955 in a study entitled A study of diffuse southern H-alpha nebulae which presented a catalog of 84 nebulae or nebular complexes . Similar catalogs include the Sharpless catalog and the RCW catalog , and many of the Gum objects are repeated in these other catalogs . However , the RCW and Gum catalogs were mainly of the southern hemisphere ( Mount Stromlo is in the southern hemisphere ) The Gum Nebula is named for Gum , who discovered it as Gum 12 ; it is an emission nebula that can be found in the southern constellations Vela and Puppis .",
  "/wiki/Caldwell_catalogue": "The Caldwell catalogue is an astronomical catalogue of 109 star clusters , nebulae , and galaxies for observation by amateur astronomers . The list was compiled by Patrick Moore as a complement to the Messier catalogue . While the Messier catalogue is used by amateur astronomers as a list of deep-sky objects for observation , Moore noted that Messier 's list was not compiled for that purpose and excluded many of the sky 's brightest deep-sky objects , such as the Hyades , the Double Cluster ( NGC 869 and NGC 884 ) , and the Sculptor Galaxy ( NGC 253 ) . The Messier catalogue was actually compiled as a list of known objects that might be confused with comets . Moore also observed that since Messier compiled his list from observations in Paris , it did not include bright deep-sky objects visible in the Southern Hemisphere , such as Omega Centauri , Centaurus A , the Jewel Box , and 47 Tucanae . Moore compiled a list of 109 objects to match the commonly accepted number of Messier objects ( he excluded M110 ) , and the list was published in Sky & Telescope in December 1995 . Moore used his other surname - Caldwell - to name the list , since the initial of Moore is already used for the Messier catalogue . Entries in the catalogue are designated with a C and the catalogue number ( 1 to 109 ) . Unlike objects in the Messier catalogue , which are listed roughly in the order of discovery by Messier and his colleagues , the Caldwell catalogue is ordered by declination , with C1 being the most northerly and C109 being the most southerly , although two objects ( NGC 4244 and the Hyades ) are listed out of sequence . Other errors in the original list have since been corrected : it incorrectly identified the S Norma Cluster ( NGC 6087 ) as NGC 6067 and incorrectly labelled the Lambda Centauri Cluster ( IC 2944 ) as the Gamma Centauri Cluster .",

Its name means 'divided into three lobes ' . The object is an unusual combination of an open cluster of stars ; an emission nebula ( the lower , red portion ) , a reflection nebula ( the upper , blue portion ) and a dark nebula ( the apparent 'gaps ' within the emission nebula that cause the trifurcated appearance ; these are also designated Barnard 85 ) . Viewed through a small telescope , the Trifid Nebula is a bright and peculiar object , and is thus a perennial favorite of amateur astronomers . The Trifid Nebula is a star-forming region in the Scutum spiral arm of the Milky Way .

  "/wiki/Westerhout_40": "Westerhout 40 or W40 ( also designated Sharpless 64 , Sh2-64 , or RCW 174 ) is a star-forming region in our galaxy located in the constellation Serpens Cauda . In this region , interstellar gas forming a diffuse nebula surrounds a cluster of several hundred new-born stars . The distance to W40 is 436\u00b19 pc ( 1420\u00b130 light-years ) , making it one of the closest sites of formation of high-mass O- and B-type stars . The Ionizing radiation from the massive OB stars has created an H II region , which has an hour-glass morphology . Dust from the molecular cloud in which W40 formed obscures the nebula , rendering W40 difficult to observe at visible wavelengths of light . Thus , X-ray , infrared , and radio observations have been used to see through the molecular cloud to study the star-formation processes going on within . W40 appears near to several other star-forming regions in the sky , including an infrared dark cloud designated Serpens South and a young stellar cluster designated the Serpens Main Cluster . Similar distances measured for these three star-forming regions suggests that they are near to each other and part of the same larger-scale collection of clouds known as the Serpens Molecular Cloud .",

  "/wiki/Crescent_Nebula": "The Crescent Nebula ( also known as NGC 6888 , Caldwell 27 , Sharpless 105 ) is an emission nebula in the constellation Cygnus , about 5000 light-years away from Earth . It was discovered by William Herschel in 1792 . It is formed by the fast stellar wind from the Wolf-Rayet star WR 136 ( HD 192163 ) colliding with and energizing the slower moving wind ejected by the star when it became a red giant around 250,000 to 400,000 [ citation needed ] years ago . The result of the collision is a shell and two shock waves , one moving outward and one moving inward . The inward moving shock wave heats the stellar wind to X-ray-emitting temperatures . It is a rather faint object located about 2 degrees SW of Sadr . For most telescopes it requires a UHC or OIII filter to see . Under favorable circumstances a telescope as small as 8 cm ( with filter ) can see its nebulosity . Larger telescopes ( 20 cm or more ) reveal the crescent or a Euro sign shape which makes some to call it the Euro sign nebula .",

It is widely known as the Cave Nebula , though that name was applied earlier to Ced 201 , a different nebula in Cepheus . Sh2-155 is an ionized H II region with ongoing star formation activity , at an estimated distance of 725 parsecs ( 2400 light-years ) from Earth . Sh2-155 was first noted as a galactic emission nebula in 1959 in the extended second edition of the Sharpless catalogue , being a part of the much larger Cep OB3 Association . Although Sh2-155 is relatively faint for amateur observation , some of its structure may be seen visually through a moderately sized telescope under dark skies . Sh2-155 lies at the edge of the Cepheus B cloud ( part of the Cepheus molecular cloud ) , and is ionized by young stars from the Cep OB3 association . It has been suggested that radiation from the hot O-type star HD 217086 is compressing the region , triggering the formation of a new generation of stars . A study of the region 's young stellar objects by the Chandra X-ray Observatory and Spitzer Space Telescope shows a progression of stellar ages in front of the cloud , supporting the hypothesis of triggered star-formation .",
