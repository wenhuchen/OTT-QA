The narrator is an unidentified young woman belonging to the ethnic German minority . M\u00fcller said the novel was written in memory of my Romanian friends who were killed under the Ceau\u015fescu regime . Like many of M\u00fcller 's books , The Land of Green Plums illustrates the position of dissidents from the German minority in Romania , who suffered a double oppression under the regime of Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu . The rural German-speaking community tries to preserve its culture by enforcing traditional rules ; once the main characters escape this environment through university study in the city , they suffer , as political dissidents , the oppression exercised by the totalitarian regime . Those who flee the country for Germany become cultural outcasts : they are not considered German there but rather Eastern Europeans . Critics read the novel as testifying to abuse and the ensuing trauma . Normal human relationships are rendered impossible by the lack of freedom of expression ; the threat of violence , imprisonment , and execution ; and the possibility that any personal friend may be a traitor . Written in a paratactic style , full of flashbacks and time shifts , the language of the book reflects trauma and political oppression .

  "/wiki/Alias_Grace": "Alias Grace is a novel of historical fiction by Canadian writer Margaret Atwood . First published in 1996 by McClelland & Stewart , it won the Canadian Giller Prize and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize . The story fictionalizes the notorious 1843 murders of Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper Nancy Montgomery in Canada West . Two servants of the Kinnear household , Grace Marks and James McDermott , were convicted of the crime . McDermott was hanged and Marks was sentenced to life imprisonment . Although the novel is based on factual events , Atwood constructs a narrative with a fictional doctor , Simon Jordan , who researches the case . Although ostensibly conducting research into criminal behaviour , he slowly becomes personally involved in the story of Grace Marks and seeks to reconcile his perception of the mild-mannered woman he sees with the murder of which she has been convicted . Atwood first encountered the story of Grace Marks in Life in the Clearings Versus the Bush by Susanna Moodie . In 1970 , she published The Journals of Susanna Moodie , a cycle of poems informed by the published works of Moodie . It became a classic of Canadian literature , as it lyrically evokes the experience of life in the wilderness , immigrant life , and colonial times . Subsequently , Atwood wrote the 1974 CBC Television film The Servant Girl about Grace Marks , also based on Susanna Moodie 's account . However , in Alias Grace , Atwood says that she has changed her opinion of Marks , having read more widely and discovered that Moodie had fabricated parts of her third-hand account of the famous murders .",

Boyd uses the diary form to explore how public events impinge on individual consciousness , so that Mountstuart 's journal alludes almost casually to the war , the death of a prime minister or the abdication of the king . Boyd plays ironically on the theme of literary celebrity , introducing his protagonist to several real writers who are included as characters - a spat with Virginia Woolf in London , a possible sexual encounter with Evelyn Waugh at Oxford , a clumsy exchange with James Joyce in Paris , and a friendship with Ernest Hemingway that spans several years . Boyd spent 30 months writing the novel . The journal style , with its gaps , false starts and contradictions , reinforces the theme of the changing self in the novel .

Cisneros 's work deals with the formation of Chicana identity , exploring the challenges of being caught between Mexican and Anglo-American cultures , facing the misogynist attitudes present in both these cultures , and experiencing poverty . For her insightful social critique and powerful prose style , Cisneros has achieved recognition far beyond Chicano and Latino communities , to the extent that The House on Mango Street has been translated worldwide and is taught in American classrooms as a coming-of-age novel .
