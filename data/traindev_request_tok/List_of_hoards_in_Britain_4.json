Abergavenny is promoted as a Gateway to Wales . It is located on the A40 trunk road and the A465 Heads of the Valleys road and is approximately 6 miles ( 10 km ) from the border with England . Originally the site of a Roman fort , Gobannium , it became a medieval walled town within the Welsh Marches . The town contains the remains of a medieval stone castle built soon after the Norman conquest of Wales . Abergavenny is situated at the confluence of the River Usk and a tributary stream , the Gavenny .

Usually considered the last king of the House of Wessex , he ruled from 1042 to 1066 . Edward was the son of \u00c6thelred the Unready and Emma of Normandy . He succeeded Cnut the Great 's son - and his own half brother - Harthacnut . He restored the rule of the House of Wessex after the period of Danish rule since Cnut ( better known as Canute ) conquered England in 1016 . When Edward died in 1066 , he was succeeded by Harold Godwinson , who was defeated and killed in the same year by the Normans under William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings . Edgar the \u00c6theling , who was of the House of Wessex , was proclaimed king after the Battle of Hastings in 1066 , but never ruled and was deposed after about eight weeks . Historians disagree about Edward 's fairly long ( 24-year ) reign . His nickname reflects the traditional image of him as unworldly and pious . Confessor reflects his reputation as a saint who did not suffer martyrdom , as opposed to King Edward the Martyr . Some portray Edward the Confessor 's reign as leading to the disintegration of royal power in England and the advance in power of the House of Godwin , due to the infighting that began after his heirless death . Biographers Frank Barlow and Peter Rex , on the other hand , portray Edward as a successful king , one who was energetic , resourceful and sometimes ruthless ; they argue that the Norman conquest shortly after his death tarnished his image .",
  "/wiki/William_the_Conqueror": "William I [ a ] ( c. 1028 - 9 September 1087 ) , usually known as William the Conqueror and sometimes William the Bastard , [ b ] was the first Norman King of England , reigning from 1066 until his death in 1087 . He was a descendant of Rollo and was Duke of Normandy from 1035 onward . His hold was secure on Normandy by 1060 , following a long struggle to establish his throne , and he launched the Norman conquest of England six years later . The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands and by difficulties with his eldest son , Robert Curthose . William was the son of the unmarried Robert I , Duke of Normandy , by his mistress Herleva . His illegitimate status and his youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father , as did the anarchy which plagued the first years of his rule . During his childhood and adolescence , members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other , both for control of the child duke and for their own ends . In 1047 , William was able to quash a rebellion and begin to establish his authority over the duchy , a process that was not complete until about 1060 . His marriage in the 1050s to Matilda of Flanders provided him with a powerful ally in the neighbouring county of Flanders . By the time of his marriage , William was able to arrange the appointment of his supporters as bishops and abbots in the Norman church . His consolidation of power allowed him to expand his horizons , and he secured control of the neighbouring county of Maine by 1062 . In the 1050s and early 1060s , William became a contender for the throne of England held by the childless Edward the Confessor , his first cousin once removed .",

The town was originally known as Inderawuda and was founded around 700 AD by Saint John of Beverley during the time of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria . After a period of Viking control , it passed to the Cerdic dynasty , a period during which it gained prominence in terms of religious importance in Great Britain . It continued to grow especially under the Normans when its trading industry was first established . A place of pilgrimage throughout the Middle Ages due to its founder , it eventually became a significant wool-trading town . Beverley was once the tenth-largest town in England , as well as one of the richest , because of its wool and the pilgrims who came to venerate its founding saint , John of Beverley . After the Reformation , the stature of Beverley was much reduced . In the 20th century , Beverley was the administrative centre of the local government district of the Borough of Beverley ( 1974-1996 ) .

  "/wiki/Andiron": "An andiron or firedog , fire-dog or fire dog is a bracket support , normally found in pairs , on which logs are laid for burning in an open fireplace , so that air may circulate under the firewood , allowing better burning and less smoke . They generally consist of a tall vertical element at the front , with at least two legs . This stops the logs from rolling out into the room , and may be highly decorative . The other element is one or more low horizontal pieces stretching back and serving to hold the logs off the bottom of the fireplace . An andiron is sometimes called a dog or dog-iron . Before the Renaissance , European andirons were almost invariably made entirely of iron and were of comparatively plain design . Indeed , andirons and firebacks were one of the first types of object to be commonly made in cast iron , a trend which in England began in the 1540s : until the nineteenth century cast iron was too brittle for many uses , but andirons carried light loads and this was not a problem . However , from the Renaissance onwards the front vertical element was increasingly given decorative treatment , and was in a different metal , such as brass , bronze or silver , which allowed casting , hugely increasing the range of decorative possibilities . When metals that could be cast began to be used for the fronts , these ordinary objects of the household received the attention of the artist , and had skill and taste lavished upon them . Thus English late 17th-century andirons often have elaborate flat brass front pieces , often in openwork and sometimes using enamel for further decoration . By the eighteenth century classical forms with several mouldings , similar to those used for candlesticks and the like , predominate in pieces for the middle classes , and were imitated in the American colonies , often just in iron and rather more simply . Small figures at the front also became popular ; in America cast flat Hessian soldiers were a long-lasting favourite .",

The name Tutbury probably derives from a Scandinavian settler and subsequent chief of the hill-fort , Totta , bury being a corruption of burh the Anglo-Saxon name for 'fortified place ' . It is 5 miles ( 8.0 km ) north of Burton upon Trent and 20 miles ( 32 km ) south of the Peak District . Quarries near Tutbury once produced alabaster which was used in the carving of Nottingham Alabaster . Until 2006 , Tutbury Crystal , a manufacturer of high-quality cut glass products , was based in the village . However production was transferred to Stoke-on-Trent as the existing factory was very old and was thought to be too small for the modern company 's requirements . The old factory was demolished and flats were built on the site , but a factory shop still operates in the village . Despite this , the tourism trade survives thanks to the long and distinguished history of the Norman Priory Church and medieval Tutbury Castle where Mary , Queen of Scots , was once imprisoned .",

It is the largest hoard of medieval coins ever found in Britain . To judge from the dates of the coins , the hoard was probably buried in haste at some time between winter 1463 and summer 1464 , perhaps by someone fleeing south after the Battle of Hexham in May 1464 , in the first stages of England 's civil war between aristocratic factions , the War of the Roses . The Fishpool Hoard , on display in Room 40 in the British Museum , London , was listed in 2003 among Our Top Ten Treasures , a special episode of BBC Television series Meet the Ancestors that profiled the ten most important treasures ever unearthed in Britain as voted by a panel of experts from the British Museum . The British Museum assesses the face value of the hoard when deposited , about \u00a3400 , would be equivalent to around \u00a3300,000 today . The makeup of the coinage , as well as dating the hoard , showed that the light coinage of 1412 did not entirely eliminate earlier gold coins .

He was the fifth king of the House of Plantagenet . Before his accession to the throne , he was commonly referred to as Lord Edward . The first son of Henry III , Edward was involved from an early age in the political intrigues of his father 's reign , which included an outright rebellion by the English barons . In 1259 , he briefly sided with a baronial reform movement , supporting the Provisions of Oxford . After reconciliation with his father , however , he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict , known as the Second Barons ' War . After the Battle of Lewes , Edward was hostage to the rebellious barons , but escaped after a few months and defeated the baronial leader Simon de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265 . Within two years the rebellion was extinguished and , with England pacified , Edward joined the Ninth Crusade to the Holy Land . He was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed that his father had died . Making a slow return , he reached England in 1274 and was crowned at Westminster Abbey . Edward spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law . Through an extensive legal inquiry , he investigated the tenure of various feudal liberties , while the law was reformed through a series of statutes regulating criminal and property law ."
