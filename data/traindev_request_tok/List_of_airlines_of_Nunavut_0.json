  "/wiki/Air_ambulance": "Air medical services is a comprehensive term covering the use of air transportation , aeroplane or helicopter , to move patients to and from healthcare facilities and accident scenes . Personnel provide comprehensive prehospital and emergency and critical care to all types of patients during aeromedical evacuation or rescue operations aboard helicopter and propeller aircraft or jet aircraft . The use of air transport to provide medical evacuation on the battlefield dates to World War I , but its role was expanded dramatically during the Korean and Vietnam wars . Later on , aircraft began to be used for the civilian emergency medical services . Helicopters can bring specialist care to the scene and transport patients to specialist hospitals , especially for major trauma cases . Fixed-wing aircraft are used for long-distance transport . In some remote areas , air medical services deliver non-emergency healthcare such as general practitioner appointments . An example of this is the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia , who also provide emergency care .",

  "/wiki/Inuit": "Inuit ( /\u02c8\u026anju\u026at/ ; syllabics : \u1403\u14c4\u1403\u1466 , the people , singular : Inuk \u1403\u14c4\u1483 , dual : Inuuk \u1403\u14c5\u1483 [ failed verification ] ) are a group of culturally similar indigenous peoples inhabiting the Arctic regions of Greenland , Canada and Alaska ( United States ) . The Inuit languages are part of the Eskimo-Aleut family . Inuit Sign Language is a critically endangered language isolate used in Nunavut . Inuit live throughout most of Northern Canada in the territory of Nunavut , Nunavik in the northern third of Quebec , Nunatsiavut and NunatuKavut in Labrador , and in various parts of the Northwest Territories , particularly around the Arctic Ocean , in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region . [ note 1 ] With the exception of NunatuKavut these areas are known in the Inuit languages as Inuit Nunangat . In Canada , sections 25 and 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982 classify Inuit as a distinctive group of Aboriginal Canadians who are not included under either the First Nations or the M\u00e9tis . The Greenlandic Inuit are descendants of ancient indigenous migrations from Canada , as these people migrated to the east through the continent . Inuit of Denmark are Danish citizens , although not the citizens of the European Union . In the United States , the Alaskan I\u00f1upiat , live primarily on the Alaska North Slope and on Little Diomede Island . In Canada and the United States , the term Eskimo was commonly used to describe Inuit , and Siberia and Alaska 's Yupik , I\u00f1upiat , and Chukchi people . However , Inuit is not accepted as a term for the Yupik and Chukchi , and Eskimo is the only term that applies to Yupik , Chukchi , I\u00f1upiat and Inuit . Since the late 20th century , Indigenous peoples in Canada and Greenlandic Inuit consider Eskimo to be a pejorative term , and they more frequently identify as Inuit for an autonym .",

It was formed as Keewatin Air Limited to provide charter services to the region . It was the first airline to have a permanent base in Nunavut ( then known as the Keewatin Region of the Northwest Territories ) . In 1987 it expanded to include medical evacuation ( MEDEVAC ) services , to what would become the Kivalliq Region , using a fleet of aircraft that began with a Tradewind aircraft - a multi-modified Beech 18 with a turbine engine and tricycle gear . This aircraft was followed by a Westwind , another modified Beech 18 with turbine engines and eventually these were replaced by Merlin IIA aircraft that had the added benefit of being pressurized and had turboprops . The MEDEVAC service is now known as Nunavut Lifeline . Currently [ when ? ] three Kingair 200 aircraft are based in Rankin Inlet , one in Churchill , Manitoba . and two in Iqaluit , where the airline also bases a Lear 35 for the long hauls to Ottawa and a Pilatus PC-12 to access the short strips .

  "/wiki/Helicopter": "A helicopter , or chopper , is a type of rotorcraft in which lift and thrust are supplied by rotors . This allows the helicopter to take off and land vertically , to hover , and to fly forward , backward , and laterally . These attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated areas where fixed-wing aircraft and many forms of VTOL ( Vertical TakeOff and Landing ) aircraft can not perform . The English word helicopter is adapted from the French word h\u00e9licopt\u00e8re , coined by Gustave Ponton d'Am\u00e9court in 1861 , which originates from the Greek helix ( \u1f15\u03bb\u03b9\u03be ) helix , spiral , whirl , convolution and pteron ( \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd ) wing . English language nicknames for helicopter include chopper , copter , helo , heli , and whirlybird . Helicopters were developed and built during the first half-century of flight , with the Focke-Wulf Fw 61 being the first operational helicopter in 1936 . Some helicopters reached limited production , but it was not until 1942 that a helicopter designed by Igor Sikorsky reached full-scale production , with 131 aircraft built . Though most earlier designs used more than one main rotor , it is the single main rotor with anti-torque tail rotor configuration that has become the most common helicopter configuration . Tandem rotor helicopters are also in widespread use due to their greater payload capacity . Coaxial helicopters , tiltrotor aircraft , and compound helicopters are all flying today . Quadcopter helicopters were pioneered as early as 1907 in France , and other types of multicopter have been developed for specialized applications such as unmanned drones .",

It was separated officially from the Northwest Territories on April 1 , 1999 , via the Nunavut Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act , though the boundaries had been drawn in 1993 . The creation of Nunavut resulted in the first major change to Canada 's political map since incorporating the province of Newfoundland in 1949 . Nunavut comprises a major portion of Northern Canada , and most of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago . Its vast territory makes it the fifth-largest country subdivision in the world , as well as North America 's second-largest ( after Greenland ) . The capital Iqaluit ( formerly Frobisher Bay ) , on Baffin Island in the east , was chosen by the 1995 capital plebiscite . Other major communities include the regional centres of Rankin Inlet and Cambridge Bay . Nunavut also includes Ellesmere Island to the far north , as well as the eastern and southern portions of Victoria Island in the west , and all islands in Hudson , James and Ungava Bays , including Akimiski Island far to the southeast of the rest of the territory . It is Canada 's only geo-political region that is not connected to the rest of North America by highway . Nunavut is the second-least populous of Canada 's provinces and territories .

It was known as Frobisher Bay from 1942 to 1987 , after the large bay on the coast of which the city is situated , when the traditional Inuktitut name was restored . In 1999 , Iqaluit was designated the capital of Nunavut after the division of the Northwest Territories into two separate territories . Before this event , Iqaluit was a small city and not well known outside the Canadian Arctic or Canada , with population and economic growth highly limited . This is due to the city 's isolation and heavy dependence on expensively imported supplies , as the city , like the rest of Nunavut , has no road , rail , or even ship connections for part of the year to the rest of Canada . The city has a polar climate , influenced by the cold deep waters of the Labrador Current just off Baffin Island ; this makes the city of Iqaluit cold , although the city is well south of the Arctic Circle . As of the 2016 census , the population was 7,740 ( Population Centre : 7,082 ) , an increase of 15.5 percent from the 2011 census . Iqaluit has the lowest population of any capital city in Canada . Inhabitants of Iqaluit are called Iqalummiut ( singular : Iqalummiuq ) ."
