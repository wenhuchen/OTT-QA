  "/wiki/Pier": "A pier is a raised structure in a body of water , typically supported by piles or pillars . Bridges , buildings , and walkways may all be supported by piers . Their open structure allows tides and currents to flow relatively unhindered , whereas the more solid foundations of a quay or the closely spaced piles of a wharf can act as a breakwater , and are consequently more liable to silting . Piers can range in size and complexity from a simple lightweight wooden structure to major structures extended over 1,600 m ( 5,200 ft ) . In American English , a pier may be synonymous with a dock . Piers have been built for several purposes , and because these different purposes have distinct regional variances , the term pier tends to have different nuances of meaning in different parts of the world . Thus in North America and Australia , where many ports were , until recently , built on the multiple pier model , the term tends to imply a current or former cargo-handling facility . In Europe in contrast , where ports more often use basins and river-side quays than piers , the term is principally associated with the image of a Victorian cast iron pleasure pier . However , the earliest piers pre-date the Victorian age .",

  "/wiki/Control_tower": "Air traffic control ( ATC ) is a service provided by ground-based air traffic controllers who direct aircraft on the ground and through controlled airspace , and can provide advisory services to aircraft in non-controlled airspace . The primary purpose of ATC worldwide is to prevent collisions , organize and expedite the flow of air traffic , and provide information and other support for pilots . In some countries , ATC plays a security or defensive role , or is operated by the military . Air traffic controllers monitor the location of aircraft in their assigned airspace by radar and communicate with the pilots by radio . To prevent collisions , ATC enforces traffic separation rules , which ensure each aircraft maintains a minimum amount of empty space around it at all times . In many countries , ATC provides services to all private , military , and commercial aircraft operating within its airspace . Depending on the type of flight and the class of airspace , ATC may issue instructions that pilots are required to obey , or advisories ( known as flight information in some countries ) that pilots may , at their discretion , disregard . The pilot in command is the final authority for the safe operation of the aircraft and may , in an emergency , deviate from ATC instructions to the extent required to maintain safe operation of their aircraft ."
