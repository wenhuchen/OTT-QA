Although commonly referred to as the Thai alphabet , the script is in fact not a true alphabet but an abugida , a writing system in which the full characters represent consonants with diacritical marks for vowels ; the absence of a vowel diacritic gives an implied ' a ' or ' o ' . Consonants are written horizontally from left to right , with vowels arranged above , below , to the left , or to the right of the corresponding consonant , or in a combination of positions . Thai has its own set of Thai numerals that are based on the Hindu-Arabic numeral system ( Thai : \u0e40\u0e25\u0e02\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 , lek thai ) , but the standard western Hindu-Arabic numerals ( Thai : \u0e40\u0e25\u0e02\u0e2e\u0e34\u0e19\u0e14\u0e39\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e23\u0e1a\u0e34\u0e01 , lek hindu arabik ) are mainly used except for government documents and the license plates of military vehicles .",
