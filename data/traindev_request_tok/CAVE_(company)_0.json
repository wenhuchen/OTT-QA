  "/wiki/Sega_ST-V": "Sega is a video game developer , publisher , and hardware development company headquartered in Tokyo , Japan , with multiple offices around the world . The company 's involvement in the arcade game industry began as a distributor of games and jukeboxes in Japan , but because Sega imported second-hand machines that required frequent maintenance , it began constructing replacement guns and flippers for its imported games . This began the company 's transition from importer to manufacturer . According to former Sega director Akira Nagai , this led to the company developing their own games . Sega released Pong-Tron , its first video-based game , in 1973 . The company prospered from the arcade game boom of the late 1970s , with revenues climbing to over US $ 100 million by 1979 . Nagai has stated that Hang-On and Out Run helped to pull the arcade game market out of the 1982 downturn and created new genres of video games . In terms of arcades , Sega is the world 's most prolific arcade game producer , having developed more than 500 games , 70 franchises , and 20 arcade system boards since 1981 . It has been recognized by Guinness World Records for this achievement . The following list comprises the various arcade system boards developed and used by Sega in their arcade games .",
