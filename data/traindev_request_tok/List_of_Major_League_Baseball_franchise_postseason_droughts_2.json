They compete in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) as a member club of the American League ( AL ) West division . The team joined the American League as an expansion team in 1977 playing their home games in the Kingdome . Since July 1999 , the Mariners ' home ballpark has been T-Mobile Park ( formerly Safeco Field ) , located in the SoDo neighborhood of Seattle . The Mariners name originates from the prominence of marine culture in the city of Seattle . They are nicknamed the M 's , a title featured in their primary logo from 1987 to 1992 . They adopted their current team colors - navy blue , northwest green ( teal ) , and silver - prior to the 1993 season , after having been royal blue and gold since the team 's inception . Their mascot is the Mariner Moose . The organization did not field a winning team until 1991 , and any real success eluded them until 1995 when they won their first division championship and defeated the New York Yankees in the ALDS . The game-winning hit in Game 5 , in which Edgar Mart\u00ednez drove home Ken Griffey Jr. to win the game in the 11th inning , clinched a series win for the Mariners , served as a powerful impetus to preserve baseball in Seattle , and has since become an iconic moment in team history . The Mariners won 116 games in 2001 , which set the American League record for most wins in a single season and tied the 1906 Chicago Cubs for the Major League record for most wins in a single season .

Before the 1998 regular season began , two new teams - the Arizona Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Devil Rays - were added by Major League Baseball . This resulted in the American League and National League having fifteen teams . However , in order for MLB officials to continue primarily intraleague play , both leagues would need to carry a number of teams that was divisible by two , so the decision was made to move one club from the AL Central to the NL Central . This realignment was widely considered to have great financial benefit to the club moving . However , to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest , Commissioner ( then club owner ) Bud Selig decided another team should have the first chance to switch leagues . The choice was offered to the Kansas City Royals , who ultimately decided to stay in the American League . The choice then fell to the Brewers , who , on November 6 , 1997 , elected to move to the National League . Had the Brewers elected not to move to the National League , the Minnesota Twins would have been offered the opportunity to switch leagues .
