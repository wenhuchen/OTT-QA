  "/wiki/Public_broadcasting": "Public broadcasting involves radio , television and other electronic-media outlets whose primary mission is public service . In many countries of the world , funding comes from governments , especially via annual fees charged on receivers . In the United States , public broadcasters may receive some funding from both federal and state sources , but generally most of their financial support comes from underwriting by foundations and businesses ( ranging from small shops to corporations ) , along with audience contributions via pledge drives . The great majority operate as private not-for-profit corporations . [ citation needed ] Public broadcasting may be nationally or locally operated , depending on the country and the station . In some countries a single organization runs public broadcasting . Other countries have multiple public-broadcasting organizations operating regionally or in different languages . Historically , public broadcasting was once the dominant or only form of broadcasting in many countries ( with the notable exception of the United States ) . Commercial broadcasting now also exists in most of these countries ; the number of countries with only public broadcasting declined substantially during the latter part of the 20th century .

CBC/Radio-Canada offers programming in English , French and eight aboriginal languages on its domestic radio service , and in five languages on its web-based international radio service , Radio Canada International ( RCI ) . However , budget cuts in the early 2010s have contributed to the corporation reducing its service via the airwaves , discontinuing RCI 's shortwave broadcasts as well as terrestrial television broadcasts in all communities served by network-owned rebroadcast transmitters , including communities not subject to Canada 's over-the-air digital television transition .

  "/wiki/Country_music": "Country music , also known as country and western ( or simply country ) , and hillbilly music , is a genre of popular music that takes its roots from genres such as American folk music ( especially Appalachian and Western music ) and blues .

Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms , folk lyrics , and harmonies mostly accompanied by string instruments such as banjos , electric and acoustic guitars , steel guitars ( such as pedal steels and dobros ) , and fiddles as well as harmonicas . Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history . According to Lindsey Starnes , the term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music ; it came to encompass Western music , which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots , in the mid-20th century . In 2009 in the United States , country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute , and second most popular in the morning commute . The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres . The origins of country music are found in the folk music of working class Americans and/or blue-collar American life , who blended popular songs , Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes , traditional English ballads , cowboy songs , and the musical traditions of various groups of European immigrants .",

The term contemporary hit radio was coined in the early 1980s by Radio & Records magazine to designate top 40 stations which continued to play hits from all musical genres as pop music splintered into adult contemporary , urban contemporary and other formats . The term top 40 is also used to refer to the actual list of hit songs , and , by extension , to refer to pop music in general . The term has also been modified to describe top 50 ; top 30 ; top 20 ; top 10 ; hot 100 ( each with its number of songs ) and hot hits radio formats , but carrying more or less the same meaning and having the same creative point of origin with Todd Storz as further refined by Gordon McLendon as well as Bill Drake .

Sometimes campus radio stations are operated for the purpose of training professional radio personnel , sometimes with the aim of broadcasting educational programming , while other radio stations exist to provide alternative to commercial broadcasting or government broadcasters . Campus radio stations are generally licensed and regulated by national governments , and have very different characteristics from one country to the next . One commonality between many radio stations regardless of their physical location is a willingness - or , in some countries , even a licensing requirement - to broadcast musical selections that are not categorized as commercial hits . Because of this , campus radio has come to be associated with emerging musical trends , including genres such as punk and new wave , alternative rock , indie rock and hip hop , long before those genres become part of the musical mainstream . Campus radio stations also often provide airplay and promotional exposure to new and emerging local artists . Campus radio supported U2 and REM Many campus radio stations carry a variety of programming including news ( often local ) , sports ( often relating to the campus ) , and spoken word programming as well as general music . Often the radio format is best described as a freeform , with a lot of creativity and individualism among the disc jockeys and show hosts . A number of these radio stations have gained critical acclaim for their programming and are considered by the community in which they are embedded to be an essential media outlet . Although the term campus radio implies full-power AM or FM transmission over the air , many radio stations experiment with low-power broadcasting , closed circuit or carrier current systems , often to on-campus listeners only .

  "/wiki/Hot_adult_contemporary": "In North American music , adult contemporary music ( AC ) is a form of radio-played popular music , ranging from 1960s vocal and 1970s soft rock music to predominantly ballad-heavy music of the present day , with varying degrees of easy listening , pop , soul , rhythm and blues , quiet storm , and rock influence . Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music . Adult contemporary tends to have lush , soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated . It is usually melodic enough to get a listener 's attention , and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music . Like most of pop music , its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse-chorus structure . The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments ( though bass guitar is usually used ) such as acoustic guitars , pianos , saxophones , and sometimes an orchestral set . The electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched . However , recent adult contemporary music may feature synthesizers ( and other electronics , such as drum machines ) . An AC radio station may play mainstream music , but it excludes hip hop , dance tracks , hard rock , and some forms of teen pop , as these are less popular among adults , the target demographic . AC radio often targets the 25-44 age group , the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s . A common practice in recent years of adult contemporary stations is to play less newer music and more hits of the past . This de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart .",

Music that was popularized by MTV in the early 1980s and the nostalgia behind it is a major driver to the format . It is considered the successor to the oldies format , a collection of top 40 songs from the late 1950s through the late 1970s that was once extremely popular in the United States . The term is sometimes incorrectly used as a synonym for the adult hits format , which uses a slightly newer music library stretching from all decades to the present with a major focus on 1990s and 2000s rock and alternative songs . In addition , adult hits stations tend to have larger playlists , playing a given song only a few times per week , compared to the tighter libraries on classic hits stations . For example , KRTH , a classic hits station in Los Angeles , plays power songs up to 30 times a week , which is another differentiator compared to other formats that share songs with classic hits libraries . The classic hits format has become extremely popular in the last few years with stations like KRTH , WCBS-FM in New York , and WLS-FM in Chicago having successful ratings with this model . Classic hits was named format of the summer of 2018 by Nielsen Audio 's research team emphasizing the huge popularity of the format .
