His influence on Western theatre , culture and politics extended from the 1880s to his death and beyond . He wrote more than sixty plays , including major works such as Man and Superman ( 1902 ) , Pygmalion ( 1912 ) and Saint Joan ( 1923 ) . With a range incorporating both contemporary satire and historical allegory , Shaw became the leading dramatist of his generation , and in 1925 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature . Born in Dublin , Shaw moved to London in 1876 , where he struggled to establish himself as a writer and novelist , and embarked on a rigorous process of self-education . By the mid-1880s he had become a respected theatre and music critic . Following a political awakening , he joined the gradualist Fabian Society and became its most prominent pamphleteer . Shaw had been writing plays for years before his first public success , Arms and the Man in 1894 . Influenced by Henrik Ibsen , he sought to introduce a new realism into English-language drama , using his plays as vehicles to disseminate his political , social and religious ideas . By the early twentieth century his reputation as a dramatist was secured with a series of critical and popular successes that included Major Barbara , The Doctor 's Dilemma and Caesar and Cleopatra . Shaw 's expressed views were often contentious ; he promoted eugenics and alphabet reform , and opposed vaccination and organised religion . He courted unpopularity by denouncing both sides in the First World War as equally culpable , and although not a republican , castigated British policy on Ireland in the postwar period .",

Along with Aeschylus and Sophocles , he is one of the three ancient Greek tragedians for whom a significant number of plays have survived . Some ancient scholars attributed 95 plays to him but , according to the Suda , it was 92 at most . Of these , 18 or 19 have survived more or less complete ( there has been debate about his authorship of Rhesus , largely on stylistic grounds ) and there are also fragments , some substantial , of most of the other plays . More of his plays have survived intact than those of Aeschylus and Sophocles together , partly because his popularity grew as theirs declined - he became , in the Hellenistic Age , a cornerstone of ancient literary education , along with Homer , Demosthenes , and Menander . Euripides is identified with theatrical innovations that have profoundly influenced drama down to modern times , especially in the representation of traditional , mythical heroes as ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances . This new approach led him to pioneer developments that later writers adapted to comedy , some of which are characteristic of romance . Yet he also became the most tragic of poets , [ nb 1 ] focusing on the inner lives and motives of his characters in a way previously unknown . He was the creator of.that cage which is the theatre of Shakespeare 's Othello , Racine 's Ph\u00e8dre , of Ibsen and Strindberg , in which .imprisoned men and women destroy each other by the intensity of their loves and hates , and yet he was also the literary ancestor of comic dramatists as diverse as Menander and George Bernard Shaw .

His male contemporaries were frequently shocked by the heresies he put into the mouths of characters , such as these words of his heroine Medea :",

  "/wiki/Faust": "Faust is the protagonist of a classic German legend , based on the historical Johann Georg Faust ( c. 1480-1540 ) . The erudite Faust is highly successful yet dissatisfied with his life , which leads him to make a pact with the Devil at a crossroads , exchanging his soul for unlimited knowledge and worldly pleasures . The Faust legend has been the basis for many literary , artistic , cinematic , and musical works that have reinterpreted it through the ages . Faust and the adjective Faustian imply a situation in which an ambitious person surrenders moral integrity in order to achieve power and success for a limited term . The Faust of early books - as well as the ballads , dramas , movies , and puppet-plays which grew out of them - is irrevocably damned because he prefers human to divine knowledge : he laid the Holy Scriptures behind the door and under the bench , refused to be called doctor of theology , but preferred to be styled doctor of medicine . Plays and comic puppet theatre loosely based on this legend were popular throughout Germany in the 16th century , often reducing Faust and Mephistopheles to figures of vulgar fun . The story was popularised in England by Christopher Marlowe , who gave it a classic treatment in his play , The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus ( whose date of publication is debated , but likely around 1587 ) . In Goethe 's reworking of the story two hundred years later , Faust becomes a dissatisfied intellectual who yearns for more than earthly meat and drink in his life .",

On 20 May , he was brought to the court to attend upon the Privy Council for questioning .

It is Shakespeare 's longest play with 30,557 words . Set in Denmark , the play depicts Prince Hamlet and his revenge against his uncle , Claudius , who has murdered Hamlet 's father in order to seize his throne and marry Hamlet 's mother . Hamlet is Shakespeare 's longest play and is considered among the most powerful and influential works of world literature , with a story capable of seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others . It was one of Shakespeare 's most popular works during his lifetime and still ranks among his most performed , topping the performance list of the Royal Shakespeare Company and its predecessors in Stratford-upon-Avon since 1879 . It has inspired many other writers - from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Charles Dickens to James Joyce and Iris Murdoch - and has been described as the world 's most filmed story after Cinderella . The story of Shakespeare 's Hamlet was derived from the legend of Amleth , preserved by 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum , as subsequently retold by the 16th-century scholar Fran\u00e7ois de Belleforest . Shakespeare may also have drawn on an earlier Elizabethan play known today as the Ur-Hamlet , though some scholars believe Shakespeare wrote the Ur-Hamlet , later revising it to create the version of Hamlet we now have . He almost certainly wrote his version of the title role for his fellow actor , Richard Burbage , the leading tragedian of Shakespeare 's time . In the 400 years since its inception , the role has been performed by numerous highly acclaimed actors in each successive century . Three different early versions of the play are extant : the First Quarto ( Q1 , 1603 ) ; the Second Quarto ( Q2 , 1604 ) ; and the First Folio ( F1 , 1623 ) .

The castle is situated on the extreme northeastern tip of the island of Zealand at the narrowest point of the \u00d8resund , the sound between present Denmark and the provinces of present Sweden that were also Danish at the time the castle was built . In this part , the sound is only 4 kilometres ( 2.5 mi ) wide , hence the strategic importance of maintaining a coastal fortification at this location commanding one of the few outlets of the Baltic Sea . The castle 's story dates back to a stronghold , Krogen , built by King Eric VII in the 1420s . Along with the fortress K\u00e4rnan , Helsingborg on the opposite coast of \u00d8resund , it controlled the entranceway to the Baltic Sea . From 1574 to 1585 , King Frederick II had the medieval fortress radically transformed into a magnificent Renaissance castle . The main architects were the Flemings Hans Hendrik van Paesschen and Anthonis van Obbergen , whereas the sculptural work was coordinated by Gert van Groningen . In 1629 , a fire destroyed much of the castle , but King Christian IV subsequently had it rebuilt . The castle also has a church within its walls .

  "/wiki/Eugene_O'Neill": "Eugene Gladstone O'Neill ( October 16 , 1888 - November 27 , 1953 ) was an American playwright and Nobel laureate in Literature . His poetically titled plays were among the first to introduce into U.S. drama techniques of realism earlier associated with Russian playwright Anton Chekhov , Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen , and Swedish playwright August Strindberg . The drama Long Day 's Journey into Night is often numbered on the short list of the finest U.S. plays in the 20th century , alongside Tennessee Williams 's A Streetcar Named Desire and Arthur Miller 's Death of a Salesman . O'Neill 's plays were among the first to include speeches in American English vernacular and involve characters on the fringes of society . They struggle to maintain their hopes and aspirations , but ultimately slide into disillusionment and despair . Of his very few comedies , only one is well-known ( Ah , Wilderness ! ) . Nearly all of his other plays involve some degree of tragedy and personal pessimism .",
  "/wiki/Henry_V_(play)": "Henry V is a history play by William Shakespeare , believed to have been written near 1599 . It tells the story of King Henry V of England , focusing on events immediately before and after the Battle of Agincourt ( 1415 ) during the Hundred Years ' War . In the First Quarto text , it was titled The Cronicle History of Henry the fift , :p.6 which became The Life of Henry the Fifth in the First Folio text . The play is the final part of a tetralogy , preceded by Richard II , Henry IV , Part 1 , and Henry IV , Part 2 . The original audiences would thus have already been familiar with the title character , who was depicted in the Henry IV plays as a wild , undisciplined young man . In Henry V , the young prince has matured . He embarks on an expedition to France and , his army badly outnumbered , defeats the French at Agincourt .",
  "/wiki/Henry_V_of_England": "Henry V ( 16 September 1386 - 31 August 1422 ) , also called Henry of Monmouth , was King of England from 1413 until his death in 1422 . He was the second English monarch of the House of Lancaster . Despite his relatively short reign , Henry 's outstanding military successes in the Hundred Years ' War against France , most notably in his famous victory at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 , made England one of the strongest military powers in Europe . Immortalised in Shakespeare 's Henriad plays , Henry is known and celebrated as one of the greatest warrior kings of medieval England . In his youth , during the reign of his father Henry IV , Henry gained military experience fighting the Welsh during the revolt of Owain Glynd\u0175r and against the powerful aristocratic Percy family of Northumberland at the Battle of Shrewsbury . Henry acquired an increasing role in England 's government due to the king 's declining health , but disagreements between father and son led to political conflict between the two . After his father 's death in 1413 , Henry assumed control of the country and asserted the pending English claim to the French throne . In 1415 , Henry embarked on war with France in the ongoing Hundred Years ' War ( 1337-1453 ) between the two nations . His military successes culminated in his famous victory at the Battle of Agincourt ( 1415 ) and saw him come close to conquering France . Taking advantage of political divisions within France , he conquered large portions of the kingdom , resulting in Normandy 's occupation by the English for the first time since 1345-1360 . After months of negotiation with Charles VI of France , the Treaty of Troyes ( 1420 ) recognised Henry V as regent and heir apparent to the French throne , and he was subsequently married to Charles 's daughter , Catherine of Valois . Following this conversation , everything seemed to point to the formation of a union between the kingdoms of France and England , in the person of King Henry .",
