The Games were the first to be celebrated after World War II ; it had been 12 years since the last Winter Games in 1936 . From the selection of a host city in a neutral country to the exclusion of Japan and Germany , the political atmosphere of the post-war world was inescapable during the Games . The organizing committee faced several challenges due to the lack of financial and human resources consumed by the war . These were the first of two winter Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Sigfrid Edstr\u00f6m . There were 28 nations that marched in the opening ceremonies on January 30 , 1948 . Bibi Torriani played for the Switzerland men 's national ice hockey team , and became the first ice hockey player to recite the Olympic Oath on behalf of all athletes . Nearly 670 athletes competed in 22 events in four sports . The Games also featured two demonstration sports : military patrol , which later became the biathlon , and winter pentathlon , which was discontinued after these Games . Notable performances were turned in by figure skaters Dick Button and Barbara Ann Scott and skier Henri Oreiller . Most of the athletic venues were already in existence from the first time St. Moritz hosted the Winter Games in 1928 . All of the venues were outdoors , which meant the Games were heavily dependent on favorable weather conditions .",

Squaw Valley was chosen to host the Games at the 1956 meeting of the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) . It was an undeveloped resort in 1955 , so from 1956 to 1960 the infrastructure and all of the venues were built at a cost of US $ 80,000,000 . It was designed to be intimate , allowing spectators and competitors to walk to nearly all the venues . Squaw Valley hosted athletes from thirty nations who competed in four sports and twenty-seven events . Women 's speed skating and biathlon made their Olympic debuts . After a poll was taken indicating that only nine countries would send a bobsled team , the organizers decided the bobsled events did not warrant the cost to build a venue , so for the first and only time bobsled was not on the Winter Olympic program . Cold War politics forced the IOC to debate the participation of China and Taiwan . The United States supported Taiwan while the Soviet Union stood behind China . Given the fact that the 1960 Games were to be held in America , there was concern among IOC members that the United States would not allow China or any other Communist country to participate . In 1957 , IOC president Avery Brundage , himself an American , announced that if the United States refused entry to any country recognized by the IOC , then they would revoke Squaw Valley 's invitation to host the Games and he would resign the presidency . Bowing to international pressure , the United States allowed athletes from Communist countries to participate .",

The results of both the men 's and ladies ' singles events were dominated by placements in the compulsory figures , which at the time were nominally worth 50% of the total score but in fact weighted more heavily than the free skating due to being judged using a wider range of marks . In the men 's event , Ondrej Nepela , the figures winner , took the gold in spite of placing only 4th in the free skating after falling on his triple loop jump . The free skating winner was Sergei Chetverukhin , who skated one of his best performances at this event to take the silver medal . Patrick P\u00e9ra , second in the figures , had a poor free skating in which he fell on a triple salchow jump early in his program and then made other mistakes . Nonetheless the weight given to figures allowed him to take the bronze medal ahead of John Misha Petkevich , Kenneth Shelley , and Toller Cranston , who all skated dynamic programs with at least one cleanly landed triple jump apiece . The effect of the figures was even more pronounced in the ladies ' competition , where gold medal winner Beatrix Schuba placed only 7th in the free skating , performing mostly single jumps . The free skating was won by Janet Lynn , who received a perfect mark of 6.0 despite falling on a flying sit spin . Lynn 's skating captivated the Japanese audience , especially when she got up smiling from her fall . Lynn took the bronze while Karen Magnussen , second in the free skating with a strong performance , took the silver . The third place skater in the free skating , Sonja Morgenstern , included a triple salchow in her program , which at this time was very rare for a female skater . She placed 6th overall .",
