  "/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)": "Billboard , stylized as billboard , is an American entertainment media brand owned by the Billboard-Hollywood Reporter Media Group , a division of Eldridge Industries . It publishes pieces involving news , video , opinion , reviews , events , and style , and is also known for its music charts , including the Hot 100 and Billboard 200 , tracking the most popular songs and albums in different genres . It also hosts events , owns a publishing firm , and operates several TV shows . Billboard was founded in 1894 by William Donaldson and James Hennegan as a trade publication for bill posters . Donaldson later acquired Hennegen 's interest in 1900 for $ 500 . In the early years of the 20th century , it covered the entertainment industry , such as circuses , fairs , and burlesque shows , and also created a mail service for travelling entertainers . Billboard began focusing more on the music industry as the jukebox , phonograph , and radio became commonplace . Many topics it covered were spun-off into different magazines , including Amusement Business in 1961 to cover outdoor entertainment , so that it could focus on music . After Donaldson died in 1925 , Billboard was passed down to his children and Hennegan 's children , until it was sold to private investors in 1985 , and has since been owned by various parties .",

  "/wiki/Dignity_(Hilary_Duff_album)": "Dignity is the fourth studio album by American recording artist Hilary Duff . It was released on March 21 , 2007 , by Hollywood Records . After launching her third record Hilary Duff ( 2004 ) , she experienced an eventful personal life , including a stalking incident , her parents getting divorced and breaking up with her boyfriend of two years Joel Madden . Consequently , Duff assumed an integral position in its production , co-writing almost every track with longtime collaborator Kara DioGuardi instead of her previously-limited involvement . Duff was musically inspired by indie rock band the Faint and pop singers Beyonc\u00e9 and Gwen Stefani . In contrast to the pop rock themes of her prior releases , Dignity takes on more of a dance sound , which she said was not her intention while writing the album . The lyrics reference the events Duff experienced in the years leading to the album 's release , and the album 's songs contain influences of rock and roll and hip hop music . Critical response was mostly positive ; the album was praised for its songwriting and her new musical direction . Upon release , Dignity debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 , a lower peak than Duff 's previous albums and with lower sales , which Billboard attributed to the loss of fans during her musical evolution . Despite this , it produced Duff 's highest-peaking single on US Billboard Hot 100 to date , With Love , which peaked at number twenty-four , and two number one club hits on US Hot Dance Club Play . The album has reached the top ten in several countries and was certified Gold in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . To promote the album , Duff embarked on her fourth concert tour , the Dignity Tour , between July 2007 and February 2008 ."
