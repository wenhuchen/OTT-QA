It is located at the confluence of the Nive and Adour rivers in the northern part of the cultural region of the Basque Country , as well as the southern part of Gascony where the Aquitaine basin joins the beginning of the Pre-Pyrenees . Together with nearby Anglet , Biarritz , Saint-Jean-de-Luz , and several smaller communes , Bayonne forms an urban area with 288,359 inhabitants at the 2012 census , 45,855 of whom lived in the city of Bayonne proper . The site on the left bank of the Nive and the Adour was probably occupied before ancient times as a fortified enclosure was attested in the 1st century at the time when the Tarbelli occupied the territory . Archaeological studies have confirmed the presence of a Roman castrum , a stronghold in Novempopulania at the end of the 4th century before the city was populated by the Vascones . In 1023 Bayonne was the capital of Labourd and , in the 12th century , extended to and beyond the Nive . At that time the first bridge was built over the Adour . The city came under the domination of the English in 1152 through the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine : it became militarily and , above all , commercially important thanks to maritime trade . It was separated from the Viscount of Labourd in 1177 by Richard the Lion Heart . In 1451 the city was taken by the Crown of France after the Hundred Years ' War . The loss of trade with the English and the silting up of the river as well as the movement of the city towards the north weakened it . The district of Saint-Esprit developed anyway thanks to the arrival of a Jewish population fleeing the Spanish expulsions dictated by the Alhambra Decree .",

That distance had a rather weak field , and Bennett lead throughout the race , defeating local favourite Henri Deloge in 4:06.0 . That time was an official world record , although many athletes had already run faster in competitions over the slightly longer mile . Together with the combined British/Australian 5000 metres team , Bennett won a second Olympic title . Bennett finished first in the race , with an unofficial world record 15:29.2 , beating teammate John Rimmer . His third event was the 4000 m steeplechase , in which he just failed to catch up with the same Rimmer in the final part of the race , settling for second place . Bennett died in Bournemouth , aged 79 . His Olympic achievements were largely forgotten for more than 100 years until his grandson Chris Bennett found his abandoned and overgrown grave in the corner of St Andrews Churchyard in Kinson . In December 2011 Bennett was commemorated after Anthony Ives Memorials of Bournemouth donated a proper headstone to recognise his feat .",
