Each team of 15 players includes two flankers , who play in the forwards , and are generally classified as either blindside or openside flankers , numbers 6 and 7 respectively .

Flankers also assist in pushing in a scrum , but are expected to detach from the scrum as soon as the ball is out to get to the play before the opposition 's forwards . Flankers also participate in line-outs , either being lifted to contest or win possession , or to lift other players . Flankers are usually the key participants in the tackling process . The flankers , especially the openside , are often the fastest forwards on the team but still relied upon for tackling .",
