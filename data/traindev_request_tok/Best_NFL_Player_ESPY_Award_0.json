It was the only season in league history where all NFL teams were scheduled to play their 16-game schedule over a span of 18 weeks ( the league again played 16 games over 18 weeks in 2001 , but this was not planned and instead was caused by the postponement of a week of games due to the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks ) . After the success of expanding the regular season to a period of 17 weeks in 1990 , the league hoped this new schedule would generate even more revenue . This was also done to avoid scheduling playoff games on January 1 and competing with college football bowl games . However , teams felt that having two weeks off during the regular season was too disruptive for their weekly routines , and thus it reverted to 17 weeks immediately after the season ended . On March 1 , 1993 , the current free agent system was introduced to the league . When new TV contracts were signed in December 1993 , CBS lost their rights to broadcasting NFC games to the then seven-year old Fox Network ( which had just started up its own sports division ) , which took effect next season ; this ended a 37 year association with the NFL for CBS . The season ended with Super Bowl XXVIII when the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Buffalo Bills 30-13 for the second consecutive season at the Georgia Dome .

The Phoenix Cardinals changed their name to Arizona Cardinals in an attempt to widen their appeal to the entire state of Arizona instead of just the Phoenix area . The name was initially resisted by Bill Bidwill . The Seattle Seahawks played their first three regular season home games at Husky Stadium because the Kingdome , the Seahawks ' regular home field , was undergoing repairs for damaged tiles on its roof .

This marked the last season until 2016 that the city of Los Angeles had an NFL team and the last one until 2017 that the city had two .
