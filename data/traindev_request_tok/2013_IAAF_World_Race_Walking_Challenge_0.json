  "/wiki/Hobart": "Hobart ( /\u02c8ho\u028ab\u0251\u02d0rt/ ( listen ) ) is the capital and most populous city of the Australian island state of Tasmania . With a population of approximately 240,342 ( over 45% of Tasmania 's population ) , it is the least populated Australian state capital city , and second smallest if territories are taken into account ( after Darwin , Northern Territory ) . The city is located in the state 's south-east on the estuary of the River Derwent , making it the most southern of Australia 's capital cities . Its skyline is dominated by the 1,271-metre ( 4,170 ft ) Mount Wellington , and its harbour forms the second-deepest natural port in the world , with much of the city 's waterfront consisting of reclaimed land . The metropolitan area is often referred to as Greater Hobart , to differentiate it from the City of Hobart , one of the five local government areas that cover the city . Founded in 1804 as a British penal colony , Hobart is Australia 's second oldest capital city after Sydney , New South Wales . Prior to British settlement , the Hobart area had been occupied for possibly as long as 35,000 years , by the semi-nomadic Mouheneener tribe , a sub-group of the Nuennone , or South-East tribe . The descendants of these Aboriginal Tasmanians often refer to themselves as 'Palawa ' . Since its foundation , the city has expanded from the mouth of Sullivans Cove in a generally north-south direction along both banks of the River Derwent , from 22 km inland from the estuary at Storm Bay to the point where the river reverts to fresh water at Bridgewater . Penal transportation ended in the 1850s , after which the city experienced periods of growth and decline . The early 20th century saw an economic boom on the back of mining , agriculture and other primary industries , and the loss of men who served in the world wars was counteracted by an influx of immigration . Despite the rise in migration from Asia and other non-English speaking regions , Hobart 's population remains predominantly ethnically Anglo-Celtic , and has the highest percentage of Australian-born residents among Australia 's capital cities .",

It lies on the river Labe 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) east of Prague on the D11 highway . It obtained the status of town from the king of Bohemia in 1472 . A historic milestone in the life of the town was the year 1905 , when it was visited by the German estate owner Prince von B\u00fclow . This well-known water diviner found in the inner courtyard of the castle signs of a strong spring , which was later bored to a depth of 97.6 metres ( 320 ft ) . The discovery of carbonic mineral water resulted in the opening of the first spa in 1908 . After World War I Pod\u011bbrady rapidly changed into a spa town which from 1926 specialized in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases , rapidly gaining renown not only in the Czech Republic , but also abroad in countries including Austria , Germany , Russia and the United States . The history of Pod\u011bbrady reaches back to medieval times . A long-distance trade route running from Prague to eastern Bohemia and then on to Silesia and Poland passed through the then-forested landscape interwoven with a dense network of river branches . This important communication intersected the River Labe to the west of the present town , at a place called Na Vinici . An ancient community and a small fortress originated near the ford .
