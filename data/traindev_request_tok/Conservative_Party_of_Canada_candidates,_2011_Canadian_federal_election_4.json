  "/wiki/Ancaster,_Ontario": "Ancaster is a historic town in the city of Hamilton , Ontario , Canada , located on the Niagara Escarpment . Founded as a town in 1793 , it immediately developed itself into one of the first important and influential early British Upper Canada communities established during the late 18th century eventually amalgamating with the city of Hamilton in 2001 . By 1823 , due in large part to its easily accessible water power and location at the juncture of prehistoric indigenous trading routes , Ancaster had become Upper Canada 's largest industrial and commercial centre . Additionally , Ancaster had at that time attracted the 2nd largest populace ( 1,681 ) in Upper Canada trailing only Kingston ( population 2,500 ) , but surpassing the populations of nearby Toronto ( 1,376 ) and Hamilton ( 1,000 ) . After this initial period of prosperity beginning in the late 18th century , sudden significant water and rail transportation advancements of the early 19th century would soon better benefit Ancaster 's neighbouring towns situated closer to the Lake Ontario waterfront . Stationary steam engines for industries that had rapidly developed in the 19th century would eventually make Ancaster 's water powered industries less vital . As a result , after the 1820s , Ancaster 's influence during the remainder of the 19th century would begin to wane . From the late 19th century , Ancaster 's population would remain static until 1946 when new subdivisions around the village were established . The population expanded further with the completion of the Hamilton-Ancaster section of Highway 403 in 1968 and the introduction of sewer systems in 1974 . After 1970 , its population essentially doubled from 15,000 residents to its present-day 33,000 .",
