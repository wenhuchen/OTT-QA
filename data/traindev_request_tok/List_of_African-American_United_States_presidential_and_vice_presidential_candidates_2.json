  "/wiki/1872_United_States_presidential_election": "The 1872 United States presidential election was the 22nd quadrennial presidential election , held on Tuesday , November 5 , 1872 . Despite a split in the Republican Party , incumbent President Ulysses S. Grant defeated Liberal Republican nominee Horace Greeley . The election is notable for being the only presidential election in which a major party nominee died during the election process . Grant was unanimously re-nominated at the 1872 Republican National Convention , but his intra-party opponents organized the Liberal Republican Party and held their own convention . The 1872 Liberal Republican convention nominated Greeley , a New York newspaper publisher , and wrote a platform calling for civil service reform and an end to Reconstruction . Democratic Party leaders believed that their only hope of defeating Grant was to unite around Greeley , and the 1872 Democratic National Convention nominated the Liberal Republican ticket . Despite the union between the Liberal Republicans and Democrats , Greeley proved to be an ineffective campaigner and Grant remained widely popular . Grant decisively won re-election , carrying 31 of the 37 states , including several Southern states that would not again vote Republican until the 20th century . Grant would be the last incumbent to win a second term until William McKinley 's victory in the 1900 presidential election , and his popular vote margin of 11.8% was the largest margin between 1852 and 1904 . On November 29 , 1872 , after the popular vote was counted , but before the Electoral College cast its votes , Greeley died . As a result , electors previously committed to Greeley voted for four different candidates for president and eight different candidates for vice president . It was the last instance until the 2016 presidential election in which more than one presidential elector voted for a candidate to whom they were not pledged .",
  "/wiki/Frederick_Douglass": "Frederick Douglass ( born Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey ; c. February 1818 - February 20 , 1895 ) was an American social reformer , abolitionist , orator , writer , and statesman . After escaping from slavery in Maryland , he became a national leader of the abolitionist movement in Massachusetts and New York , gaining note for his oratory and incisive antislavery writings . In his time , he was described by abolitionists as a living counter-example to slaveholders ' arguments that slaves lacked the intellectual capacity to function as independent American citizens . Northerners at the time found it hard to believe that such a great orator had once been a slave . Douglass wrote several autobiographies . He described his experiences as a slave in his 1845 autobiography , Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass , an American Slave , which became a bestseller , and was influential in promoting the cause of abolition , as was his second book , My Bondage and My Freedom ( 1855 ) . After the Civil War , Douglass remained an active campaigner against slavery and wrote his last autobiography , Life and Times of Frederick Douglass . First published in 1881 and revised in 1892 , three years before his death , it covered events during and after the Civil War . Douglass also actively supported women 's suffrage , and held several public offices . Without his approval , Douglass became the first African American nominated for Vice President of the United States as the running mate and Vice Presidential nominee of Victoria Woodhull , on the Equal Rights Party ticket . Douglass was a firm believer in the equality of all peoples , whether white , black , female , Native American , or Chinese immigrants . He was also a believer in dialogue and in making alliances across racial and ideological divides , and in the liberal values of the U.S. Constitution .",
  "/wiki/Equal_Rights_Party_(United_States)": "The Equal Rights Party was the name for several different nineteenth-century political parties in the United States . The first party was the Locofocos , during the 1830s and 1840s . The Anti-Rent party during the Anti-Rent War was also known by this name during the 1840s and 1850s . Another party by this name ran Victoria Woodhull for President of the United States and Frederick Douglass for Vice President of the United States in the 1872 presidential election . It was also known as the People 's Party , the Cosmo-Political Party and the National Radical Reformers . A fourth was the party that ran Belva Ann Lockwood for President in the 1884 and 1888 presidential elections and Marietta Stow and Alfred H. Love ( and replacing him , Charles Stuart Wells ) for vice president respectively . This was also known as the National Equal Rights Party .

  "/wiki/Victoria_Woodhull": "Victoria Claflin Woodhull , later Victoria Woodhull Martin ( September 23 , 1838 - June 9 , 1927 ) , was an American leader of the women 's suffrage movement . In 1872 , she ran for President of the United States . While many historians and authors agree that Woodhull was the first woman to run for President of the United States , some have questioned that priority given issues with the legality of her run . They disagree with classifying it as a true candidacy because she was younger than the constitutionally mandated age of 35 . ( Woodhull 's 35th birthday was in September 1873 , seven months after the March inauguration ) . However , election coverage by contemporary newspapers does not suggest age was a significant issue ; this may , however , be due to the fact that no one took the candidacy seriously . An activist for women 's rights and labor reforms , Woodhull was also an advocate of free love , by which she meant the freedom to marry , divorce and bear children without social restriction or government interference . They can not roll back the rising tide of reform , she often said . The world moves . Woodhull twice went from rags to riches , her first fortune being made on the road as a magnetic healer before she joined the spiritualist movement in the 1870s . Authorship of many of her articles is disputed ( many of her speeches on these topics were collaborations between Woodhull , her backers , and her second husband , Colonel James Blood ) . However , despite her ethical problems , her role as a representative of these movements was powerful .",

Republican Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover defeated the Democratic nominee , Governor Al Smith of New York . Hoover was the last Republican to win a presidential election until 1952 . After President Calvin Coolidge declined to seek reelection , Hoover emerged as his party 's front-runner . As Hoover 's intra-party opponents failed to unite around a candidate , Hoover received a large majority of the vote at the 1928 Republican National Convention . The strong state of the economy discouraged some Democrats from running , and Smith was nominated on the first ballot of the 1928 Democratic National Convention . Hoover and Smith had been widely known as potential presidential candidates long before the 1928 campaign , and both were generally regarded as outstanding leaders . Each candidate was a newcomer to the presidential race and presented in his person and record an appeal of unknown potency to the electorate . Each candidate also faced serious discontent within his party membership , and neither had the wholehearted support of his party organization . In the end , the Republicans were identified with the booming economy of the 1920s , whereas Smith , a Roman Catholic , suffered politically from anti-Catholic prejudice , his anti-prohibitionist stance , and his association with the legacy of corruption of Tammany Hall . Hoover won a third straight Republican landslide and made substantial inroads in the traditionally Democratic Solid South , winning several states that had not voted for a Republican since the end of Reconstruction . Hoover 's victory made him the first president born west of the Mississippi River , and he is the most recent sitting member of the Cabinet to win a major party 's presidential nomination .",

Roosevelt united the party around him , campaigning on the failures of the Hoover administration . He promised recovery with a New Deal for the American people .

  "/wiki/Communist_Party_USA": "The Communist Party USA , officially the Communist Party of the United States of America ( CPUSA ) , is a communist party in the United States established in 1919 after a split in the Socialist Party of America following the Russian Revolution . The history of the CPUSA is closely related to the American labor movement and communist parties worldwide . Initially operating underground due to the Palmer Raids starting in the First Red Scare , the party was influential in American politics in the first half of the 20th century and played a prominent role in the labor movement from the 1920s through the 1940s , becoming known for opposing racism and racial segregation after sponsoring the defense for the Scottsboro Boys in 1931 . Its membership increased during the Great Depression , and they played a key role in the Congress of Industrial Organizations . The CPUSA subsequently declined due to events such as the beginning of the Cold War , the second Red Scare , and the influence of McCarthyism . Its opposition to the Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine were unpopular , with its endorsed candidate Henry A. Wallace under-performing in the 1948 presidential election . Its support for the Soviet Union increasingly alienated it from the rest of the left in the United States in the 1960s . The CPUSA received significant funding from the Soviet Union and crafted its public positions to match those of Moscow . The CPUSA also used a covert apparatus to assist the Soviets with their intelligence activities in the United States and utilized a network of front organizations to shape public opinion . The CPUSA opposed glasnost and perestroika in the Soviet Union and as a result major funding from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ended in 1989 . The party remains committed to Marxism-Leninism .",

With the backing of party leaders , Landon defeated progressive Senator William Borah at the 1936 Republican National Convention to win his party 's presidential nomination . The populist Union Party nominated Congressman William Lemke for president . The election took place as the Great Depression entered its eighth year . Roosevelt was still working to push the provisions of his New Deal economic policy through Congress and the courts . However , the New Deal policies he had already enacted , such as Social Security and unemployment benefits , had proven to be highly popular with most Americans . Landon , a political moderate , accepted much of the New Deal but criticized it for waste and inefficiency .

Browder is best remembered as the General Secretary of the CPUSA during the 1930s and first half of the 1940s . During World War I , Browder served time in federal prison as a conscientious objector to conscription and the war . Upon his release , Browder became an active member of the American Communist movement , soon working as an organizer on behalf of the Communist International and its Red International of Labor Unions in China and the Pacific region . In 1930 , following the removal of a rival political faction from leadership , Browder was made General Secretary of the CPUSA . For the next 15 years thereafter Browder was the most recognizable public figure associated with American Communism , authoring dozens of pamphlets and books , making numerous public speeches before sometimes vast audiences , and twice running for President of the United States . Browder also took part in activities on behalf of Soviet intelligence in America during his period of party leadership , placing those who sought to convey sensitive information to the party into contact with Soviet intelligence . In the wake of public outrage over the 1939 Nazi-Soviet pact , Browder was indicted for passport fraud . He was convicted of two counts early in 1940 and sentenced to four years in prison , remaining free for a time on appeal . In the spring of 1942 , the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the sentence and Browder began what proved to be a 14-month stint in federal prison .

Roosevelt defeated Republican businessman Wendell Willkie to be reelected for an unprecedented third term in office . Roosevelt did not want to campaign for a third term initially , but was driven by worsening conditions in Europe . He and his allies sought to defuse challenges from other party leaders like James Farley and Vice President John Nance Garner . The 1940 Democratic National Convention re-nominated Roosevelt on the first ballot , while Garner was replaced on the ticket by Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace . Willkie , a dark horse candidate , defeated conservative Senator Robert A. Taft and prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey on the sixth presidential ballot of the 1940 Republican National Convention . Roosevelt , acutely aware of strong isolationist and non-interventionism sentiment , promised there would be no involvement in foreign wars if he were re-elected . Willkie , who had not previously run for public office , conducted an energetic campaign and managed to revive Republican strength in areas of the Midwest and Northeast . He criticized perceived incompetence and waste in the New Deal , warned of the dangers of breaking the two-term tradition , and accused Roosevelt of secretly planning to take the country into World War II . Willkie was damaged by his association with big business , as many working class voters blamed corporations and business leaders for a large part of the onset of the Great Depression .",

The Republicans chose Richard Nixon , a young senator from California , as Eisenhower 's running mate . Republicans attacked Truman 's handling of the Korean War and the broader Cold War , and alleged that Soviet spies had infiltrated the U.S. government . Democrats faulted Eisenhower for failing to condemn Republican Senator Joe McCarthy and other reactionary Republicans who they alleged had engaged in reckless and unwarranted attacks .

Despite challenges from Wallace , Republican nominee Thomas E. Dewey , and Strom Thurmond of the segregationist Dixiecrats , Truman won re-election in the 1948 election .

  "/wiki/1980_United_States_presidential_election": "The 1980 United States presidential election was the 49th quadrennial presidential election . It was held on Tuesday , November 4 , 1980 . Republican nominee Ronald Reagan defeated Democrat Jimmy Carter . Due to the rise of conservatism following Reagan 's victory , some historians consider the election to be a realigning election that marked the start of the Reagan Era . Carter 's unpopularity and poor relations with Democratic leaders encouraged an intra-party challenge by Senator Ted Kennedy , a younger brother of former President John F. Kennedy . Carter defeated Kennedy in the majority of the Democratic primaries , but Kennedy remained in the race until Carter was officially nominated at the 1980 Democratic National Convention . The Republican primaries were contested between Reagan , who had previously served as the Governor of California , former Congressman George H. W. Bush of Texas , Congressman John B. Anderson of Illinois , and several other candidates . All of Reagan 's opponents had dropped out by the end of the primaries , and the 1980 Republican National Convention nominated a ticket consisting of Reagan and Bush . Anderson entered the race as an independent candidate , and convinced former Wisconsin Governor Patrick Lucey , a Democrat , to serve as his running mate . Reagan campaigned for increased defense spending , implementation of supply-side economic policies , and a balanced budget . His campaign was aided by Democratic dissatisfaction with Carter , the Iran hostage crisis , and a worsening economy at home marked by high unemployment and inflation . Carter attacked Reagan as a dangerous right-wing extremist and warned that Reagan would cut Medicare and Social Security .",

Incumbent Republican President Ronald Reagan defeated former Vice President Walter Mondale , the Democratic candidate . Reagan faced only token opposition in his bid for re-nomination by the Republicans , so he and Vice President George H. W. Bush were easily re-nominated . Mondale defeated activist Jesse Jackson and several other candidates in the 1984 Democratic primaries before eventually choosing U.S. Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York as his running mate , the first woman to be on a major party 's presidential ticket . Reagan touted a strong economic recovery from the 1970s stagflation and the 1981-82 recession , as well as the widespread perception that his presidency had overseen a revival of national confidence and prestige . The Reagan campaign produced effective television advertising and deftly neutralized concerns regarding Reagan 's age . Mondale criticized Reagan 's supply-side economic policies and budget deficits , and he called for a nuclear freeze and ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment . Reagan won 58.8% of the popular vote and carried 49 of the 50 states , becoming the oldest person to win a presidential election . Reagan 's showing ranks fifth in the share of electoral votes received and fifth in the share of the popular vote won . No candidate since 1984 has equaled Reagan 's share of the electoral vote , although his popular vote was eventually surpassed by Bush in 2004 ( 62 million ) and subsequent candidates . Mondale received 40.6% of the popular vote , but carried only the District of Columbia and his home state of Minnesota .",

Bush had alienated many of the conservatives in his party by breaking his 1988 campaign pledge against raising taxes , but he fended off a primary challenge from conservative commentator Pat Buchanan . Bush 's popularity after his success in the Gulf War dissuaded high-profile Democratic candidates like Mario Cuomo from entering the 1992 Democratic primaries . Clinton , a leader of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council , established himself as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination by sweeping the Super Tuesday primaries . He defeated former and future Governor of California Jerry Brown , former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas , and other candidates to win his party 's nomination , and chose Senator Al Gore as his running mate . Billionaire Ross Perot launched an independent campaign , emphasizing his opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement and his plan to reduce the national debt . The economy was in recession and Bush 's greatest strength , foreign policy , was regarded as much less important following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War and the relatively peaceful climate in the Middle East after the Gulf War . Perot led in several polls taken in June 1992 , but severely damaged his candidacy by temporarily dropping out of the race in July . The Bush campaign criticized Clinton 's character and emphasized Bush 's foreign policy successes , while Clinton focused on the economy .
