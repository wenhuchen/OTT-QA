  "/wiki/Gjirokast\u00ebr": "Gjirokast\u00ebr ( Albanian pronunciation : [ \u025fi\u027eokast\u0259\u027e ] ) is a city in southern Albania , on a valley between the Gjer\u00eb mountains and the Drino , at 300 metres above sea level . Its old town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site , described as a rare example of a well-preserved Ottoman town , built by farmers of large estate . The city is overlooked by Gjirokast\u00ebr Fortress , where the Gjirokast\u00ebr National Folklore Festival is held every five years . It is the birthplace of former Albanian communist leader Enver Hoxha , and author Ismail Kadare . The city appears in the historical record dating back in 1336 by its Greek name , \u0391\u03c1\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf - Argyrokastro , as part of the Byzantine Empire . It became part of the Orthodox Christian diocese of Dryinoupolis and Argyrokastro after the destruction of nearby Adrianoupolis . Gjirokast\u00ebr later was contested between the Despotate of Epirus and the Albanian clan of John Zenevisi before falling under Ottoman rule for the next five centuries ( 1417-1913 ) . Throughout the Ottoman era Gjirokast\u00ebr was officially known in Ottoman Turkish as Ergiri and also Ergiri Kasr\u0131 . During the Ottoman period conversions to Islam and an influx of Muslim converts from the surrounding countryside made Gjirokast\u00ebr go from being an overwhelmingly Christian city in the 16th century into one with a large Muslim population by the early 19th century . Gjirokast\u00ebr also became a major religious centre for Bektashi Sufism . Taken by the Hellenic Army during the Balkan Wars of 1912-3 on account of its large Greek population , it was eventually incorporated into the newly independent state of Albania in 1913 . This proved highly unpopular with the local Greek population , who rebelled ; after several months of guerrilla warfare , the short-lived Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus was established in 1914 with Gjirokast\u00ebr as its capital .",

The city was awarded the title of the European Youth Capital of 2022 . Tirana is located in the center of Albania and is enclosed by mountains and hills with Mount Dajt elevating on the east and a slight valley on the northwest overlooking the Adriatic Sea in the distance . Due to its location within the Plain of Tirana and the close proximity to the Mediterranean Sea , the city is particularly influenced by a Mediterranean seasonal climate . It is among the wettest and sunniest cities in Europe , with 2,544 hours of sun per year . Tirana flourished as a city in 1614 but the region that today corresponds to the city 's territory has been continuously inhabited since the Iron Age . The city 's territory was inhabited by several Illyrian tribes but had no importance within Illyria . Indeed , it was annexed by Rome and became an integral part of the Roman Empire following the Illyrian Wars . The heritage of that period is still evident and represented by the Mosaics of Tirana . Later , in the 5th and 6th centuries , a Paleochristian basilica was built around this site . After the Roman Empire split into East and West in the 4th century , its successor the Byzantine Empire took control over most of Albania , and built the Petrel\u00eb Castle in the reign of Justinian I .

It was founded in 681 when Bulgar tribes led by Asparuh moved to the northeastern Balkans . There they secured Byzantine recognition of their right to settle south of the Danube by defeating - possibly with the help of local South Slavic tribes - the Byzantine army led by Constantine IV . At the height of its power , Bulgaria spread from the Danube Bend to the Black Sea and from the Dnieper River to the Adriatic Sea . As the state solidified its position in the Balkans , it entered into a centuries-long interaction , sometimes friendly and sometimes hostile , with the Byzantine Empire . Bulgaria emerged as Byzantium 's chief antagonist to its north , resulting in several wars . The two powers also enjoyed periods of peace and alliance , most notably during the Second Arab siege of Constantinople , where the Bulgarian army broke the siege and destroyed the Arab army , thus preventing an Arab invasion of Southeastern Europe . Byzantium had a strong cultural influence on Bulgaria , which also led to the eventual adoption of Christianity in 864 . After the disintegration of the Avar Khaganate , the country expanded its territory northwest to the Pannonian Plain . Later the Bulgarians confronted the advance of the Pechenegs and Cumans , and achieved a decisive victory over the Magyars , forcing them to establish themselves permanently in Pannonia . During the late 9th and early 10th centuries , Simeon I achieved a string of victories over the Byzantines .

One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture , which dates back to 6,500 BC .

The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries .

It was established by the Treaty of Berlin in 1878 . After the Russo-Turkish War ended with a Russian victory , the Treaty of San Stefano was signed by Russia and the Ottoman Empire on 3 March 1878 . Under this , a large Bulgarian vassal state was agreed to , which was significantly larger : its lands encompassed nearly all ethnic Bulgarians in the Balkans , and included most of Moesia , Thrace and Macedonia , stretching from the Black Sea to the Aegean . However , the United Kingdom and Austria-Hungary were against the establishment of such a large Russian client state in the Balkans , fearing it would shift the balance of power in the Mediterranean . Due to this , the great powers convened and signed the Treaty of Berlin , superseding the Treaty of San Stefano , which never went into effect . This created a much smaller principality , alongside an autonomous Eastern Rumelia within the Ottoman Empire . Although an Ottoman vassal , Bulgaria only acknowledged the authority of the Sublime Porte in a formal way . It had its own Constitution , flag and anthem , and conducted its own foreign policy . In 1885 , a bloodless revolution resulted in Eastern Rumelia being de facto annexed by Bulgaria , which the Ottoman Empire accepted with the Tophane Agreement .
