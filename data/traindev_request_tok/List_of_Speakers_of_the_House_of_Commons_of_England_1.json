He became an esquire in the king 's household and was knighted in 1378 . He took part in a number of diplomatic missions and became MP for Gloucestershire in 1390 , 1393 , 1394 and 1399 . On the last occasion he was elected Speaker , but stood down on the ostensible grounds of ill-health , but may have been persuaded to do so by the influence of Thomas Arundel , archbishop of Canterbury , who was appalled by his election and warned the clergy that Cheyne was an inveterate enemy of the contemporary church . The revolution of 1399 made for strange bedfellows . Although Cheyne is never called a Lollard ( heretic ) by contemporaries , he was a core member of a connection of knights held ( with good cause ) to be promoters of , or at least sympathetic to , that emerging sect . His testament reflected some of that sect 's attitudes but embedded in a good deal of orthodoxy . In that generation after John Wyclif , many sympathisers with the moral and social ideas of that scholar indeed hoped this would not prove incompatible with continuing devotion to orthodox piety and acceptance within the Catholic Church . Under Henry IV he continued to be employed on diplomatic missions , including a two-year trip to Rome in 1407 . He acquired property in Beckford , Gloucestershire as his principal estate . Being near to death , he was not implicated in the Oldcastle Rising of 1413/14 , which involved a few , but far from all , of the sect , but the Cheynes of Drayton Beauchamp , Buckinghamshire , were , and they seem to have been his eventual heirs after the deaths of his sons .",
