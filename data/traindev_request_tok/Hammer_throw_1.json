A general Warsaw Uprising between August and October 1944 led to even greater devastation and systematic razing by the Germans in advance of the Vistula-Oder Offensive . Warsaw gained the new title of Phoenix City because of its extensive history and complete reconstruction after World War II , which had left over 85% of its buildings in ruins .
