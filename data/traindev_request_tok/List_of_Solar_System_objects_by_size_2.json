  "/wiki/Moons_of_Saturn": "The moons of Saturn are numerous and diverse , ranging from tiny moonlets only tens of meters across to enormous Titan , which is larger than the planet Mercury . Saturn has 82 moons with confirmed orbits that are not embedded in its rings - of which only 13 have diameters greater than 50 kilometers - as well as dense rings that contain millions of embedded moonlets and innumerable smaller ring particles . Seven Saturnian moons are large enough to have collapsed into a relaxed , ellipsoidal shape , though only one or two of those , Titan and possibly Rhea , are currently in hydrostatic equilibrium . Particularly notable among Saturn 's moons are Titan , the second-largest moon in the Solar System ( after Jupiter 's Ganymede ) , with a nitrogen-rich Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape featuring dry river networks and hydrocarbon lakes , Enceladus , which emits jets of gas and dust from its south-polar region , and Iapetus , with its contrasting black and white hemispheres . Twenty-four of Saturn 's moons are regular satellites ; they have prograde orbits not greatly inclined to Saturn 's equatorial plane . They include the seven major satellites , four small moons that exist in a trojan orbit with larger moons , two mutually co-orbital moons and two moons that act as shepherds of Saturn 's F Ring . Two other known regular satellites orbit within gaps in Saturn 's rings . The relatively large Hyperion is locked in a resonance with Titan . The remaining regular moons orbit near the outer edge of the A Ring , within G Ring and between the major moons Mimas and Enceladus . The regular satellites are traditionally named after Titans and Titanesses or other figures associated with the mythological Saturn . The remaining 58 , with mean diameters ranging from 4 to 213 km , are irregular satellites , whose orbits are much farther from Saturn , have high inclinations , and are mixed between prograde and retrograde . These moons are probably captured minor planets , or debris from the breakup of such bodies after they were captured , creating collisional families .",

  "/wiki/Moons_of_Neptune": "Neptune has 14 known moons , which are named for minor water deities in Greek mythology . By far the largest of them is Triton , discovered by William Lassell on October 10 , 1846 , 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself ; over a century passed before the discovery of the second natural satellite , Nereid . Neptune 's outermost moon Neso , which has an orbital period of about 26 Julian years , orbits further from its planet than any other moon in the Solar System . Triton is unique among moons of planetary mass in that its orbit is retrograde to Neptune 's rotation and inclined relative to Neptune 's equator , which suggests that it did not form in orbit around Neptune but was instead gravitationally captured by it . The next-largest irregular satellite in the Solar System , Saturn 's moon Phoebe , has only 0.03% of Triton 's mass . The capture of Triton , probably occurring some time after Neptune formed a satellite system , was a catastrophic event for Neptune 's original satellites , disrupting their orbits so that they collided to form a rubble disc . Triton is massive enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium and to retain a thin atmosphere capable of forming clouds and hazes . Inward of Triton are seven small regular satellites , all of which have prograde orbits in planes that lie close to Neptune 's equatorial plane ; some of these orbit among Neptune 's rings . The largest of them is Proteus . They were re-accreted from the rubble disc generated after Triton 's capture after the Tritonian orbit became circular . Neptune also has six more outer irregular satellites other than Triton , including Nereid , whose orbits are much farther from Neptune and at high inclination : three of these have prograde orbits , while the remainder have retrograde orbits . In particular , Nereid has an unusually close and eccentric orbit for an irregular satellite , suggesting that it may have once been a regular satellite that was significantly perturbed to its current position when Triton was captured .",

  "/wiki/Scattered_disc": "The scattered disc ( or scattered disk ) is a distant circumstellar disc in the Solar System that is sparsely populated by icy small solar system bodies , which are a subset of the broader family of trans-Neptunian objects . The scattered-disc objects ( SDOs ) have orbital eccentricities ranging as high as 0.8 , inclinations as high as 40\u00b0 , and perihelia greater than 30 astronomical units ( 4.5\u00d7109 km ; 2.8\u00d7109 mi ) . These extreme orbits are thought to be the result of gravitational scattering by the gas giants , and the objects continue to be subject to perturbation by the planet Neptune . Although the closest scattered-disc objects approach the Sun at about 30-35 AU , their orbits can extend well beyond 100 AU . This makes scattered objects among the coldest and most distant objects in the Solar System . The innermost portion of the scattered disc overlaps with a torus-shaped region of orbiting objects traditionally called the Kuiper belt , but its outer limits reach much farther away from the Sun and farther above and below the ecliptic than the Kuiper belt proper . [ a ] Because of its unstable nature , astronomers now consider the scattered disc to be the place of origin for most periodic comets in the Solar System , with the centaurs , a population of icy bodies between Jupiter and Neptune , being the intermediate stage in an object 's migration from the disc to the inner Solar System . Eventually , perturbations from the giant planets send such objects towards the Sun , transforming them into periodic comets . Many objects of the proposed Oort cloud are also thought to have originated in the scattered disc . Detached objects are not sharply distinct from scattered disc objects , and some such as Sedna have sometimes been considered to be included in this group .",

The first modern era mention of the possibility of an asteroid satellite was in connection with an occultation of the bright star Gamma Ceti by the asteroid 6 Hebe in 1977 .
