  "/wiki/South_Carolina's_2nd_congressional_district": "The 2nd Congressional District of South Carolina is a congressional district in central and southwestern South Carolina . The district spans from Columbia to the South Carolina side of the Augusta , Georgia metropolitan area . From 1993 through 2012 , it included all of Lexington , Jasper , Hampton , Allendale and Barnwell counties ; most of Richland and Beaufort counties and parts of Aiken , Calhoun and Orangeburg counties . It was made more compact in the 2010 round of redistricting , and now comprises all of Lexington , Aiken and Barnwell counties , most of Richland County , and part of Orangeburg County . Besides Columbia ( 60 percent of which is in the district ) , other major cities in the district include Aiken and North Augusta . The district 's current configuration dates from 1933 , following South Carolina losing a seat in apportionment as a result of the 1930 Census showing that the state 's population had declined . Before that time , much of its territory had been within the 6th district . As a Columbia-based district from 1933 to the early 1990s , it was a fairly compact district in the central part of the state , which was largely coextensive with the Columbia metropolitan area . As a result of the 1990 census , the state legislature was required to draw a black-majority district . In a deal between Republicans and Democrats , the 6th District , previously located in the northeastern portion of the state , was redefined to incorporate most of the old 2nd 's black residents . To make up for the loss in population , the 2nd was pushed as far west as the fringes of the Augusta suburbs and as far south as Beaufort/Hilton Head . Since 1965 the 2nd district has been held by the Republican Party , made up of white conservatives in the late 20th-century realignment of political parties in the South .",
