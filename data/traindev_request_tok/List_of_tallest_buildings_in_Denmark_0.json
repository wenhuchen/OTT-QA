[ citation needed ] Its modern , functional architecture in bright concrete , glass and bronze-colored aluminum gives a unique impression . The building was designed by Gehrdt Bornebusch in collaboration with Max Br\u00fcel and J\u00f8rgen Selchau . Sven Hansen was the landscape architect while the artistic decoration was done by Poul Gernes . Its construction began in 1965 and the hospital was finished in 1975 . It was opened in 1976 . The hospital has 1,616 beds ( of 2010 ) and employs about 4,000 people and tends to 82,000 patients annually . The hospital is a teaching hospital for medical students from Copenhagen University . The former title Amtssygehuset i Herlev was changed when the Danish Municipal Reform of January 1 , 2007 abolished the amter and replaced them with five administrative regions . In 1987 the hospital was involved in the case of the hospital bombings ( Danish : Sygehusbomberne ) where an undetonated pipe bomb was found in the hospital .",

It is the seat of the Danish Parliament ( Folketinget ) , the Danish Prime Minister 's Office , and the Supreme Court of Denmark . Also , several parts of the palace are used by the Danish monarch , including the Royal Reception Rooms , the Palace Chapel and the Royal Stables . The palace is thus home to the three supreme powers : the executive power , the legislative power , and the judicial power . It is the only building in the world that houses all three of a country 's branches of government . The name Christiansborg is thus also frequently used as a metonym for the Danish political system , and colloquially it is often referred to as Rigsborgen ( 'the castle of the realm ' ) or simply Borgen ( 'the castle ' ) . The present building , the third with this name , is the last in a series of successive castles and palaces constructed on the same site since the erection of the first castle in 1167 . Since the early fifteenth century , the various buildings have served as the base of the central administration ; until 1794 as the principal residence of the Danish kings and after 1849 as the seat of parliament . The palace today bears witness to three eras of Danish architecture , as the result of two serious fires . The first fire occurred in 1794 and the second in 1884 . The main part of the current palace , finished in 1928 , is in the historicist Neo-baroque style . The chapel dates back to 1826 and is in a neoclassical style .",

Originally a Viking fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now Gammel Strand , Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century . Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions , defences and armed forces . During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the Kalmar Union , governing the entire present day Nordic region in a personal union with Sweden and Norway ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state . The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of Scandinavia under the union for well over 120 years , starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion . After a plague outbreak and fire in the 18th century , the city underwent a period of redevelopment . This included construction of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden and founding of such cultural institutions as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts . After further disasters in the early 19th century when Horatio Nelson attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city , rebuilding during the Danish Golden Age brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen 's architecture .",

  "/wiki/Solar_PV_system": "A photovoltaic system , also PV system or solar power system , is a power system designed to supply usable solar power by means of photovoltaics . It consists of an arrangement of several components , including solar panels to absorb and convert sunlight into electricity , a solar inverter to convert the output from direct to alternating current , as well as mounting , cabling , and other electrical accessories to set up a working system . It may also use a solar tracking system to improve the system 's overall performance and include an integrated battery solution , as prices for storage devices are expected to decline . Strictly speaking , a solar array only encompasses the ensemble of solar panels , the visible part of the PV system , and does not include all the other hardware , often summarized as balance of system ( BOS ) . As PV systems convert light directly into electricity , they are not to be confused with other solar technologies , such as concentrated solar power or solar thermal , used for heating and cooling . PV systems range from small , rooftop-mounted or building-integrated systems with capacities from a few to several tens of kilowatts , to large utility-scale power stations of hundreds of megawatts . Nowadays , most PV systems are grid-connected , while off-grid or stand-alone systems account for a small portion of the market . Operating silently and without any moving parts or environmental emissions , PV systems have developed from being niche market applications into a mature technology used for mainstream electricity generation . A rooftop system recoups the invested energy for its manufacturing and installation within 0.7 to 2 years and produces about 95 percent of net clean renewable energy over a 30-year service lifetime . :30 Due to the growth of photovoltaics , prices for PV systems have rapidly declined since their introduction . However , they vary by market and the size of the system .
