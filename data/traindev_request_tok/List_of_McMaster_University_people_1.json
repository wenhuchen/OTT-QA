  "/wiki/Richard_Bader": "Richard F. W. Bader ( October 15 , 1931 - January 15 , 2012 ) was a Canadian quantum chemist , noted for his work on the Atoms in molecules theory . This theory attempts to establish a physical basis for many of the working concepts of chemistry , such as atoms in molecules and bonding , in terms of the topology of the electron density function in three-dimensional space . He was born in 1931 in Kitchener , Ontario , Canada . His parents were Albert Bader and Alvina Bader , who immigrated from Switzerland . His father was a butcher at Burns Pride of Canada and his mother was a housekeeper at Kitchener Hospital of Waterloo . He received a scholarship from McMaster University that allowed him to earn a BSC in 1953 . His father was his best supporter who encouraged him and taught him to never quit his education and his dream . He finished his master 's degree in science at McMaster University in 1955 . He obtained a PhD ( 1958 ) from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) . He did postdoctoral work at MIT and the University of Cambridge . He was appointed Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Ottawa in 1959 and promoted to Associate Professor in 1962 . He moved to McMaster University as Associate Professor in 1963 , became full Professor in 1966 and was Emeritus Professor till 1996 .",
  "/wiki/Atoms_in_molecules": "The quantum theory of atoms in molecules ( QTAIM ) is a model of molecular and condensed matter electronic systems ( such as crystals ) in which the principal objects of molecular structure - atoms and bonds - are natural expressions of a system 's observable electron density distribution function . An electron density distribution of a molecule is a probability distribution that describes the average manner in which the electronic charge is distributed throughout real space in the attractive field exerted by the nuclei . According to QTAIM , molecular structure is revealed by the stationary points of the electron density together with the gradient paths of the electron density that originate and terminate at these points . QTAIM was primarily developed by Professor Richard Bader and his research group at McMaster University over the course of decades , beginning with analyses of theoretically calculated electron densities of simple molecules in the early 1960s and culminating with analyses of both theoretically and experimentally measured electron densities of crystals in the 90s . The development of QTAIM was driven by the assumption that , since the concepts of atoms and bonds have been and continue to be so ubiquitously useful in interpreting , classifying , predicting and communicating chemistry , they should have a well-defined physical basis . QTAIM recovers the central operational concepts of the molecular structure hypothesis , that of a functional grouping of atoms with an additive and characteristic set of properties , together with a definition of the bonds that link the atoms and impart the structure . QTAIM defines chemical bonding and structure of a chemical system based on the topology of the electron density . In addition to bonding , AIM allows the calculation of certain physical properties on a per-atom basis , by dividing space up into atomic volumes containing exactly one nucleus , which acts as a local attractor of the electron density . In QTAIM an atom is defined as a proper open system , i.e . a system that can share energy and electron density which is localized in the 3D space . The mathematical study of these features is usually referred to in the literature as charge density topology . QTAIM rests on the fact that the dominant topological property of the vast majority of electron density distributions is the presence of strong maxima that occur exclusively at the nuclei , certain pairs of which are linked together by ridges of electron density .",

  "/wiki/Harold_Innis": "Harold Adams Innis FRSC ( 1894-1952 ) was a Canadian professor of political economy at the University of Toronto and the author of seminal works on media , communication theory , and Canadian economic history . Despite his dense and difficult prose , Innis was one of Canada 's most original thinkers . He helped develop the staples thesis , which holds that Canada 's culture , political history , and economy have been decisively influenced by the exploitation and export of a series of staples such as fur , fishing , lumber , wheat , mined metals , and coal . The staple thesis dominated economic history in Canada 1930s-1960s , and continues to be a fundamental part of the Canadian political economy tradition . Innis 's writings on communication explore the role of media in shaping the culture and development of civilizations . He argued , for example , that a balance between oral and written forms of communication contributed to the flourishing of Greek civilization in the 5th century BC . He warned , however , that Western civilization is now imperiled by powerful , advertising-driven media obsessed by present-mindedness and the continuous , systematic , ruthless destruction of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity . His intellectual bond with Eric A. Havelock formed the foundations of the Toronto School of communication theory , which provided a source of inspiration for future members of the school : Marshall McLuhan and Edmund Snow Carpenter . Innis laid the basis for scholarship that looked at the social sciences from a distinctly Canadian point of view . As the head of the University of Toronto 's political economy department , he worked to build up a cadre of Canadian scholars so that universities would not continue to rely as heavily on British or American-trained professors unfamiliar with Canada 's history and culture . He was successful in establishing sources of financing for Canadian scholarly research . As the Cold War grew hotter after 1947 , Innis grew increasingly hostile to the United States .",
