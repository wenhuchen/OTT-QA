It changes the principles and techniques of international air navigation and fosters the planning and development of international air transport to ensure safe and orderly growth . Its headquarters is located in the Quartier International of Montreal , Quebec , Canada . The ICAO Council adopts standards and recommended practices concerning air navigation , its infrastructure , flight inspection , prevention of unlawful interference , and facilitation of border-crossing procedures for international civil aviation . ICAO defines the protocols for air accident investigation that are followed by transport safety authorities in countries signatory to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation . The Air Navigation Commission ( ANC ) is the technical body within ICAO . The Commission is composed of 19 Commissioners , nominated by the ICAO 's contracting states and appointed by the ICAO Council . Commissioners serve as independent experts , who although nominated by their states , do not serve as state or political representatives . International Standards And Recommended Practices are developed under the direction of the ANC through the formal process of ICAO Panels . Once approved by the Commission , standards are sent to the Council , the political body of ICAO , for consultation and coordination with the Member States before final adoption . ICAO is distinct from other international air transport organizations , particularly because it alone is vested with international authority ( among signatory states ) : other organizations include the International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) , a trade association representing airlines ; the Civil Air Navigation Services Organization ( CANSO ) , an organization for Air navigation service providers ( ANSPs ) ; and the Airports Council International , a trade association of airport authorities .",

The King Philip II of Spain granted Havana the title of City in 1592 . Walls as well as forts were built to protect the old city .

Colombia is bounded on the north by the Caribbean Sea , the northwest by Panama , the south by both Ecuador and Peru , the east by Venezuela , the southeast by Brazil , and the west by the Pacific . It comprises thirty-two departments , with the capital in Bogot\u00e1 . Colombia is ethnically and linguistically diverse , with its rich cultural heritage reflecting influences by various Amerindian civilizations , European settlement , forced African labor , and immigration from Europe and the greater Middle East . Urban centres are concentrated in the Andean highlands and the Caribbean coast . Colombia has been inhabited by various American Indian peoples since at least 12,000 BCE , including the Muisca , Quimbaya , and the Tairona . Spaniards arrived in 1499 and by the mid-16th century annexed part of the region , establishing the New Kingdom of Granada , with Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1 as its capital . Independence from Spain was achieved in 1819 , but by 1830 the Gran Colombia Federation was dissolved , with what is now Colombia and Panama emerging as the Republic of New Granada . The new sovereign state experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation ( 1858 ) , and then the United States of Colombia ( 1863 ) , before the Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886 . Panama seceded in 1903 , leading to Colombia 's present borders . Beginning in the 1960s , the country suffered from an asymmetric low-intensity armed conflict and political violence , both of which escalated in the 1990s . Since 2005 , there has been significant improvement in security , stability , and rule of law .",
