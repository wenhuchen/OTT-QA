  "/wiki/Han_Character": "Chinese characters ( simplified Chinese : \u6c49\u5b57 ; traditional Chinese : \u6f22\u5b57 ; pinyin : h\u00e0nz\u00ec ; literally : 'Han characters ' ) are logograms developed for the writing of Chinese . They have been adapted to write a number of other Asian languages . They remain a key component of the Japanese writing system where they are known as kanji . Chinese characters constitute the oldest continuously used system of writing in the world . By virtue of their widespread current use in East Asia , and historic use throughout the Sinosphere , Chinese characters are among the most widely adopted writing systems in the world by number of users . Chinese characters number in the tens of thousands , though most of them are minor graphic variants encountered only in historical texts . Unlike an alphabet , a character-based writing system associates each logogram with an entire sound and thus may be compared in some aspects to a syllabary . Functional literacy in written Chinese requires a knowledge of between three and four thousand characters . In Japan , 2,136 are taught through secondary school ( the J\u014dy\u014d kanji ) ; hundreds more are in everyday use . Due to post-WWII simplifications of characters in Japan as well as in China , the Chinese characters used in Japan today are distinct from those used in China in several respects . There are various national standard lists of characters , forms , and pronunciations . Simplified forms of certain characters are used in mainland China , Singapore , and Malaysia ; the corresponding traditional characters are used in Taiwan , Hong Kong , Macau , and to a limited extent in South Korea .",

It is spoken by the Taiwanese Hoklo people , who descended from immigrants from southern Fujian during the Qing dynasty . The Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b ( POJ ) romanization is a popular orthography for this variant of Hokkien . Taiwanese Hokkien is generally similar to the speeches of Amoy , Quanzhou and Zhangzhou ( branches of Chinese Minnan ) , as well as their dialectal forms used in Southeast Asia and are generally mutually intelligible . The mass popularity of Hokkien entertainment media from Taiwan has given prominence to the Taiwanese variety of Hokkien , especially since the 1980s .",

Ba-wan are initially cooked by steaming ; however , they may also be served after being deep fried to give them a skin or gently poached in oil to heat them without drying them out .",
  "/wiki/Bamboo": "Bamboos /b\u00e6m\u02c8bu\u02d0/ ( listen ) are evergreen perennial flowering plants in the subfamily Bambusoideae of the grass family Poaceae . The word bamboo comes from the Dutch or Portuguese languages , which probably borrowed it from Malay . In bamboo , as in other grasses , the internodal regions of the stem are usually hollow and the vascular bundles in the cross-section are scattered throughout the stem instead of in a cylindrical arrangement . The dicotyledonous woody xylem is also absent . The absence of secondary growth wood causes the stems of monocots , including the palms and large bamboos , to be columnar rather than tapering . Bamboos include some of the fastest-growing plants in the world , due to a unique rhizome-dependent system . Certain species of bamboo can grow 910 mm ( 36 in ) within a 24-hour period , at a rate of almost 40 mm ( 1.6 in ) an hour ( a growth around 1 mm every 90 seconds , or 1 inch every 40 minutes ) . Giant bamboos are the largest members of the grass family . Bamboos are of notable economic and cultural significance in South Asia , Southeast Asia and East Asia , being used for building materials , as a food source , and as a versatile raw product . Bamboo , like wood , is a natural composite material with a high strength-to-weight ratio useful for structures . Bamboo 's strength-to-weight ratio is similar to timber , and its strength is generally similar to a strong softwood or hardwood timber .",

Radishes are grown and consumed throughout the world , being mostly eaten raw as a crunchy salad vegetable with bite . There are numerous varieties , varying in size , flavor , color , and length of time they take to mature . Radishes owe their sharp flavor to the various chemical compounds produced by the plants , including glucosinolate , myrosinase , and isothiocyanate . They are sometimes grown as companion plants and suffer from few pests and diseases . They germinate quickly and grow rapidly , common smaller varieties being ready for consumption within a month , while larger daikon varieties take several months . Being easy to grow and quick to harvest , radishes are often planted by novice gardeners . Another use of radish is as a cover or catch crop in winter , or as a forage crop . Some radishes are grown for their seeds ; daikon , for instance , may be grown for oil production . Others are used for sprouting .",

Curry is generally prepared in a sauce . Curry dishes prepared in the southern states of India , where the word also originated , may be spiced with leaves from the curry tree . There are many varieties of dishes called 'curries ' . For example , in original traditional cuisines , the precise selection of spices for each dish is a matter of national or regional cultural tradition , religious practice , and , to some extent , family preference . Such dishes are called by specific names that refer to their ingredients , spicing , and cooking methods . Spices are used both whole and ground , cooked or raw , and they may be added at different times during the cooking process to produce different results . The main spices found in most curry powders of the Indian subcontinent are coriander , cumin , and turmeric . A wide range of additional spices may be included depending on the geographic region and the foods being included ( fish , lentils , red or white meat , rice , and vegetables ) . Curry powder , a commercially prepared mixture of spices , is largely a Western creation , dating to the 18th century . Such mixtures are commonly thought to have first been prepared by Indian merchants for sale to members of the British Colonial government and army returning to Britain . Outside of the Indian subcontinent , curry may also be used to describe the various unrelated native dishes of Island Southeast Asia , Mainland Southeast Asia , and Oceania which use coconut milk or spice pastes and are commonly eaten over rice ( like the Filipino ginataan and Thai gaeng class of dishes ) .",
  "/wiki/Deep_fried": "Deep frying ( also referred to as deep fat frying ) is a cooking method in which food is submerged in hot fat , most commonly oil , as opposed to the shallow oil used in conventional frying done in a frying pan .

Deep frying is classified as hot-fat cooking method . Typically , deep frying foods cook quickly : all sides of a food are cooked simultaneously as oil has a high rate of heat conduction . The term deep frying and many modern deep-fried foods were not invented until the 19th century , but the practice has been around for millennia . Early records and cookbooks suggest that the practice began in certain European countries before other countries adopted the practice . Deep frying is popular worldwide , with deep-fried foods accounting for a large portion of global caloric consumption .

The variety of honey produced by honey bees ( the genus Apis ) is the best-known , due to its worldwide commercial production and human consumption . Honey is collected from wild bee colonies , or from hives of domesticated bees , a practice known as beekeeping or apiculture . Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose , and has about the same relative sweetness as sucrose ( table sugar ) . It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor when used as a sweetener . Most microorganisms do not grow in honey , so sealed honey does not spoil , even after thousands of years . One tablespoonful ( 15 ml ) of honey provides 46 calories ( kcal ) of energy . Honey is regarded as safe when not taken in excessive amounts . Honey use and production have a long and varied history as an ancient activity .

  "/wiki/Iron_egg": "Iron egg ( Chinese : \u9435\u86cb ; pinyin : ti\u011bd\u00e0n ) is a special version of soy egg , a snack from Taiwan . They are considered a delicacy and originated in the Tamsui District of New Taipei City . The dish consists of small eggs that have been repeatedly stewed in a mix of spices and air-dried . The resulting eggs are dark brown on the outside , chewy in texture , and very flavourful compared to standard boiled eggs . It has been said to taste sweet , spicy and slightly salty with a concentrated egg flavour - a great snack with drinks . The eggs were supposed to have been created by the restaurateur Huang Zhangnian ( \u9ec3\u5f35\u54d6 ) serving snacks to the dock hands in the sea-side town. [ when ? ] On one rainy day with less business than usual , Huang Zhangnian had to continually recook soy eggs ( \u6ef7\u86cb ) to keep them warm after taking them out of the soy sauce broth . The recooking and drying process eventually resulted in shrunken eggs that were dark , flavourful , and chewy , which was extremely popular with the locals . Huang eventually founded a new business based on her iron egg recipe , selling them under the brand Apotiedan ( \u963f\u5a46\u9435\u86cb ; 'Grandma 's iron eggs ' ) . They can only be created by the use of chicken , pigeon or quail eggs but not from duck eggs . The popularity of iron eggs has risen and they can be found in other regions besides Taiwan , such as in Africa and the Middle East ."
