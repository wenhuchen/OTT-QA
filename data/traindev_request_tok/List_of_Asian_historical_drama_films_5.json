  "/wiki/Meiji_period": "The Meiji era ( \u660e\u6cbb , Meiji , Japanese pronunciation : [ me\ua71c\u02d0 ( d ) \u0291i ] ) is an era of Japanese history which extended from October 23 , 1868 to July 30 , 1912 . This era represents the first half of the Empire of Japan , during which period the Japanese people moved from being an isolated feudal society at risk of colonisation by European powers to the new paradigm of a modern , industrialised nation state and emergent great power , influenced by Western scientific , technological , philosophical , political , legal , and aesthetic ideas . As a result of such wholesale adoption of radically-different ideas , the changes to Japan were profound , and affected its social structure , internal politics , economy , military , and foreign relations . The period corresponded to the reign of Emperor Meiji and was succeeded upon the accession of Emperor Taish\u014d by the Taish\u014d era .",

The new emperor was a sickly man , which prompted the shift in political power from the old oligarchic group of elder statesmen ( or genr\u014d ) to the Imperial Diet of Japan and the democratic parties . Thus , the era is considered the time of the liberal movement known as the Taish\u014d democracy in Japan ; it is usually distinguished from the preceding chaotic Meiji period and the following militaristic-driven first part of the Sh\u014dwa period .",

He presided over the Meiji period , a time of rapid change that witnessed the Empire of Japan rapidly transform from an isolationist feudal state to an industrialized world power . At the time of Emperor Meiji 's birth in 1852 , Japan was an isolated , pre-industrial , feudal country dominated by the Tokugawa shogunate and the daimy\u014ds , who ruled over the country 's more than 250 decentralized domains . [ citation needed ] By the time of his death in 1912 , Japan had undergone an extensive political , economic , and social revolution and emerged as one of the great powers on the world stage . The New York Times summed up this transformation at the Emperor 's funeral in 1912 with the words : the contrast between that which preceded the funeral car and that which followed it was striking indeed . Before it went old Japan ; after it came new Japan . Since the modern era , when an Emperor of Japan dies they are given a posthumous name . Such a name is a combination of the era of which they reigned and coincides with the Emperor 's contribution to the throne whilst they were alive . Therefore , while publicly known during his life merely as The Emperor , he is historically known as Emperor Meiji after his death . [ b ] He obtained this current title in reference to the Meiji period which spanned almost the entirety of his reign .

Although there were ruling Emperors before the Meiji Restoration , the events restored practical abilities and consolidated the political system under the Emperor of Japan . The goals of the restored government were expressed by the new Emperor in the Charter Oath . The Restoration led to enormous changes in Japan 's political and social structure and spanned both the late Edo period ( often called the Bakumatsu ) and the beginning of the Meiji period .

The major theatres of operations were the Liaodong Peninsula and Mukden in Southern Manchuria and the seas around Korea , Japan and the Yellow Sea . Russia sought a warm-water port on the Pacific Ocean for its navy and for maritime trade . Vladivostok was operational only during the summer , whereas Port Arthur , a naval base in Liaodong Province leased to Russia by China , was operational all year . Since the end of the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895 , Japan feared Russian encroachment on its plans to create a sphere of influence in Korea and Manchuria . Russia had demonstrated an expansionist policy in the Siberian Far East from the reign of Ivan the Terrible in the 16th century . Seeing Russia as a rival , Japan offered to recognize Russian dominance in Manchuria in exchange for recognition of Korea as being within the Japanese sphere of influence . Russia refused and demanded Korea north of the 39th parallel to be a neutral buffer zone between Russia and Japan . The Japanese government perceived a Russian threat to their plans for expansion into Asia and chose to go to war . After negotiations broke down in 1904 , the Japanese Navy opened hostilities by attacking the Russian Eastern Fleet at Port Arthur , China , in a surprise attack . Russia suffered multiple defeats by Japan , but Tsar Nicholas II was convinced that Russia would win and chose to remain engaged in the war ; at first , to await the outcomes of certain naval battles , and later to preserve the dignity of Russia by averting a humiliating peace . Russia ignored Japan 's willingness early on to agree to an armistice and rejected the idea to bring the dispute to the Arbitration Court at The Hague .",

He ruled Italy as the prime minister from 1922 to 1943 ; he constitutionally led the country until 1925 , when he dropped the pretense of democracy and established a dictatorship . Mussolini inspired several totalitarian rulers , such as Adolf Hitler . Known as Il Duce ( The Leader ) , Mussolini was the founder of Italian Fascism . In 1912 , Mussolini had been a leading member of the National Directorate of the Italian Socialist Party ( PSI ) , but was expelled from the PSI for advocating military intervention in World War I , in opposition to the party 's stance on neutrality . Mussolini served in the Royal Italian Army during the war until he was wounded and discharged in 1917 . Mussolini denounced the PSI , his views now centering on nationalism instead of socialism and later founded the fascist movement which came to oppose egalitarianism and class conflict , instead advocating revolutionary nationalism transcending class lines . Following the March on Rome in October 1922 , Mussolini became the youngest Italian Prime Minister up to that date . After removing all political opposition through his secret police and outlawing labor strikes , Mussolini and his followers consolidated their power through a series of laws that transformed the nation into a one-party dictatorship . Within five years , Mussolini had established dictatorial authority by both legal and extraordinary means and aspired to create a totalitarian state . In 1929 , Mussolini signed the Lateran Treaty with the Vatican , ending decades of struggle between the Italian state and the Papacy , and recognized the independence of Vatican City .

  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire . War in the Balkans , the aerial Battle of Britain , the Blitz , and the long Battle of the Atlantic followed .",
  "/wiki/Cold_War": "The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the Soviet Union and the United States and their respective allies , the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc , after World War II . The period is generally considered to span the 1947 Truman Doctrine to the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union . The term cold is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers , but they each supported major regional conflicts known as proxy wars . The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by the two powers , following their temporary alliance and victory against Nazi Germany in 1945 . Whilst the Western Bloc and Eastern Bloc generally espoused the economic theories of capitalism and socialism , respectively , the conflict was mostly geopolitical in nature . Each power had a nuclear strategy that discouraged a pre-emptive attack by the other side , on the basis that such an attack would lead to the total destruction of the attacker - the doctrine of mutually assured destruction ( MAD ) . Aside from the nuclear arsenal development and conventional military deployment , the struggle for dominance was expressed via psychological warfare , massive propaganda campaigns and espionage , far-reaching embargoes , rivalry at sports events and technological competitions such as the Space Race . The West was led by the United States , a federal republic with a two-party presidential system , as well as the other First World nations of the Western Bloc that were generally liberal democratic but economically and politically entwined with a network of authoritarian states , most of which were the Western Bloc 's former colonies . [ A ] The Soviet Union was a self-declared Marxist-Leninist state that had a totalitarian government ultimately led by a committee known as the Politburo . The Communist Party of the Soviet Union ( CPSU ) had influence across the Second World . The US government supported right-wing governments and uprisings across the world , while the Soviet government funded communist parties and revolutions around the world . As nearly all the colonial states achieved independence in the period 1945-1960 , they became Third World battlefields in the Cold War .",

The attack led to the United States ' formal entry into World War II the next day . The Japanese military leadership referred to the attack as the Hawaii Operation and Operation AI , and as Operation Z during its planning . Japan intended the attack as a preventive action to keep the United States Pacific Fleet from interfering with its planned military actions in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , and the United States . Over the course of seven hours there were coordinated Japanese attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines , Guam and Wake Island and on the British Empire in Malaya , Singapore , and Hong Kong .

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Midway": "The Battle of Midway was a decisive naval battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II that took place on 4-7 June 1942 , six months after Japan 's attack on Pearl Harbor and one month after the Battle of the Coral Sea . The United States Navy under Admirals Chester W. Nimitz , Frank J. Fletcher , and Raymond A. Spruance defeated an attacking fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy under Admirals Isoroku Yamamoto , Ch\u016bichi Nagumo , and Nobutake Kond\u014d near Midway Atoll , inflicting devastating damage on the Japanese fleet that proved irreparable . Military historian John Keegan called it the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare , while naval historian Craig Symonds called it one of the most consequential naval engagements in world history , ranking alongside Salamis , Trafalgar , and Tsushima Strait , as both tactically decisive and strategically influential . The Japanese operation , like the earlier attack on Pearl Harbor , sought to eliminate the United States as a strategic power in the Pacific , thereby giving Japan a free hand in establishing its Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere . The Japanese hoped another demoralizing defeat would force the U.S. to capitulate in the Pacific War and thus ensure Japanese dominance in the Pacific . Luring the American aircraft carriers into a trap and occupying Midway was part of an overall barrier strategy to extend Japan 's defensive perimeter , in response to the Doolittle air raid on Tokyo . This operation was also considered preparatory for further attacks against Fiji , Samoa , and Hawaii itself . The plan was handicapped by faulty Japanese assumptions of the American reaction and poor initial dispositions . Most significantly , American cryptographers were able to determine the date and location of the planned attack , enabling the forewarned U.S. Navy to prepare its own ambush . Four Japanese and three American aircraft carriers participated in the battle . The four Japanese fleet carriers - Akagi , Kaga , S\u014dry\u016b and Hiry\u016b , part of the six-carrier force that had attacked Pearl Harbor six months earlier - were sunk , as was the heavy cruiser Mikuma . The U.S. lost the carrier Yorktown and the destroyer Hammann .",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Iwo_Jima": "The Battle of Iwo Jima ( 19 February - 26 March 1945 ) was a major battle in which the United States Marine Corps and Navy landed on and eventually captured the island of Iwo Jima from the Imperial Japanese Army ( IJA ) during World War II . The American invasion , designated Operation Detachment , had the goal of capturing the entire island , including the three Japanese-controlled airfields ( including the South Field and the Central Field ) , to provide a staging area for attacks on the Japanese main islands . This five-week battle comprised some of the fiercest and bloodiest fighting of the Pacific War of World War II . After the heavy losses incurred in the battle , the strategic value of the island became controversial . It was useless to the U.S. Army as a staging base and useless to the U.S. Navy as a fleet base . However , Navy Seabees rebuilt the landing strips , which were used as emergency landing strips for USAAF B-29s . The IJA positions on the island were heavily fortified , with a dense network of bunkers , hidden artillery positions , and 18 km ( 11 mi ) of tunnels . The American ground forces were supported by extensive naval artillery , and had complete air supremacy provided by U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aviators throughout the battle . Japanese combat deaths numbered three times the number of American deaths although , uniquely among Pacific War Marine battles , American total casualties ( dead and wounded ) exceeded those of the Japanese . Of the 21,000 Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima at the beginning of the battle , only 216 were taken prisoner , some of whom were captured because they had been knocked unconscious or otherwise disabled . The majority of the remainder were killed in action , although it has been estimated that as many as 3,000 continued to resist within the various cave systems for many days afterwards , eventually succumbing to their injuries or surrendering weeks later . Despite the bloody fighting and severe casualties on both sides , the American victory was assured from the start .",
  "/wiki/Hiroshima_(film)": "Hiroshima is a 1995 Japanese-Canadian war drama film directed by Koreyoshi Kurahara and Roger Spottiswoode about the decision-making processes that led to the dropping of the atomic bombs by the United States on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki toward the end of World War II . The three-hour film was made for television ( Showtime Network ) and evidently had no theatrical release , but is available on DVD for home viewing .

  "/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki": "The United States detonated two nuclear weapons over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9 , 1945 , respectively , with the consent of the United Kingdom , as required by the Quebec Agreement . The two bombings killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people , most of whom were civilians , and remain the only use of nuclear weapons in armed conflict . In the final year of World War II , the Allies prepared for a very costly invasion of the Japanese mainland . This undertaking was preceded by a conventional and firebombing campaign which devastated 67 Japanese cities . The war in Europe had concluded when Germany signed its instrument of surrender on May 8 , 1945 , and the Allies turned their full attention to the Pacific theater . The Allies called for the unconditional surrender of the Imperial Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on July 26 , 1945 , the alternative being prompt and utter destruction . Japan ignored the ultimatum and the war continued . By August 1945 , the Allies ' Manhattan Project had produced two types of atomic bombs , and the 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) was equipped with the specialized Silverplate version of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress that could deliver them from Tinian in the Mariana Islands . The Allies issued orders for atomic bombs to be used on four Japanese cities on July 25 . On August 6 , one of the modified B-29s dropped a uranium gun-type bomb ( Little Boy ) on Hiroshima . Another B-29 dropped a plutonium implosion bomb ( Fat Man ) on Nagasaki three days later . The bombs immediately devastated their targets .",

Unlike in the occupation of Germany , the Soviet Union was allowed little to no influence over Japan . This foreign presence marks the only time in Japan 's history that it has been occupied by a foreign power . At MacArthur 's insistence , Emperor Hirohito remained on the imperial throne . The wartime cabinet was replaced with a cabinet acceptable to the Allies and committed to implementing the terms of the Potsdam Declaration , which among other things called for the country to become a parliamentary democracy . Under MacArthur 's guidance , the Japanese government introduced sweeping social reforms and implemented economic reforms that recalled American New Deal priorities of the 1930s under President Roosevelt . The Japanese constitution was comprehensively overhauled and the Emperor 's theoretically-vast powers , which for many centuries had been constrained by conventions that had evolved over time , became strictly limited by law . The occupation , codenamed Operation Blacklist , was ended by the San Francisco Peace Treaty , signed on September 8 , 1951 , and effective from April 28 , 1952 , after which Japan 's sovereignty - with the exception , until 1972 , of the Ryukyu Islands - was fully restored .

The single-seat aircraft , flown by pilot Francis Gary Powers , was hit by an S-75 Dvina ( SA-2 Guideline ) surface-to-air missile and crashed near Sverdlovsk ( today 's Yekaterinburg ) . Powers parachuted safely and was captured . Initially , the US authorities acknowledged the incident as the loss of a civilian weather research aircraft operated by NASA , but were forced to admit the mission 's true purpose when a few days later the Soviet government produced the captured pilot and parts of the U-2 's surveillance equipment , including photographs of Soviet military bases taken during the mission . The incident occurred during the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower and the premiership of Nikita Khrushchev , around two weeks before the scheduled opening of an east-west summit in Paris . It caused great embarrassment to the United States and prompted a marked deterioration in its relations with the Soviet Union , already strained by the ongoing Cold War . Powers was convicted of espionage and sentenced to three years of imprisonment plus seven years of hard labor but was released two years later on 10 February 1962 during a prisoner exchange for Soviet officer Rudolf Abel .",

It is also known as The Unbroken in the United States . Shizumanu Taiy\u014d is based on a novel by Toyoko Yamasaki which centers on Hajime Onchi , an employee of NAL , a large national airline . The first part of the novel focuses on Onchi 's activity as the chairman of the employees ' union in the 1960s ; his reward for fighting for better working conditions for the staff is a series of postings abroad , to Pakistan , Iran , and finally Kenya , a destination to which the company does not even fly .

The events portrayed in the story are based upon actual events that took place at Japan Airlines .

Several politicians and JAL executives portrayed in the story are also based on real-world counterparts . JAL objected strongly to both the novel and the film , stating that they were defamatory to the airline and disrespected the victims of the actual Flight 123 .

  "/wiki/Japan_Airlines_Flight_123": "Japan Airlines Flight 123 was a scheduled domestic Japan Airlines passenger flight from Tokyo 's Haneda Airport to Osaka International Airport , Japan . On August 12 , 1985 , a Boeing 747SR operating this route suffered a sudden decompression twelve minutes into the flight and crashed in the area of Mount Takamagahara , Ueno , Gunma Prefecture , 100 kilometres ( 62 miles ; 54 nautical miles ) from Tokyo thirty-two minutes later . The crash site was on Osutaka Ridge , near Mount Osutaka . Japan 's Aircraft Accident Investigation Commission officially concluded that the rapid decompression was caused by a faulty repair by Boeing technicians after a tailstrike incident during a landing at Osaka Airport in 1978 . The rear bulkhead of the plane had been repaired with an improperly installed doubler plate , compromising the plane 's airworthiness . Cabin pressurization continued to expand and contract the improperly repaired bulkhead until the day of the accident , when the faulty repair failed , causing a rapid decompression that ripped off a large portion of the tail and caused the loss of hydraulic controls to the entire plane . The aircraft , configured with increased economy class seating , was carrying 524 people . Casualties of the crash included all 15 crew members and 505 of the 509 passengers . One of the passengers survived the initial crash but subsequently died of their injuries hours later while awaiting rescue . It is the deadliest single-aircraft accident in aviation history .",
  "/wiki/The_Troubles": "The Troubles ( Irish : Na Triobl\u00f3id\u00ed ) were an ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland during the late 20th century . Also known internationally as the Northern Ireland conflict , it is sometimes described as an irregular war or low-level war . The conflict began in the late 1960s and is usually deemed to have ended with the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 . Although the Troubles primarily took place in Northern Ireland , at times the violence spilled over into parts of the Republic of Ireland , England , and mainland Europe . The conflict was primarily political and nationalistic , fuelled by historical events . It also had an ethnic or sectarian dimension , although it was not a religious conflict . A key issue was the constitutional status of Northern Ireland . Unionists/loyalists , who were mostly Protestants , wanted Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom . Irish nationalists/republicans , who were mostly Catholics , wanted Northern Ireland to leave the United Kingdom and join a united Ireland . The conflict began during a campaign by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association to end discrimination against the Catholic/nationalist minority by the Protestant/unionist government and police force . The authorities attempted to suppress this protest campaign and were accused of police brutality ; it was also met with violence from loyalists , who alleged it was a republican front . Increasing tensions led to severe violence in August 1969 and the deployment of British troops , in what became the British Army 's longest ever operation .",
