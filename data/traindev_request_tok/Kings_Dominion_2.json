  "/wiki/Ferris_wheel": "A Ferris wheel is an amusement ride consisting of a rotating upright wheel with multiple passenger-carrying components ( commonly referred to as passenger cars , cabins , tubs , capsules , gondolas , or pods ) attached to the rim in such a way that as the wheel turns , they are kept upright , usually by gravity . Some of the largest modern Ferris wheels have cars mounted on the outside of the rim , with electric motors to independently rotate each car to keep it upright . These wheels are sometimes referred to as observation wheels and their cars referred to as capsules . However , these alternative names are also used for wheels with conventional gravity-oriented cars . The original Ferris Wheel was designed and constructed by George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. as a landmark for the 1893 World 's Columbian Exposition in Chicago . The generic term Ferris wheel , now used in American English for all such structures , has become the most common type of amusement ride at state fairs in the United States . The current tallest Ferris wheel is the 167.6-metre ( 550 ft ) High Roller in Las Vegas , Nevada , which opened to the public in March 2014 .",
  "/wiki/Geauga_Lake": "Geauga Lake was a theme park in Bainbridge Township and Aurora , Ohio , United States . Established in 1887 in what had been a local recreation area adjacent to a lake of the same name , the first amusement ride was added in 1889 , and the park 's first roller coaster - later known as the Big Dipper - was built in 1925 . In 1969 , the park was sold to Funtime , Inc. , and was expanded over the years with additional rides and amenities . Further expansion occurred in the mid and late 1990s after Funtime 's acquisition by Premier Parks in 1995 . Prior to the 2000 season , soon after Premier Parks acquired Six Flags , the park was re-branded as Six Flags Ohio and four new roller coasters were added . A year later , Six Flags bought the adjacent SeaWorld Ohio and combined the two parks under the name Six Flags Worlds of Adventure . The park changed ownership again in 2004 after a purchase by Cedar Fair . The park 's SeaWorld portion was transformed into a water park in 2005 , and together they became known as Geauga Lake and Wildwater Kingdom . On September 21 , 2007 , Cedar Fair announced the closing of the amusement park in 2008 , and that the property would operate solely as a water park under the title Wildwater Kingdom . Cedar Fair announced Wildwater Kingdom would not reopen after the 2016 season .",

  "/wiki/Wild_mouse": "A Wild Mouse roller coaster ( also Mad Mouse or Crazy Mouse ) is a type of roller coaster characterized by small cars that seat four people or fewer and ride on top of the track , taking tight , flat turns ( without banking ) at modest speeds , yet producing high lateral G-forces . The track work is characterized by many turns and bunny hops , the latter producing abrupt negative vertical G forces . When approaching a turn from a straight section , the intended impression is that one will simply continue straight , and thus plunge off of the device , this since there are no transition sections as are in a conventional high speed roller coaster track and the turn itself is obscured upon close approach . Almost all Wild Mice feature switchback sections , consisting of several of these unbanked turns , separated by straight sections . Usually the turns on the switchback section are 180\u00b0 , but some coasters feature 90\u00b0 turns as well as more rarely steep runs with loops ( for example Crazy Mouse at Tobu Zoo in Japan , which is no longer operating ) . Some riders , usually among taller people , report sustaining whiplash after being subjected to these turns . [ citation needed ] The feeling of a Wild Mouse coaster is amplified by using cars that are wider than the track itself , giving the impression that the riders are hanging off the side or that they might fly out , thus giving it the name wild . Some may include trick-track - a straight piece of track banked slightly side to side designed to throw the rider left to right . Some wild mouse coasters , such as Primeval Whirl , also have spinning cars . The modern Wild Mouse was invented by German designer Franz Mack . In the original wooden Wild Mouse coasters of the 1960s and 1970s , the cars were so small that they could only fit two adults in close contact . While the low capacity of these rides led to long lines , the cars were small by design .",

  "/wiki/Carousel": "A carousel ( American English : from French carrousel and Italian carosello ) , roundabout ( British English ) , or merry-go-round , is a type of amusement ride consisting of a rotating circular platform with seats for riders . The seats are traditionally in the form of rows of wooden horses or other animals mounted on posts , many of which are moved up and down by gears to simulate galloping , to the accompaniment of looped circus music . [ citation needed ] This leads to one of the alternative American names , the galloper ( however see direction of rotation below ) . Other popular names are jumper , horseabout , and flying horses . [ citation needed ] Carousels are commonly populated with horses , each horse weighing roughly 100 lbs ( 45 kg ) , but may include a variety of mounts , for example pigs , zebras , tigers , or mythological creatures such as dragons or unicorns . Sometimes , chair-like or bench-like seats are used , and occasionally mounts can be shaped like aeroplanes or cars . The roundabouts or merry-go-rounds installed in playgrounds are usually somewhat different devices : simple , child-powered rotating platforms with bars or handles to which children can cling while riding .",

  "/wiki/Drop_tower_(ride)": "A drop tower or big drop is a type of amusement ride incorporating a central structure or tower . Drop towers vary in height , passenger capacity , lift type , and brake type . Many are custom-made , although there are some mass-produced designs . Riders experience free-fall initially , followed by rapid heavy deceleration . With most drop towers , a gondola carrying riders is lifted to the top of a large vertical structure , then released to free-fall down the tower . Brakes activate to slow the gondola as it approaches the bottom of the ride . Some designs expand on this concept with features such as rotating gondolas , or several bounces before coming to rest . Most drop towers require child riders to exceed a minimum height ; limits vary widely depending upon the nature of the tower , with a 30-foot ( 9 m ) tower for smaller children from 37 inches ( 95 cm ) tall , and a 115-foot ( 35 m ) tower having a 51-inch ( 130 cm ) restriction . Drop towers use a magnetic braking system to slow the carriage quickly and smoothly once it reaches the bottom of the tower . This system is fail-safe because magnets do not need to be powered by electricity or other sources ; they work intrinsically by the laws of magnetism .",
