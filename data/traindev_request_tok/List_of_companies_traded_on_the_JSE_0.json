  "/wiki/Banking": "A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit . Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets . Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country , banks are highly regulated in most countries . Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities . In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity , banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards , known as the Basel Accords . Banking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways was a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world . In the history of banking , a number of banking dynasties - notably , the Medicis , the Fuggers , the Welsers , the Berenbergs , and the Rothschilds - have played a central role over many centuries . The oldest existing retail bank is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena , while the oldest existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank .",
  "/wiki/Investment_banking": "An investment bank is a financial services company or corporate division that engages in advisory-based financial transactions on behalf of individuals , corporations , and governments . Traditionally associated with corporate finance , such a bank might assist in raising financial capital by underwriting or acting as the client 's agent in the issuance of securities . An investment bank may also assist companies involved in mergers and acquisitions ( M & A ) and provide ancillary services such as market making , trading of derivatives and equity securities , and FICC services ( fixed income instruments , currencies , and commodities ) . Most investment banks maintain prime brokerage and asset management departments in conjunction with their investment research businesses . As an industry , it is broken up into the Bulge Bracket ( upper tier ) , Middle Market ( mid-level businesses ) , and boutique market ( specialized businesses ) . Unlike commercial banks and retail banks , investment banks do not take deposits . From the passage of Glass-Steagall Act in 1933 until its repeal in 1999 by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act , the United States maintained a separation between investment banking and commercial banks . Other industrialized countries , including G7 countries , have historically not maintained such a separation . As part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ( Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 ) , the Volcker Rule asserts some institutional separation of investment banking services from commercial banking . All investment banking activity is classed as either sell side or buy side . The sell side involves trading securities for cash or for other securities ( e.g . facilitating transactions , market-making ) , or the promotion of securities ( e.g .",
  "/wiki/Construction": "Construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure . Construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser , while construction typically takes place on location for a known client . Construction as an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries . Construction starts with planning , design , and financing ; it continues until the project is built and ready for use . Large-scale construction requires collaboration across multiple disciplines . A project manager normally manages the budget on the job , and a construction manager , design engineer , construction engineer or architect supervises it . Those involved with the design and execution must consider zoning requirements , environmental impact of the job , scheduling , budgeting , construction-site safety , availability and transportation of building materials , logistics , inconvenience to the public caused by construction delays and bidding . Large construction projects are sometimes referred to as megaprojects .",

  "/wiki/Pharmaceuticals": "A medication ( also referred to as medicine , pharmaceutical drug , or simply drug ) is a drug used to diagnose , cure , treat , or prevent disease . Drug therapy ( pharmacotherapy ) is an important part of the medical field and relies on the science of pharmacology for continual advancement and on pharmacy for appropriate management . Drugs are classified in multiple ways . One of the key divisions is by level of control , which distinguishes prescription drugs ( those that a pharmacist dispenses only on the order of a physician , physician assistant , or qualified nurse ) from over-the-counter drugs ( those that consumers can order for themselves ) . Another key distinction is between traditional small-molecule drugs , usually derived from chemical synthesis , and biopharmaceuticals , which include recombinant proteins , vaccines , blood products used therapeutically ( such as IVIG ) , gene therapy , monoclonal antibodies and cell therapy ( for instance , stem-cell therapies ) . Other ways to classify medicines are by mode of action , route of administration , biological system affected , or therapeutic effects . An elaborate and widely used classification system is the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System ( ATC system ) . The World Health Organization keeps a list of essential medicines . Drug discovery and drug development are complex and expensive endeavors undertaken by pharmaceutical companies , academic scientists , and governments . As a result of this complex path from discovery to commercialization , partnering has become a standard practice for advancing drug candidates through development pipelines . Governments generally regulate what drugs can be marketed , how drugs are marketed , and in some jurisdictions , drug pricing . Controversies have arisen over drug pricing and disposal of used drugs .",

The term is commonly interchanged with marketing research ; however , expert practitioners may wish to draw a distinction , in that marketing research is concerned specifically about marketing processes , while market research is concerned specifically with markets . Market research is one of the main factors used in maintaining competitiveness over competitors . Market research provides important information which helps to identify and analyze the needs of the market , the market size and the competition . Market-research techniques encompass both qualitative techniques such as focus groups , in-depth interviews , and ethnography , as well as quantitative techniques such as customer surveys , and analysis of secondary data .

  "/wiki/Chemical": "A chemical substance is a form of matter having constant chemical composition and characteristic properties . Some references add that chemical substance can not be separated into its constituent elements by physical separation methods , i.e. , without breaking chemical bonds . Chemical substances can be simple substances , chemical compounds , or alloys . Chemical elements may or may not be included in the definition , depending on expert viewpoint . Chemical substances are often called 'pure ' to set them apart from mixtures . A common example of a chemical substance is pure water ; it has the same properties and the same ratio of hydrogen to oxygen whether it is isolated from a river or made in a laboratory . Other chemical substances commonly encountered in pure form are diamond ( carbon ) , gold , table salt ( sodium chloride ) and refined sugar ( sucrose ) . However , in practice , no substance is entirely pure , and chemical purity is specified according to the intended use of the chemical . Chemical substances exist as solids , liquids , gases , or plasma , and may change between these phases of matter with changes in temperature or pressure . Chemical substances may be combined or converted to others by means of chemical reactions . Forms of energy , such as light and heat , are not matter , and are thus not substances in this regard .",

  "/wiki/Property": "Property in the abstract is what belongs to or with something , whether as an attribute or as a component of said thing . In the context of this article , it is one or more components ( rather than attributes ) , whether physical or incorporeal , of a person 's estate ; or so belonging to , as in being owned by , a person or jointly a group of people or a legal entity like a corporation or even a society . Depending on the nature of the property , an owner of property has the right to consume , alter , share , redefine , rent , mortgage , pawn , sell , exchange , transfer , give away or destroy it , or to exclude others from doing these things , as well as to perhaps abandon it ; whereas regardless of the nature of the property , the owner thereof has the right to properly use it ( as a durable , mean or factor , or whatever ) , or at the very least exclusively keep it . In economics and political economy , there are three broad forms of property : private property , public property , and collective property ( also called cooperative property ) . Property that jointly belongs to more than one party may be possessed or controlled thereby in very similar or very distinct ways , whether simply or complexly , whether equally or unequally . However , there is an expectation that each party 's will ( rather discretion ) with regard to the property be clearly defined and unconditional , [ citation needed ] so as to distinguish ownership and easement from rent . The parties might expect their wills to be unanimous , or alternately every given one of them , when no opportunity for or possibility of dispute with any other of them exists , may expect his , her , its or their own will to be sufficient and absolute . The Restatement ( First ) of Property defines property as anything , tangible or intangible whereby a legal relationship between persons and the state enforces a possessory interest or legal title in that thing . This mediating relationship between individual , property and state is called a property regime . In sociology and anthropology , property is often defined as a relationship between two or more individuals and an object , in which at least one of these individuals holds a bundle of rights over the object . The distinction between collective property and private property is regarded as a confusion since different individuals often hold differing rights over a single object . Important widely recognized types of property include real property ( the combination of land and any improvements to or on the land ) , personal property ( physical possessions belonging to a person ) , private property ( property owned by legal persons , business entities or individual natural persons ) , public property ( state owned or publicly owned and available possessions ) and intellectual property ( exclusive rights over artistic creations , inventions , etc .",
  "/wiki/Agriculture": "Agriculture is the science and art of cultivating plants and livestock . Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization , whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities . The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago . After gathering wild grains beginning at least 105,000 years ago , nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago . Pigs , sheep and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago . Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world . Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output , though about 2 billion people still depended on subsistence agriculture into the twenty-first . Modern agronomy , plant breeding , agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers , and technological developments have sharply increased yields , while causing widespread ecological and environmental damage . Selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat , but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage . Environmental issues include contributions to global warming , depletion of aquifers , deforestation , antibiotic resistance , and growth hormones in industrial meat production . Genetically modified organisms are widely used , although some are banned in certain countries . The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods , fibers , fuels and raw materials ( such as rubber ) .",

  "/wiki/Holding_company": "A holding company is a company that owns other companies ' outstanding stock . A holding company usually does not produce goods or services itself ( with no eponymous consumer-facing brand at most times ) ; rather , its purpose is to own shares of other companies to form a corporate group . However , in many jurisdiction of the world , holding companies are usually termed as parent companies who besides holding stock in other companies can conduct trade and other business activities itself . Holding companies allow the reduction of risk for the owners and can allow the ownership and control of a number of different companies . Holding companies are also created to hold assets such as IP and trade secrets that are protected from the operation company . This creates a smaller risk when it comes to litigation . In the United States , 80% of stock , in voting and value , must be owned before tax consolidation benefits such as tax-free dividends can be claimed . That is , if Company A owns 80% or more of the stock of Company B , Company A will not pay taxes on dividends paid by Company B to its stockholders , as the payment of dividends from B to A is essentially transferring cash from one company to the other . Any other shareholders of Company B will pay the usual taxes on dividends , as they are legitimate and ordinary dividends to these shareholders . Sometimes a company intended to be a pure holding company identifies itself as such by adding Holding or Holdings to its name .",
  "/wiki/Manufacturing": "Manufacturing is the production of products for use or sale using labor and machines , tools , chemical or biological processing or formulation and is the essence of secondary industry . The term may refer to a range of human activity from handicraft to high tech but is most commonly applied to industrial design , in which raw materials from primary industry are transformed into finished goods on a large scale . Such finished goods may be sold to other manufacturers for the production of other more complex products ( such as aircraft , household appliances , furniture , sports equipment or automobiles ) , or distributed via the tertiary industry to end users and consumers ( usually through wholesalers , who in turn sell to retailers , who then sell them to individual customers ) . Manufacturing engineering or manufacturing process are the steps through which raw materials are transformed into a final product . The manufacturing process begins with the product design , and materials specification from which the product is made . These materials are then modified through manufacturing processes to become the required part . Modern manufacturing includes all intermediate processes required in the production and integration of a product 's components . Some industries , such as semiconductor and steel manufacturers use the term fabrication instead . The manufacturing sector is closely connected with engineering and industrial design . Examples of major manufacturers in North America include General Motors Corporation , General Electric , Procter & Gamble , General Dynamics , Boeing , Pfizer , and Precision Castparts . Examples in Europe include Volkswagen Group , Siemens , FCA and Michelin . Examples in Asia include Toyota , Yamaha , Panasonic , LG , Samsung and Tata Motors .",

The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to human beings and is a feature of all human societies . The amount and type of clothing worn depends on gender , body type , social , and geographic considerations . Clothing serves many purposes : it can serve as protection from the elements , rough surfaces , rash-causing plants , insect bites , splinters , thorns and prickles by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment . Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions , and they can provide a hygienic barrier , keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body . Clothing also provides protection from ultraviolet radiation . Wearing clothes is also a social norm , and being deprived of clothing in front of others may be embarrassing .

  "/wiki/Loan": "In finance , a loan is the lending of money by one or more individuals , organizations , or other entities to other individuals , organizations etc . The recipient ( i.e. , the borrower ) incurs a debt and is usually liable to pay interest on that debt until it is repaid as well as to repay the principal amount borrowed . The document evidencing the debt ( e.g. , a promissory note ) will normally specify , among other things , the principal amount of money borrowed , the interest rate the lender is charging , and the date of repayment . A loan entails the reallocation of the subject asset ( s ) for a period of time , between the lender and the borrower . The interest provides an incentive for the lender to engage in the loan . In a legal loan , each of these obligations and restrictions is enforced by contract , which can also place the borrower under additional restrictions known as loan covenants . Although this article focuses on monetary loans , in practice , any material object might be lent . Acting as a provider of loans is one of the main activities of financial institutions such as banks and credit card companies . For other institutions , issuing of debt contracts such as bonds is a typical source of funding .",
  "/wiki/Finance": "Finance is the study of money and how it is used . Specifically , it deals with the questions of how an individual , company or government acquires the money needed - called capital in the company context - and how they then spend or invest that money . Finance is , correspondingly , often split into three areas : personal finance , corporate finance and public finance . At the same time , finance is about the overall system - i.e . the financial markets that allow the flow of money , via investments and other financial instruments , between and within these areas ; this flow is facilitated by the financial services sector . A major focus within finance is thus investment management - called money management for individuals , and asset management for institutions - and finance then includes the associated activities of securities trading , investment banking , financial engineering , and risk management . More abstractly , finance is concerned with the investment and deployment of assets and liabilities over space and time : i.e . it is about performing valuation and asset allocation today , based on risk and uncertainty of future outcomes , incorporating the time value of money ( determining the present value of these future values , discounting , requires a risk-appropriate discount rate ) . As an academic field , finance theory is studied and developed within the disciplines of management , ( financial ) economics , accountancy and applied mathematics . Correspondingly , given its wide application , there are several related professional qualifications , that can lead to the field . As the debate to whether finance is an art or a science is still open , there have been recent efforts to organize a list of unsolved problems in finance .",

Most of the literature on affordable housing refers to mortgages and number of forms that exist along a continuum - from emergency shelters , to transitional housing , to non-market rental ( also known as social or subsidized housing ) , to formal and informal rental , indigenous housing , and ending with affordable home ownership . In Australia , the National Affordable Housing Summit Group developed their definition of affordable housing as housing that is .reasonably adequate in standard and location for lower or middle income households and does not cost so much that a household is unlikely to be able to meet other basic needs on a sustainable basis . Affordable housing in the United Kingdom includes social rented and intermediate housing , provided to specified eligible households whose needs are not met by the market . The notion of housing affordability became widespread in the 1980s in Europe and North America .

  "/wiki/Nickel": "Nickel is a chemical element with the symbol Ni and atomic number 28 . It is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge . Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile . Pure nickel , powdered to maximize the reactive surface area , shows a significant chemical activity , but larger pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer forms on the surface and prevents further corrosion ( passivation ) . Even so , pure native nickel is found in Earth 's crust only in tiny amounts , usually in ultramafic rocks , and in the interiors of larger nickel-iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth 's atmosphere . Meteoric nickel is found in combination with iron , a reflection of the origin of those elements as major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis . An iron-nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth 's outer and inner cores . Use of nickel ( as a natural meteoric nickel-iron alloy ) has been traced as far back as 3500 BCE . Nickel was first isolated and classified as a chemical element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt , who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral , in the cobalt mines of Los , H\u00e4lsingland , Sweden . The element 's name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology , Nickel ( similar to Old Nick ) , who personified the fact that copper-nickel ores resisted refinement into copper . An economically important source of nickel is the iron ore limonite , which often contains 1-2% nickel . Nickel 's other important ore minerals include pentlandite and a mixture of Ni-rich natural silicates known as garnierite .",

  "/wiki/Welding": "Welding is a fabrication or sculptural process that joins materials , usually metals or thermoplastics , by using high heat to melt the parts together and allowing them to cool causing fusion . Welding is distinct from lower temperature metal-joining techniques such as brazing and soldering , which do not melt the base metal . In addition to melting the base metal , a filler material is typically added to the joint to form a pool of molten material ( the weld pool ) that cools to form a joint that , based on weld configuration ( butt , full penetration , fillet , etc . ) , can be stronger than the base material ( parent metal ) . Pressure may also be used in conjunction with heat , or by itself , to produce a weld . Welding also requires a form of shield to protect the filler metals or melted metals from being contaminated or oxidized . Many different energy sources can be used for welding , including a gas flame ( chemical ) , an electric arc ( electrical ) , a laser , an electron beam , friction , and ultrasound . While often an industrial process , welding may be performed in many different environments , including in open air , under water , and in outer space . Welding is a hazardous undertaking and precautions are required to avoid burns , electric shock , vision damage , inhalation of poisonous gases and fumes , and exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation . Until the end of the 19th century , the only welding process was forge welding , which blacksmiths had used for millennia to join iron and steel by heating and hammering . Arc welding and oxy-fuel welding were among the first processes to develop late in the century , and electric resistance welding followed soon after . Welding technology advanced quickly during the early 20th century as the world wars drove the demand for reliable and inexpensive joining methods ."
