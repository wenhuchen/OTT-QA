  "/wiki/United_States_Representative": "The United States House of Representatives is the lower house of the United States Congress , the Senate being the upper house . Together they compose the national legislature of the United States . The composition of the House is established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The House is composed of representatives who sit in congressional districts that are allocated to each of the 50 states on a basis of population as measured by the U.S. Census , with each district entitled to one representative . Since its inception in 1789 , all representatives have been directly elected . The total number of voting representatives is fixed by law at 435 . As of the 2010 Census , the largest delegation is that of California , with fifty-three representatives . Seven states have only one representative : Alaska , Delaware , Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota , Vermont , and Wyoming . The House is charged with the passage of federal legislation , known as bills , which , after concurrence by the Senate , are sent to the president for consideration . In addition to this basic power , the House has certain exclusive powers , among them the power to initiate all bills related to revenue ; the impeachment of federal officers , who are sent to trial before the Senate ; and , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for president , the duty falls upon the House to elect one of the top three recipients of electors for that office , with one vote given to each state for that purpose .

Located in the South Central region , Texas shares borders with the states of Louisiana to the east , Arkansas to the northeast , Oklahoma to the north , New Mexico to the west , and the Mexican states of Chihuahua , Coahuila , Nuevo Le\u00f3n , and Tamaulipas to the southwest , and has a coastline with the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast . Houston is the most populous city in Texas and the fourth largest in the U.S. , while San Antonio is the second-most populous in the state and seventh largest in the U.S. Dallas-Fort Worth and Greater Houston are the fourth and fifth largest metropolitan statistical areas in the country , respectively . Other major cities include Austin , the second-most populous state capital in the U.S. , and El Paso . Texas is nicknamed the Lone Star State for its former status as an independent republic , and as a reminder of the state 's struggle for independence from Mexico . The Lone Star can be found on the Texas state flag and on the Texas state seal . The origin of Texas 's name is from the word taysha , which means friends in the Caddo language . Due to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault , Texas contains diverse landscapes common to both the U.S. Southern and Southwestern regions . Although Texas is popularly associated with the U.S. southwestern deserts , less than 10% of Texas 's land area is desert . Most of the population centers are in areas of former prairies , grasslands , forests , and the coastline . Traveling from east to west , one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods , to rolling plains and rugged hills , and finally the desert and mountains of the Big Bend . The term six flags over Texas [ note 1 ] refers to several nations that have ruled over the territory .",

The degree was first awarded in the United States in the early 20th century and was created as a modern version of the old European doctor of law degree ( such as the Dottore in Giurisprudenza in Italy and the Juris Utriusque Doctor in Germany and central Europe ) . Originating from the 19th-century Harvard movement for the scientific study of law and first denominated LL.B. , it is a degree that in most common law jurisdictions is the primary professional preparation for lawyers . It traditionally involves a three-year program , although some U.S. law schools offer a two-year accelerated program in which students complete courses over two additional summer semesters . The LL.B . was largely replaced by the J.D . in the US in the later 20th century .",
