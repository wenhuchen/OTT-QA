  "/wiki/Restaurant": "A restaurant ( French : [ \u0281\u025bsto\u0281\u0251\u0303 ] ( listen ) ) , or an eatery , is a business that prepares and serves food and drinks to customers . Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises , but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services . Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings , including a wide variety of cuisines and service models ranging from inexpensive fast food restaurants and cafeterias , to mid-priced family restaurants , to high-priced luxury establishments . In Western countries , most mid- to high-range restaurants serve alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine . Some restaurants serve all the major meals , such as breakfast , lunch , and dinner ( e.g. , major fast food chains , diners , hotel restaurants , and airport restaurants ) . Other restaurants may serve only a single meal ( for example , a pancake house may only serve breakfast ) or they may serve two meals ( e.g. , lunch and dinner ) .",
  "/wiki/Diamond": "Diamond is a solid form of the element carbon with its atoms arranged in a crystal structure called diamond cubic . At room temperature and pressure , another solid form of carbon known as graphite is the chemically stable form , but diamond almost never converts to it . Diamond has the highest hardness and thermal conductivity of any natural material , properties that are utilized in major industrial applications such as cutting and polishing tools . They are also the reason that diamond anvil cells can subject materials to pressures found deep in the Earth . Because the arrangement of atoms in diamond is extremely rigid , few types of impurity can contaminate it ( two exceptions being boron and nitrogen ) . Small numbers of defects or impurities ( about one per million of lattice atoms ) color diamond blue ( boron ) , yellow ( nitrogen ) , brown ( defects ) , green ( radiation exposure ) , purple , pink , orange or red . Diamond also has relatively high optical dispersion ( ability to disperse light of different colors ) . Most natural diamonds have ages between 1 billion and 3.5 billion years . Most were formed at depths between 150 and 250 kilometres ( 93 and 155 mi ) in the Earth 's mantle , although a few have come from as deep as 800 kilometres ( 500 mi ) . Under high pressure and temperature , carbon-containing fluids dissolved minerals and replaced them with diamonds . Much more recently ( tens to hundreds of million years ago ) , they were carried to the surface in volcanic eruptions and deposited in igneous rocks known as kimberlites and lamproites . Synthetic diamonds can be grown from high-purity carbon under high pressures and temperatures or from hydrocarbon gas by chemical vapor deposition ( CVD ) .",

  "/wiki/Telecommunication": "Telecommunication is the transmission of signs , signals , messages , words , writings , images and sounds or information of any nature by wire , radio , optical or other electromagnetic systems . Telecommunication occurs when the exchange of information between communication participants includes the use of technology . It is transmitted through a transmission medium , such as over physical media , for example , over electrical cable , or via electromagnetic radiation through space such as radio or light . Such transmission paths are often divided into communication channels which afford the advantages of multiplexing . Since the Latin term communicatio is considered the social process of information exchange , the term telecommunications is often used in its plural form because it involves many different technologies . Early means of communicating over a distance included visual signals , such as beacons , smoke signals , semaphore telegraphs , signal flags and optical heliographs . Other examples of pre-modern long-distance communication included audio messages such as coded drumbeats , lung-blown horns , and loud whistles . 20th- and 21st-century technologies for long-distance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies , such as telegraph , telephone , and teleprinter , networks , radio , microwave transmission , optical fiber , and communications satellites . A revolution in wireless communication began in the first decade of the 20th century with the pioneering developments in radio communications by Guglielmo Marconi , who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1909 , and other notable pioneering inventors and developers in the field of electrical and electronic telecommunications . These included Charles Wheatstone and Samuel Morse ( inventors of the telegraph ) , Alexander Graham Bell ( inventor of the telephone ) , Edwin Armstrong and Lee de Forest ( inventors of radio ) , as well as Vladimir K. Zworykin , John Logie Baird and Philo Farnsworth ( some of the inventors of television ) .",
  "/wiki/Coal": "Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock , formed as rock strata called coal seams . Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements ; chiefly hydrogen , sulfur , oxygen , and nitrogen . Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years . Vast deposits of coal originate in former wetlands - called coal forests - that covered much of the Earth 's tropical land areas during the late Carboniferous ( Pennsylvanian ) and Permian times . As a fossil fuel burned for heat , coal supplies about a quarter of the world 's primary energy and two-fifths of its electricity . Some iron and steel making and other industrial processes burn coal . The extraction and use of coal causes many premature deaths and much illness . The coal industry damages the environment , including by climate change as it is the largest anthropogenic source of carbon dioxide , 14 gigatonne ( Gt ) in 2016 , which is 40% of the total fossil fuel emissions and almost 25% of total global greenhouse gas emissions . As part of the worldwide energy transition many countries have stopped using or use less coal , and the UN Secretary General has asked governments to stop building new coal plants by 2020 . To meet the Paris Agreement target of keeping global warming to well below 2 \u00b0C ( 3.6 \u00b0F ) coal use needs to halve from 2020 to 2030 . The largest consumer and importer of coal is China . China mines almost half the world 's coal , followed by India with about a tenth .",
  "/wiki/Gold": "Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au ( from Latin : aurum ) and atomic number 79 , making it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally . In its purest form , it is a bright , slightly reddish yellow , dense , soft , malleable , and ductile metal . Chemically , gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element . It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions . Gold often occurs in free elemental ( native ) form , as nuggets or grains , in rocks , in veins , and in alluvial deposits . It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver ( as electrum ) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium . Less commonly , it occurs in minerals as gold compounds , often with tellurium ( gold tellurides ) . Gold is resistant to most acids , though it does dissolve in aqua regia , a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid , which forms a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion . Gold is insoluble in nitric acid , which dissolves silver and base metals , a property that has long been used to refine gold and to confirm the presence of gold in metallic objects , giving rise to the term acid test . Gold also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide , which are used in mining and electroplating . Gold dissolves in mercury , forming amalgam alloys , but this is not a chemical reaction . A relatively rare element , gold is a precious metal that has been used for coinage , jewelry , and other arts throughout recorded history .",

  "/wiki/Food": "Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism . Food is usually of plant or animal origin , and contains essential nutrients , such as carbohydrates , fats , proteins , vitamins , or minerals . The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism 's cells to provide energy , maintain life , or stimulate growth . Historically , humans secured food through two methods : hunting and gathering and agriculture , which gave modern humans a mainly omnivorous diet . Worldwide , humanity has created numerous cuisines and culinary arts , including a wide array of ingredients , herbs , spices , techniques , and dishes . Today , the majority of the food energy required by the ever-increasing population of the world is supplied by the food industry . Food safety and food security are monitored by agencies like the International Association for Food Protection , World Resources Institute , World Food Programme , Food and Agriculture Organization , and International Food Information Council . They address issues such as sustainability , biological diversity , climate change , nutritional economics , population growth , water supply , and access to food . The right to food is a human right derived from the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights ( ICESCR ) , recognizing the right to an adequate standard of living , including adequate food , as well as the fundamental right to be free from hunger .",
  "/wiki/Healthcare": "Health care , health-care , or healthcare is the maintenance or improvement of health via the prevention , diagnosis , treatment , recovery , or cure of disease , illness , injury , and other physical and mental impairments in people . Health care is delivered by health professionals in allied health fields . Physicians and physician associates are a part of these health professionals . Dentistry , pharmacy , midwifery , nursing , medicine , optometry , audiology , psychology , occupational therapy , physical therapy , athletic training and other health professions are all part of health care . It includes work done in providing primary care , secondary care , and tertiary care , as well as in public health . Access to health care may vary across countries , communities , and individuals , influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies . Providing health care services means the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes . Factors to consider in terms of healthcare access include financial limitations ( such as insurance coverage ) , geographic barriers ( such as additional transportation costs , possibility to take paid time off of work to use such services ) , and personal limitations ( lack of ability to communicate with healthcare providers , poor health literacy , low income ) . Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services , efficacy of treatments , and overall outcome ( well-being , mortality rates ) . Health care systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations . According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , a well-functioning health care system requires a financing mechanism , a well-trained and adequately paid workforce , reliable information on which to base decisions and policies , and well maintained health facilities to deliver quality medicines and technologies . An efficient health care system can contribute to a significant part of a country 's economy , development and industrialization .",
  "/wiki/Pharmaceuticals": "A medication ( also referred to as medicine , pharmaceutical drug , or simply drug ) is a drug used to diagnose , cure , treat , or prevent disease . Drug therapy ( pharmacotherapy ) is an important part of the medical field and relies on the science of pharmacology for continual advancement and on pharmacy for appropriate management . Drugs are classified in multiple ways . One of the key divisions is by level of control , which distinguishes prescription drugs ( those that a pharmacist dispenses only on the order of a physician , physician assistant , or qualified nurse ) from over-the-counter drugs ( those that consumers can order for themselves ) . Another key distinction is between traditional small-molecule drugs , usually derived from chemical synthesis , and biopharmaceuticals , which include recombinant proteins , vaccines , blood products used therapeutically ( such as IVIG ) , gene therapy , monoclonal antibodies and cell therapy ( for instance , stem-cell therapies ) . Other ways to classify medicines are by mode of action , route of administration , biological system affected , or therapeutic effects . An elaborate and widely used classification system is the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System ( ATC system ) . The World Health Organization keeps a list of essential medicines . Drug discovery and drug development are complex and expensive endeavors undertaken by pharmaceutical companies , academic scientists , and governments . As a result of this complex path from discovery to commercialization , partnering has become a standard practice for advancing drug candidates through development pipelines . Governments generally regulate what drugs can be marketed , how drugs are marketed , and in some jurisdictions , drug pricing . Controversies have arisen over drug pricing and disposal of used drugs .",
  "/wiki/Fisheries": "Generally , a fishery is an entity engaged in raising or harvesting fish which is determined by some authority to be a fishery . According to the FAO , .a fishery is an activity leading to harvesting of fish . It may involve capture of wild fish or raising of fish through aquaculture . It is typically defined in terms of the people involved , species or type of fish , area of water or seabed , method of fishing , class of boats , purpose of the activities or a combination of the foregoing features . The definition often includes a combination of fish and fishers in a region , the latter fishing for similar species with similar gear types . Directly or indirectly , the livelihood of over 500 million people in developing countries depends on fisheries and aquaculture . Overfishing , including the taking of fish beyond sustainable levels , is reducing fish stocks and employment in many world regions . A report by Prince Charles ' International Sustainability Unit , the New York-based Environmental Defence Fund and 50in10 published in July 2014 estimated global fisheries were adding US $ 270 billion a year to global GDP , but by full implementation of sustainable fishing , that figure could rise by as much as US $ 50 billion .",

  "/wiki/Sugar": "Sugar is the generic name for sweet-tasting , soluble carbohydrates , many of which are used in food . Simple sugars , also called monosaccharides , include glucose , fructose , and galactose . Compound sugars , also called disaccharides or double sugars , are molecules composed of two monosaccharides joined by a glycosidic bond . Common examples are sucrose ( glucose + fructose ) , lactose ( glucose + galactose ) , and maltose ( two molecules of glucose ) . In the body , compound sugars are hydrolysed into simple sugars . Table sugar , granulated sugar or regular sugar refers to sucrose , a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose . Longer chains of monosaccharides are not regarded as sugars , and are called oligosaccharides or polysaccharides . Some other chemical substances , such as glycerol and sugar alcohols , may have a sweet taste , but are not classified as sugar . Sugars are found in the tissues of most plants . Honey and fruit are abundant natural sources of unbounded simple sugars . Sucrose is especially concentrated in sugarcane and sugar beet , making them ideal for efficient commercial extraction to make refined sugar . In 2016 , the combined world production of those two crops was about two billion tonnes .",
  "/wiki/Property_development": "Real estate development , or property development , is a business process , encompassing activities that range from the renovation and re-lease of existing buildings to the purchase of raw land and the sale of developed land or parcels to others . Real estate developers are the people and companies who coordinate all of these activities , converting ideas from paper to real property . Real estate development is different from construction , although many developers also manage the construction process . Developers buy land , finance real estate deals , build or have builders build projects , create , imagine , control , and orchestrate the process of development from the beginning to end . Developers usually take the greatest risk in the creation or renovation of real estate - and receive the greatest rewards . Typically , developers purchase a tract of land , determine the marketing of the property , develop the building program and design , obtain the necessary public approval and financing , build the structures , and rent out , manage , and ultimately sell it . Sometimes property developers will only undertake part of the process . For example , some developers source a property and get the plans and permits approved before selling the property with the plans and permits to a builder at a premium price . Alternatively , a developer that is also a builder may purchase a property with the plans and permits in place so that they do not have the risk of failing to obtain planning approval and can start construction on the development immediately . Developers work with many different counterparts along each step of this process , including architects , city planners , engineers , surveyors , inspectors , contractors , lawyers , leasing agents , etc . In the Town and Country Planning context in the United Kingdom , 'development ' is defined in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 s55 .",
  "/wiki/Agricultural": "Agriculture is the science and art of cultivating plants and livestock . Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization , whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities . The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago . After gathering wild grains beginning at least 105,000 years ago , nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago . Pigs , sheep and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago . Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world . Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output , though about 2 billion people still depended on subsistence agriculture into the twenty-first . Modern agronomy , plant breeding , agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers , and technological developments have sharply increased yields , while causing widespread ecological and environmental damage . Selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat , but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage . Environmental issues include contributions to global warming , depletion of aquifers , deforestation , antibiotic resistance , and growth hormones in industrial meat production . Genetically modified organisms are widely used , although some are banned in certain countries . The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods , fibers , fuels and raw materials ( such as rubber ) .",
  "/wiki/Starch": "Starch or amylum is a polymeric carbohydrate consisting of numerous glucose units joined by glycosidic bonds . This polysaccharide is produced by most green plants as energy storage . It is the most common carbohydrate in human diets and is contained in large amounts in staple foods like potatoes , wheat , maize ( corn ) , rice , and cassava . Pure starch is a white , tasteless and odorless powder that is insoluble in cold water or alcohol . It consists of two types of molecules : the linear and helical amylose and the branched amylopectin . Depending on the plant , starch generally contains 20 to 25% amylose and 75 to 80% amylopectin by weight . Glycogen , the glucose store of animals , is a more highly branched version of amylopectin . In industry , starch is converted into sugars , for example by malting , and fermented to produce ethanol in the manufacture of beer , whisky and biofuel . It is processed to produce many of the sugars used in processed foods . Mixing most starches in warm water produces a paste , such as wheatpaste , which can be used as a thickening , stiffening or gluing agent . The biggest industrial non-food use of starch is as an adhesive in the papermaking process . Starch can be applied to parts of some garments before ironing , to stiffen them .",
  "/wiki/Aluminum": "Aluminium ( aluminum in American and Canadian English ) is a chemical element with the symbol Al and atomic number 13 . It is a silvery-white , soft , non-magnetic and ductile metal in the boron group . By mass , aluminium makes up about 8% of the Earth 's crust , where it is the third most abundant element ( after oxygen and silicon ) and also the most abundant metal . Occurrence of aluminium decreases in the Earth 's mantle below , however . The chief ore of aluminium is bauxite . Aluminium metal is highly reactive , such that native specimens are rare and limited to extreme reducing environments . Instead , it is found combined in over 270 different minerals . Aluminium is remarkable for its low density and its ability to resist corrosion through the phenomenon of passivation . Aluminium and its alloys are vital to the aerospace industry and important in transportation and building industries , such as building facades and window frames . The oxides and sulfates are the most useful compounds of aluminium . Despite its prevalence in the environment , no known form of life uses aluminium salts metabolically , but aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals . Because of these salts ' abundance , the potential for a biological role for them is of continuing interest , and studies continue .",
  "/wiki/Department_store": "A department store is a retail establishment offering a wide range of consumer goods in different product categories known as departments . In modern major cities , the department store made a dramatic appearance in the middle of the 19th century , and permanently reshaped shopping habits , and the definition of service and luxury . Similar developments were under way in London ( with Whiteleys ) , in Paris ( Le Bon March\u00e9 in 1852 ) and in New York ( with Stewart 's ) . Today , departments often include the following : clothing , furniture , home appliances , toys , cosmetics , houseware , gardening , toiletries , sporting goods , do it yourself , paint , and hardware . Additionally , other lines of products such as food , books , jewelry , electronics , stationery , photographic equipment , baby products , and products for pets are sometimes included . Customers generally check out near the front of the store , although some stores include sales counters within each department . Some stores are one of many within a larger retail chain , while others are independent retailers . In the 1970s , they came under heavy pressure from discounters , and have come under even heavier pressure from e-commerce sites since 2010 . Big-box stores , hypermarkets , and discount stores are comparable to historical department stores .",

This matters for the fiduciary duties owed by the board of directors and the equitable ownership of the fund 's assets . In the United Kingdom , the term investment trust has a strict meaning under tax law . However , the term is more commonly used within the UK to include any closed-ended investment company , including venture capital trusts ( VCTs ) . The Association of Investment Companies is the trade association representing investment trusts and VCTs . In Japan , investment trusts are called trust accounts ( \u4fe1\u8a17\u53e3 , shintaku-guchi ) ; the largest stockholder of many public companies are usually trust banks handling the investment trusts , the largest being the Japan Trustee Services Bank , The Master Trust Bank of Japan and the Trust & Custody Services Bank .",

An information technology system ( IT system ) is generally an information system , a communications system or , more specifically speaking , a computer system - including all hardware , software and peripheral equipment - operated by a limited group of users . Humans have been storing , retrieving , manipulating , and communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC , but the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review ; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented that the new technology does not yet have a single established name . We shall call it information technology ( IT ) . Their definition consists of three categories : techniques for processing , the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making , and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs .

  "/wiki/Fashion": "Fashion is a popular aesthetic expression at a certain time and in a certain context , especially in clothing , footwear , lifestyle , accessories , makeup , hairstyle and body proportions . Whereas a trend often connotes a very specific aesthetic expression , and often lasting shorter than a season , fashion is a distinctive and industry-supported expression traditionally tied to the fashion season and collections . Style is an expression that lasts over many seasons and is often connected to cultural movements and social markers , symbols , class and culture ( ex . Baroque , Rococo , etc. ) . According to sociologist Pierre Bourdieu , fashion connotes the latest fashion , the latest difference . Even though they are often used together , the term fashion differs from clothes and costume , where the first describes the material and technical garment , whereas the second has been relegated to special senses like fancy-dress or masquerade wear . Fashion instead describes the social and temporal system that activates dress as a social signifier in a certain time and context . Philosopher Giorgio Agamben connects fashion to the current intensity of the qualitative moment , to the temporal aspect the Greek called kairos , whereas clothes belong to the quantitative , to what the Greek called chronos . Exclusive brands aspire for the label haute couture , but the term is technically limited to members of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture in Paris . With increasing mass-production of consumer commodities at cheaper prices , and with global reach , sustainability has become an urgent issue amongst politicians , brands and consumers .",
  "/wiki/Apparel": "Clothing ( also known as clothes , apparel and attire ) is items worn on the body . Clothing is typically made of fabrics or textiles but over time has included garments made from animal skin or other thin sheets of materials put together . The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to human beings and is a feature of all human societies . The amount and type of clothing worn depends on gender , body type , social , and geographic considerations . Clothing serves many purposes : it can serve as protection from the elements , rough surfaces , rash-causing plants , insect bites , splinters , thorns and prickles by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment . Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions , and they can provide a hygienic barrier , keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body . Clothing also provides protection from ultraviolet radiation . Wearing clothes is also a social norm , and being deprived of clothing in front of others may be embarrassing . In most parts of the world , not wearing clothes in public so that genitals , breasts or buttocks are visible could be considered indecent exposure .",
  "/wiki/Retail": "Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to earn a profit . Retailers satisfy demand identified through a supply chain . The term retailer is typically applied where a service provider fills the small orders of many individuals , who are end-users , rather than large orders of a small number of wholesale , corporate or government clientele . Shopping generally refers to the act of buying products . Sometimes this is done to obtain final goods , including necessities such as food and clothing ; sometimes it takes place as a recreational activity . Recreational shopping often involves window shopping and browsing : it does not always result in a purchase . Retail markets and shops have a very ancient history , dating back to antiquity . Some of the earliest retailers were itinerant peddlers . Over the centuries , retail shops were transformed from little more than rude booths to the sophisticated shopping malls of the modern era . Most modern retailers typically make a variety of strategic level decisions including the type of store , the market to be served , the optimal product assortment , customer service , supporting services and the store 's overall market positioning . Once the strategic retail plan is in place , retailers devise the retail mix which includes product , price , place , promotion , personnel , and presentation . In the digital age , an increasing number of retailers are seeking to reach broader markets by selling through multiple channels , including both bricks and mortar and online retailing ."
