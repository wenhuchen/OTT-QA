[ XIII ] The metropolitan area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea , and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean . It is bordered by Belgium , Luxembourg and Germany to the northeast , Switzerland and Italy to the east , and Andorra and Spain to the south . The overseas territories include French Guiana in South America and several islands in the Atlantic , Pacific and Indian oceans . The country 's 18 integral regions ( five of which are situated overseas ) span a combined area of 643,801 square kilometres ( 248,573 sq mi ) and a total population of 67.02 million ( as of July 2019 [ update ] ) .

  "/wiki/Sculpture": "Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions . It is one of the plastic arts . Durable sculptural processes originally used carving ( the removal of material ) and modelling ( the addition of material , as clay ) , in stone , metal , ceramics , wood and other materials but , since Modernism , there has been an almost complete freedom of materials and process . A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving , assembled by welding or modelling , or molded or cast . Sculpture in stone survives far better than works of art in perishable materials , and often represents the majority of the surviving works ( other than pottery ) from ancient cultures , though conversely traditions of sculpture in wood may have vanished almost entirely . However , most ancient sculpture was brightly painted , and this has been lost . Sculpture has been central in religious devotion in many cultures , and until recent centuries large sculptures , too expensive for private individuals to create , were usually an expression of religion or politics . Those cultures whose sculptures have survived in quantities include the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean , India and China , as well as many in Central and South America and Africa . The Western tradition of sculpture began in ancient Greece , and Greece is widely seen as producing great masterpieces in the classical period . During the Middle Ages , Gothic sculpture represented the agonies and passions of the Christian faith . The revival of classical models in the Renaissance produced famous sculptures such as Michelangelo 's David . Modernist sculpture moved away from traditional processes and the emphasis on the depiction of the human body , with the making of constructed sculpture , and the presentation of found objects as finished art works .",

The copper statue , a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States , was designed by French sculptor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi and its metal framework was built by Gustave Eiffel . The statue was dedicated on October 28 , 1886 . The Statue of Liberty is a figure of Libertas , a robed Roman liberty goddess . She holds a torch above her head with her right hand , and in her left hand carries a tabula ansata inscribed in Roman numerals with JULY IV MDCCLXXVI ( July 4 , 1776 ) , the date of the U.S . Declaration of Independence . A broken shackle and chain lie at her feet as she walks forward , commemorating the recent national abolition of slavery . After its dedication , the statue became an icon of freedom and of the United States ; it has been a welcoming sight to immigrants arriving by sea . Bartholdi was inspired by a French law professor and politician , \u00c9douard Ren\u00e9 de Laboulaye , who is said to have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to U.S. independence would properly be a joint project of the French and U.S. peoples . Because of the post-war instability in France , work on the statue did not commence until the early 1870s . In 1875 , Laboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue and the U.S. provide the site and build the pedestal . Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed , and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions .",

Burr served as a Continental Army officer in the American Revolutionary War , after which he became a successful lawyer and politician . He was elected twice to the New York State Assembly ( 1784-1785 , 1798-1799 ) , was appointed New York State Attorney General ( 1789-1791 ) , was chosen as a U.S. senator ( 1791-1797 ) from the State of New York , and reached the apex of his career as vice president .

  "/wiki/List_of_Vice_Presidents_of_the_United_States": "There have been 48 vice presidents of the United States since the office came into existence in 1789 . Originally , the vice president was the person who received the second most votes for president in the Electoral College . However , in the election of 1800 a tie in the electoral college between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr led to the selection of the president by the House of Representatives . To prevent such an event from happening again , the Twelfth Amendment was added to the Constitution , creating the current system where electors cast a separate ballot for the vice presidency . The vice president is the first person in the presidential line of succession and assumes that presidency if the president dies , resigns , or is impeached and removed from office . Nine vice presidents have ascended to the presidency in this way : eight ( John Tyler , Millard Fillmore , Andrew Johnson , Chester A. Arthur , Theodore Roosevelt , Calvin Coolidge , Harry S. Truman , and Lyndon B. Johnson ) through the president 's death and one ( Gerald Ford ) through the president 's resignation . In addition , the vice president serves as the president of the Senate and may choose to cast a tie-breaking vote on decisions made by the Senate . Vice presidents have exercised this latter power to varying extents over the years . Prior to adoption of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967 , an intra-term vacancy in the office of the vice president could not be filled until the next post-election inauguration . Several such vacancies occurred - seven vice presidents died , one resigned and eight succeeded to the presidency . This amendment allowed for a vacancy to be filled through appointment by the president and confirmation by both chambers of the Congress . Since its ratification , the vice presidency has been vacant twice ( both in the context of scandals surrounding the Nixon administration ) and was filled both times through this process , namely in 1973 following Spiro Agnew 's resignation , and again in 1974 after Gerald Ford succeeded to the presidency .",

In this capacity , the vice president is empowered to preside over Senate deliberations , but may not vote except to cast a tie-breaking vote . The vice president also presides over joint sessions of Congress . The vice president is indirectly elected together with the president to a four-year term of office by the people of the United States through the Electoral College . Section 2 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment , ratified in 1967 , created a mechanism for intra-term vice presidential succession , establishing that vice presidential vacancies will be filled by the president and confirmed by both houses of Congress . Prior to 1967 , in the event a vice president succeeded to the presidency , died , or resigned from office , the vice presidency remained vacant until the next presidential and vice presidential terms began . The vice president is also a statutory member of the National Security Council , and the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution . The Office of the Vice President assists and organises the vice president 's official functions . The role of the vice presidency has changed dramatically since the office was created during the 1787 constitutional Convention . Especially over the past 100 years , the vice presidency has evolved into a position of domestic and foreign policy political power , and is now widely seen as an integral part of a president 's administration . As the vice president 's role within the executive branch has expanded , his role within the legislative branch has contracted ; for example , he presides over the Senate only infrequently .",
  "/wiki/Bulls_Ferry": "Bulls Ferry ( also Bull 's Ferry ) is an area along the Hudson River , just north of Weehawken Port Imperial in the towns of West New York , Guttenberg and North Bergen in New Jersey . It takes its name from a pre-Revolutionary settlement belonging to the Bull family , who operated a row-and-sail ferry to the burgeoning city of New York across the river . During the Revolutionary War , the British built and occupied a blockhouse in the area of Bull 's Ferry , an area known to the British as Block House Point . This fort was the site of several skirmishes between the British and American forces . Brigadier General Anthony Wayne led American troops from New Bridge on a raid against the blockhouse on July 20 , 1780 , in the Battle of Bull 's Ferry . After the raid , the blockhouse was abandoned when British troops decamped to the fort at Bergen Neck . Like Burdett 's Landing to the north , Bull 's Ferry was a crucial crossing point well into the 19th century . Ferry service continued for several decades until steam ferries , notably from Hoboken , replaced the earlier , brute-force rowing service . Larger terminals to the north at Edgewater and south at the West Shore Railroad Terminal operated until the 1950s . Modern ferries still commute to Manhattan out of Port Imperial in Weehawken , Hoboken and Paulus Hook in Jersey City ( as well as Sandy Hook on the Jersey shore ) .

( The canal was sometimes called the Morris and Essex Canal , in error , due to confusion with the nearby and unrelated Morris and Essex Railroad . ) With a total elevation change of more than 900 feet ( 270 m ) , the canal was considered an ingenious technological marvel for its use of water-driven inclined planes , the first in the United States , to cross the northern New Jersey hills . [ a ] It was built primarily to move coal to industrializing eastern cities that had stripped their environs of wood . [ b ] Completed to Newark in 1831 , the canal was extended eastward to Jersey City between 1834 and 1836 . In 1839 , hot blast technology was married to blast furnaces fired entirely using anthracite , allowing the continuous high-volume production of plentiful anthracite pig iron . The Morris Canal eased the transportation of anthracite from Pennsylvania 's Lehigh Valley to northern New Jersey 's growing iron industry and other developing industries adopting steam power in New Jersey and the New York City area . It also carried minerals and iron ore westward to blast furnaces in western New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania ( famously , Allentown and Bethlehem ) until the development of Great Lakes iron ore caused the trade to decline . The Morris Canal remained in heavy use through the 1860s . But railroads had begun to eclipse canals in the United States , and in 1871 , it was leased to the Lehigh Valley Railroad . Like many enterprises that depended on anthracite , the canal 's revenues dried up with the rise of oil fuels and truck transport . It was taken over by the state of New Jersey in 1922 , and formally abandoned in 1924 .",
