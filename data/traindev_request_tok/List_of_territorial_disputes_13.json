Approximately 70 to 80 percent of the country 's citizens identify as Turkish , while Kurds are the largest minority at anywhere from 15 to 20 percent of the population . At various points in its history , the region has been inhabited by diverse civilisations including the Assyrians , Greeks , Thracians , Phrygians , Urartians , and Armenians . Hellenization started during the era of Alexander the Great and continued into the Byzantine era . The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , and their victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 symbolises the start and foundation of Turkey . The Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243 , when it disintegrated into small principalities called beyliks . Beginning in the late 13th century , the Ottomans started uniting beyliks and conquering the Balkans . After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople in 1453 , Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I . During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent the Ottoman Empire encompassed much of Southeast Europe , West Asia and North Africa and became a world power .",

Its population is approximately 10.7 million as of 2018 ; Athens , the nation 's capital , is its largest city , followed by Thessaloniki . Situated on the southern tip of the Balkan Peninsula , Greece is located at the crossroads of Europe , Asia , and Africa . It shares land borders with Albania to the northwest , North Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north , and Turkey to the northeast . The Aegean Sea lies to the east of the mainland , the Ionian Sea to the west , the Cretan Sea and the Mediterranean Sea to the south . Greece has the longest coastline on the Mediterranean Basin and the 11th longest coastline in the world at 13,676 km ( 8,498 mi ) in length , featuring many islands , of which 227 are inhabited . Eighty percent of Greece is mountainous , with Mount Olympus being the highest peak at 2,918 metres ( 9,573 ft ) . The country consists of nine traditional geographic regions : Macedonia , Central Greece , the Peloponnese , Thessaly , Epirus , the Aegean Islands ( including the Dodecanese and Cyclades ) , Thrace , Crete , and the Ionian Islands . Greece is considered the cradle of Western civilisation , being the birthplace of democracy , Western philosophy , Western literature , historiography , political science , major scientific and mathematical principles , Western drama and the Olympic Games . From the eighth century B.C. , the Greeks were organised into various independent city-states , known as poleis ( singular polis ) , which spanned the entire Mediterranean region and the Black Sea . Philip of Macedon united most of the Greek mainland in the fourth century BC , with his son Alexander the Great rapidly conquering much of the ancient world , from the eastern Mediterranean to India . Greece was annexed by Rome in the second century B.C. , becoming an integral part of the Roman Empire and its successor , the Byzantine Empire , which adopted the Greek language and culture .",
  "/wiki/Treaty_of_S\u00e8vres": "The Treaty of S\u00e8vres ( French : Trait\u00e9 de S\u00e8vres ) was one of a series of treaties that the Central Powers signed with the Allied Powers after their defeat in World War I. Hostilities had already ended with the Armistice of Mudros . The treaty was signed on 10 August 1920 , in an exhibition room at the Manufacture nationale de S\u00e8vres porcelain factory in S\u00e8vres , France . The S\u00e8vres treaty marked the beginning of the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire , and its dismemberment . The terms it stipulated included the renunciation of all non-Turkish territory and its cession to the Allied administration . Notably , the ceding of Eastern Mediterranean lands allowed the creation of new forms of government , including the British Mandate for Palestine and the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon . The terms of the treaty stirred hostility and nationalist feeling amongst Turks . The signatories of the treaty were stripped of their citizenship by the Grand National Assembly led by Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk , and this ignited the Turkish War of Independence . In that war , Atat\u00fcrk led the Turkish nationalists to defeat the combined armies of the signatories of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres , including the remnants of the Ottoman Empire . In a new treaty , that of Lausanne in 1923 , Turkish sovereignty was preserved through the establishment of the Republic of Turkey .",

It was founded at the end of the 13th century in northwestern Anatolia in the town of S\u00f6\u011f\u00fct ( modern-day Bilecik Province ) by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman I . Although initially the dynasty was of Turkic origin , it was Persianised in terms of language , culture , literature and habits . After 1354 , the Ottomans crossed into Europe , and with the conquest of the Balkans , the Ottoman beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire . The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror . During the 16th and 17th centuries , at the height of its power under the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent , the Ottoman Empire was a multinational , multilingual empire controlling most of Southeast Europe , parts of Central Europe , Western Asia , parts of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus , North Africa and the Horn of Africa . At the beginning of the 17th century , the empire contained 32 provinces and numerous vassal states . Some of these were later absorbed into the Ottoman Empire , while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries . [ note 7 ] With Constantinople as its capital and control of lands around the Mediterranean Basin , the Ottoman Empire was at the centre of interactions between the Eastern and Western worlds for six centuries . While the empire was once thought to have entered a period of decline following the death of Suleiman the Magnificent , this view is no longer supported by the majority of academic historians . The empire continued to maintain a flexible and strong economy , society and military throughout the 17th and much of the 18th century . However , during a long period of peace from 1740 to 1768 , the Ottoman military system fell behind that of their European rivals , the Habsburg and Russian empires .",

His leadership undertook sweeping progressive reforms , which modernized Turkey into a secular , industrial nation . Ideologically a secularist and nationalist , his policies and theories became known as Kemalism . Due to his military and political accomplishments , Atat\u00fcrk is regarded according to studies as one of the greatest leaders of the 20th century . Atat\u00fcrk came to prominence for his role in securing the Ottoman Turkish victory at the Battle of Gallipoli ( 1915 ) during World War I . Following the defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire , he led the Turkish National Movement , which resisted the mainland Turkey 's partition among the victorious Allied powers . Establishing a provisional government in the present-day Turkish capital Ankara , he defeated the forces sent by the Allies , thus emerging victorious from what was later referred to as the Turkish War of Independence . He subsequently proceeded to abolish the decrepit Ottoman Empire and proclaimed the foundation of the Turkish Republic in its place . As the president of the newly formed Turkish Republic , Atat\u00fcrk initiated a rigorous program of political , economic , and cultural reforms with the ultimate aim of building a modern , progressive , and secular nation-state . He made primary education free and compulsory , opening thousands of new schools all over the country . He also introduced the Latin-based Turkish alphabet , replacing the old Ottoman Turkish alphabet .

Most of these were the Protestant descendants of colonists from Great Britain . However , a significant minority , mostly Catholics , were nationalists who wanted a united Ireland independent of British rule . Today , the former generally see themselves as British and the latter generally see themselves as Irish , while a distinct Northern Irish or Ulster identity is claimed both by a large minority of Catholics and Protestants and by many of those who are non-aligned .

It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas .",

Excluding Crimea , Ukraine has a population of about 42 million , making it the 32nd most populous country in the world . Its capital and largest city is Kiev . Ukrainian is the official language and its alphabet is Cyrillic . The dominant religion in the country is Eastern Orthodoxy . The territory of modern Ukraine has been inhabited since 32,000 BC . During the Middle Ages , the area was a key centre of East Slavic culture , with the powerful state of Kievan Rus ' forming the basis of Ukrainian identity . Following its fragmentation in the 13th century , the territory was contested , ruled and divided by a variety of powers , including the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , Austria-Hungary , the Ottoman Empire and Russia . A Cossack republic emerged and prospered during the 17th and 18th centuries , but its territory was eventually split between Poland and the Russian Empire .",

The territory included Vilnius , the historical capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania . Lithuania , after declaring independence from the Russian Empire , claimed the Vilnius Region based on this historical legacy . Poland argued for the right of self-determination of the local Poles . As a result , throughout the interwar period the control over the area was disputed between Poland and Lithuania . The Soviet Union recognized it as part of Lithuania in the Soviet-Lithuanian Treaty of 1920 , but in 1920 it was seized by Poland and became part of short lived puppet state of Central Lithuania , and was subsequently incorporated into the Second Polish Republic . Direct military conflicts ( Polish-Lithuanian War and \u017beligowski 's Mutiny ) were followed up by fruitless negotiations in the League of Nations . After the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939 , as part of the Soviet fulfillment of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact , the entire region came under Soviet control . About one fifth of the region , including Vilnius , was ceded to Lithuania by the Soviet Union on October 10 , 1939 in exchange for Soviet military bases within the territory of Lithuania .

  "/wiki/Lithuania": "The first known record of the name of Lithuania ( Lithuanian : Lietuva ) is in a 9 March 1009 story of Saint Bruno in the Quedlinburg Chronicle . The Chronicle recorded a Latinized form of the name Lietuva : Litua ( pronounced [ litua ] ) . Due to the lack of reliable evidence , the true meaning of the name is unknown . Nowadays , scholars still debate the meaning of the word and there are a few plausible versions . Since Lietuva has a suffix ( -uva ) , the original word should have no suffix . [ citation needed ] A likely candidate is Liet\u0101 . Because many Baltic ethnonyms originated from hydronyms , linguists have searched for its origin among local hydronyms . Usually , such names evolved through the following process : hydronym \u2192 toponym \u2192 ethnonym . Lietava , a small river not far from Kernav\u0117 , the core area of the early Lithuanian state and a possible first capital of the eventual Grand Duchy of Lithuania , is usually credited as the source of the name . However , the river is very small and some find it improbable that such a small and local object could have lent its name to an entire nation .

Russia sought to cross Poland in order to stimulate a Europe-wide communist revolution . Poland 's Chief of State , J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski , felt the time was right to expand Polish borders as far east as feasible , to be followed by a Polish-led Intermarium federation of Central and Eastern European states , as a bulwark against the re-emergence of German and Russian imperialism . Vladimir Lenin saw Poland as the bridge the Red Army had to cross to assist other Communist movements and bring about more European revolutions . By 1919 , Polish forces had taken control of much of Western Ukraine , emerging victorious from the Polish-Ukrainian War . The West Ukrainian People 's Republic , led by Yevhen Petrushevych , had tried to create a Ukrainian state on territories to which both Poles and Ukrainians laid claim . In the Russian part of Ukraine Symon Petliura tried to defend and strengthen the Ukrainian People 's Republic but as the Bolsheviks began to win the Russian Civil War , they started to advance westward towards the disputed Ukrainian territories , causing Petliura 's forces to retreat to Podolia . By the end of 1919 , a clear front had formed as Petliura decided to ally with Pi\u0142sudski . Border skirmishes escalated following Pi\u0142sudski 's Kiev Offensive in April 1920 . The Polish offensive was met by a successful Red Army counter-attack .

These checks were enacted by a legislature ( sejm ) controlled by the nobility ( szlachta ) .

As a result , many western countries continued to recognize Lithuania as an independent , sovereign de jure state subject to international law , represented by the legations appointed by the pre-1940 Baltic states , which functioned in various places through the Lithuanian Diplomatic Service . On 18 May 1989 , the Lithuanian SSR declared itself to be a sovereign state , though still part of the USSR . On 11 March 1990 , the Republic of Lithuania was re-established as an independent state . Considered illegal by the Soviet authorities , the country was recognized by western powers immediately prior to the breakup of the Soviet Union . The Soviet Union itself recognized Lithuanian independence on 6 September 1991 .",
  "/wiki/Polish_population_transfers_(1944-1946)": "The Polish population transfers in 1944-46 from the eastern half of prewar Poland ( also known as the expulsions of Poles from the Kresy macroregion ) , refer to the forced migrations of Poles toward the end - and in the aftermath - of World War II . These were the result of Soviet Union policy that was ratified by its Allies . Similarly the Soviet Union had enforced policy between 1939 and 1941 , that targeted and expelled ethnic Poles residing in the Soviet zone of occupation following the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland . The second wave of expulsions resulted from the retaking of Poland by the Red Army during the Soviet counter-offensive . It took over territory for its republic of Ukraine , a shift that was ratified at the end of World War II by the Soviet Union 's then Allies of the West . The postwar population transfers , targeting Polish nationals , were part of an official Soviet policy that affected more than one million Polish citizens , who were removed in stages from the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union . After the war , following Soviet demands laid out during the Tehran Conference of 1943 , the Kresy macroregion was formally incorporated into the Ukrainian , Belarusian and Lithuanian Republics of the Soviet Union . This was agreed at the Potsdam Conference of Allies in 1945 , to which the acting Government of the Republic of Poland in exile was not invited . The ethnic displacement of Poles ( and also of ethnic Germans , covered in a separate article ) was agreed to by the Allied leaders : Winston Churchill of the United Kingdom , Franklin D. Roosevelt of the U.S. , and Joseph Stalin of the USSR , during the conferences at both Tehran and Yalta . The Polish transfers were among the largest of several post-war expulsions in Central and Eastern Europe , which displaced a total of about twenty million people . According to official data , during the state-controlled expulsion between 1945 and 1946 , roughly 1,167,000 Poles left the westernmost republics of the Soviet Union , less than 50% of those who registered for population transfer . Another major ethnic Polish transfer took place after Stalin 's death , in 1955-1959 .",
  "/wiki/Repatriation_of_Poles_(1955-1959)": "Repatriation of Polish population in the years of 1955-1959 ( also known as the second repatriation , to distinguish it from the first repatriation in the years 1944-1946 ) was the second wave of forced repatriation ( in fact , deportation ) of the Poles living in the territories annexed by the Soviet Union ( see Kresy Wschodnie ) . It should be stressed that the widely used term repatriation , promoted by decades of Polish communist propaganda , is a kind of manipulation and refers to an act of illegal expatriation .",
  "/wiki/Fall_of_the_Soviet_Union": "The dissolution of the Soviet Union [ a ] was the process of internal disintegration within the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR ) , also referred to as the Soviet Union , which began in the second half of the 1980s with growing unrest in the national republics and ended on 26 December 1991 , when the USSR itself was voted out of existence by the Supreme Soviet , following the Belavezha Accords . Declaration number 142-\u041d by the Supreme Soviet resulted in self-governing independence to the Republics of the USSR , formally dissolving the USSR . The declaration acknowledged the independence of the former Soviet republics and created the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) , although five of the signatories ratified it much later or did not do so at all . On the previous day , 25 December , Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev , the eighth and final leader of the USSR , resigned , declared his office extinct and handed over its powers - including control of the Soviet nuclear missile launching codes - to Russian President Boris Yeltsin . That evening at 7:32 p.m. , the Soviet flag was lowered from the Kremlin for the last time and replaced with the pre-revolutionary Russian flag . Previously , from August to December , all the individual republics , including Russia itself , had either seceded from the union or at the very least denounced the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR . The week before formal dissolution , eleven republics signed the Alma-Ata Protocol formally establishing the CIS and declaring that the USSR had ceased to exist . Both the Revolutions of 1989 and the dissolution of the USSR also marked the end of the Cold War . Several of the former Soviet republics have retained close links with the Russian Federation and formed multilateral organizations such as the Commonwealth of Independent States , Eurasian Economic Community , the Union State , the Eurasian Customs Union and the Eurasian Economic Union to enhance economic and security cooperation . On the other hand , the Baltic states have joined NATO and the European Union .",
  "/wiki/Act_of_the_Re-Establishment_of_the_State_of_Lithuania": "The Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania or Act of March 11 ( Lithuanian : Aktas d\u0117l Lietuvos nepriklausomos valstyb\u0117s atstatymo ) was an independence declaration by Lithuania adopted on March 11 , 1990 , signed by all members of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania led by S\u0105j\u016bdis . The act emphasized restoration and legal continuity of the interwar-period Lithuania , which was occupied by the USSR and lost independence in June 1940 . It was the first time that an occupied state declared independence from the dissolving Soviet Union .",
  "/wiki/Passetto_di_Borgo": "The Passetto di Borgo , or simply Passetto , is an elevated passage that links the Vatican City with the Castel Sant'Angelo . It is an approximately 800 metres ( 2,600 ft ) long corridor , located in the rione of Borgo . It was erected in 1277 by Pope Nicholas III , but parts of the wall were built by Totila during the Gothic War . On at least two occasions it served as an escape route for Popes in danger . Pope Alexander VI crossed it in 1494 , when Charles VIII invaded the city and the pope 's life was in peril . Clement VII escaped to safety through this passage during the Sack of Rome in 1527 , when troops of the Holy Roman Emperor , Charles V , massacred almost the entire Swiss Guard on the steps of St Peter 's Basilica .",
  "/wiki/Vatican_City": "Vatican City ( /\u02c8v\u00e6t\u026ak\u0259n/ ( listen ) ) , officially Vatican City State ( Italian : Stato della Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano ; [ d ] Latin : Status Civitatis Vaticanae ) , [ e ] [ f ] is an independent city-state enclaved within Rome , Italy . Established with the Lateran Treaty ( 1929 ) , it is distinct from , yet under full ownership , exclusive dominion , and sovereign authority and jurisdiction of the Holy See ( Latin : Sancta Sedes ) . [ g ] With an area of 44 hectares ( 110 acres ) , and a population of about 1,000 , it is the smallest sovereign state in the world by both area and population . The Vatican City is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state ( a type of theocracy ) ruled by the pope who is the bishop of Rome and head of the Catholic Church . The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of various national origins . Since the return of the popes from Avignon in 1377 , they have generally resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City , although at times residing instead in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere . The Holy See dates back to early Christianity , and is the primate episcopal see of the Catholic Church , with 1.3 billion Catholic Christians around the world distributed in the Latin Church and 23 Eastern Catholic Churches . The independent Vatican City-state , on the other hand , came into existence on 11 February 1929 by the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy , which spoke of it as a new creation , not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States ( 756-1870 ) , which had previously encompassed much of central Italy . Within the Vatican City are religious and cultural sites such as St. Peter 's Basilica , the Sistine Chapel , and the Vatican Museums . They feature some of the world 's most famous paintings and sculptures . The unique economy of Vatican City is supported financially by the sale of postage stamps and souvenirs , fees for admission to museums , and sales of publications .",
  "/wiki/Holy_See": "The Holy See ( Latin : Sancta Sedes , Ecclesiastical Latin : [ \u02c8sa\u014bkta \u02c8sedes ] ; Italian : Santa Sede [ \u02c8santa \u02c8s\u025b\u02d0de ] ) , also called the See of Rome , is the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome , known as the pope , which includes the apostolic episcopal see of the Diocese of Rome with universal ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the worldwide Catholic Church , as well as a sovereign entity of international law . Founded in the first century by Saints Peter and Paul , by virtue of Petrine and papal primacy according to Catholic tradition , it is the focal point of full communion for Catholic Christians around the world . As a sovereign entity , the Holy See is headquartered in , operates from , and exercises exclusive dominion over the independent Vatican City State enclave in Rome , of which the pope is sovereign . It is organized into polities of the Latin Church and the 23 Eastern Catholic Churches , and their dioceses and religious institutes . The Holy See is administered by the Roman Curia ( Latin for Roman Court ) , which is the central government of the Catholic Church . The Roman Curia includes various dicasteries , comparable to ministries and executive departments , with the Cardinal Secretary of State as its chief administrator . Papal elections are carried out by the College of Cardinals . Although the Holy See is sometimes metonymically referred to as the Vatican , the Vatican City State was distinctively established with the Lateran Treaty of 1929 , between the Holy See and Italy , to ensure the temporal , diplomatic , and spiritual independence of the papacy . [ citation needed ] As such , papal nuncios , who are papal diplomats to states and international organizations , are recognized as representing the Holy See not the Vatican City State , as prescribed in the Canon law of the Catholic Church ; and therefore the integrity of the Catholic Church along with its 1.3 billion members . The Holy See is thus viewed as the central government of the Catholic Church . The Catholic Church , in turn , is the largest non-government provider of education and health care in the world . The diplomatic status of the Holy See facilitates the access of its vast international network of charities ."
