  "/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada": "The provinces and territories of Canada are sub-national divisions within the geographical areas of Canada under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Constitution . In the 1867 Canadian Confederation , three provinces of British North America - New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , and the Province of Canada ( which upon Confederation was divided into Ontario and Quebec ) - were united to form a federated colony , becoming a sovereign nation in the next century . Over its history , Canada 's international borders have changed several times , and the country has grown from the original four provinces to the current ten provinces and three territories . Together , the provinces and territories make up the world 's second-largest country by area . The major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces receive their power and authority from the Constitution Act , 1867 ( formerly called the British North America Act , 1867 ) , whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the Parliament of Canada . The powers flowing from the Constitution Act are divided between the Government of Canada ( the federal government ) and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively . A change to the division of powers between the federal government and the provinces requires a constitutional amendment , whereas a similar change affecting the territories can be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada or government . In modern Canadian constitutional theory , the provinces are considered sovereign within certain areas based on the divisions of responsibility between the provincial and federal government within the Constitution Act 1867 , and each province thus has its own representative of the Canadian Crown , the lieutenant governor . The territories are not sovereign , but instead their authorities and responsibilities come directly from the federal level , and as a result , have a commissioner instead of a lieutenant governor .",
  "/wiki/Toronto": "Toronto is the provincial capital of Ontario and the most populous city in Canada , with a population of 2,954,024 as of July 2018 .

People have travelled through and inhabited the Toronto area , located on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers , deep ravines , and urban forest , for more than 10,000 years . After the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase , when the Mississauga surrendered the area to the British Crown , the British established the town of York in 1793 and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada . During the War of 1812 , the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy damage by American troops . York was renamed and incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto . It was designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation . The city proper has since expanded past its original borders through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of 630.2 km2 ( 243.3 sq mi ) .
