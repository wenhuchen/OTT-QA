Between 1976 and 1984 he claimed seven gold and five silver medals at the Summer Olympics and world and European championships . Though he was later disqualified and stripped of the title and medal at the 1976 Olympics and his 1980 Olympic Games medal is controversial . He later coached the Australian Paralympic Powerlifting Team in the 1990s to early 2000s . Blagoev was disqualified and stripped of the title and medal at the 1976 Olympics along with his Bulgarian teammate Valentin Hristov for anabolic steroid use . Because the IOC had not yet established the lifetime ban of athletes who cheated using PEDs at the Olympics , the Bulgarian was allowed to participate at the 1980 Olympic Games . The controversial Games in Moscow Russia is still the only modern Olympic Games in history where no one in the entire Summer Games tested positive for the use of alcohol , stimulants , or PEDs .",

The clean and press was dropped from the included lifts after the 1972 games in Munich , due to disagreement over proper form . The Games of 1976 were the first Olympics to start testing for anabolic steroids .",
  "/wiki/Anabolic_steroid": "Anabolic steroids , also known more properly as anabolic-androgenic steroids ( AAS ) , are steroidal androgens that include natural androgens like testosterone as well as synthetic androgens that are structurally related and have similar effects to testosterone . They are anabolic and increase protein within cells , especially in skeletal muscles , and also have varying degrees of androgenic and virilizing effects , including induction of the development and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characteristics such as the growth of facial and body hair . The word anabolic , referring to anabolism , comes from the Greek \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae anabole , that which is thrown up , mound . Androgens or AAS are one of three types of sex hormone agonists , the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone . AAS were synthesized in the 1930s , and are now used therapeutically in medicine to stimulate muscle growth and appetite , induce male puberty and treat chronic wasting conditions , such as cancer and AIDS . The American College of Sports Medicine acknowledges that AAS , in the presence of adequate diet , can contribute to increases in body weight , often as lean mass increases and that the gains in muscular strength achieved through high-intensity exercise and proper diet can be additionally increased by the use of AAS in some individuals . Health risks can be produced by long-term use or excessive doses of AAS . These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels ( increased low-density lipoprotein and decreased high-density lipoprotein ) , acne , high blood pressure , liver damage ( mainly with most oral AAS ) , and dangerous changes in the structure of the left ventricle of the heart . These risks are further increased when , as they often do , athletes take steroids alongside other drugs , causing significantly more damage to their bodies . The effect of anabolic steroids on the heart can cause myocardial infarction and strokes . Conditions pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as gynecomastia and testicular size reduction may also be caused by AAS . In women and children , AAS can cause irreversible masculinization .",

  "/wiki/Amphetamine": "Amphetamine [ note 1 ] ( contracted from alpha-methylphenethylamine ) is a central nervous system ( CNS ) stimulant that is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , narcolepsy , and obesity . Amphetamine was discovered in 1887 and exists as two enantiomers : [ note 2 ] levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine . Amphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical , the racemic free base , which is equal parts of the two enantiomers , levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine , in their pure amine forms . The term is frequently used informally to refer to any combination of the enantiomers , or to either of them alone . Historically , it has been used to treat nasal congestion and depression . Amphetamine is also used as an athletic performance enhancer and cognitive enhancer , and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant . It is a prescription drug in many countries , and unauthorized possession and distribution of amphetamine are often tightly controlled due to the significant health risks associated with recreational use . [ sources 1 ] The first amphetamine pharmaceutical was Benzedrine , a brand which was used to treat a variety of conditions . Currently , pharmaceutical amphetamine is prescribed as racemic amphetamine , Adderall , [ note 3 ] dextroamphetamine , or the inactive prodrug lisdexamfetamine . Amphetamine increases monoamine and excitatory neurotransmission in the brain , with its most pronounced effects targeting the norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitter systems . [ sources 2 ] At therapeutic doses , amphetamine causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria , change in desire for sex , increased wakefulness , and improved cognitive control . It induces physical effects such as improved reaction time , fatigue resistance , and increased muscle strength .",

  "/wiki/Phenylpropanolamine": "Phenylpropanolamine ( PPA ) is a sympathomimetic agent which is used as a decongestant and appetite suppressant . It was commonly used in prescription and over-the-counter cough and cold preparations . In veterinary medicine , it is used to control urinary incontinence in dogs . PPA is also known as \u03b2-hydroxyamphetamine , and is a member of the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes . It is closely related to the cathinones ( \u03b2-ketoamphetamines ) . The compound exists as four stereoisomers , which include d- and l-norephedrine and d- and l-norpseudoephedrine . d-Norpseudoephedrine is also known as cathine , and is found naturally in Catha edulis ( khat ) . Pharmaceutical drug preparations of PPA have varied in their stereoisomer composition in different countries , which may explain differences in misuse and side effect profiles . Analogues of PPA include ephedrine , pseudoephedrine , amphetamine , methamphetamine , and cathinone . Although originally thought to act as a direct agonist of adrenergic receptors , PPA was subsequently found to show only weak or negligible affinity for these receptors , and has been instead characterized as an indirect sympathomimetic which acts by inducing norepinephrine release and thereby activating adrenergic receptors . It was patented in 1938 . In the United States , PPA is no longer sold due to a purported increased risk of stroke in younger women .",
