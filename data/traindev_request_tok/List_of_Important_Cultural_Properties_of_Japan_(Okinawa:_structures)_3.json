  "/wiki/Taish\u014d_period": "Taish\u014d era ( \u5927\u6b63 , Taish\u014d ) is a period in the history of Japan dating from 30 July 1912 to 25 December 1926 , coinciding with the reign of the Emperor Taish\u014d . The new emperor was a sickly man , which prompted the shift in political power from the old oligarchic group of elder statesmen ( or genr\u014d ) to the Imperial Diet of Japan and the democratic parties . Thus , the era is considered the time of the liberal movement known as the Taish\u014d democracy in Japan ; it is usually distinguished from the preceding chaotic Meiji period and the following militaristic-driven first part of the Sh\u014dwa period .",

  "/wiki/Phosphorite": "Phosphorite , phosphate rock or rock phosphate is a non-detrital sedimentary rock which contains high amounts of phosphate minerals . The phosphate content of phosphorite ( or grade of phosphate rock ) varies greatly , from 4% to 20% phosphorus pentoxide ( P2O5 ) . Marketed phosphate rock is enriched ( beneficiated ) to at least 28% , often more than 30% P2O5 . This occurs through washing , screening , de-liming , magnetic separation or flotation . By comparison , the average phosphorus content of sedimentary rocks is less than 0.2% . The phosphate is present as fluorapatite Ca5 ( PO4 ) 3F typically in cryptocrystalline masses ( grain sizes < 1 \u03bcm ) referred to as collophane-sedimentary apatite deposits of uncertain origin . It is also present as hydroxyapatite Ca5 ( PO4 ) 3OH or Ca10 ( PO4 ) 6 ( OH ) 2 , which is often dissolved from vertebrate bones and teeth , whereas fluorapatite can originate from hydrothermal veins . Other sources also include chemically dissolved phosphate minerals from igneous and metamorphic rocks . Phosphorite deposits often occur in extensive layers , which cumulatively cover tens of thousands of square kilometres of the Earth 's crust . Limestones and mudstones are common phosphate-bearing rocks . Phosphate rich sedimentary rocks can occur in dark brown to black beds , ranging from centimeter-sized laminae to beds that are several meters thick . Although these thick beds can exist , they are rarely only composed of phosphatic sedimentary rocks .",

This was part of a global period of social upheavals and conflicts such as the Great Depression and World War II . Defeat in the Second World War brought about radical change in Japan . For the first and only time in its history , Japan was occupied by foreign powers ; this occupation lasted seven years . Allied occupation brought forth sweeping democratic reforms . It led to the formal end of the emperor 's status as a demigod and the transformation of Japan from a form of mixed constitutional and absolute monarchy to a Constitutional monarchy with a liberal democracy . In 1952 , with the Treaty of San Francisco , Japan became a sovereign nation again . The post-war Sh\u014dwa period is characterized by the Japanese economic miracle .
