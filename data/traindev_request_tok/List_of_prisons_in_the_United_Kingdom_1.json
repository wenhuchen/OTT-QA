Historically the county town of Berkshire , since 1974 Abingdon has been administered by the Vale of White Horse district within Oxfordshire . The area was occupied from the early to middle Iron Age and the remains of a late Iron Age and Roman defensive enclosure lies below the town centre . Abingdon Abbey was founded around 676 , giving its name to the emerging town . In the 13th and 14th centuries , Abingdon was an agricultural centre with an extensive trade in wool , alongside weaving and the manufacture of clothing . Charters for the holding of markets and fairs were granted by various monarchs , from Edward I to George II . The town survived the dissolution of the abbey in 1538 , and by the 18th and 19th centuries , with the building of Abingdon Lock in 1790 , and Wilts & Berks Canal in 1810 , was a key link between major industrial centres such as Bristol , London , Birmingham and the Black Country . In 1856 the Abingdon Railway opened , linking the town with the Great Western Railway at Radley . The Wilts & Berks Canal was abandoned in 1906 but a voluntary trust is now working to restore and re-open it . Abingdon railway station was closed to passengers in September 1963 . The line remained open for goods until 1984 , including serving the MG car factory , which operated from 1929 to October 1980 . Abingdon 's brewery , Morland , whose most famous ale , Old Speckled Hen , was named after an early MG car , was taken over and closed down by Greene King Brewery in 1999 , with production moving to Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk .",

It is fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south , the Pennines to the north and east , and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation . The local authority for the city is Manchester City Council . The recorded history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort of Mamucium or Mancunium , which was established in about AD 79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell . It is historically a part of Lancashire , although areas of Cheshire south of the River Mersey were incorporated in the 20th century . The first to be included , Wythenshawe , was added to the city in 1931 . Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township , but began to expand at an astonishing rate around the turn of the 19th century . Manchester 's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution , and resulted in it becoming the world 's first industrialised city . Manchester achieved city status in 1853 . The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894 , creating the Port of Manchester and directly linking the city to the Irish Sea , 36 miles ( 58 km ) to the west . Its fortune declined after the Second World War , owing to deindustrialisation , but the IRA bombing in 1996 led to extensive investment and regeneration .",

It encompasses one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United Kingdom and comprises ten metropolitan boroughs : Bolton , Bury , Oldham , Rochdale , Stockport , Tameside , Trafford , Wigan , and the cities of Manchester and Salford . Greater Manchester was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972 , and designated a functional city region on 1 April 2011 . Greater Manchester spans 493 square miles ( 1,277 km2 ) , which roughly covers the territory of the Greater Manchester Built-up Area , the second most populous urban area in the UK . It is landlocked and borders Cheshire ( to the south-west and south ) , Derbyshire ( to the south-east ) , West Yorkshire ( to the north-east ) , Lancashire ( to the north ) and Merseyside ( to the west ) . There is a mix of high-density urban areas , suburbs , semi-rural and rural locations in Greater Manchester , but land use is mostly urban - the product of concentric urbanisation and industrialisation which occurred mostly during the 19th century when the region flourished as the global centre of the cotton industry . It has a focused central business district , formed by Manchester city centre and the adjoining parts of Salford and Trafford , but Greater Manchester is also a polycentric county with ten metropolitan districts , each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs . Greater Manchester is governed by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority ( GMCA ) , which consists of political leaders from each of the ten metropolitan borough councils , plus a directly elected mayor , with responsibility for economic development , regeneration and transport . Andy Burnham is the inaugural Mayor of Greater Manchester , elected in 2017 . For the 12 years following 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government ; district councils shared power with the Greater Manchester County Council . The county council was abolished in 1986 , and so its districts ( the metropolitan boroughs ) effectively became unitary authority areas . However , the metropolitan county continued to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference , and as a ceremonial county , with a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff .",

After the 18th-century decline of Southwark 's small wharves , the borough rapidly grew in population and saw the growth of great docks , printing/paper , railways , goods yards , small artisan and other often low-wage industries and Southwark was among many such inner districts to see slum clearance and replacement largely with social housing during the late 19th and early 20th centuries .

Covering an area of 2,653 square kilometres ( 1,024 sq mi ) , Dorset borders Devon to the west , Somerset to the north-west , Wiltshire to the north-east , and Hampshire to the east . The county town is Dorchester which is in the south . After the reorganisation of local government in 1974 the county 's border was extended eastward to incorporate the Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch . Around half of the population lives in the South East Dorset conurbation , while the rest of the county is largely rural with a low population density . The county has a long history of human settlement stretching back to the Neolithic era . The Romans conquered Dorset 's indigenous Celtic tribe , and during the Early Middle Ages , the Saxons settled the area and made Dorset a shire in the 7th century . The first recorded Viking raid on the British Isles occurred in Dorset during the eighth century , and the Black Death entered England at Melcombe Regis in 1348 . Dorset has seen much civil unrest : in the English Civil War , an uprising of vigilantes was crushed by Oliver Cromwell 's forces in a pitched battle near Shaftesbury ; the doomed Monmouth Rebellion began at Lyme Regis ; and a group of farm labourers from Tolpuddle were instrumental in the formation of the trade union movement . During the Second World War , Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the invasion of Normandy , and the large harbours of Portland and Poole were two of the main embarkation points .
