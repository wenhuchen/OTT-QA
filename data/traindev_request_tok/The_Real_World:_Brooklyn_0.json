  "/wiki/Salt_Lake_City,_Utah": "Salt Lake City ( often shortened to Salt Lake and abbreviated as SLC ) is the capital and most populous municipality of the U.S. state of Utah , as well as the seat of Salt Lake County , the most populous county in Utah . With an estimated population of 200,591 in 2018 , the city is the core of the Salt Lake City metropolitan area , which has a population of 1,222,540 ( 2018 estimate ) . Salt Lake City is further situated within a larger metropolis known as the Salt Lake City-Ogden-Provo Combined Statistical Area , a corridor of contiguous urban and suburban development stretched along a 120-mile ( 190 km ) segment of the Wasatch Front , comprising a population of 2,606,548 ( as of 2018 estimates ) . It is one of only two major urban areas in the Great Basin . The world headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) is located in Salt Lake City . The city was founded in 1847 by followers of the church , led by Brigham Young , who were seeking to escape persecution that they had experienced while living farther east . The Mormon pioneers , as they would come to be known , entered an arid valley and immediately began building , planning , and extending an extensive irrigation network which could feed the population and foster future growth . Salt Lake City 's street grid system is based on a standard compass grid plan , with the Salt Lake Temple at the origin . Due to its proximity to the Great Salt Lake , the city was named Great Salt Lake City . In 1868 , the 17th Utah Territorial Legislature dropped the word Great from the city 's name . Immigration of international members of the church , mining booms , and the construction of the first transcontinental railroad initially brought economic growth , and the city was nicknamed the Crossroads of the West . It was traversed by the Lincoln Highway , the first transcontinental highway , in 1913 .",
  "/wiki/Hippie": "A hippie ( sometimes spelled hippy ) is a member of the counterculture of the 1960s , originally a youth movement that began in the United States during the mid-1960s and spread to other countries around the world . The word hippie came from hipster and was used to describe beatniks who moved into New York City 's Greenwich Village and San Francisco 's Haight-Ashbury district . The term hippie first found popularity in San Francisco with Herb Caen , who was a journalist for the San Francisco Chronicle . The origins of the terms hip and hep are uncertain . By the 1940s , both had become part of African American jive slang and meant sophisticated ; currently fashionable ; fully up-to-date . The Beats adopted the term hip , and early hippies inherited the language and countercultural values of the Beat Generation . Hippies created their own communities , listened to psychedelic music , embraced the sexual revolution , and many used drugs such as marijuana and LSD to explore altered states of consciousness .",
  "/wiki/Hip-hop": "Hip hop or hip-hop , is a culture and art movement that was created by African Americans , Latino Americans and Caribbean Americans in the Bronx , New York City . The origin of the name is often disputed . It is also argued as to whether hip hop started in the South or West Bronx . While the term hip hop is often used to refer exclusively to hip hop music ( including rap ) , hip hop is characterized by nine elements , of which only four are considered essential to understanding hip hop musically . Afrika Bambaataa of the hip hop collective Zulu Nation outlined these main pillars of hip hop culture , coining the terms : rapping ( also called MCing or emceeing ) , a rhythmic vocal rhyming style ( orality ) ; DJing ( and turntablism ) , which is making music with record players and DJ mixers ( aural/sound and music creation ) ; b-boying/b-girling/breakdancing ( movement/dance ) ; and graffiti . Other elements of hip hop subculture and arts movements beyond the main four are : hip hop culture and historical knowledge of the movement ( intellectual/philosophical ) ; beatboxing , a percussive vocal style ; street entrepreneurship ; hip hop language ; and hip hop fashion and style , among others . The fifth element , although debated , is commonly considered either street knowledge , hip hop fashion , or beatboxing . The Bronx hip hop scene emerged in the mid-1970s from neighborhood block parties thrown by the Black Spades , an African-American group that has been described as being a gang , a club , and a music group . Brother-sister duo Clive Campbell , a.k.a . DJ Kool Herc , and Cindy Campbell additionally hosted DJ parties in the Bronx and are credited for the rise in the genre . Hip hop culture has spread to both urban and suburban communities throughout the United States and subsequently the world . These elements were adapted and developed considerably , particularly as the art forms spread to new continents and merged with local styles in the 1990s and subsequent decades .",
  "/wiki/Panic_attacks": "Panic attacks are sudden periods of intense fear that may include palpitations , sweating , shaking , shortness of breath , numbness , or a feeling that something bad is going to happen . The maximum degree of symptoms occurs within minutes . Typically they last for about 30 minutes but the duration can vary from seconds to hours . There may be a fear of losing control or chest pain . Panic attacks themselves are not typically dangerous physically . Panic attacks can occur due to a number of disorders including panic disorder , social anxiety disorder , post traumatic stress disorder , drug use disorder , depression , and medical problems . They can either be triggered or occur unexpectedly . Smoking , caffeine , and psychological stress increase the risk of having a panic attack . Before diagnosis , conditions that produce similar symptoms should be ruled out , such as hyperthyroidism , hyperparathyroidism , heart disease , lung disease , and drug use . Treatment of panic attacks should be directed at the underlying cause . In those with frequent attacks , counselling or medications may be used . Breathing training and muscle relaxation techniques may also help .",
  "/wiki/Punk_rock": "Punk rock ( or simply punk ) is a music genre that emerged in the mid-1970s . Rooted in 1960s garage rock , punk bands rejected the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock . They typically produced short , fast-paced songs with hard-edged melodies and singing styles , stripped-down instrumentation , and often political , anti-establishment lyrics . Punk embraces a DIY ethic ; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through independent record labels . The term punk rock was first used by American rock critics in the early 1970s to describe 1960s garage bands and certain subsequent acts they perceived as stylistic inheritors . When the movement now bearing the name developed from 1974 to 1976 , acts such as Television , Patti Smith , and the Ramones in New York City ; the Sex Pistols , the Clash , and the Damned in London ; and the Saints in Brisbane formed its vanguard . As 1977 approached , punk became a major cultural phenomenon in the UK . It spawned a punk subculture expressing youthful rebellion through distinctive styles of clothing and adornment ( such as deliberately offensive T-shirts , leather jackets , studded or spiked bands and jewelry , safety pins , and bondage and S & M clothes ) and a variety of anti-authoritarian ideologies . In 1977 , the influence of the music and subculture became more pervasive , spreading worldwide , especially in England . It took root in a wide range of local scenes that often rejected affiliation with the mainstream . In the late 1970s , punk experienced a second wave as new acts that were not active during its formative years adopted the style . By the early 1980s , faster and more aggressive subgenres such as hardcore punk ( e.g .",
  "/wiki/Mormon": "Mormons are a religious and cultural group related to Mormonism , the principal branch of the Latter Day Saint movement of Restorationist Christianity , initiated by Joseph Smith in upstate New York during the 1820s . After Smith 's death in 1844 , the Mormons followed Brigham Young to what would become the Utah Territory . Today , most Mormons are understood to be members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) . Other Mormons may be independently religious , secular and non-practicing , or belong to another denomination . The center of Mormon cultural influence is in Utah , and North America has more Mormons than any other continent , though the majority of Mormons live outside the United States . Mormons have developed a strong sense of commonality that stems from their doctrine and history . During the 19th century , Mormon converts tended to gather to a central geographic location , and between 1852 and 1890 a minority of Mormons openly practiced plural marriage , a form of religious polygamy . Mormons dedicate large amounts of time and resources to serving in their church , and many young Mormons choose to serve a full-time proselytizing mission . Mormons have a health code which eschews alcoholic beverages , tobacco , hot drinks ( tea and coffee ) , and addictive substances . They tend to be very family-oriented and have strong connections across generations and with extended family , reflective of their belief that families can be sealed together beyond death . Mormons also have a strict law of chastity , requiring abstention from sexual relations outside heterosexual marriage and fidelity within marriage . Mormons self-identify as Christian , although some non-Mormons consider Mormons non-Christian and some of their beliefs differ from those of mainstream Christianity .",

Members of the subculture typically do not self-identify as hipsters , and the word hipster is often used as a pejorative for someone who is pretentious or overly trendy . Stereotypical elements include vintage clothes and other non-mainstream fashion , skinny jeans , checked shirts , an ironic moustache or full beard , and big glasses . The subculture is broadly associated with indie music and alternative . In America it is associated with affluent white ( European-American ) young adults living in gentrified urban areas . The term hipster in its present usage first appeared in the 1990s and became particularly prominent in the late 2000s and early 2010s , being derived from the earlier hipster movements of the 1940s .",
  "/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)": "The Republican Party , also referred to as the GOP ( Grand Old Party ) , is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States ; the other is its historic rival , the Democratic Party . The GOP was founded in 1854 by opponents of the Kansas-Nebraska Act , which allowed for the potential expansion of slavery into certain U.S. territories . The party supported classical liberalism , opposed the expansion of slavery , and supported economic reform . Abraham Lincoln was the first Republican president . Under the leadership of Lincoln and a Republican Congress , slavery was banned in the United States in 1865 . The Party was generally dominant during the Third Party System and the Fourth Party System . After 1912 , the Party underwent an ideological shift to the right . Following the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the party 's core base shifted , with Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics . The party 's 21st-century base of support includes people living in rural areas , men , people without college degrees , the elderly , white Americans , and evangelical Christians . The 21st-century Republican Party ideology is American conservatism , which incorporates both economic policies and social values . The GOP supports lower taxes , free market capitalism , restrictions on immigration , increased military spending , gun rights , restrictions on abortion , deregulation and restrictions on labor unions . After the Supreme Court 's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade , the Republican Party opposed abortion in its party platform and grew its support among evangelicals .",

  "/wiki/Gay": "Gay is a term that primarily refers to a homosexual person or the trait of being homosexual . The term was originally used to mean carefree , cheerful , or bright and showy . The term 's use as a reference to homosexuality may date as early as the late 19th century , but its use gradually increased in the mid-20th century . In modern English , gay has come to be used as an adjective , and as a noun , referring to the community , practices and cultures associated with homosexuality . In the 1960s , gay became the word favored by homosexual men to describe their sexual orientation . By the end of the 20th century , the word gay was recommended by major LGBT groups and style guides to describe people attracted to members of the same sex . At about the same time , a new , pejorative use became prevalent in some parts of the world . Among younger speakers , the word has a meaning ranging from derision ( e.g. , equivalent to rubbish or stupid ) to a light-hearted mockery or ridicule ( e.g. , equivalent to weak , unmanly , or lame ) . In this use , the word rarely means homosexual , as it is often used , for example , to refer to an inanimate object or abstract concept of which one disapproves . The extent to which these usages still retain connotations of homosexuality has been debated and harshly criticized .",
  "/wiki/Social_welfare_provision": "Welfare is a type of government support for the citizens of that society . Welfare may be provided to people of any income level , as with social security ( and is then often called a social safety net ) , but it is usually intended to ensure that people can meet their basic human needs such as food and shelter . Welfare attempts to provide a minimal level of well-being , usually either a free- or a subsidized-supply of certain goods and social services , such as healthcare , education , and vocational training . A welfare state is a political system wherein the State assumes responsibility for the health , education , and welfare of society . The system of social security in a welfare state provides social services , such as universal medical care , unemployment insurance for workers , financial aid , free post-secondary education for students , subsidized public housing , and pensions ( sickness , incapacity , old-age ) , etc . In 1952 , with the Social Security ( Minimum Standards ) Convention ( nr . 102 ) , the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) formally defined the social contingencies covered by social security . The first welfare state was Imperial Germany ( 1871-1918 ) , where the Bismarck government introduced social security in 1889 . In the early 20th century , the United Kingdom introduced social security around 1913 , and adopted the welfare state with the National Insurance Act 1946 , during the Attlee government ( 1945-51 ) . In the countries of western Europe , Scandinavia , and Australasia , social welfare is mainly provided by the government out of the national tax revenues , and to a lesser extent by non-government organizations ( NGOs ) , and charities ( social and religious ) .",

  "/wiki/Coming_out": "Coming out of the closet , often shortened to coming out , is a metaphor for LGBT people 's self-disclosure of their sexual orientation or of their gender identity . The term coming out can also be used in various non-LGBT applications ( e.g . atheists ) . Framed and debated as a privacy issue , coming out of the closet is described and experienced variously as a psychological process or journey ; decision-making or risk-taking ; a strategy or plan ; a mass or public event ; a speech act and a matter of personal identity ; a rite of passage ; liberation or emancipation from oppression ; an ordeal ; a means toward feeling gay pride instead of shame and social stigma ; or even career suicide . Author Steven Seidman writes that it is the power of the closet to shape the core of an individual 's life that has made homosexuality into a significant personal , social , and political drama in twentieth-century America . Coming out of the closet is the source of other gay slang expressions related to voluntary disclosure or lack thereof . LGBT people who have already revealed or no longer conceal their sexual orientation or gender identity are out , i.e . openly LGBT . Oppositely , LGBT people who have yet to come out or have opted not to do so are labelled as closeted or being in the closet . Outing is the deliberate or accidental disclosure of an LGBT person 's sexual orientation or gender identity , without their consent . By extension , outing oneself is self-disclosure . Glass closet means the open secret of when public figures ' being LGBT is considered a widely accepted fact even though they have not officially come out .",

  "/wiki/Italian-American": "Italian Americans ( Italian : italoamericani or italo-americani [ \u02ccitalo.ameri\u02c8ka\u02d0ni ] ) are citizens of the United States of America who are of Italian descent . Residing mainly in Northeastern and urban industrial Midwestern metropolitan areas , Italian Americans are the fifth largest self-identified ethnic group in the United States behind German Americans , Irish Americans , English Americans and Mexican Americans , though realistically the various Americans of British , Northwestern European , and Germanic ancestries that do not identify their ancestry in censuses or identify simply as American are much higher in number . About 5.5 million Italians immigrated to the United States from 1820 to 2004 . In 1870 , there were fewer than 25,000 Italian immigrants in America , many of them Northern Italian refugees from the wars that accompanied the Risorgimento - the struggle for Italian unification and independence from foreign rule which ended in 1871 . Immigration began to increase during the 1870s , when more than twice as many Italians immigrated ( 1870-79 : 46,296 ) than during the five previous decades combined ( 1820-69 : 22,627 ) . The 1870s were followed by the greatest surge of immigration , which occurred between 1880 and 1914 and brought more than 4 million Italians to the United States , the greatest number coming from Southern Italy ( namely Campania , Apulia , Basilicata , Calabria and Sicily ) , areas which were still largely rural and agricultural , and where much of the populace had been impoverished by centuries of foreign misrule , and an oppressive taxation system imposed after Italian unification in 1861 . This period of large-scale immigration ended abruptly with the onset of the First World War in 1914 and , except for one year ( 1922 ) , never fully resumed . Further immigration was greatly limited by several laws Congress passed in the 1920s . Following the unification , the unitary Italian state initially encouraged emigration to relieve economic pressures in the South . After the American Civil War , which resulted in over a half million killed or wounded , immigrant workers were recruited from Italy and elsewhere to fill the labor shortage caused by the war . In the United States , most Italians began their new lives as manual laborers in eastern cities , mining camps and farms . The descendants of the Italian immigrants gradually rose from a lower economic class in the first generation to a level comparable to the national average by 1970 .",

It is one of the five Italian autonomous regions and is officially referred to as Regione Siciliana . Sicily is located in the central Mediterranean Sea , south of the Italian Peninsula , from which it is separated by the narrow Strait of Messina . Its most prominent landmark is Mount Etna , the tallest active volcano in Europe , and one of the most active in the world , currently 3,329 m ( 10,922 ft ) high . The island has a typical Mediterranean climate . The earliest archaeological evidence of human activity on the island dates from as early as 12,000 BC . By around 750 BC , Sicily had three Phoenician and a dozen Greek colonies and it was later the site of the Sicilian Wars and the Punic Wars . After the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD , Sicily was ruled during the Early Middle Ages by the Vandals , the Ostrogoths , the Byzantine Empire , and the Emirate of Sicily . The Norman conquest of southern Italy led to the creation of the Kingdom of Sicily , which was subsequently ruled by the Hohenstaufen , the Capetian House of Anjou , Spain , and the House of Habsburg . It was unified under the House of Bourbon with the Kingdom of Naples as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies .

The capital and largest city is Bangkok , a special administrative area . Thailand is bordered to the north by Myanmar and Laos , to the east by Laos and Cambodia , to the south by the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia , and to the west by the Andaman Sea and the southern extremity of Myanmar . Its maritime boundaries include Vietnam in the Gulf of Thailand to the southeast , and Indonesia and India on the Andaman Sea to the southwest . It is a unitary state . Although nominally the country is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy , the most recent coup , in 2014 , established a de facto military dictatorship under a junta . Tai peoples migrated from southwestern China to mainland Southeast Asia from the 11th century ; the oldest known mention of their presence in the region by the exonym Siamese dates to the 12th century . Various Indianised kingdoms such as the Mon kingdoms , Khmer Empire and Malay states ruled the region , competing with Thai states such as the Kingdoms of Ngoenyang , Sukhothai , Lan Na and Ayutthaya , which rivaled each other . Documented European contact began in 1511 with a Portuguese diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya , now one of the great powers in the region . Ayutthaya reached its peak during cosmopolitan Narai 's reign ( 1656-1688 ) , gradually declining thereafter until being ultimately destroyed in the 1767 Burmese-Siamese War . Taksin ( r. 1767-1782 ) quickly reunified the fragmented territory and established the short-lived Thonburi Kingdom .",

  "/wiki/AIDS": "Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( HIV/AIDS ) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Following initial infection a person may not notice any symptoms , or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness . Typically , this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms . If the infection progresses , it interferes more with the immune system , increasing the risk of developing common infections such as tuberculosis , as well as other opportunistic infections , and tumors which are otherwise rare in people who have normal immune function . These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . This stage is often also associated with unintended weight loss . HIV is spread primarily by unprotected sex ( including anal and oral sex ) , contaminated blood transfusions , hypodermic needles , and from mother to child during pregnancy , delivery , or breastfeeding . Some bodily fluids , such as saliva , sweat and tears , do not transmit the virus . HIV is a member of the group of viruses known as retroviruses . Methods of prevention include safe sex , needle exchange programs , treating those who are infected , pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis , and male circumcision . Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication . There is no cure or vaccine ; however , antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy .",

Four passenger airliners operated by two major U.S. passenger air carriers ( United Airlines and American Airlines ) - all of which departed from airports in the northeastern United States bound for San Francisco and Los Angeles - were hijacked by 19 al-Qaeda terrorists . Two of the planes , American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 , were crashed into the North and South towers , respectively , of the World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan . Within an hour and 42 minutes , both 110-story towers collapsed . Debris and the resulting fires caused a partial or complete collapse of all other buildings in the World Trade Center complex , including the 47-story 7 World Trade Center tower , as well as significant damage to ten other large surrounding structures . A third plane , American Airlines Flight 77 , was crashed into the Pentagon ( the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense ) in Arlington County , Virginia , which led to a partial collapse of the building 's west side . The fourth plane , United Airlines Flight 93 , was initially flown toward Washington , D.C. , but crashed into a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville , Pennsylvania , after its passengers thwarted the hijackers . 9/11 is the single deadliest terrorist attack in human history and the single deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement officers in the history of the United States , with 343 and 72 killed , respectively .

A leading member of the revolutionary Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party , and later , the Baghdad-based Ba'ath Party and its regional organization the Iraqi Ba'ath Party - which espoused Ba'athism , a mix of Arab nationalism and socialism - Saddam played a key role in the 1968 coup ( later referred to as the 17 July Revolution ) that brought the party to power in Iraq . As vice president under the ailing General Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr , and at a time when many groups were considered capable of overthrowing the government , Saddam created security forces through which he tightly controlled conflicts between the government and the armed forces . In the early 1970s , Saddam nationalized oil and foreign banks leaving the system eventually insolvent mostly due to the Iran-Iraq War , the Gulf War , and UN sanctions . Through the 1970s , Saddam cemented his authority over the apparatus of government as oil money helped Iraq 's economy to grow at a rapid pace . Positions of power in the country were mostly filled with Sunni Arabs , a minority that made up only a fifth of the population . Saddam formally rose to power in 1979 , although he had already been the de facto head of Iraq for several years . He suppressed several movements , particularly Shi ' a and Kurdish movements which sought to overthrow the government or gain independence , respectively , and maintained power during the Iran-Iraq War and the Gulf War . Whereas some in the Arab world lauded Saddam for opposing the United States and attacking Israel , he was widely condemned for the brutality of his dictatorship . The total number of Iraqis killed by the security services of Saddam 's government in various purges and genocides is conservatively estimated to be 250,000 . Saddam 's invasions of Iran and Kuwait also resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths .

Symptoms may include disturbing thoughts , feelings , or dreams related to the events , mental or physical distress to trauma-related cues , attempts to avoid trauma-related cues , alterations in how a person thinks and feels , and an increase in the fight-or-flight response . These symptoms last for more than a month after the event . Young children are less likely to show distress , but instead may express their memories through play . A person with PTSD is at a higher risk for suicide and intentional self-harm . Most people who experience traumatic events do not develop PTSD . People who experience interpersonal trauma such as rape or child abuse are more likely to develop PTSD as compared to people who experience non-assault based trauma , such as accidents and natural disasters . About half of people develop PTSD following rape . Children are less likely than adults to develop PTSD after trauma , especially if they are under 10 years of age . Diagnosis is based on the presence of specific symptoms following a traumatic event . Prevention may be possible when counselling is targeted at those with early symptoms but is not effective when provided to all trauma-exposed individuals whether or not symptoms are present . The main treatments for people with PTSD are counselling ( psychotherapy ) and medication .",

These attractions are generally subsumed under heterosexuality , homosexuality , and bisexuality , while asexuality ( the lack of sexual attraction to others ) is sometimes identified as the fourth category . These categories are aspects of the more nuanced nature of sexual identity and terminology . For example , people may use other labels , such as pansexual or polysexual , or none at all . According to the American Psychological Association , sexual orientation also refers to a person 's sense of identity based on those attractions , related behaviors , and membership in a community of others who share those attractions . Androphilia and gynephilia are terms used in behavioral science to describe sexual orientation as an alternative to a gender binary conceptualization . Androphilia describes sexual attraction to masculinity ; gynephilia describes the sexual attraction to femininity . The term sexual preference largely overlaps with sexual orientation , but is generally distinguished in psychological research . A person who identifies as bisexual , for example , may sexually prefer one sex over the other . Sexual preference may also suggest a degree of voluntary choice , whereas the scientific consensus is that sexual orientation is not a choice . Scientists do not know the exact cause of sexual orientation , but they theorize that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic , hormonal , and environmental influences . Although no single theory on the cause of sexual orientation has yet gained widespread support , scientists favor biologically-based theories .",

  "/wiki/Abdominals": "The abdomen ( colloquially called the belly , tummy or midriff ) is the part of the body between the thorax ( chest ) and pelvis , in humans and in other vertebrates . The abdomen is the front part of the abdominal segment of the trunk . The region occupied by the abdomen is called the abdominal cavity . In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body ; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax . In humans , the abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim . The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint ( the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1 ) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet . The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity . The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear .",
