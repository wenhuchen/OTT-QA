In 1971 , Brown 's coordinate women 's institution , Pembroke College , was fully merged into the university ; Pembroke Campus now includes dormitories and classrooms used by all of Brown . Undergraduate admissions is highly selective , with an acceptance rate of 6.6 percent for the class of 2023 .
