  "/wiki/De_Havilland_Hornet": "The de Havilland DH.103 Hornet is a twin-piston engined fighter aircraft developed by de Havilland . It further exploited the wooden construction techniques that had been pioneered by the de Havilland Mosquito . Development of the Hornet had started during the Second World War as a private venture . The aircraft was to conduct long range fighter operations in the Pacific Theatre against the Empire of Japan but the war ended before the Hornet reached operational squadron status . The Hornet entered service with RAF Fighter Command where it equipped several day fighter units and was commonly stationed in the British mainland . It saw combat in the Far East , being used as a strike fighter as part of the British military action taken during the Malayan Emergency . A naval carrier-capable version , the Sea Hornet , had been envisioned early on and was procured by the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy .",

Development started in September 1942 in response to United States Army Air Forces requirement for a fighter possessing an extremely high rate of climb , using the most powerful liquid-cooled engine then available , the Allison V-3420 . The program was cancelled after only a small number of prototypes and production aircraft had been completed , as it was no longer required in its original role , could not be quickly deployed , and possessed no significant advantages over aircraft already in production .",

  "/wiki/IMAM_Ro.58": "The IMAM Ro.58 was an Italian twin-engined , two-seat monoplane heavy fighter and attack aircraft , a development of the IMAM Ro.57 . First flown in May 1942 , it was considered a general improvement over its predecessor , mainly due to the substitution of higher power Daimler-Benz DB 601 engines for the Fiat A.74 engines used on the Ro.57 . Initially it had many problems and during the maiden flight only the proficiency of the test pilot , Adriano Mantelli , saved the plane . It was easily recognizable because it appeared to have a long hump over the fuselage ( to accommodate two crew members as opposed to one in the Ro.57 ) . The Ro.58 was a twin-tailed aircraft , in layout similar to the Bf 110 . The performance of the aircraft with the DB 601 engines was much better than even many single engine fighters of the time ( 605 km/h at 5,000 m , 1,500 km endurance , 10,500 m ceiling ) . More heavily armed than its predecessor , with five forward-firing MG 151s ; three in the nose and two under the belly ( the underbelly guns were not present during the first flight tests ) and one 12.7 mm rear-facing Breda-SAFAT machine gun . Tested alongside an Me 410 it was found to be superior , but even so it initially had its share of problems that delayed production . By the time it was refined it was too late for Italy , and there were no resources even for single-engine fighters , much less the more expensive twin-engined ones . As with the Ro.57 , which was not put into production in 1940 or 1941 , the Ro.58 , better armed and faster appeared only in May 1942 , and too late to be produced in any numbers , as Italy surrendered to the Allies in September 1943 .",
  "/wiki/Kawasaki_Ki-64": "The Kawasaki Ki-64 ( Allied code name : Rob ) was a one-off prototype of an experimental heavy , single seat , fighter . It had two unusual design features . First ; it had two Kawasaki Ha-40 engines in tandem ; one in the aircraft nose , the other behind the cockpit , both being connected by a drive shaft . This combination ( called the Kawasaki Ha-201 ) drove two , three-bladed , contra-rotating propellors . The second feature was the use of the wing surface as a radiator for the water-cooled engines . The aircraft first flew in December 1943 . During the fifth flight , the rear engine caught fire ; and while the aircraft made an emergency landing , it was damaged . The aircraft was subsequently abandoned in mid-1944 in favour of more promising projects . The airframe survived the war , and parts of the unique cooling system were sent to Wright Field for examination .",
  "/wiki/Kawasaki_Ki-96": "The Kawasaki Ki-96 was a Japanese single seat , twin-engine heavy fighter of World War II . It was intended to replace the Kawasaki Ki-45s of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service . However , it was not adopted and only three prototypes were built .",
  "/wiki/Lockheed_XP-49": "The Lockheed XP-49 ( company Model 522 ) was an advancement on the P-38 Lightning for a fighter in response to U.S. Army Air Corps proposal 39-775 .
