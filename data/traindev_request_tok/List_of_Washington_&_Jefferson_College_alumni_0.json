  "/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States": "Abolitionism ( or the Anti-Slavery Movement ) in the United States of America was the movement which sought to end slavery in the United States immediately , active both before and during the American Civil War . In the Americas and western Europe , abolitionism was a movement which sought to end the Atlantic slave trade and set slaves free . In the 17th century , enlightenment thinkers condemned slavery on humanistic grounds and English Quakers and some Evangelical denominations condemned slavery as un-Christian . At that time , most slaves were Africans , but thousands of Native Americans were also enslaved . In the 18th century , as many as six million Africans were transported to the Americas as slaves , at least a third of them on British ships to North America . The colony of Georgia originally prohibited slavery within its territory , and thereafter , abolition was part of the message of the First Great Awakening of the 1730s and 1740s in the Thirteen Colonies . During the Age of Enlightenment rationalist thinkers criticized slavery for violating people 's natural rights . A member of the British Parliament , James Edward Oglethorpe , was among the first to articulate the Enlightenment case against slavery . The founder of the Province of Georgia , Oglethorpe banned slavery on humanistic grounds . He argued against it in Parliament and eventually encouraged his friends Granville Sharp and Hannah More to vigorously pursue the cause . Soon after his death in 1785 , Sharp and More joined with William Wilberforce and others in forming the Clapham Sect . Although anti-slavery sentiments were widespread by the late 18th century , many colonies , churches , and emerging nations ( notably in the southern United States ) continued to use and defend the traditions of slavery .",
