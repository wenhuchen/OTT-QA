It was Godard 's first feature-length work and represented Belmondo 's breakthrough as an actor . Breathless was one of the early , more influential examples of French New Wave ( nouvelle vague ) cinema . Along with Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut 's The 400 Blows and Alain Resnais 's Hiroshima , Mon Amour , both released a year earlier , it brought international attention to new styles of French filmmaking . At the time , the film attracted much attention for its bold visual style , which included unconventional use of jump cuts . A fully restored version of the film was released in the U.S. for its 50th anniversary in May 2010 . When originally released in France , the film attracted over 2 million viewers .",

He rose to prominence as a pioneer of the 1960s French New Wave film movement . During his early career as a film critic , Godard criticized mainstream French cinema 's Tradition of Quality , which emphasized established convention over innovation and experimentation . In response , he and like-minded critics began to make their own films . Many of Godard 's films challenge the conventions of traditional Hollywood in addition to French cinema . In 1964 , Godard described his and his colleagues ' impact : We barged into the cinema like cavemen into the Versailles of Louis XV . He is often considered the most radical French filmmaker of the 1960s and 1970s ; his approach in film conventions , politics and philosophies made him arguably the most influential director of the French New Wave . Along with showing knowledge of film history through homages and references , several of his films expressed his political views ; he was an avid reader of existential and Marxist philosophy . Since the New Wave , his politics have been much less radical and his recent films are about representation and human conflict from a humanist , and a Marxist perspective . In a 2002 Sight & Sound poll , Godard ranked third in the critics ' top ten directors of all time ( which was put together by assembling the directors of the individual films for which the critics voted ) . He is said to have created one of the largest bodies of critical analysis of any filmmaker since the mid-twentieth century . He and his work have been central to narrative theory and have challenged both commercial narrative cinema norms and film criticism 's vocabulary .",

Chabrol 's career began with Le Beau Serge ( 1958 ) , inspired by Hitchcock 's Shadow of a Doubt ( 1943 ) . Thrillers became something of a trademark for Chabrol , with an approach characterized by a distanced objectivity . This is especially apparent in Les Biches ( 1968 ) , La Femme infid\u00e8le ( 1969 ) , and Le Boucher ( 1970 ) - all featuring St\u00e9phane Audran , who was his wife at the time . Sometimes characterized as a mainstream New Wave director , Chabrol remained prolific and popular throughout his half-century career . In 1978 , he cast Isabelle Huppert as the lead in Violette Nozi\u00e8re . On the strength of that effort , the pair went on to others including the successful Madame Bovary ( 1991 ) and La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie ( 1996 ) . Film critic John Russell Taylor has stated that there are few directors whose films are more difficult to explain or evoke on paper , if only because so much of the overall effect turns on Chabrol 's sheer hedonistic relish for the medium.Some of his films become almost private jokes , made to amuse himself . James Monaco has called Chabrol the craftsman par excellence of the New Wave , and his variations upon a theme give us an understanding of the explicitness and precision of the language of the film that we do n't get from the more varied experiments in genre of Truffaut or Godard ."
