  "/wiki/Black_Swan_(film)": "Black Swan is a 2010 American psychological horror film directed by Darren Aronofsky . The screenplay was written by Mark Heyman , John McLaughlin , and Andres Heinz , based on an original story by Heinz . The film stars Natalie Portman , Vincent Cassel , Mila Kunis , Barbara Hershey , and Winona Ryder . The plot revolves around a production of Tchaikovsky 's Swan Lake ballet by the prestigious New York City Ballet company . The production requires a ballerina to play the innocent and fragile White Swan , for which the committed dancer Nina ( Portman ) is a perfect fit , as well as the dark and sensual Black Swan , which are qualities better embodied by the new arrival Lily ( Kunis ) . Nina is overwhelmed by a feeling of immense pressure when she finds herself competing for the part , causing her to lose her tenuous grip on reality and descend into a nightmare . Usually described as a psychological horror thriller film , Black Swan can also be interpreted as a metaphor for achieving artistic perfection , with all of the psychological and physical challenges one might encounter , i.e . the film can be perceived as a poetic metaphor for the birth of an artist , that is , as a visual representation of Nina 's psychic odyssey toward achieving artistic perfection and of the price to be paid for it . Aronofsky conceived the premise by connecting his viewings of a production of Swan Lake with an unrealized screenplay about understudies and the notion of being haunted by a double , similar to the folklore surrounding doppelg\u00e4ngers . Aronofsky cites Fyodor Dostoevsky 's The Double as another inspiration for the film . The director also considered Black Swan a companion piece to his 2008 film The Wrestler , with both films involving demanding performances for different kinds of art . He and Portman first discussed the project in 2000 , and after a brief attachment to Universal Studios , Black Swan was produced in New York City in 2009 by Fox Searchlight Pictures .",
