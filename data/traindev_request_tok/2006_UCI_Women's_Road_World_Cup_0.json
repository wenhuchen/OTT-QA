  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands .

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",

Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal , fungal , and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , and its most populous city is Auckland .

  "/wiki/Team_time_trial": "A team time trial ( TTT ) is a road-based bicycle race in which teams of cyclists race against the clock ( see individual time trial for a more detailed description of ITT events ) . The winning team in a TTT is determined by the comparing the times of ( usually ) the fourth-finishing rider in each team ( though the relevant finish position can be otherwise specified in advance by the race organisers ) . This means that each team will try to get their first four ( at least ) riders across the finish line in a tight group : it is actually a disadvantage for any rider to finish far in advance of the fourth rider , as by staying back a faster rider can help the fourth rider to get a quicker time . Where a TTT is part of a stage race , it is necessary for each rider to be given a finish time that can be cumulated into the general classification timings . Hence , all riders in the team who finish in the leading bunch are given the time of the fourth rider , and any rider who has been dropped is timed individually in the usual way . Teams start at equal intervals , usually two , three or four minutes apart . Starting sequences will usually be based on individuals ' times in previous events , but in TTTs conducted as part of a multi-stage road race ( such as the Tour de France and the Giro d'Italia ) the highest ranked teams will normally start later . Later starters have the advantage of knowing what times they need to beat ( and this also makes the event more interesting to spectators ) . Unlike individual time trials where competitors are not permitted to 'draft ' ( ride in the slipstream ) behind each other , in team time trials , riders in each team employ this as their main tactic , each member taking a turn at the front while teammates 'sit in ' behind . After their turn , the lead rider will swing over , allowing the next rider to take the lead , while the leader goes to the back of the team . Should one team overtake another , the overtaken team would be expected to drop back .",
