Baker was killed , and a newly-arrived Confederate unit routed the rest of Stones expedition .

Illinois has been noted as a microcosm of the entire United States . With Chicago in northeastern Illinois , small industrial cities and immense agricultural productivity in the north and center of the state , and natural resources such as coal , timber , and petroleum in the south , Illinois has a diverse economic base , and is a major transportation hub . Chicagoland , Chicago 's metropolitan area , encompasses over 65% of the state 's population .

  "/wiki/Nathaniel_P._Banks": "Nathaniel Prentice ( or Prentiss ) Banks ( January 30 , 1816 - September 1 , 1894 ) was an American politician from Massachusetts and a Union general during the Civil War . A millworker by background , Banks was prominent in local debating societies , and his oratorical skills were noted by the Democratic Party . However , his abolitionist views fitted him better for the nascent Republican Party , through which he became Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and Governor of Massachusetts in the 1850s . Always a political chameleon ( for which he was criticized by contemporaries ) , Banks was the first professional politician ( with no outside business or other interests ) to serve as Massachusetts Governor . At the outbreak of the Civil War , President Lincoln appointed Banks as one of the first 'political ' major generals , over the heads of West Point regulars , who initially resented him , but came to acknowledge his influence on the administration of the war . After suffering a series of inglorious setbacks in the Shenandoah River Valley at the hands of Stonewall Jackson , Banks replaced Benjamin Butler at New Orleans as commander of the Department of the Gulf , charged with administration of Louisiana and gaining control of the Mississippi River . But he failed to reinforce Grant at Vicksburg , and badly handled the Siege of Port Hudson , taking its surrender only after Vicksburg had fallen . He then launched the Red River Campaign , a failed attempt to occupy eastern Texas that prompted his recall . Banks was regularly criticized for the failures of his campaigns , notably in tactically important tasks including reconnaissance . Banks was also instrumental in early reconstruction efforts in Louisiana , intended by Lincoln as a model for later such activities . After the war , Banks returned to the Massachusetts political scene , serving in Congress , where he supported Manifest Destiny , influenced the Alaska Purchase legislation , and supported women 's suffrage . In his later years he adopted more liberal progressive causes , and served as a United States marshal for Massachusetts before suffering a decline in his mental faculties .",

  "/wiki/William_W._Belknap": "William Worth Belknap ( September 22 , 1829 - October 12 , 1890 ) was a lawyer , soldier in the Union Army , government administrator in Iowa , and the 30th United States Secretary of War under President Ulysses S. Grant . A native of New York , Belknap graduated from Princeton University in 1848 , studied law with a Georgetown attorney , and passed the bar in 1851 . He moved to Iowa , where he practiced law in partnership with Ralph P. Lowe . Belknap entered politics as a Democrat and served one term in the Iowa House of Representatives . When the American Civil War broke out in 1861 , Belknap joined the Union Army . A veteran of the Iowa Militia who had attained the rank of captain , he was commissioned as a major in the 15th Iowa Volunteer Infantry . He took part in numerous engagements , including Shiloh and Corinth , served as a regimental , brigade , division , and corps commander , and served in high-level staff positions . By the end of the war , Belknap had been promoted to brigadier general of volunteers , and received a brevet promotion to major general . After declining a regular Army commission , Belknap was appointed Iowa 's Collector of Internal Revenue by President Andrew Johnson ; he served with distinction for four years . In 1869 , President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Belknap as Secretary of War . During his tenure , Belknap ordered portraits of all the previous Secretaries , intending to create a complete collection in honor of the United States Centennial . In 1871 , Belknap was investigated by Congress , after he was directly involved in the sale of arms and munitions to France , while the United States was ostensibly neutral during the Franco-Prussian War .",
  "/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_War": "The secretary of war was a member of the United States president 's Cabinet , beginning with George Washington 's administration . A similar position , called either Secretary at War or Secretary of War , had been appointed to serve the Congress of the Confederation under the Articles of Confederation between 1781 and 1789 . Benjamin Lincoln and later Henry Knox held the position . When Washington was inaugurated as the first president under the Constitution , he appointed Knox to continue serving as Secretary of War . The secretary of war was the head of the War Department . At first , he was responsible for all military affairs , including naval affairs . In 1798 , the secretary of the Navy was created by statute , and the scope of responsibility for this office was reduced to the affairs of the United States Army . From 1886 onward , the secretary of war was in the line of succession to the presidency , after the vice president of the United States , the speaker of the House of Representatives , the president pro tem of the Senate and the secretary of state . In 1947 , with the passing of the National Security Act of 1947 , the secretary of war was replaced by the secretary of the Army and the secretary of the Air Force , which , along with the secretary of the Navy , have since 1949 been non-Cabinet subordinates under the secretary of defense . The secretary of the Army 's office is generally considered the direct successor to the secretary of war 's office although the secretary of defense took the secretary of war 's position in the Cabinet , and the line of succession to the presidency .",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Pleasant_Hill": "The Battle of Pleasant Hill , Louisiana ( 9 April 1864 ) , formed part of the Red River Campaign during the American Civil War , when Union forces were aiming to occupy the state capital Shreveport . The battle was essentially a continuation of the Battle of Mansfield ( 8 April ) , a Confederate victory , which had caused the Union commander Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks to send his wagons , with most of his artillery , downriver in retreat . However , both sides had been reinforced through the night , and when the Confederate commander Maj. Gen. Richard Taylor launched an assault against the Union line , it was repulsed , though at a high cost in casualties . This led the demoralised Union army to retreat the next day . For this reason , the result of the battle , technically a Union victory , has been disputed by historians ."
