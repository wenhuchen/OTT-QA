  "/wiki/Taiwan_Strait_Tunnel_Project": "The Taiwan Strait Tunnel Project is a proposed undersea tunnel to connect Pingtan in Mainland China to Hsinchu in Taiwan as part of the G3 Beijing-Taipei Expressway . First proposed in 1996 , the project has since been subject to a number of academic discussions and feasibility studies , including by the China Railway Engineering Corporation . The route between Pingtan and Hsinchu was chosen because of its short distance ( compared to other proposed routes ) and its relative geological stability ( in a region frequented by earthquakes ) . One expert from the Chinese Academy of Engineering suggested in 2005 that the Taiwan Strait Tunnel Project was one of five major undersea tunnel projects under consideration for the next twenty to thirty years . The project is not considered viable due to a lack of interest from the Taiwanese , staggering costs and unsolved technical problems . At nearly 150 km , the proposed tunnel would be nearly three times longer than the Channel Tunnel . In addition , Taiwan is concerned about the tunnel 's potential use by China in aggressive military actions . Nonetheless , in July 2013 , the Chinese State Council approved plans for the project .",

Neighbouring states include the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) to the north-west , Japan to the north-east , and the Philippines to the south . The island of Taiwan has an area of 35,808 square kilometres ( 13,826 sq mi ) , with mountain ranges dominating the eastern two-thirds and plains in the western third , where its highly urbanised population is concentrated . Taipei is the capital and largest metropolitan area . Other major cities include Kaohsiung , Taichung , Tainan and Taoyuan . With 23.7 million inhabitants , Taiwan is among the most densely populated states , and is the most populous state and largest economy that is not a member of the United Nations ( UN ) . Taiwanese indigenous peoples settled the island of Taiwan around 6,000 years ago . In the 17th century , Dutch rule opened the island to mass Han immigration . After the brief Kingdom of Tungning in parts of the southern and western areas of the island , the island was annexed in 1683 by the Qing dynasty of China , and ceded to the Empire of Japan in 1895 . Following the surrender of Japan in 1945 , the Republic of China , which had overthrown and succeeded the Qing in 1911 , took control of Taiwan on behalf of the World War II Allies . The resumption of the Chinese Civil War led to the loss of the mainland to the Communist Party of China and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949 . Although the ROC government continued to claim to be the legitimate representative of China , since 1950 its effective jurisdiction has been limited to Taiwan and numerous smaller islands .",

Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty .

[ note 1 ] The first section of the MRT opened on 7 November 1987 , and the network has since grown rapidly in accordance with Singapore 's aim of developing a comprehensive rail network as the backbone of the country 's public transportation system , with an average daily ridership of 3.384 million in 2019 , [ note 2 ] approximately 83% of the bus network 's 4.099 million in the same period . Singapore 's MRT infrastructure is built , operated , and managed in accordance with a hybridised quasi-nationalised regulatory framework called the New Rail Financing Framework ( NRFF ) , in which the lines are constructed and the assets owned by the Land Transport Authority , a statutory board of the Government of Singapore . The Land Transport Authority allocates operating concessions to two for-profit private corporations , namely SMRT and SBS Transit , both of which are responsible for asset maintenance on their respective lines . These operators also run bus and taxi services , thus facilitating the full integration of public transport services . As of January 2020 , the MRT network encompasses 203 kilometres ( 126 mi ) of route on standard gauge , with 122 stations in operation , spread across six lines set in a circle-radial topology . The network is expected to double to a total length of almost 400 kilometres ( 250 mi ) by 2040 as a result of ongoing expansion works to its six existing lines and the construction of three new lines . The network is complemented by a small number of local Light Rail Transit ( LRT ) networks in the suburban towns of Bukit Panjang , Sengkang , and Punggol that link MRT stations with HDB public housing estates , bringing the combined length of the domestic heavy and light rail network to 231.6 kilometres ( 143.9 mi ) , with a total of 159 stations in operation .

Singapore is located about one degree ( 137 kilometres or 85 miles ) north of the equator , and is situated off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula , and by extension , the southernmost extremity of continental Asia . The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia 's Riau Islands , its northern , western , and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia , and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east . It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south , and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans , being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east . The country 's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets , the combined area of which has increased by almost 25% since the country 's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects . Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history , modern Singapore , then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate , was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles , a British colonial officer , established a trading post of the East India Company on the island . In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond . During the Second World War , Imperial Japan successfully invaded Singapore , resulting in an interregnum of British rule corresponding with a brief Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 . Following Japan 's surrender in 1945 , the Straits Settlements were dissolved , with Singapore being returned to British control as a standalone crown colony in 1946 .",

The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries .
