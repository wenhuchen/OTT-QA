Founded after the American Revolution as the seat of government of the newly independent country , Washington was named after George Washington , the first president of the United States and a Founding Father . As the seat of the United States federal government and several international organizations , Washington is an important world political capital . The city , located on the Potomac River bordering Maryland and Virginia , is one of the most visited cities in the world , with more than 20 million tourists annually . The signing of the Residence Act on July 16 , 1790 , approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River on the country 's East Coast . The U.S. Constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress , and the District is therefore not a part of any U.S. state . The states of Maryland and Virginia each donated land to form the federal district , which included the pre-existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria . The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital . In 1846 , Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia , including the city of Alexandria ; in 1871 , it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the District . Washington had an estimated population of 702,455 as of July 2018 [ update ] , making it the 20th most populous city in the United States . Commuters from the surrounding Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city 's daytime population to more than one million during the workweek .

In common parlance , the term is used to denote U.S. Air Force aircraft modified and used to transport the president . The aircraft are prominent symbols of the American presidency and its power . The idea of designating specific military aircraft to transport the President arose in 1943 , when officials of the United States Army Air Forces , the predecessor to the U.S. Air Force , became concerned about using commercial airlines for presidential travel . A C-87 Liberator Express was reconfigured for use as the first dedicated VIP-and-presidential transport aircraft and named Guess Where II , but the Secret Service rejected it because of its safety record . A C-54 Skymaster was then converted for presidential use ; dubbed the Sacred Cow , it carried President Franklin D. Roosevelt to the Yalta Conference in February 1945 and was used for another two years by President Harry S. Truman . The Air Force One call sign was created in 1953 , after a Lockheed Constellation named Columbine II carrying President Dwight D. Eisenhower entered the same airspace as a commercial airline flight using the same flight number . Other Air Force Ones have included another Lockheed Constellation , Columbine III , and two Boeing 707s , introduced in the 1960s and 1970s . Since 1990 , the presidential fleet has consisted of two Boeing VC-25As : highly customized Boeing 747-200B aircraft .

One of the key cities in the British colonization of the Americas , Charles Town played a major role in the slave trade , which laid the foundation for the city 's size and wealth , and was dominated by a slavocracy of plantation owners and slave traders . Independent Charleston slave traders like Joseph Wragg were the first to break through the monopoly of the Royal African Company , pioneering the large-scale slave trade of the 18th century . Historians estimate that nearly half of all Africans brought to America arrived in Charleston , most at Gadsden 's Wharf .

Although no longer being purchased by the U.S. Air Force , improved versions are being built for export customers . In 1993 , General Dynamics sold its aircraft manufacturing business to the Lockheed Corporation , which in turn became part of Lockheed Martin after a 1995 merger with Martin Marietta . The Fighting Falcon 's key features include a frameless bubble canopy for better visibility , side-mounted control stick to ease control while maneuvering , an ejection seat reclined 30 degrees from vertical to reduce the effect of g-forces on the pilot , and the first use of a relaxed static stability/fly-by-wire flight control system which helps to make it an agile aircraft . The F-16 has an internal M61 Vulcan cannon and 11 locations for mounting weapons and other mission equipment . The F-16 's official name is Fighting Falcon , but Viper is commonly used by its pilots and crews , due to a perceived resemblance to a viper snake as well as the Colonial Viper starfighter on Battlestar Galactica which aired at the time the F-16 entered service .
