The series follows Olivia Dunham ( Anna Torv ) , Peter Bishop ( Joshua Jackson ) , and Walter Bishop ( John Noble ) , all members of the fictional Fringe Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , based in Boston , Massachusetts , under the supervision of Homeland Security . The team uses fringe science and FBI investigative techniques to investigate a series of unexplained , often ghastly occurrences , which are related to mysteries surrounding a parallel universe . The series has been described as a hybrid of fantasy , procedural dramas and serials , influenced by films like Altered States and television shows such as Lost , The X-Files and The Twilight Zone . The series began as a traditional mystery-of-the-week series and became more serialized in later seasons . Most episodes contain a standalone plot , with several others also exploring the series ' overarching mythology . Critical reception was at first lukewarm but became more favorable after the first season , when the series began to explore its mythology , including parallel universes and alternate timelines . The show , along with cast and crew , were nominated for many major awards . Despite its move to the Friday night death slot and low ratings , the series developed a cult following . It also spawned two six-part comic book series , an alternate reality game , and three novels .",
