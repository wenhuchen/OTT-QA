  "/wiki/History_of_Iran": "The history of Iran , which was commonly known until the mid-20th century as Persia in the Western world , is intertwined with the history of a larger region , also to an extent known as Greater Iran , comprising the area from Anatolia , the Bosphorus , and Egypt in the west to the borders of Ancient India and the Syr Darya in the east , and from the Caucasus and the Eurasian Steppe in the north to the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman in the south . Iran is home to one of the world 's oldest continuous major civilizations , with historical and urban settlements dating back to 7000 BC . The south-western and western part of the Iranian Plateau participated in the traditional Ancient Near East with Elam , from the Early Bronze Age , and later with various other peoples , such as the Kassites , Mannaeans , and Gutians . Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel calls the Persians the first Historical People . The Medes unified Iran as a nation and empire in 625 BC . The Achaemenid Empire ( 550-330 BC ) , founded by Cyrus the Great , was the first true global superpower state and it ruled from the Balkans to North Africa and also Central Asia , spanning three continents , from their seat of power in Persis ( Persepolis ) . It was the largest empire yet seen and the first world empire . The Achaemenid Empire was the only civilization in all of history to connect over 40% of the global population , accounting for approximately 49.4 million of the world 's 112.4 million people in around 480 BC . They were succeeded by the Seleucid , Parthian , and Sasanian Empires , who successively governed Iran for almost 1,000 years and made Iran once again as a leading power in the world . Persia 's arch-rival was the Roman Empire and its successor , the Byzantine Empire . The Iranian Empire proper begins in the Iron Age , following the influx of Iranian peoples . Iranian people gave rise to the Medes , the Achaemenid , Parthian , and Sasanian Empires of classical antiquity .",

The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City ; other main offices are in Geneva , Nairobi , Vienna and The Hague . The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars , succeeding the ineffective League of Nations . On 25 April 1945 , 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter , which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945 , when the UN began operations . Pursuant to the Charter , the organization 's objectives include maintaining international peace and security , protecting human rights , delivering humanitarian aid , promoting sustainable development , and upholding international law . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; this number grew to 193 in 2011 , representing the vast majority of the world 's sovereign states . The organization 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies . Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring , reporting and confidence-building roles . UN membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s . Since then , 80 former colonies have gained independence , including 11 trust territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council . By the 1970s , the UN 's budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping .",

Several walls were being built from as early as the 7th century BC by ancient Chinese states ; selective stretches were later joined together by Qin Shi Huang ( 220-206 BC ) , the first Emperor of China . Little of the Qin wall remains . Later on , many successive dynasties have built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls . The most well-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty ( 1368-1644 ) . Apart from defense , other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls , allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road , regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration . Furthermore , the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watch towers , troop barracks , garrison stations , signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire , and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor . The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses . Collectively , they stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west , from the present-day Sino-Russian border in the north to Taohe River in the south ; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of Mongolian steppe . A comprehensive archaeological survey , using advanced technologies , has concluded that the walls built by the Ming dynasty measure 8,850 km ( 5,500 mi ) . This is made up of 6,259 km ( 3,889 mi ) sections of actual wall , 359 km ( 223 mi ) of trenches and 2,232 km ( 1,387 mi ) of natural defensive barriers such as hills and rivers .

  "/wiki/Traditional_water_sources_of_Persian_antiquity": "Most rivers in Iran are seasonal and have traditionally not been able to supply the needs of urban settlements . Major rivers like the Arvand , Aras , Zayandeh , Sefid and Atrak were few and far between in the vast lands of Persian antiquity . With the growth of urban settlements during the ages , locally dug deep wells ( up to 100 meters deep ) could no longer keep up with the demand , leading to the systematic digging of a specialized network of canals known as Qanat .",
  "/wiki/Qanat": "A qanat or kariz is a gently sloping underground channel to transport water from an aquifer or water well to surface for irrigation and drinking , acting as an underground aqueduct . This is an old system of water supply from a deep well with a series of vertical access shafts . The qanats still create a reliable supply of water for human settlements and irrigation in hot , arid , and semi-arid climates , but the value of this system is directly related to the quality , volume , and regularity of the water flow . Traditionally qanats are built by a group of skilled laborers , muqann\u012bs , with hand labor . The profession historically paid well and was typically handed down from father to son . According to most sources , the qanat technology was developed in ancient Iran by the Persian people sometime in the early 1st millennium BC , and spread from there slowly westward and eastward .

Its history dates back to at least 5,000 BC with characteristic examples distributed over a vast area from Turkey and Iraq to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan , and from the Caucasus to Zanzibar . Persian buildings vary from peasant huts to tea houses , and garden pavilions to some of the most majestic structures the world has ever seen . In addition to historic gates , palaces , and mosques , the rapid growth of cities such as the capital Tehran has brought about a wave of demolition and new construction . Iranian architecture displays great variety , both structural and aesthetic , from a variety of traditions and experience . Without sudden innovations , and despite the repeated trauma of invasions and cultural shocks , it has achieved an individuality distinct from that of other Muslim countries . Its paramount virtues are : a marked feeling for form and scale ; structural inventiveness , especially in vault and dome construction ; a genius for decoration with a freedom and success not rivaled in any other architecture . Traditionally , the guiding formative motif of Iranian architecture has been its cosmic symbolism by which man is brought into communication and participation with the powers of heaven . This theme has not only given unity and continuity to the architecture of Persia , but has been a primary source of its emotional character as well . According to American historian and archaeologist Arthur Pope , the supreme Iranian art , in the proper meaning of the word , has always been its architecture . The supremacy of architecture applies to both pre- and post-Islamic periods .",

With a population of around 8.7 million in the city and 15 million in the larger metropolitan area of Greater Tehran , Tehran is the most populous city in Iran and Western Asia , and has the second-largest metropolitan area in the Middle East ( after Cairo ) . It is ranked 24th in the world by the population of its metropolitan area . In the Classical era , part of the territory of present-day Tehran was occupied by Rhages , a prominent Median city . It was subject to destruction through the medieval Arab , Turkic , and Mongol invasions . Its modern-day inheritor remains as an urban area absorbed into the metropolitan area of Greater Tehran . Tehran was first chosen as the capital of Iran by Agha Mohammad Khan of the Qajar dynasty in 1786 , in order to remain within close reach of Iran 's territories in the Caucasus , before being separated from Iran as a result of the Russo-Iranian Wars , and to avoid the vying factions of the previously ruling Iranian dynasties . The capital has been moved several times throughout history , and Tehran is the 32nd national capital of Iran . Large-scale demolition and rebuilding began in the 1920s , and Tehran has been a destination for mass migrations from all over Iran since the 20th century . Tehran is home to many historical collections , including the royal complexes of Golestan , Sa'dabad , and Niavaran , where the two last dynasties of the former Imperial State of Iran were seated .

Carpet weaving is an essential part of Persian culture and Iranian art . Within the group of Oriental rugs produced by the countries of the so-called rug belt , the Persian carpet stands out by the variety and elaborateness of its manifold designs . Persian carpets and rugs of various types were woven in parallel by nomadic tribes , in village and town workshops , and by royal court manufactories alike . As such , they represent different , simultaneous lines of tradition , and reflect the history of Iran and its various peoples . The carpets woven in the Safavid court manufactories of Isfahan during the sixteenth century are famous for their elaborate colours and artistical design , and are treasured in museums and private collections all over the world today . Their patterns and designs have set an artistic tradition for court manufactories which was kept alive during the entire duration of the Persian Empire up to the last royal dynasty of Iran . Carpets woven in towns and regional centers like Tabriz , Kerman , Mashhad , Kashan , Isfahan , Nain and Qom are characterized by their specific weaving techniques and use of high-quality materials , colours and patterns . Town manufactories like those of Tabriz have played an important historical role in reviving the tradition of carpet weaving after periods of decline . Rugs woven by the villages and various tribes of Iran are distinguished by their fine wool , bright and elaborate colours , and specific , traditional patterns . Nomadic and small village weavers often produce rugs with bolder and sometimes more coarse designs , which are considered as the most authentic and traditional rugs of Persia , as opposed to the artistic , pre-planned designs of the larger workplaces . Gabbeh rugs are the best-known type of carpet from this line of tradition .",
  "/wiki/Carpet": "A carpet is a textile floor covering typically consisting of an upper layer of pile attached to a backing . The pile was traditionally made from wool , but since the 20th century , synthetic fibers such as polypropylene , nylon or polyester are often used , as these fibers are less expensive than wool . The pile usually consists of twisted tufts that are typically heat-treated to maintain their structure . The term carpet is often used interchangeably with the term rug , although rugs are typically considered to be smaller than a room and not attached to the floor . Carpets are used for a variety of purposes , including insulating a person 's feet from a cold tile or concrete floor , making a room more comfortable as a place to sit on the floor ( e.g. , when playing with children or as a prayer rug ) , reducing sound from walking ( particularly in apartment buildings ) , and adding decoration or colour to a room . Carpets can be made in any colour by using differently dyed fibers . Carpets can have many different types of patterns and motifs used to decorate the surface . Carpets are used in industrial and commercial establishments such as retail stores and hotels and in private homes . Today , a huge range of carpets and rugs are available at many price and quality levels , ranging from inexpensive , synthetic carpets that are mass-produced in factories and used in commercial buildings to costly hand-knotted wool rugs that are used in private homes of wealthy families . Carpets can be produced on a loom quite similar to woven fabric , made using needle felts , knotted by hand ( in oriental rugs ) , made with their pile injected into a backing material ( called tufting ) , flatwoven , made by hooking wool or cotton through the meshes of a sturdy fabric , or embroidered . Carpet is commonly made in widths of 12 feet ( 3.7 m ) and 15 feet ( 4.6 m ) in the US and 4 m ( 13 ft ) and 5 m ( 16 ft ) in Europe . Since the 19th and 20th century , where necessary for wall-to-wall carpet , different widths of carpet can be seamed together with a seaming iron and seam tape ( formerly it was sewn together ) and fixed to a floor over a cushioned underlay ( pad ) using nails , tack strips ( known in the UK as gripper rods ) , adhesives , or occasionally decorative metal stair rods .",
