The Master System launched in North America in 1986 , followed by Europe in 1987 , and Brazil in 1989 . A Japanese version of the Master System was also launched in 1987 , which features a few enhancements over the export models ( and by proxy the original Mark III ) : a built-in FM audio chip , a rapid-fire switch , and a dedicated port for the 3D glasses . A cost-reduced model known as the Master System II was released in 1990 in North America and Europe . The original Master System models use both cartridges and a credit card-sized format known as Sega Cards . Accessories for the consoles include a light gun and 3D glasses that work with a range of specially designed games . The later Master System II redesign removed the card slot , turning it into a strictly cartridge-only system and is incompatible with the 3D glasses . The Master System was released in competition with the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) . Its library is smaller and with fewer well-reviewed games than the NES , due in part to Nintendo licensing policies requiring platform exclusivity . Though the Master System had newer , improved hardware , it failed to overturn Nintendo 's significant market share advantage in Japan and North America . However , it attained significantly more success in Europe and Brazil .",

After the debut of the Nintendo 64 in late 1996 , the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S. , where it was discontinued in 1998 . Having sold 9.26 million units worldwide , the Saturn is considered a commercial failure . The failure of Sega 's development teams to release a game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series , known in development as Sonic X-treme , has been considered a factor in the console 's poor performance . Although the Saturn is remembered for several well regarded games , including Nights into Dreams , the Panzer Dragoon series , and the Virtua Fighter series , its reputation is mixed due to its complex hardware design and limited third-party support . Sega 's management has been criticized for its decisions during the system 's development and discontinuation .",
