  "/wiki/Argentina": "Argentina ( Spanish : [ a\u027exen\u02c8tina ] ) , officially the Argentine Republic [ A ] ( Spanish : Rep\u00fablica Argentina ) , is a country located mostly in the southern half of South America . Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with Chile to the west , the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north , Brazil to the northeast , Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east , and the Drake Passage to the south . With a mainland area of 2,780,400 km2 ( 1,073,500 sq mi ) , [ B ] Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world , the fourth largest in the Americas , the second largest in South America after Brazil , and the largest Spanish-speaking nation . The sovereign state is subdivided into twenty-three provinces ( Spanish : provincias , singular provincia ) and one autonomous city ( ciudad aut\u00f3noma ) , Buenos Aires , which is the federal capital of the nation ( Spanish : Capital Federal ) as decided by Congress . The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions , but exist under a federal system . Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica , the Falkland Islands ( Spanish : Islas Malvinas ) , and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period . The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times . The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century . Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810-1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with several waves of European immigration , mainly Italians and Spaniards , radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook ; 62.5% of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry , and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture .",

Canaanite tribes are archaeologically attested since the Middle Bronze Age , while the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah emerged during the Iron Age . The Neo-Assyrian Empire destroyed Israel around 720 BCE . Judah was later conquered by the Babylonian , Persian and Hellenistic empires and had existed as Jewish autonomous provinces . The successful Maccabean Revolt led to an independent Hasmonean kingdom by 110 BCE , which in 63 BCE however became a client state of the Roman Republic that subsequently installed the Herodian dynasty in 37 BCE , and in 6 CE created the Roman province of Judea . Judea lasted as a Roman province until the failed Jewish revolts resulted in widespread destruction , the expulsion of the Jewish population and the renaming of the region from Iudaea to Syria Palaestina . Jewish presence in the region has persisted to a certain extent over the centuries . In the 7th century CE , the Levant was taken from the Byzantine Empire by the Arabs and remained in Muslim control until the First Crusade of 1099 , followed by the Ayyubid conquest of 1187 .",

His work combined geometric abstraction with a dynamic organization of form in small reliefs and constructions , monumental public sculpture and pioneering kinetic works that assimilated new materials such as nylon , wire , lucite and semi-transparent materials , glass and metal . Responding to the scientific and political revolutions of his age , Gabo led an eventful and peripatetic life , moving to Berlin , Paris , Oslo , Moscow , London , and finally the United States , and within the circles of the major avant-garde movements of the day , including Cubism , Futurism , Constructivism , the Bauhaus , de Stijl and the Abstraction-Cr\u00e9ation group . Two preoccupations , unique to Gabo , were his interest in representing negative space - released from any closed volume or mass - and time . He famously explored the former idea in his Linear Construction works ( 1942-1971 ) - used nylon filament to create voids or interior spaces as concrete as the elements of solid mass - and the latter in his pioneering work , Kinetic Sculpture ( Standing Waves ) ( 1920 ) , often considered the first kinetic work of art . Gabo elaborated many of his ideas in the Constructivist Realistic Manifesto , which he issued with his brother , sculptor Antoine Pevsner as a handbill accompanying their 1920 open-air exhibition in Moscow . In it , he sought to move past Cubism and Futurism , renouncing what he saw as the static , decorative use of color , line , volume and solid mass in favor of a new element he called the kinetic rhythms ( \u2026 ) the basic forms of our perception of real time . Gabo held a utopian belief in the power of sculpture - specifically abstract , Constructivist sculpture - to express human experience and spirituality in tune with modernity , social progress , and advances in science and technology . After working on a smaller scale in England during the war years ( 1936-1946 ) , Gabo moved to the United States , where he received several public sculpture commissions , only some of which he completed . These include Constructie , an 81-foot commemorative monument in front of the Bijenkorf Department Store ( 1954 , unveiled in 1957 ) in Rotterdam , and Revolving Torsion , a large fountain outside St Thomas Hospital in London .

Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas .",
