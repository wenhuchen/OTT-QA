  "/wiki/Sheriff_Hill": "Sheriff Hill is a suburb in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead in Tyne and Wear , England . It lies on the B1296 road 2 miles ( 3.2 km ) south of Gateshead , 2.5 miles ( 4.0 km ) south of Newcastle upon Tyne and 12 miles ( 19 km ) north of the historic city of Durham . According to the 2001 UK census it had a population of 5,051 . Historically part of Gateshead Fell in County Durham , Sheriff Hill was the site of a battle between William the Conqueror and Malcolm III of Scotland in 1068 . A road was built through Gateshead Fell in the early 13th century , attracting some settlers . A procession of bishops , sheriffs and noblemen known as the Sheriff 's March took place on the road in 1282 and continued biannually until the 1830s . By then , Gateshead Fell had been enclosed and a village had grown around the road , largely populated by an influx of tinkers , coalminers working at Sheriff Hill Colliery and workers at the local pottery , mill and sandstone quarry . By the turn of the 20th century these industries were in steep decline . The local authority built a large council estate at Sheriff Hill to alleviate dangerous overcrowding in Gateshead , effectively turning the area into a residential suburb . It ceased to be an independent village on 1 April 1974 when it was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead under the terms of the Local Government Act 1972 . Now part of the local council ward of High Fell , the suburb is economically disadvantaged compared with other areas of the borough and nationally , with high levels of unemployment . Sheriff Hill was the site of one of Gateshead 's largest boarding schools but as of 2012 , the only remaining educational establishment is Glynwood Primary School .",

  "/wiki/Methodist": "Methodism is an umbrella term used to describe denominations of Protestant Christianity which follow the line of the Methodist movement . Methodist denominations are historically related and derive their doctrine of practice and belief from the life and teachings of John Wesley . George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . [ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals , collectively known as the Social Gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people .",

One of the more populous of the two dozen or so villages which now comprise the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead , Low Fell has a long and rich history . In stark contrast to the industrial development of its near neighbour Sheriff Hill , the settlement at Low Fell developed through the building of a new road to bypass the steep turnpike road which ran through Sheriff Hill , which in turn encouraged both private enterprise ( particularly public houses ) and the incumbency of dozens of wealthy individuals who built substantial villas in which they could escape the dirt and grime of 19th century Newcastle upon Tyne . Several of these villas remain today and contribute to the dozen Grade II listed buildings in the suburb , which has continued to develop into an affluent area with a village feel .

  "/wiki/Photographic_paper": "Photographic paper is a paper coated with a light-sensitive chemical formula , used for making photographic prints . When photographic paper is exposed to light , it captures a latent image that is then developed to form a visible image ; with most papers the image density from exposure can be sufficient to not require further development , aside from fixing and clearing , though latent exposure is also usually present . The light-sensitive layer of the paper is called the emulsion . The most common chemistry was based on silver salts ( the focus of this page ) but other alternatives have also been used . The print image is traditionally produced by interposing a photographic negative between the light source and the paper , either by direct contact with a large negative ( forming a contact print ) or by projecting the shadow of the negative onto the paper ( producing an enlargement ) . The initial light exposure is carefully controlled to produce a gray scale image on the paper with appropriate contrast and gradation . Photographic paper may also be exposed to light using digital printers such as the LightJet , with a camera ( to produce a photographic negative ) , by scanning a modulated light source over the paper , or by placing objects upon it ( to produce a photogram ) . Despite the introduction of digital photography , photographic papers are still sold commercially .

It is well known in many countries , especially in the English-speaking world , its traditional use being to bid farewell to the old year at the stroke of midnight on New Year 's Eve . By extension , it is also sung at funerals , graduations , and as a farewell or ending to other occasions . The international Scouting movement in many countries uses it to close jamborees and other functions . The poem 's Scots title may be translated into standard English as old long since or , more idiomatically , long long ago , days gone by , or old times . Consequently , For auld lang syne , as it appears in the first line of the chorus , might be loosely translated as for the sake of old times . The phrase Auld Lang Syne is also used in similar poems by Robert Ayton ( 1570-1638 ) , Allan Ramsay ( 1686-1757 ) , and James Watson ( 1711 ) , as well as older folk songs predating Burns . Matthew Fitt uses the phrase in the days of auld lang syne as the equivalent of once upon a time in his retelling of fairy tales in the Scots language .",

  "/wiki/Suffragette": "A suffragette was a member of militant women 's organisations in the early 20th century who , under the banner Votes for Women , fought for the right to vote in public elections , known as women 's suffrage . The term refers in particular to members of the British Women 's Social and Political Union ( WSPU ) , a women-only movement founded in 1903 by Emmeline Pankhurst , which engaged in direct action and civil disobedience . In 1906 , a reporter writing in the Daily Mail coined the term suffragette for the WSPU , from suffragist , to belittle the women advocating women 's suffrage . The militants embraced the new name , even adopting it for use as the title of the newspaper published by the WSPU . Women had won the right to vote in several countries by the end of the 19th century ; in 1893 , New Zealand became the first self-governing country to grant the vote to all women over the age of 21 . When by 1903 women in Britain had not been enfranchised , Pankhurst decided that women had to do the work ourselves ; the WSPU motto became deeds , not words . The suffragettes heckled politicians , tried to storm parliament , were attacked and sexually assaulted during battles with the police , chained themselves to railings , smashed windows , set fire to postboxes and empty buildings , set bombs in order to damage churches and property , and faced anger and ridicule in the media . When imprisoned they went on hunger strike , to which the government responded by force-feeding them . The first suffragette to be force fed was Evaline Hilda Burkitt . The death of one suffragette , Emily Davison , when she ran in front of the king 's horse at the 1913 Epsom Derby , made headlines around the world . The WSPU campaign had varying levels of support from within the suffragette movement ; breakaway groups formed , and within the WSPU itself not all members supported the direct action . The suffragette campaign was suspended when World War I broke out in 1914 .",
  "/wiki/Fabian_Society": "The Fabian Society is a British socialist organisation whose purpose is to advance the principles of democratic socialism via gradualist and reformist effort in democracies , rather than by revolutionary overthrow . As one of the founding organisations of the Labour Representation Committee in 1900 , and as an important influence upon the Labour Party which grew from it , the Fabian Society has had a powerful influence on British politics . Other members of the Fabian Society have included political leaders from countries formerly part of the British Empire , such as Jawaharlal Nehru , who adopted Fabian principles as part of their own political ideologies . The Fabian Society founded the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1895 . Today , the society functions primarily as a think tank and is one of 21 socialist societies affiliated with the Labour Party . Similar societies exist in Australia ( the Australian Fabian Society ) , in Canada ( the Douglas-Coldwell Foundation and the now disbanded League for Social Reconstruction ) , in Sicily ( Sicilian Fabian Society ) and in New Zealand ( The NZ Fabian Society ) .",

  "/wiki/Listed_building": "A listed building , or listed structure , is one that has been placed on one of the four statutory lists maintained by Historic England in England , Historic Environment Scotland in Scotland , Cadw in Wales , and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency in Northern Ireland . The term has also been used in Ireland , where buildings are surveyed for the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage in accordance with the country 's obligations under the Granada Convention . However , the preferred term in Ireland is protected structure . A listed building may not be demolished , extended , or altered without special permission from the local planning authority , which typically consults the relevant central government agency , particularly for significant alterations to the more notable listed buildings . In England and Wales , a national amenity society must be notified of any work to a listed building which involves any element of demolition . Exemption from secular listed building control is provided for some buildings in current use for worship , but only in cases where the relevant religious organisation operates its own equivalent permissions procedure . Owners of listed buildings are , in some circumstances , compelled to repair and maintain them and can face criminal prosecution if they fail to do so or if they perform unauthorised alterations . When alterations are permitted , or when listed buildings are repaired or maintained , the owners are often required to use specific materials or techniques . Although most sites appearing on the lists are buildings , other structures such as bridges , monuments , sculptures , war memorials , and even milestones and mileposts and The Beatles ' Abbey Road pedestrian crossing are also listed . Ancient , military , and uninhabited structures , such as Stonehenge , are sometimes instead classified as scheduled monuments and protected by much older legislation , whilst cultural landscapes such as parks and gardens are currently listed on a non-statutory basis .",

On the death of his grandmother in 1901 , George 's father ascended the throne as Edward VII , and George was created Prince of Wales . He became king-emperor on his father 's death in 1910 . George V 's reign saw the rise of socialism , communism , fascism , Irish republicanism , and the Indian independence movement , all of which radically changed the political landscape . The Parliament Act 1911 established the supremacy of the elected British House of Commons over the unelected House of Lords . As a result of the First World War ( 1914-1918 ) , the empires of his first cousins Nicholas II of Russia and Wilhelm II of Germany fell , while the British Empire expanded to its greatest effective extent . In 1917 , George became the first monarch of the House of Windsor , which he renamed from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha as a result of anti-German public sentiment . In 1924 he appointed the first Labour ministry and in 1931 the Statute of Westminster recognised the dominions of the Empire as separate , independent states within the British Commonwealth of Nations . He had smoking-related health problems throughout much of his later reign and at his death was succeeded by his eldest son , Edward VIII .",

A peculiarity of the Army is that it gives its clergy titles of military ranks , such as lieutenant or major . It does not celebrate the rites of Baptism and Holy Communion . However , the Army 's doctrine is otherwise typical of holiness churches in the Wesleyan-Arminian tradition . The Army 's purposes are the advancement of the Christian religion . of education , the relief of poverty , and other charitable objects beneficial to society or the community of mankind as a whole . The Army was founded in 1865 in London by one-time Methodist circuit-preacher William Booth and his wife Catherine as the East London Christian Mission , and can trace its origins to the Blind Beggar tavern . In 1878 Booth reorganised the mission , becoming its first General and introducing the military structure which has been retained as a matter of tradition ."
