  "/wiki/United_States": "The United States of America ( USA ) , commonly known as the United States ( U.S. or US ) or America , is a country consisting of 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . [ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",
  "/wiki/Lieutenant_colonel_(United_States)": "In the United States Army , U.S. Marine Corps , and U.S. Air Force , lieutenant colonel is a field-grade military officer rank , just above the rank of major and just below the rank of colonel .

  "/wiki/Austria-Hungary": "Austria-Hungary , often referred to as the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Dual Monarchy , was a constitutional monarchy in Central and Eastern Europe between 1867 and 1918 . It was formed when the Austrian Empire adopted a new constitution ; as a result Austria ( Cisleithania ) and Hungary ( Transleithania ) were placed on equal footing . It dissolved when its member states proclaimed sovereignty and independence following the First World War . The union was established by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 on 30 March 1867 in the aftermath of the Austro-Prussian War . It consisted of two monarchies ( Austria and Hungary ) , and one autonomous region : the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia under the Hungarian crown , which negotiated the Croatian-Hungarian Settlement in 1868 . It was ruled by the House of Habsburg , and constituted the last phase in the constitutional evolution of the Habsburg Monarchy . Following the 1867 reforms , the Austrian and Hungarian states were co-equal in power . Foreign and military affairs came under joint oversight , but all other governmental faculties were divided between respective states . Austria-Hungary was a multinational state and one of Europe 's major powers at the time . Austria-Hungary was geographically the second-largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire , at 621,538 km2 ( 239,977 sq mi ) , and the third-most populous ( after Russia and the German Empire ) . The Empire built up the fourth-largest machine building industry of the world , after the United States , Germany , and the United Kingdom .

It is composed of nine federated states ( Bundesl\u00e4nder ) , one of which is Vienna , Austria 's capital and its largest city . It is bordered by Germany to the northwest , Czech Republic to the north , Slovakia to the northeast , Hungary to the east , Slovenia and Italy to the south , and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west . Austria occupies an area of 83,879 km2 ( 32,386 sq mi ) and has a population of nearly 9 million people . While German is the country 's official language , many Austrians communicate informally in a variety of Bavarian dialects . Austria initially emerged as a margraviate around 976 and developed into a duchy and archduchy . In the 16th century , Austria started serving as the heart of the Habsburg Monarchy and the junior branch of the House of Habsburg - one of the most influential royal dynasties in history . As an archduchy , it was a major component and administrative centre of the Holy Roman Empire . Early in the 19th century , Austria established its own empire , which became a great power and the leading force of the German Confederation but pursued its own course independently of the other German states . Following the Austro-Prussian War and the compromise with Hungary , the Dual Monarchy was established . Austria was involved in World War I under Emperor Franz Joseph following the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand , the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne . After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy , the Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed with the intent of the union with Germany , which eventually failed because of the Allied Powers and the state remained unrecognized .",
  "/wiki/Nazi_Germany": "Nazi Germany is the common English name for Germany between 1933 and 1945 , when Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party ( NSDAP ) controlled the country through a dictatorship . Under Hitler 's rule , Germany became a totalitarian state where nearly all aspects of life were controlled by the government . The official name of the state was Deutsches Reich ( German Reich ) until 1943 and Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich ( Greater German Reich ) from 1943 to 1945 . Nazi Germany is also known as the Third Reich ( Drittes Reich ) , meaning Third Realm or Third Empire , the first two being the Holy Roman Empire ( 800-1806 ) and the German Empire ( 1871-1918 ) . The Nazi regime ended after the Allies defeated Germany in May 1945 , ending World War II in Europe . Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by the President of the Weimar Republic , Paul von Hindenburg , on 30 January 1933 . The NSDAP then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power . Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the offices and powers of the Chancellery and Presidency . A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole F\u00fchrer ( leader ) of Germany . All power was centralised in Hitler 's person and his word became the highest law . The government was not a coordinated , co-operating body , but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler 's favour .

  "/wiki/Independent_State_of_Croatia": "The Independent State of Croatia ( Serbo-Croatian : Nezavisna Dr\u017eava Hrvatska , NDH ; German : Unabh\u00e4ngiger Staat Kroatien ; Italian : Stato indipendente di Croazia ) was a World War II-era puppet state of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy . It was established in parts of occupied Yugoslavia on 10 April 1941 , after the invasion by the Axis powers . Its territory consisted of most of modern-day Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina , as well as some parts of modern-day Serbia and Slovenia , but also excluded many Croat-populated areas in Dalmatia ( until late 1943 ) , Istria , and Me\u0111imurje regions ( which today are part of Croatia ) . During its entire existence , the NDH was governed as a one-party state by the fascist Usta\u0161a organization . The Usta\u0161e was led by the Poglavnik , Ante Paveli\u0107 . [ note 3 ] The regime targeted Serbs , Jews and Roma as part of a large-scale campaign of genocide , as well as anti-fascist or dissident Croats and Bosnian Muslims . Between 1941-45 , 22 concentration camps existed inside the territory controlled by the Independent State of Croatia , two of which ( Jastrebarsko and Sisak ) housed only children and the largest of which was Jasenovac . The state was officially a monarchy after the signing of the Laws of the Crown of Zvonimir on 15 May 1941 . Appointed by Victor Emmanuel III of Italy , Prince Aimone , Duke of Aosta initially refused to assume the crown in opposition to the Italian annexation of the Croat-majority populated region of Dalmatia , annexed as part of the Italian irredentist agenda of creating a Mare Nostrum ( Our Sea ) . He later briefly accepted the throne due to pressure from Victor Emmanuel III and was titled Tomislav II of Croatia , but never moved from Italy to reside in Croatia . From the signing of the Treaties of Rome on 18 May 1941 until the Italian capitulation on 8 September 1943 , the state was a territorial condominium of Germany and Italy . In its judgement in the Hostages Trial , the Nuremberg Military Tribunal concluded that NDH was not a sovereign state .",

In the Netherlands the rank overste is used as a synonym for a lieutenant colonel .",
  "/wiki/Generaloberst": "Generaloberst , in English colonel general , was , in Germany and Austria-Hungary - the German Reichswehr and Wehrmacht , the Austro-Hungarian Common Army , and the East German National People 's Army , as well as the respective police services - the second highest general officer rank , ranking as equal to a 4 star full general but below general field marshal . It was equivalent to Generaladmiral in the Kriegsmarine until 1945 , or to Flottenadmiral in the Volksmarine until 1990 . The rank was the highest ordinary military rank and the highest military rank awarded in peacetime ; the higher rank of general field marshal was only awarded in wartime by the head of state . In general , a Generaloberst had the same privileges as a general field marshal . A literal translation of Generaloberst would be uppermost general , but it is often translated as colonel-general by analogy to Oberst , colonel , including in countries where the rank was adopted , e.g . in Russia ( \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b-\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a , general-polkovnik ) . Oberst derives from the superlative form of Germanic ober ( upper ) , cognate to English over , thus Superior General might be a more idiomatic rendering . The rank was created in 1854 , originally for Emperor William I - then Prince of Prussia - because traditionally members of the royal family were not promoted to the rank of field marshal . During the 19th century the rank was largely honorary and usually only held by members of the princely families or the Governor of Berlin . Regular promotion of professional officers to the grade did not begin until 1911 . Since the rank of Generalfeldmarschall was also reserved for wartime promotions , the additional rank of a supreme general in the capacity of a field marshal - the Generaloberst im Range eines Generalfeldmarschalls - was created for promotions during peacetime . Such generals were entitled to wear four pips on their shoulder boards , compared to the normal three .",

  "/wiki/Admiral": "Admiral is one of the highest ranks in some navies , and in many navies is the highest rank .

Although initially the dynasty was of Turkic origin , it was Persianised in terms of language , culture , literature and habits .
