Sodwana Bay National Park is a narrow strip of forested sand dunes located along the east coast . Proclaimed a national park in the 1950s , it is frequented by anglers and divers . Sodwana is situated in the Maputaland Marine Protected Area and is the only recreational scuba diving area along the Greater St Lucia Wetlands Park ( now renamed to iSimangaliso ) coastline . Classified as one of the top dive sites in the world [ citation needed ] , the park is visited by some 35 000 scuba divers per year . The bay is near the southern end of the tropical western Indo-Pacific marine ecoregion , and reef-building corals are present . The 50 km reef complex is the habitat of a wide diversity of resident and migratory species . Several submarine canyons cut into the edge of the continental shelf , which is very close to the shoreline . It was in one of these that on 27 November 2000 that a resident population of coelacanths was discovered . Sailfish , king mackerel , kingfish and other pelagic species of game fish migrate south down the east coast of Africa and since the activities of sea pirates off the coast of north east Africa healthy populations of pelagic game fish again reach all the way south off the coast of South Africa which has re-established Sodwana as a sport fishing destination for pelagic species .",
