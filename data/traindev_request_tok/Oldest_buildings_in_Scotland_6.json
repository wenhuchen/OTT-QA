It is Scotland 's third most populous city , one of Scotland 's 32 local government council areas and the United Kingdom 's 39th most populous built-up area , with an official population estimate of 196,670 for the city of Aberdeen and 227,560 for the local council area . During the mid-18th to mid-20th centuries , Aberdeen 's buildings incorporated locally quarried grey granite , which can sparkle like silver because of its high mica content . Since the discovery of North Sea oil in the 1970s , Aberdeen has been known as the off-shore oil capital of Europe . The area around Aberdeen has been settled for at least 8,000 years , when prehistoric villages lay around the mouths of the rivers Dee and Don . The city has a long , sandy coastline and a marine climate , the latter resulting in chilly summers and mild winters . Aberdeen received Royal burgh status from David I of Scotland ( 1124-1153 ) , transforming the city economically . The city has two universities , the University of Aberdeen , founded in 1495 , and Robert Gordon University , which was awarded university status in 1992 , making Aberdeen the educational centre of north-east Scotland . The traditional industries of fishing , paper-making , shipbuilding , and textiles have been overtaken by the oil industry and Aberdeen 's seaport . Aberdeen Heliport is one of the busiest commercial heliports in the world and the seaport is the largest in the north-east of Scotland . Aberdeen used to host the Aberdeen International Youth Festival , a major international event which attracted up to 1000 of the most talented young performing arts companies but the council ended funding in 2017 and the festival was wound up in 2018 . In 2015 , Mercer named Aberdeen the 57th most liveable city in the world , as well as the fourth most liveable city in Britain .",

  "/wiki/Bronze_Age": "The Bronze Age is a historical period that was characterized by the use of bronze , and in some areas proto-writing , and other early features of urban civilization . The Bronze Age is the second principal period of the three-age Stone-Bronze-Iron system , as proposed in modern times by Christian J\u00fcrgensen Thomsen , for classifying and studying ancient societies . An ancient civilization is defined to be in the Bronze Age either by producing bronze by smelting its own copper and alloying with tin , arsenic , or other metals , or by trading for bronze from production areas elsewhere . Bronze itself is harder and more durable than other metals available at the time , allowing Bronze Age civilizations to gain a technological advantage . Whilst terrestrial iron is naturally abundant , its high melting point of 1,538 \u00b0C ( 2,800 \u00b0F ) placed it out of reach of common use until the end of the second millennium BC . Tin 's low melting point of 231.9 \u00b0C ( 449.4 \u00b0F ) and copper 's relatively moderate melting point of 1,085 \u00b0C ( 1,985 \u00b0F ) placed them within the capabilities of the Neolithic pottery kilns , which date back to 6000 BC and were able to produce temperatures greater than 900 \u00b0C ( 1,650 \u00b0F ) . Copper-tin ores are rare , as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in Western Asia before trading in bronze began in the third millennium BC . Worldwide , the Bronze Age generally followed the Neolithic period , with the Chalcolithic serving as a transition . Although the Iron Age generally followed the Bronze Age , in some areas ( such as Sub-Saharan Africa ) , the Iron Age began as early as 2500 BC . Bronze Age cultures differed in their development of the first writing . According to archaeological evidence , cultures in Mesopotamia ( cuneiform script ) and Egypt ( hieroglyphs ) developed the earliest viable writing systems .",

  "/wiki/Cistercian": "The Cistercians ( /s\u026a\u02c8st\u025c\u02d0r\u0283\u0259nz/ ) officially the Order of Cistercians ( Latin : ( Sacer ) Ordo Cisterciensis , abbreviated as OCist or SOCist ) , are a Catholic religious order of monks and nuns that branched off from the Benedictines and follow the Rule of Saint Benedict . They are also known as Bernardines , after the highly influential Bernard of Clairvaux ( though that term is also used of one of the Franciscan Orders in Poland and Lithuania ) ; or as White Monks , in reference to the colour of the cuccula or white choir robe worn by the Cistercians over their habits , as opposed to the black cuccula worn by Benedictine monks . The term Cistercian ( French Cistercien ) , derives from Cistercium , the Latin name for the village of C\u00eeteaux , near Dijon in eastern France . It was in this village that a group of Benedictine monks from the monastery of Molesme founded C\u00eeteaux Abbey in 1098 , with the goal of following more closely the Rule of Saint Benedict . The best known of them were Robert of Molesme , Alberic of C\u00eeteaux and the English monk Stephen Harding , who were the first three abbots . Bernard of Clairvaux entered the monastery in the early 1110s with 30 companions and helped the rapid proliferation of the order . By the end of the 12th century , the order had spread throughout France and into England , Wales , Scotland , Ireland , Spain , Portugal , Italy , Scandinavia and Eastern Europe . The keynote of Cistercian life was a return to literal observance of the Rule of St Benedict . Rejecting the developments the Benedictines had undergone , the monks tried to replicate monastic life as it had been in Saint Benedict 's time ; indeed in various points they went beyond it in austerity . The most striking feature in the reform was the return to manual labour , especially agricultural work in the fields , a special characteristic of Cistercian life . The Cistercians also made major contributions to culture and technology in medieval Europe : Cistercian architecture is considered one of the most beautiful styles of medieval architecture ; and the Cistercians were the main force of technological diffusion in fields such as agriculture , hydraulic engineering , and metallurgy . The original emphasis of Cistercian life was on manual labour and self-sufficiency , and many abbeys have traditionally supported themselves through activities such as agriculture and brewing ales .",

These may include a hospice , a school , and a range of agricultural and manufacturing buildings such as a barn , a forge , or a brewery . In English usage , the term monastery is generally used to denote the buildings of a community of monks . In modern usage , convent tends to be applied only to institutions of female monastics ( nuns ) , particularly communities of teaching or nursing religious sisters .

It lies around 2 miles ( 3.2 km ) west of North Berwick , and around 19 miles ( 31 km ) east of Edinburgh . The oldest parts of the castle date to the 13th century , and it was abandoned by the end of the 17th century . Begun in around 1240 by John De Vaux , the castle was heavily damaged during the Wars of Scottish Independence , when it was twice taken by the English . In the 14th century , Dirleton was repaired by the Haliburton family , and it was acquired by the Ruthvens in 1505 . The Ruthvens were involved in several plots against Mary , Queen of Scots , and King James VI , and eventually forfeited the castle in 1600 . Dirleton ceased to be a residence , although Oliver Cromwell was forced to besiege the castle to flush out a band of mosstroopers ( marauders ) , during the Third English Civil War in 1650 . The damaged castle was then acquired by John Nisbet , Lord Dirleton , who decided to build a new country house on the nearby Archerfield Estate . The Nisbet family of Dirleton continued to maintain the castle 's gardens , before handing Dirleton into state care in 1923 . The ruins and gardens are now maintained by Historic Environment Scotland . Dirleton Castle stands on a rocky outcrop , at the heart of the rich agricultural lands of the barony of Dirleton , and guards the coastal approach to Edinburgh from England , via the port of North Berwick . The ruins comprise a 13th-century keep , and a 16th-century house which the Ruthvens built adjacent .",

  "/wiki/Edinburgh_Castle": "Edinburgh Castle is a historic fortress which dominates the skyline of Edinburgh , the capital city of Scotland , from its position on the Castle Rock . Archaeologists have established human occupation of the rock since at least the Iron Age ( 2nd century AD ) , although the nature of the early settlement is unclear . There has been a royal castle on the rock since at least the reign of David I in the 12th century , and the site continued at times to be a royal residence until 1633 . From the 15th century , the castle 's residential role declined , and by the 17th century it was principally used as military barracks with a large garrison . Its importance as a part of Scotland 's national heritage was recognised increasingly from the early 19th century onwards , and various restoration programmes have been carried out over the past century and a half . As one of the most important strongholds in the Kingdom of Scotland , Edinburgh Castle was involved in many historical conflicts from the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 14th century to the Jacobite rising of 1745 . Research undertaken in 2014 identified 26 sieges in its 1100-year-old history , giving it a claim to having been the most besieged place in Great Britain and one of the most attacked in the world . Few of the present buildings pre-date the Lang Siege of the 16th century when the medieval defences were largely destroyed by artillery bombardment . The most notable exceptions are St Margaret 's Chapel from the early 12th century , which is regarded as the oldest building in Edinburgh , the Royal Palace and the early-16th-century Great Hall , although the interiors have been much altered from the mid-Victorian period onwards . The castle also houses the Scottish regalia , known as the Honours of Scotland and is the site of the Scottish National War Memorial and the National War Museum of Scotland . The British Army is still responsible for some parts of the castle , although its presence is now largely ceremonial and administrative . Some of the castle buildings house regimental museums which contribute to its presentation as a tourist attraction .",

Lidar scans have been carried out to establish the length of the wall and the Roman distance units used . Security was bolstered by a deep ditch on the northern side . It is thought that there was a wooden palisade on top of the turf . The barrier was the second of two great walls created by the Romans in Great Britain . Its ruins are less evident than those of the better-known Hadrian 's Wall to the south , primarily because the turf and wood wall has largely weathered away , unlike its stone-built southern predecessor . Construction began in AD 142 at the order of Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius , and took about 12 years to complete . Antoninus Pius never visited Britain , whereas his predecessor Hadrian had done so . Pressure from the Caledonians may have led Antoninus to send the empire 's troops further north . The Antonine Wall was protected by 16 forts with small fortlets between them ; troop movement was facilitated by a road linking all the sites known as the Military Way . The soldiers who built the wall commemorated the construction and their struggles with the Caledonians with decorative slabs , twenty of which survive .",

For centuries this location was used to offload seagoing ships , and led to the growth of Port Glasgow close to the castle on either side and to the south . When dredging techniques made the Clyde navigable as far as Glasgow the port became a shipbuilding centre , and the castle was surrounded by shipyards . Ferguson Shipbuilders , the last shipyard on the lower Clyde , stands close to the west of the castle , but the shipyards to the east were removed around the 1980s and new landscaped areas formed to the east of Newark Castle , opening up scenic views of the castle and across the Clyde from a new bypass road .",
  "/wiki/Port_Glasgow": "The origins of Port Glasgow go back to the construction by Sir George Maxwell between 1450 and 1477 of the New Werke of Finlastoun , which became Newark Castle . At a good anchorage near the castle , a small fishing hamlet known as Newark formed , like other scattered hamlets along the shores of the River Clyde . After 1589 the village of Greenock formed just under 4 miles ( 6 kilometres ) to the west of Newark , and gradually became a market town with growing fishing and sea trade , although it had only a jetty in the bay to unload ships . Since seagoing ships could not go further up the Clyde due to sandbanks , the Glasgow merchants such as the Tobacco Lords wanted harbour access , but got into arguments with Greenock over harbour dues and warehouses . They put a bid in for the Easter Greenock estate for a harbour , but were outbid and the lands became the Barony of Cartsburn . They then negotiated with Sir Patrick Maxwell of Newark Estate , and in 1668 he agreed to lease the City of Glasgow 13 acres ( 5.3 hectares ) of land to the west of the castle , for payment of 1,300 merks and an annual feu duty of four merks . Construction of piers and breakwaters enclosing the harbour began promptly , and Newport Glasgow was constituted as a free port . Trade prospered quickly , and by 1710 Newport Glasgow had the principal Clyde custom house , initially in Customhouse Lane , then after 1754 in a new building constructed on the west quay of the harbour . Through that century the town became known simply as Port Glasgow . Ships , mostly owned by Glasgow merchants , imported tobacco , sugar , rum , cotton and mahogany from the Americas , as well as timber , iron and hemp from the Baltic . These goods were then taken by road to Glasgow , as was market garden produce from farms around Port Glasgow .

  "/wiki/Pluscarden_Abbey": "Pluscarden Abbey is a Roman Catholic Benedictine monastery in the glen of the Black Burn , 6 miles south-west of Elgin , Moray , Scotland . It was founded in 1230 by Alexander II for the Valliscaulian Order . In 1454 , following a merger with the priory of Urquhart , Pluscarden Priory became a Benedictine House . The Scottish Reformation saw the decline of the priory , and by 1680 it was in a ruinous condition . Some work to arrest decay took place in the late 19th century . In 1948 , the priory became a house of the Subiaco Cassinese Congregation of Benedictines , and restoration began at the hands of monks from Prinknash Abbey in Gloucestershire . In 1966 , the priory received its independence from the mother-house ; it was elevated to abbatial status in 1974 .",

  "/wiki/Benedictine": "The Benedictines , officially the Order of Saint Benedict ( Latin : Ordo Sancti Benedicti , abbreviated as OSB ) , are a monastic Catholic religious order of monks and nuns that follow the Rule of Saint Benedict . They are also sometimes called the Black Monks , in reference to the colour of the members ' religious habits . Despite being called an order , the Benedictines do not operate under a single hierarchy but are instead organised as a collection of independent monastic communities , with each community ( monastery , priory or abbey ) within the order maintaining its autonomy . Unlike other religious orders , the Benedictines do not have a superior general or motherhouse with universal jurisdiction . Instead , the order is represented internationally by the Benedictine Confederation , an organization that was set up in 1893 to represent the order 's shared interests .",

It measures about 72 feet in diameter by 18 feet in height , and is around 5,000 years old . The roof is constructed of two massive slabs with a third slab superimposed . The entrance is at the east side . Although the structure has partially collapsed , it is still possible to enter one chamber . The antiquary Erskine Beveridge believed that a second and perhaps a third chamber exist . In or prior to 1911 , Dr Beveridge excavated within and near the cairn , and he found evidence of burnt burials as well as pieces of pottery ( some with patterned lines ) , wood ashes , burnt bones , a flint arrowhead , a scraper , and a piece of pierced talc .

[ Note 1 ] The islands are geographically coextensive with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar , one of the 32 unitary council areas of Scotland . They form part of the archipelago of the Hebrides , separated from the Scottish mainland and from the Inner Hebrides by the waters of the Minch , the Little Minch , and the Sea of the Hebrides . Scottish Gaelic is the predominant spoken language , although in a few areas English speakers form a majority . Most of the islands have a bedrock formed from ancient metamorphic rocks and the climate is mild and oceanic . The 15 inhabited islands have a total population of 26,830 and there are more than 50 substantial uninhabited islands . From Barra Head to the Butt of Lewis is roughly 210 kilometres ( 130 mi ) . There are various important prehistoric structures , many of which pre-date the first written references to the islands by Roman and Greek authors . The Western Isles became part of the Norse kingdom of the Su\u00f0reyjar , which lasted for over 400 years until sovereignty was transferred to Scotland by the Treaty of Perth in 1266 . Control of the islands was then held by clan chiefs , principal of whom were the MacLeods , MacDonalds , Mackenzies and MacNeils . The Highland Clearances of the 19th century had a devastating effect on many communities and it is only in recent years that population levels have ceased to decline . Much of the land is now under local control and commercial activity is based on tourism , crofting , fishing , and weaving .",
  "/wiki/Hebrides": "The Hebrides ( /\u02c8h\u025bbr\u026adi\u02d0z/ ; Scottish Gaelic : Innse Gall , pronounced [ \u02c8\u0129\u02d0\u0283\u0259 \u02c8kaul\u032a\u02e0 ] ; Old Norse : Su\u00f0reyjar ) comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland . There are two main groups : the Inner and Outer Hebrides . These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic , and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic- , Norse- , and English-speaking peoples . This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands , which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times . The Hebrides are the source of much of Scottish Gaelic literature and Gaelic music . Today the economy of the islands is dependent on crofting , fishing , tourism , the oil industry , and renewable energy . The Hebrides have lower biodiversity than mainland Scotland , but there is a significant presence of seals and seabirds ."
