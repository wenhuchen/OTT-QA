  "/wiki/Bohemia_at_the_Olympics": "Kingdom of Bohemia , an autonomous part of Austria-Hungary until 1918 , competed at some of the early modern Olympic Games . The team made its debut at the 1900 Summer Olympics . After World War I , Bohemia became part of the new Czechoslovakia , and Bohemian athletes competed for Czechoslovakia at the Olympics .

  "/wiki/Unified_Team_at_the_Olympics": "The Unified Team was the name used for the sports team of the former Soviet Union ( except the Baltic states ) at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona . The IOC country code was EUN , after the French name , \u00c9quipe unifi\u00e9e . The Unified Team was sometimes informally called the CIS Team ( Commonwealth of Independent States , as a counterpart of CIS national football team taking part in Euro 1992 of the same year ) , although Georgia did not join the CIS until 1993 . During the Winter Olympics , the National Olympic Committees ( NOCs ) of the constituent countries had not yet been affiliated to the IOC , so the Olympic Flag was used in place of a national flag at the Opening Ceremony and at medals ceremonies , and the Olympic Hymn was played for gold medallists . By the time of the Summer Olympics , the NOCs had affiliated separately , though they fielded a joint team with a standard uniform as Olympic qualifying rounds had been completed before the final demise of the Soviet Union . Where an EUN individual won a medal , the national flag of the medallist 's nation was raised rather than the Olympic flag , and a gold medallist 's national anthem was played rather than the Olympic Hymn . In team sports , the EUN team continued to use the Olympic flag and the Olympic Hymn , as team members represented different nations . The team finished second in the medal table at the 1992 Winter Games , and first at the 1992 Summer Games , edging its old rival the US in the latter .",
  "/wiki/West_Germany_at_the_Olympics": "West Germany competed at the Olympic Games between 1952 and 1988 .

Likewise , between 1956 and 1964 both countries competed together under the United Team of Germany flag . It was not until 1968 that a full-fledged West German team appeared , and it competed in all the Olympics but the 1980 Summer Olympics - as it supported the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott - until 1988 . Afterwards , the German reunification in 1990 reestablished the German team .",

  "/wiki/Russian_Empire_at_the_Olympics": "Russia has competed at the modern Olympic Games on many occasions , but as different nations in its history . As the Russian Empire , the nation first competed at the 1900 Games , and returned again in 1908 and 1912 . After the Russian revolution in 1917 , and the subsequent establishment of the Soviet Union in 1922 , it would be forty years until Russian athletes again competed at the Olympics , as the Soviet Union at the 1952 Summer Olympics .

  "/wiki/Soviet_Union_at_the_Olympics": "The Soviet Union first participated at the Olympic Games in 1952 , and competed at the Games on 18 occasions subsequently . At six of its nine appearances at the Summer Olympic Games , the Soviet team ranked first in the total number of gold medals won , it was second by this count on the other three . Similarly , the team was ranked first in the gold medal count seven times and second twice in nine appearances at the Winter Olympic Games . Soviet Union 's success might be attributed to a heavy state 's investment in sports to fulfill its political agenda on an international stage . Following the Russian Revolution of November 1917 and the Russian Civil War ( 1917-1922 ) , the Soviet Union did not participate in international sporting events on ideological grounds ; however , after World War II ( 1939-1945 ) , attendance at the Olympic Games came to be seen by Soviet officials and leaders as a useful method of promoting Communist ideals . The Olympic Committee of the USSR was formed on April 21 , 1951 , and the IOC recognised the new body in its 45th session ( May 7 , 1951 ) . In the same year , when the Soviet representative Konstantin Andrianov became an IOC member , the USSR officially joined the Olympic Movement . The 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki thus became first Olympic Games for Soviet athletes . On July 20 , 1952 Nina Romashkova won the first Olympic gold medal in the history of Soviet sport , competing in the women 's discus throw . Romashkova 's result in this event ( 51.42 m ) was the new Olympic record at that time . The 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo became the first Winter Olympic Games for Soviet athletes .
