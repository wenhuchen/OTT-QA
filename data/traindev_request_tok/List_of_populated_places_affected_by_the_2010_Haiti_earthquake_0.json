  "/wiki/Haitian_Creole_language": "Haitian Creole ( /\u02c8he\u026a\u0283\u0259n \u02c8kri\u02d0o\u028al/ ) is a French-based creole language spoken by 10-12 million people worldwide , and the only language of most Haitians . It is called krey\u00f2l ayisyen or just krey\u00f2l ( [ k\u0263ej\u0254l ] ) by its speakers , and cr\u00e9ole ha\u00eftien in Standard French . The language emerged from contact between French settlers and enslaved Africans during the Atlantic slave trade in the French colony of Saint-Domingue ( now Haiti ) . Although its vocabulary is mostly taken from 18th-century French , it also has influences from Portuguese , Spanish , English , Ta\u00edno , and West African languages . It is not mutually intelligible with standard French , and has its own distinctive grammar . Haitians are the largest community in the world speaking a modern creole language . Usage of , and education in , Haitian Creole has been contentious since at least the 19th century ; some Haitians view French as a legacy of colonialism , while Creole was maligned by francophones as a miseducated person 's French . Until the late 20th century , Haitian presidents spoke only standard French to their fellow citizens , and until the 2000s , all instruction at Haitian elementary schools was in modern standard French , a second language to most of the students .",

Because no single translation adequately conveys the layered sense of the word , the French term is usually used in English writing . The Arrondissements are listed below , by department :",

  "/wiki/Mass_grave": "A mass grave is a grave containing multiple human corpses , which may or may not be identified prior to burial . The United Nations has defined a criminal mass grave as a burial site containing three or more victims of execution . Mass graves are usually created after many people die or are killed , and there is a desire to bury the corpses quickly for sanitation concerns . Although mass graves can be used during major conflicts such as war and crime , in modern times they may be used after a famine , epidemic , or natural disaster . In disasters , mass graves are used for infection and disease control . In such cases , there is often a breakdown of the social infrastructure that would enable proper identification and disposal of individual bodies ."
