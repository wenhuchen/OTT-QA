  "/wiki/Meritorious_Service_Medal_(United_States)": "The Meritorious Service Medal ( MSM ) is a military award presented to members of the United States Armed Forces who distinguished themselves by outstanding meritorious achievement or service to the United States subsequent to January 16 , 1969 . The MSM was previously awarded as a decoration for achievement during peacetime , but effective 11 September 2001 , this decoration may also be bestowed in lieu of the Bronze Star Medal for meritorious achievement in a designated combat theater . Normally , the acts or services rendered must be comparable to that required for the Legion of Merit but in a duty of lesser , though considerable , responsibility . Within the U.S. Army , according to AR 600-8-22 , Paragraph 3-16 , the MSM may not be upgraded to or downgraded from a recommended Bronze Star Medal . In the Army , an MSM recommendation that is downgraded will be approved as an Army Commendation Medal ( ARCOM ) . A higher award and decoration known as the Defense Meritorious Service Medal ( DMSM ) is intended for similar services performed under joint duty within the United States Department of Defense , to include the Joint Staff , the Unified Combatant Commands , and joint task forces under their cognizance .",

  "/wiki/Painter": "Painting is the practice of applying paint , pigment , color or other medium to a solid surface ( called the matrix or support ) . The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush , but other implements , such as knives , sponges , and airbrushes , can be used . The final work is also called a painting . Painting is an important form in the visual arts , bringing in elements such as drawing , gesture ( as in gestural painting ) , composition , narration ( as in narrative art ) , or abstraction ( as in abstract art ) . Paintings can be naturalistic and representational ( as in a still life or landscape painting ) , photographic , abstract , narrative , symbolistic ( as in Symbolist art ) , emotive ( as in Expressionism ) , or political in nature ( as in Artivism ) . A portion of the history of painting in both Eastern and Western art is dominated by religious art . Examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery , to Biblical scenes Sistine Chapel ceiling , to scenes from the life of Buddha or other images of Eastern religious origin . In art , the term painting describes both the act and the result of the action . The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls , paper , canvas , wood , glass , lacquer , pottery , leaf , copper and concrete , and the painting may incorporate multiple other materials including sand , clay , paper , plaster , gold leaf , as well as objects .",
  "/wiki/Printmaker": "Printmaking is the process of creating artworks by printing , normally on paper . Printmaking normally covers only the process of creating prints that have an element of originality , rather than just being a photographic reproduction of a painting . Except in the case of monotyping , the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece , which is called a print . Each print produced is considered an original work of art , and is correctly referred to as an impression , not a copy ( that means a different print copying the first , common in early printmaking ) . Often impressions vary considerably , whether intentionally or not . The images on most prints are created for that purpose , perhaps with a preparatory study such as a drawing . A print that copies another work of art , especially a painting , is known as a reproductive print . Prints are created by transferring ink from a matrix to a sheet of paper or other material , by a variety of techniques . Common types of matrices include : metal plates , usually copper or zinc , or polymer plates and other thicker plastic sheets for engraving or etching ; stone , aluminum , or polymer for lithography ; blocks of wood for woodcuts and wood engravings ; and linoleum for linocuts . Screens made of silk or synthetic fabrics are used for the screen printing process . Other types of matrix substrates and related processes are discussed below . Multiple impressions printed from the same matrix form an edition .",

In interviews , Schwegler has expressed an affinity for the ruin , non-sites and discarded objects . Schwegler calls herself an urban archaeologist who prefers to mine the peripheral ruin , the discarded stuff that is ignored and considered worthless . By reassigning the value and purpose of something recognizable , I emphasize the perforation between what it was and what it has now become . Pulling from the traditions of craft and conceptual art , Schwegler uses a variety of mediums , including glass , metal , sculpture , photography , and installation . Schwegler is represented by UPFOR Gallery in Portland , Oregon and Asphodel in New York , NY .",
