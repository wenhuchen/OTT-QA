The Buffalo area was inhabited before the 17th century by the Native American Iroquois tribe and later by French colonizers . The city grew significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of immigration , the construction of the Erie Canal and rail transportation , and its close proximity to Lake Erie . This growth provided an abundance of fresh water and an ample trade route to the Midwestern United States while grooming its economy for the grain , steel and automobile industries that dominated the city 's economy in the 20th century . Since the city 's economy relied heavily on manufacturing , deindustrialization in the latter half of the 20th century led to a steady decline in population . While some manufacturing activity remains , Buffalo 's economy has transitioned to service industries with a greater emphasis on healthcare , research and higher education , which emerged following the Great Recession .
