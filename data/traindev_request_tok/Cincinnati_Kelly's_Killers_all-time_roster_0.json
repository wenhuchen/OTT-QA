  "/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)": "In baseball , the batting average ( BA ) is the number of hits divided by at bats . It is usually rounded to three decimal places and read without the decimal : A player with a batting average of .300 is batting three-hundred . If necessary to break ties , batting averages could be taken beyond the .001 measurement . In this context , .001 is considered a point , such that a .235 batter is 5 points higher than a .230 batter .",

  "/wiki/Charlie_Bastian": "Charles A. Bastian ( March 2 , 1858 - November 10 , 1943 ) was an American professional baseball infielder . He played in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) for the Wilmington Quicksteps , Kansas City Cowboys , Philadelphia Quakers , Chicago White Stockings , Chicago Pirates , Cincinnati Kelly 's Killers , and Philadelphia Phillies . Debuting with the Wilmington Quicksteps in 1884 , Bastian played just 17 games before moving on to Union Association rival Kansas City Cowboys , where he tallied another eleven . After the demise of the UA , Bastian signed with the Philadelphia Quakers of the National League . He became the club 's everyday shortstop , playing 103 games but hitting only .167 with 4 home runs and 29 RBI . He also led the league in strikeouts with 82 . Despite this , in 1886 , Bastian became the regular second baseman for the Quakers . His production increased a bit as he hit .217 with 2 home runs and 38 RBI , and he placed in the league 's top ten in triples . However , as his offense was still subpar , Bastian lost his starting job for 1887 , remaining with the team as a utility infielder that season and the next . The Chicago White Stockings ( predecessors of the Cubs ) were Bastian 's next stop , as they purchased him from Philadelphia . With the Cubs , Bastian 's performance bottomed out . He batted a career-low .135 and played in just 46 games .",
  "/wiki/Second_baseman": "In baseball and softball , second baseman is a fielding position in the infield , between second and first base . The second baseman often possesses quick hands and feet , needs the ability to get rid of the ball quickly , and must be able to make the pivot on a double play . In addition , second basemen are usually right-handed ; only four left-handed throwing players have ever played second base in Major League Baseball since 1950 . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the second baseman is assigned the number 4 . Good second basemen need to have very good range since they have to field balls closer to the first baseman who is often holding runners on , or moving towards the base to cover . On a batted ball to right field , the second baseman goes out towards the ball for the relay . Due to these requirements , second base is sometimes a primarily defensive position in the modern game , but there are hitting stars as well .",

He pitched in 12 games , completed 10 out of 11 starts , and had an ERA of 3.88 in 95 innings pitched . He also played one game in the outfield , giving him a total of 13 games played at the major league level . He had a batting average of .105 ( 4-for-38 ) , but eight walks pushed his on-base percentage up to .261 . He had four RBI and scored five runs . Bell was a brother of former major league player Frank Bell , who played for the 1885 Brooklyn Grays .",
  "/wiki/Starting_pitcher": "In baseball ( hardball or softball ) , a starting pitcher or starter is the first pitcher in the game for each team . A pitcher is credited with a game started if they throw the first pitch to the opponent 's first batter of a game . Starting pitchers are expected to pitch for a significant portion of the game , although their ability to do this depends on many factors , including effectiveness , stamina , health , and strategy . A starting pitcher in professional baseball usually rests three , four , or five days after pitching a game before pitching another . Therefore , most professional baseball teams have four , five or six starting pitchers on their rosters . These pitchers , and the sequence in which they pitch , is known as the rotation . In modern baseball , a five-man rotation is most common . In contrast , a pitcher who enters the game after the first pitch of the game is a relief pitcher . Occasionally , an opening pitcher is used for only a few innings , and is replaced by a long reliever or a pitcher who would typically be a starting pitcher .",
  "/wiki/Games_pitched": "In baseball statistics , games pitched ( denoted by Games G in tables of only pitching statistics ) is the number of games in which a player appears as a pitcher ; a player who is announced as the pitcher must face at least one batter , although exceptions are made if the pitcher announced in the starting lineup is injured before facing a batter , perhaps while batting or running the bases in the top of the first inning , before the opposing team comes to bat . The statistic is also referred to as appearances , usually to refer to the number of games a relief pitcher has pitched in .",
  "/wiki/Complete_game": "In baseball , a complete game ( denoted by CG ) is the act of a pitcher pitching an entire game without the benefit of a relief pitcher . A pitcher who meets this criterion will be credited with a complete game regardless of the number of innings played - pitchers who throw an entire official game that is shortened by rain will still be credited with a complete game , while starting pitchers who are relieved in extra innings after throwing nine or more innings will not be credited with a complete game . A starting pitcher who is replaced by a pinch hitter in the final half inning of a game will still be credited with a complete game . The frequency of complete games has evolved since the early days of baseball . The complete game was essentially an expectation in the early 20th century and pitchers completed almost all of the games they started . In modern baseball , the feat is much more rare and no pitcher has reached 30 complete games in a season since 1975 ; in the 21st century , a pitcher has thrown 10 or more complete games in a season only twice .",

  "/wiki/At_bat": "In baseball , an at bat ( AB ) or time at bat is a batter 's turn batting against a pitcher . An at bat is different from a plate appearance . A batter is credited with a plate appearance regardless of what happens during their turn at bat , but a batter is credited with an at bat only if that plate appearance does not have one of the results enumerated below . While at bats are used to calculate certain statistics , including batting average and slugging percentage , a player can qualify for the season-ending rankings in these categories only if they accumulate 502 plate appearances during the season .

  "/wiki/Shortstop": "Shortstop , abbreviated SS , is the baseball or softball fielding position between second and third base , which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions . Historically the position was assigned to defensive specialists who were typically poor at batting and were often placed at the bottom of the batting order . Today shortstops are often able to hit well and many are placed at the top of the lineup . In the numbering system used by scorers to record defensive plays , the shortstop is assigned the number 6 . More hit balls go to the shortstop than to any other position , as there are more right-handed hitters in baseball than left-handed hitters , and most hitters have a tendency to pull the ball slightly . Like a second baseman , a shortstop must be agile , for example when performing a 4-6-3 double play . Also , like a third baseman , the shortstop fields balls hit to the left side of the infield , where a strong arm is needed to throw out a batter-runner before they reach the safety of first base .",
  "/wiki/Run_(baseball)": "In baseball , a run is scored when a player advances around first , second and third base and returns safely to home plate , touching the bases in that order , before three outs are recorded and all obligations to reach base safely on batted balls are met or assured . A player may score by hitting a home run or by any combination of plays that puts him safely on base ( that is , on first , second , or third ) as a runner and subsequently brings him home . The object of the game is for a team to score more runs than its opponent . The Official Baseball Rules hold that if the third out of an inning is a force out of a runner advancing to any base then , even if another baserunner crosses home plate before that force out is made , his run does not count . However , if the third out is not a force out , but a tag out , then if that other baserunner crosses home plate before that tag out is made , his run will count . In baseball statistics , a player who advances around all the bases to score is credited with a run ( R ) , sometimes referred to as a run scored . While runs scored is considered an important individual batting statistic , it is regarded as less significant than runs batted in ( RBIs ) . Both individual runs scored and runs batted in are heavily context-dependent ; however , the sabermetric statistic runs created provides a more sophisticated assessment of a player 's contribution toward producing runs for his team . A pitcher is likewise assessed runs surrendered in his statistics , which differentiate between standard earned runs ( for which the pitcher is statistically assigned full responsibility ) and unearned runs scored due to fielding errors , which do not count in his personal statistics . Specifically , if a fielding error occurs which affects the number of runs scored in an inning , the Official Scorer - the official in-game statistician - in order to determine how many of the runs should be classified as earned , will reconstruct the inning as if the error had not occurred . For example , with two outs , suppose a runner reaches base because of a fielding error , and then the next batter hits a two-run home run , and then the following batter then makes the third out , ending the inning . If the inning is reconstructed without the error , and if that third batter , instead of reaching on an error , registered an out , the inning would have ended there without any runs scoring .",
  "/wiki/Triple_(baseball)": "In baseball , a triple is the act of a batter safely reaching third base after hitting the ball , with neither the benefit of a fielder 's misplay ( see error ) nor another runner being put out on a fielder 's choice . A triple is sometimes called a three-bagger or three-base hit . For statistical and scorekeeping purposes it is denoted by 3B . Triples have become somewhat rare in Major League Baseball . It often requires a ball hit to a distant part of the field , or the ball taking an unusual bounce in the outfield . It also usually requires that the batter hit the ball solidly , and be a speedy runner . It also often requires that the batter 's team have a good strategic reason for wanting the batter on third base , as a double will already put the batter in scoring position and there will often be little strategic advantage to taking the risk of trying to stretch a double into a triple . ( The inside-the-park home run is much rarer than a triple ) . The trend for modern ballparks is to have smaller outfields ( often increasing the number of home runs ) ; it has ensured that the career and season triples leaders mostly consist of those who played early in Major League Baseball history , generally in the dead-ball era . A walk-off triple ( one that ends a game ) occurs very infrequently . For example , the 2016 MLB season saw only three walk-off triples , excluding one play that was actually a triple plus an error .",
  "/wiki/Home_run": "In baseball , a home run ( abbreviated HR ) is scored when the ball is hit in such a way that the batter is able to circle the bases and reach home safely in one play without any errors being committed by the defensive team in the process . In modern baseball , the feat is typically achieved by hitting the ball over the outfield fence between the foul poles ( or making contact with either foul pole ) without first touching the ground , resulting in an automatic home run . There is also the inside-the-park home run where the batter reaches home safely while the baseball is in play on the field . A home run with a high exit velocity and good launch angle is sometimes called a no-doubter , because it leaves no doubt that it is going to leave the park when it leaves the bat . When a home run is scored , the batter is also credited with a hit and a run scored , and an RBI for each runner that scores , including himself . Likewise , the pitcher is recorded as having given up a hit and a run , with additional runs charged for each runner that scores other than the batter . Home runs are among the most popular aspects of baseball and , as a result , prolific home run hitters are usually the most popular among fans and consequently the highest paid by teams - hence the old saying , Home run hitters drive Cadillacs , and singles hitters drive Fords ( coined , circa 1948 , by veteran pitcher Fritz Ostermueller , by way of mentoring his young teammate , Ralph Kiner ) .",
  "/wiki/Run_batted_in": "A run batted in ( RBI ) , plural runs batted in ( RBI or RBIs ) , is a statistic in baseball and softball that credits a batter for making a play that allows a run to be scored ( except in certain situations such as when an error is made on the play ) . For example , if the batter bats a base hit , then another player on a higher base can head home to score a run , and the batter gets credited with batting in that run . Before the 1920 Major League Baseball season , runs batted in were not an official baseball statistic . Nevertheless , the RBI statistic was tabulated - unofficially - from 1907 through 1919 by baseball writer Ernie Lanigan , according to the Society for American Baseball Research . Common nicknames for an RBI include ribby ( or ribbie ) , rib , and ribeye . The plural of RBI is generally RBIs , although some commentators use RBI as both singular and plural , as it can also stand for runs batted in .",

  "/wiki/First_baseman": "First base , or 1B , is the first of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a baserunner to score a run for that player 's team . A first baseman is the player on the team playing defense who fields the area nearest first base , and is responsible for the majority of plays made at that base . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the first baseman is assigned the number 3 . Also called first sacker or cornerman , the first baseman is ideally a tall player who throws left-handed and possesses good flexibility and quick reflexes . Flexibility is needed because the first baseman receives throws from the other infielders , the catcher and the pitcher after they have fielded ground balls . In order for the runner to be called out , the first baseman must be able to stretch towards the throw and catch it before the runner reaches first base . First base is often referred to as the other hot corner - the hot corner being third base - and therefore , like the third baseman , he must have quick reflexes to field the hardest hit balls down the foul line , mainly by left-handed pull hitters and right-handed hitters hitting to the opposite field . They often are power hitters who have a substantial number of home runs and extra base hits while maintaining a .270 plus batting average . [ citation needed ]",

Born in Boston , Cannonball Crane was a man of uncommon strength . In his prime , he was described as a giant in physical strength and proportions . He reportedly could throw a baseball 135 yards , farther than anyone else who played the game in his era . After his playing career ended , he died from what was officially declared an accidental overdose but was reported by others to have been a suicide .",
  "/wiki/Win\u2013loss_record_(pitching)": "In baseball and softball , a pitcher 's win-loss record ( also referred to simply as their record ) indicates the number of wins ( denoted W ) and losses ( denoted L ) they have been credited with . For example , a 20-10 win-loss record would represent 20 wins and 10 losses . In each game , one pitcher on the winning team is awarded a win ( the winning pitcher ) and one pitcher on the losing team is given a loss ( the losing pitcher ) in their respective statistics . These pitchers are collectively known as the pitchers of record . The designation of win or loss for a pitcher is known as a decision , and only one pitcher for each team receives a decision . A starting pitcher who does not receive credit for a win or loss is said to have no decision . In certain situations , another pitcher on the winning team who pitched in relief of the winning pitcher can be credited with a save , and holds can be awarded to relief pitchers on both sides , but these are never awarded to the same pitcher who is awarded the win . The decisions are awarded by the official scorer of the game in accordance with the league 's rules . The official scorer does not assign a winning or losing pitcher in some games which are forfeited , such as those that are tied at the time of forfeiture . If the game is tied ( a rare event ) , no pitcher is awarded any decision . A pitcher 's winning percentage is calculated by dividing the number of wins by the number of decisions ( wins plus losses ) , and it is commonly expressed with three decimal places .",

  "/wiki/Catcher": "Catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player . When a batter takes his/her turn to hit , the catcher crouches behind home plate , in front of the ( home ) umpire , and receives the ball from the pitcher . In addition to this primary duty , the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well . The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket , but in cricket , wicketkeepers are increasingly known for their batting abilities . Positioned behind home plate , the catcher can see the whole field , and is therefore in the best position to direct and lead the other players in a defensive play . The catcher typically calls for pitches using hand signals . The calls are based on the pitcher 's mechanics and strengths , as well as the batter 's tendencies and weaknesses . Foul tips , bouncing balls in the dirt , and contact with runners during plays at the plate are all events to be handled by the catcher , necessitating the use of protective equipment . This includes a mask , chest and throat protectors , shin guards , and a heavily padded catcher 's mitt . Because the position requires a comprehensive understanding of the game 's strategies , the pool of former catchers yields a disproportionate number of managers in both Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball , including such prominent examples as Connie Mack , Steve O'Neill , Al L\u00f3pez , Mike Scioscia , and Joe Torre . The physical and mental demands of being involved on every defensive play can wear catchers down over a long season , and can have a negative effect on their offensive output . Because of the strategic defensive importance of catching , if a catcher has exceptional defensive skills , teams are often willing to overlook their relative offensive weaknesses .",

  "/wiki/King_Kelly": "Michael Joseph King Kelly ( December 31 , 1857 - November 8 , 1894 ) , also commonly known as $ 10,000 Kelly , was an American outfielder , catcher , and manager in various professional American baseball leagues including the National League , International Association , Players ' League , and the American Association . He spent the majority of his 16-season playing career with the Chicago White Stockings and the Boston Beaneaters . Kelly was a player-manager three times in his career - in 1887 for the Beaneaters , in 1890 leading the Boston Reds to the pennant in the only season of the Players ' League 's existence , and in 1891 for the Cincinnati Kelly 's Killers - before his retirement in 1893 . He is also often credited with helping to popularize various strategies as a player such as the hit and run , the hook slide , and the catcher 's practice of backing up first base . In only the second vote since its creation in 1939 , the Old Timers Committee ( now the Veterans ' Committee ) elected Kelly to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945 . In concluding where to truly give Kelly credit as an innovator , a 2004 book devoted to 19th-century rule bending in baseball - and which came close to exhaustively accounting for all contemporary reporting on various subjects - placed stress on the following : Kelly 's hook slide does sound special , and players probably tried to copy it . Also , he seems to have been the first big leaguer to successfully cut a base ( when the usually lone umpire was n't looking ) , at least according to the newspaper record . And , Kelly could have been the first to foul off lots of pitches on purpose . Doing so was a top trick of some Baltimore players of the 1890s . At the turn of the century , that trick was defused when all foul balls began counting as strikes . Kelly 's autobiography Play Ball was published while he was with the Beaneaters in 1888 , the first autobiography by a baseball player ; it was ghostwritten by Boston baseball writer John J. Jack Drohan . Kelly also became a vaudeville performer during his playing career , first performing in Boston where he would recite the now-famous baseball poem Casey at the Bat , sometimes butchering it .",

In 1890 the Reds won the Players ' League pennant when they finished first ahead of the New York Giants , and then won the American Association pennant when they finished first ahead of the St. Louis Browns ( now the Cardinals ) . The Boston Reds are one of two major league teams to win back-to-back pennants spanning two different leagues . The Brooklyn Dodgers did it also , winning the AA pennant in 1889 and the NL pennant in 1890 . At the conclusion of the 1891 season , the National League pressed for the consolidation of the American Association with the National League . Part of the posturing included the National League directing its champion Boston Beaneaters not to play the Reds in a World Series . The leagues settled , adding four AA clubs to a combined circuit . As part of the settlement , the owners of the four clubs not joining the combined circuit , including the Reds , were paid $ 135,000 and their players dispersed to the surviving clubs .

  "/wiki/Relief_pitcher": "In baseball and softball , a relief pitcher or reliever is a pitcher who enters the game after the starting pitcher is removed due to injury , ineffectiveness , fatigue , ejection , or for other strategic reasons , such as inclement weather delays or pinch hitter substitutions . Relief pitchers are further divided informally into various roles , such as closers , setup men , middle relief pitchers , left/right-handed specialists , and long relievers . Whereas starting pitchers usually rest several days before pitching in a game again due to the number of pitches thrown , relief pitchers are expected to be more flexible and typically pitch more games but with fewer innings pitched . A team 's staff of relievers is normally referred to metonymically as a team 's bullpen , which refers to the area where the relievers sit during games , and where they warm-up prior to entering the game .",
