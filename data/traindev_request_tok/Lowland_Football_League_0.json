The area was for more than 400 years central to historic border wars between the Kingdoms of England and Scotland , and several times possession of Berwick changed hands between the two kingdoms . The last time it changed hands was when Richard of Gloucester retook it for England in 1482 . To this day many Berwickers feel a close affinity to Scotland . Berwick remains a traditional market town and also has some notable architectural features , in particular its medieval town walls , its Georgian Town Hall , its Elizabethan ramparts , and Britain 's earliest barracks buildings , which Nicholas Hawksmoor built ( 1717-21 ) for the Board of Ordnance .",

For many years Cumbernauld was chiefly populated around what is now called The Village with the medieval castle a short walk away surrounded by its own park grounds . The castle frequently hosted visiting royalty and the grounds were famous for their white cattle which were hunted in the oak forest . The town began to spread as the weaving industry of the village was supplemented by mining and quarrying as travel across Scotland became easier due to the Forth and Clyde Canal and the railways being constructed . Cumbernauld railway station , though some distance from the village , improved communications with Glasgow , Falkirk and Stirling .

  "/wiki/Stirling": "Stirling ( /\u02c8st\u025c\u02d0rl\u026a\u014b/ ; Scots : Stirlin ; Scottish Gaelic : Sruighlea [ \u02c8s\u032at\u032a\u027eu\u029dl\u0259 ] ) is a city in central Scotland , 26 miles ( 42 km ) north-east of Glasgow and 37 miles ( 60 km ) north-west of the Scottish capital , Edinburgh . The market town , surrounded by rich farmland , grew up connecting the royal citadel , the medieval old town with its merchants and tradesmen , the bridge and the port . Located on the River Forth , Stirling is the administrative centre for the Stirling council area , and is traditionally the county town of Stirlingshire . Proverbially it is the strategically important Gateway to the Highlands . It has been said that Stirling , like a huge brooch clasps Highlands and Lowlands together . Similarly he who holds Stirling , holds Scotland is often quoted . Stirling 's key position as the lowest bridging point of the River Forth before it broadens towards the Firth of Forth made it a focal point for travel north or south . When Stirling was temporarily under Anglo-Saxon sway , according to a 9th-century legend , it was attacked by Danish invaders . The sound of a wolf roused a sentry , however , who alerted his garrison , which forced a Viking retreat . This led to the wolf being adopted as a symbol of the town as is shown on the 1511 Stirling Jug . The area is today known as Wolfcraig . Even today the wolf appears with a goshawk on the council 's coat of arms along with the recently chosen motto : Steadfast as the Rock .",
