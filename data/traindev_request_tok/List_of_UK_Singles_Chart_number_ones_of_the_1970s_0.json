  "/wiki/Don't_Cry_for_Me_Argentina": "Do n't Cry for Me Argentina is a song recorded by Julie Covington for the 1976 concept album Evita , and was later included in the 1978 musical of the same name . The song was written and composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice while they were researching the life of Argentinian leader Eva Per\u00f3n . It appears at the opening and near the end of the show , initially as the spirit of the dead Eva exhorting the people of Argentina not to mourn her , and finally during Eva 's speech from the balcony of the Casa Rosada . Covington was signed by the songwriters for the track , based on her previous work in musicals . The Evita album had taken 3-4 months to record , since Rice was not satisfied with the intensity of the initial recordings . The song had a number of different titles before Do n't Cry for Me Argentina was chosen as the final one . The song shares its melody with Oh What a Circus from the same show and lyrically consists of platitudes where Eva tries to win the favour of the people of Argentina . It was released in the United Kingdom on 12 November 1976 as the first single from the album , accompanied by national and trade advertising , full-colour posters , display sleeves as well as radio interviews . The song reached number one on the UK Singles Chart and earned a gold certification from the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) , with over a million copies sold . It also reached the top of the charts in Australia , Belgium , Ireland , New Zealand and the Netherlands . Do n't Cry for Me Argentina was critically appreciated , with Rice and Lloyd Webber winning the 1977 Ivor Novello award in the category of Best Song Musically and Lyrically .
