  "/wiki/Eric_Lock": "Eric Stanley Lock , DSO , DFC & Bar ( 19 April 1919 - 3 August 1941 ) was a British Royal Air Force ( RAF ) fighter pilot and flying ace of the Second World War . Born in Shrewsbury in 1919 Lock had his first experience of flying as a teenager . In the late 1930s with war a possibility and the likely event of him being called to arms , Lock decided that he would prefer to fight as an airman . He joined the RAF in 1939 . He completed his training in 1940 and was posted to No . 41 Squadron RAF in time for the Battle of Britain . Lock became the RAF 's most successful Allied pilot during the battle , shooting down 21 German aircraft and sharing in the destruction of one . After the Battle of Britain Lock served on the Channel Front , flying offensive sweeps over France . Lock went on to bring his overall total to 26 aerial victories , one shared destroyed and eight probable in 25 weeks of operational sorties over a one-year period - during which time he was hospitalised for six months . Included in his victory total were 20 German fighter aircraft , 18 of them Messerschmitt Bf 109s . In mid-1941 Lock was promoted to the rank of Flight Lieutenant . Lock earned the nickname Sawn Off Lockie , because of his extremely short stature .",
  "/wiki/No._41_Squadron_RAF": "No . 41 Squadron of the Royal Air Force is the RAF 's Test and Evaluation Squadron ( TES ) , based at RAF Coningsby , Lincolnshire . Its official title is 41 TES . The squadron was formed in 1916 during First World War as part of the Royal Flying Corps and served on the Western Front as a ground attack and fighter squadron . Disbanded in 1919 as part of the post-war draw down , No . 41 Squadron was re-formed as an RAF squadron in 1923 and remained on home service until 1935 when it was deployed to Aden during the Abyssinian crisis . During the Second World War , the squadron flew Supermarine Spitfire fighters and saw action over Dunkirk and the during the Battle of Britain in the early years of the war . Combat operations were flown from Britain over German-occupied Europe during 1941-1944 , before the squadron moved to the continent after the Normandy landings . During 1944-45 , the squadron supported the Allied advance into Germany and it remained there until mid-1946 as part of the occupation force following the end of hostilities . In the post war years , the squadron was disbanded and re-formed several times , operating a variety of jet aircraft in the fighter , reconnaissance and interceptor roles . In 2006 , the squadron was re-roled as the Fast Jet & Weapons Operational Evaluation Unit . It remained in this role until 2010 when it became the RAF 's Test and Evaluation Squadron .",
  "/wiki/Supermarine_Spitfire": "The Supermarine Spitfire is a British single-seat fighter aircraft that was used by the Royal Air Force and other Allied countries before , during , and after World War II . Many variants of the Spitfire were built , using several wing configurations , and it was produced in greater numbers than any other British aircraft . It was also the only British fighter produced continuously throughout the war . The Spitfire continues to be popular among enthusiasts ; nearly 60 remain airworthy , and many more are static exhibits in aviation museums throughout the world . The Spitfire was designed as a short-range , high-performance interceptor aircraft by R. J. Mitchell , chief designer at Supermarine Aviation Works , which operated as a subsidiary of Vickers-Armstrong from 1928 . Mitchell pushed the Spitfire 's distinctive elliptical wing with cutting-edge sunken rivets ( designed by Beverley Shenstone ) to have the thinnest possible cross-section , helping give the aircraft a higher top speed than several contemporary fighters , including the Hawker Hurricane . Mitchell continued to refine the design until his death in 1937 , whereupon his colleague Joseph Smith took over as chief designer , overseeing the Spitfire 's development through its multitude of variants . During the Battle of Britain , from July to October 1940 , the public perceived the Spitfire to be the main RAF fighter , though the more numerous Hurricane shouldered a greater proportion of the burden against Nazi Germany 's air force , the Luftwaffe . However , Spitfire units had a lower attrition rate and a higher victory-to-loss ratio than those flying Hurricanes because of the Spitfire 's higher performance . During the battle , Spitfires were generally tasked with engaging Luftwaffe fighters - mainly Messerschmitt Bf 109E-series aircraft , which were a close match for them . After the Battle of Britain , the Spitfire superseded the Hurricane to become the backbone of RAF Fighter Command , and saw action in the European , Mediterranean , Pacific , and South-East Asian theatres . Much loved by its pilots , the Spitfire served in several roles , including interceptor , photo-reconnaissance , fighter-bomber , and trainer , and it continued to serve in these roles until the 1950s .",
  "/wiki/Missing_in_action": "Missing in action ( MIA ) is a casualty classification assigned to combatants , military chaplains , combat medics , and prisoners of war who are reported missing during wartime or ceasefire .

Becoming MIA has been an occupational risk for as long as there has been warfare .",
  "/wiki/Squadron_Leader": "Squadron leader ( Sqn Ldr in the RAF ; SQNLDR in the RAAF and RNZAF ; formerly sometimes S/L in all services ) is a commissioned rank in the Royal Air Force and the air forces of many countries which have historical British influence . It is also sometimes used as the English translation of an equivalent rank in countries which have a non-English air force-specific rank structure . An air force squadron leader ranks above flight lieutenant and immediately below wing commander and it is the most junior of the senior officer ranks . The air force rank of squadron leader has a NATO ranking code of OF-3 , equivalent to a lieutenant-commander in the Royal Navy or a major in the British Army or the Royal Marines . The equivalent rank in the Women 's Auxiliary Air Force , Women 's Royal Air Force ( until 1968 ) and Princess Mary 's Royal Air Force Nursing Service ( until 1980 ) was squadron officer . Squadron leader has also been used as a cavalry command appointment ( UK ) and rank ( France ) since at least the nineteenth century . In Argentina it is used as a command appointment by both the army 's cavalry and by the air force 's flying units . The cavalry rank of squadron leader in France is also an OF-4 equivalent to a major , and the cavalry appointment of squadron leader in the UK generally corresponds to this rank as well .",

  "/wiki/Killed_in_action": "Killed in action ( KIA ) is a casualty classification generally used by militaries to describe the deaths of their own combatants at the hands of hostile forces . The United States Department of Defense , for example , says that those declared KIA need not have fired their weapons but have been killed due to hostile attack . KIAs include those killed by friendly fire in the midst of combat , but not from incidents such as accidental vehicle crashes , murder and other non-hostile events or terrorism . KIA can be applied both to front-line combat troops and to naval , air and support troops . Someone who is killed in action during a particular event is denoted with a \u2020 ( dagger ) beside their name to signify their death in that event or events . [ citation needed ] Further , KIA denotes a person to have been killed in action on the battlefield whereas died of wounds ( DOW ) relates to someone who survived to reach a medical treatment facility . The North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) also uses DWRIA , rather than DOW , for died of wounds received in action . However , historically , militaries and historians have used the former acronym . [ citation needed ] PKIA means presumed killed in action . This term is used when personnel are lost in battle , initially listed missing in action ( MIA ) , but after not being found , are later presumed to have not survived .",

The alternative spelling , serjeant , is used in The Rifles and other units that draw their heritage from the British Light Infantry . Its origin is the Latin serviens , 'one who serves ' , through the French term sergent . The term sergeant refers to a non-commissioned officer placed above the rank of a corporal and a police officer immediately below a lieutenant or , in the UK Police forces , below an inspector . In most armies the rank of sergeant corresponds to command of a squad ( or section ) . In Commonwealth armies , it is a more senior rank , corresponding roughly to a platoon second-in-command . In the United States Army , sergeant is a more junior rank corresponding to a four-soldier fireteam leader . More senior non-commissioned ranks are often variations on sergeant , for example staff sergeant , first sergeant , and sergeant major . Many countries use sergeant rank , whether in English or using a cognate with the same origin in another language . The equivalent rank in Arab armies is raq\u012bb ( \u0631\u0642\u064a\u0628 ) , meaning 'overseer ' or 'watcher ' .",

  "/wiki/Hawker_Hurricane": "The Hawker Hurricane is a British single-seat fighter aircraft of the 1930s-40s that was designed and predominantly built by Hawker Aircraft Ltd. for service with the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . It was overshadowed in the public consciousness by the Supermarine Spitfire 's role during Battle of Britain in 1940 , but the Hurricane inflicted 60 percent of the losses sustained by the Luftwaffe in the engagement , and fought in all the major theatres of the Second World War . The Hurricane originated from discussions between RAF officials and aircraft designer Sir Sydney Camm about a proposed monoplane derivative of the Hawker Fury biplane in the early 1930s . Despite an institutional preference for biplanes and lack of interest from the Air Ministry , Hawker refined their monoplane proposal , incorporating several innovations which became critical to wartime fighter aircraft , including retractable landing gear and the more powerful Rolls-Royce Merlin engine . The Air Ministry ordered Hawker 's Interceptor Monoplane in late 1934 , and the prototype Hurricane K5083 performed its maiden flight on 6 November 1935 . In June 1936 , the Hurricane went into production for the Air Ministry ; it entered squadron service on 25 December 1937 . Its manufacture and maintenance was eased by using conventional construction methods so that squadrons could perform many major repairs without external support . The Hurricane was rapidly procured prior to the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 , when the RAF had 18 Hurricane-equipped squadrons in service . The aircraft was relied on to defend against German aircraft operated by the Luftwaffe , including dogfighting with Messerschmitt Bf 109s in multiple theatres of action . The Hurricane was developed through several versions , into bomber-interceptors , fighter-bombers , and ground support aircraft as well as fighters . Versions designed for the Royal Navy known as the Sea Hurricane had modifications enabling operation from ships . Some were converted as catapult-launched convoy escorts .",
