  "/wiki/French_Renaissance_architecture": "French Renaissance architecture is a style which was prominent between the 15th and early 17th centuries in the Kingdom of France . It succeeded French Gothic architecture . The style was originally imported from Italy next after the Hundred Years ' War by the French kings Charles VII , Louis XI , Charles VIII , Louis XII , and Fran\u00e7ois I . Several notable royal ch\u00e2teaux in this style were built in the Loire Valley , notably the Chateau de Montsoreau , the Chateau de Langeais , the Chateau d'Amboise , the Chateau of Blois , the Chateau of Gaillon , and the Chateau of Chambord , and , closer to Paris , the Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau . This style of French architecture had two distinct periods . During the first period , between about 1450 and 1590 , the Italian style was copied directly , often by Italian architects and craftsmen . In the second period , between 1540 and the end of the Valois dynasty in 1589 , French architects and craftsmen gave the style a more distinctive and original French character . The major architects of the style included the royal architects Philibert Delorme , Pierre Lescot and Jean Bullant , and the Italian architect and architectural theorist Sebastiano Serlio .",
  "/wiki/Italian_Renaissance_architecture": "Renaissance architecture is the European architecture of the period between the early 14th and early 16th centuries in different regions , demonstrating a conscious revival and development of certain elements of ancient Greek and Roman thought and material culture . Stylistically , Renaissance architecture followed Gothic architecture and was succeeded by Baroque architecture . Developed first in Florence , with Filippo Brunelleschi as one of its innovators , the Renaissance style quickly spread to other Italian cities . The style was carried to France , Germany , England , Russia and other parts of Europe at different dates and with varying degrees of impact . Renaissance style places emphasis on symmetry , proportion , geometry and the regularity of parts , as they are demonstrated in the architecture of classical antiquity and in particular ancient Roman architecture , of which many examples remained . Orderly arrangements of columns , pilasters and lintels , as well as the use of semicircular arches , hemispherical domes , niches and aedicula replaced the more complex proportional systems and irregular profiles of medieval buildings .",
  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",

  "/wiki/Queen_Anne_style_architecture_in_the_United_States": "In the United States , Queen Anne-style architecture was popular from roughly 1880 to 1910 . Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era . Within the Victorian era timeline , Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles . The style bears almost no relationship to the Queen Anne style architecture , a toned-down version of English Baroque mostly used for gentry houses , produced in the actual reign of Queen Anne from 1702 to 1714 . It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right . Queen Anne , as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture , is broadly applied to architecture , furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910 ; some Queen Anne architectural elements , such as the wraparound front porch , continued to be found into the 1920s .",

  "/wiki/Progressive_Era": "The Progressive Era was a period of widespread social activism and political reform across the United States that spanned the 1890s to the 1920s . The main objectives of the Progressive movement were addressing problems caused by industrialization , urbanization , immigration , and political corruption . The movement primarily targeted political machines and their bosses . By taking down these corrupt representatives in office , a further means of direct democracy would be established . They also sought regulation of monopolies ( trustbusting ) and corporations through antitrust laws , which were seen as a way to promote equal competition for the advantage of legitimate competitors . They also advocated for new government roles and regulations , and new agencies to carry out those roles , such as the FDA . Many progressives supported prohibition of alcoholic beverages , ostensibly to destroy the political power of local bosses based in saloons , but others out of a religious motivation . At the same time , women 's suffrage was promoted to bring a purer female vote into the arena . A third theme was building an Efficiency Movement in every sector that could identify old ways that needed modernizing , and bring to bear scientific , medical and engineering solutions ; a key part of the efficiency movement was scientific management , or Taylorism . In Michael McGerr 's book A Fierce Discontent , Jane Addams stated that she believed in the necessity of association of stepping across the social boundaries of industrial America . Many activists joined efforts to reform local government , public education , medicine , finance , insurance , industry , railroads , churches , and many other areas .

In two of the 45 states , the speaker of the upper house of the state legislature serves in such a capacity . In most cases , the lieutenant governor is the highest officer of state after the governor , standing in for that officer when they are absent from the state or temporarily incapacitated . In the event a governor dies , resigns or is removed from office , the lieutenant governor typically becomes governor . In 25 states , the governor and lieutenant governor are elected on the same ticket , ensuring that they come from the same political party . In the remaining 18 states , they are elected separately and , thus , may come from different parties . The lieutenant governor is also frequently the presiding officer of the upper house of the state legislature , similar to the Vice President of the United States . Among the seven states without a separate , full-time office of lieutenant governor , two states have a post of lieutenant governor that is filled by the highest officer of the State Senate . In Tennessee , the full title of the leader of the Senate is lieutenant governor and speaker of the Senate . In West Virginia , the title of lieutenant governor is assigned by statute to the Senate President . With the exception of Arkansas , Georgia , Tennessee , Texas , Virginia , Washington and West Virginia , every state has had a female lieutenant governor or equivalent .

Under the broad designation Renaissance architecture nineteenth-century architects and critics went beyond the architectural style which began in Florence and central Italy in the early 15th century as an expression of Renaissance humanism ; they also included styles we would identify as Mannerist or Baroque . Self-applied style designations were rife in the mid- and later nineteenth century : Neo-Renaissance might be applied by contemporaries to structures that others called Italianate , or when many French Baroque features are present ( Second Empire ) . The divergent forms of Renaissance architecture in different parts of Europe , particularly in France and Italy , has added to the difficulty of defining and recognizing Neo-Renaissance architecture . A comparison between the breadth of its source material , such as the English Wollaton Hall , Italian Palazzo Pitti , the French Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord , and the Russian Palace of Facets - all deemed Renaissance - illustrates the variety of appearances the same architectural label can take .",
