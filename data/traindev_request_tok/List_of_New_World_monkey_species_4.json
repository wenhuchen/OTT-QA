  "/wiki/White-faced_saki": "The white-faced saki ( Pithecia pithecia ) , called the Guianan saki and the golden-faced saki , is a species of the New World saki monkey . They can be found in Brazil , French Guiana , Guyana , Suriname and Venezuela . This species lives in the understory and lower canopy of the forest , feeding mostly on fruits , nuts , seeds , humans , and insects . Although they are arboreal creatures and are specialists of swinging from tree to tree ( brachiation ) , they are also terrestrial when foraging . White-faced sakis typically live around 14 years in their natural habitat and have been recorded to live up to 36 years in captivity . Sakis are active in the day and sleep highly elevated ( 15-20m ) in trees with many leaves to shelter them from weather and flying predators . A formerly recognized subspecies of this monkey , P. p. chrysocephala , was elevated to full species status as P. chrysocephala in 2014 .",

He is known as the father of modern taxonomy . Many of his writings were in Latin , and his name is rendered in Latin as Carolus Linn\u00e6us ( after 1761 Carolus a Linn\u00e9 ) . Linnaeus was born in the countryside of Sm\u00e5land in southern Sweden . He received most of his higher education at Uppsala University and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730 . He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738 , where he studied and also published the first edition of his Systema Naturae in the Netherlands . He then returned to Sweden where he became professor of medicine and botany at Uppsala . In the 1740s , he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals . In the 1750s and 1760s , he continued to collect and classify animals , plants , and minerals , while publishing several volumes . He was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe at the time of his death . Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau sent him the message : Tell him I know no greater man on earth . Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote : With the exception of Shakespeare and Spinoza , I know no one among the no longer living who has influenced me more strongly .",
  "/wiki/Monk_saki": "The monk saki ( Pithecia monachus ) also known as Geoffroy 's monk saki or Miller 's monk saki , is a species of saki monkey , a type of New World monkey , from South America . It is found in forested areas of northwestern Brazil , northeastern Peru , eastern Ecuador and southeastern Colombia . This monkey can grow up to be 30 to 50 centimetres ( 12 to 20 in ) long and weigh about 1 to 2 kilograms ( 2 lb 3 oz to 4 lb 7 oz ) , approximately the same as a large rabbit . The thick , bushy tail can be up to 25 to 55 centimetres ( 10 to 22 in ) long . It has coarse fur , which is long and shaggy around the face and neck . A shy , wary animal , it is totally arboreal , living high in the trees and sometimes descending to lower levels but not to the ground . It generally moves on all fours but may sometimes walk upright on a large branch and will leap across gaps . During the day , it moves in pairs or small family groups , feeding on fruits , berries , honey , some leaves , small mammals such as mice and bats , and birds . The female gives birth to 1 young per mating season with the average family size being 4.5 .",

Geoffroy 's scientific views had a transcendental flavor ( unlike Lamarck 's materialistic views ) and were similar to those of German morphologists like Lorenz Oken . He believed in the underlying unity of organismal design , and the possibility of the transmutation of species in time , amassing evidence for his claims through research in comparative anatomy , paleontology , and embryology .",

He was the younger brother of the Prussian minister , philosopher , and linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt ( 1767-1835 ) . Humboldt 's quantitative work on botanical geography laid the foundation for the field of biogeography . Humboldt 's advocacy of long-term systematic geophysical measurement laid the foundation for modern geomagnetic and meteorological monitoring . Between 1799 and 1804 , Humboldt travelled extensively in the Americas , exploring and describing them for the first time from a modern scientific point of view . His description of the journey was written up and published in an enormous set of volumes over 21 years . Humboldt was one of the first people to propose that the lands bordering the Atlantic Ocean were once joined ( South America and Africa in particular ) . Humboldt resurrected the use of the word cosmos from the ancient Greek and assigned it to his multivolume treatise , Kosmos , in which he sought to unify diverse branches of scientific knowledge and culture . This important work also motivated a holistic perception of the universe as one interacting entity . He was the first person to describe the phenomenon and cause of human-induced climate change , in 1800 and again in 1831 , based on observations generated during his travels .",

  "/wiki/Arac\u00e1_uakari": "The Arac\u00e1 uakari ( Cacajao ayresi ) , also known as the Ayres black uakari , is a newly described species of monkey from the northwest Brazilian Amazon . It was found by Jean-Phillipe Boubli of the University of Auckland after following native Yanomamo Indians on their hunts along the Rio Arac\u00e1 , a northern tributary of the Rio Negro . It was subsequently described in 2008 together with the more westerly distributed Neblina uakari . Until then , the black-headed uakari was the only species of mainly black uakari that was recognized . Stephen F. Ferrari et al proposed treating the Arac\u00e1 uakari as a subspecies of the black-headed uakari rather than as a separate species . This monkey is named after Brazilian biologist Jos\u00e9 M\u00e1rcio Ayres , formerly a senior zoologist for the Wildlife Conservation Society . Jos\u00e9 M\u00e1rcio Ayres , who died in 2003 , pioneered studies in uakaris and played a fundamental role in the creation of the Mamirau\u00e1 Sustainable Development Reserve , which is of great importance for the white uakari . Very little is known about the Arac\u00e1 uakari , but based on present knowledge it has the smallest distribution of all species of uakaris ( possibly as small as 5,000-6,000 square kilometres ( 1,900-2,300 sq mi ) ) and is the only one not found in any protected area .

  "/wiki/Neblina_uakari": "The Neblina uakari ( Cacajao hosomi ) or black-headed uakari , is a newly described species of monkey from the far northwest Brazilian Amazon and adjacent southern Venezuela .

Until then , the black-headed uakari ( found to the west and south of the Neblina uakari ) was the only species of mainly black uakari that was recognized . The English name of the Neblina uakari refers to the Pico da Neblina , which marks the approximate center of its known distribution . Several years before it was realized it represented an undescribed species ( and not just black-headed uakaris ) , it was studied in the Pico da Neblina National Park in Brazil . When combined with the adjacent Serran\u00eda de la Neblina National Park in Venezuela , a significant part of this uakaris distribution is within protected areas . It has well coordinated travel established through constant calling , allowing a group to spread 200 to 300 meters . Females produce one offspring , typically in March and April coinciding with the fruiting season ."
