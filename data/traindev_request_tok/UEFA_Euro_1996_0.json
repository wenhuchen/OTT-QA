Portugal 's first participation in a major tournament finals was at the 1966 World Cup , which saw a team featuring Ballon d'Or winner Eus\u00e9bio finish in third place . The next two times Portugal qualified for the World Cup finals were in 1986 and 2002 , going out in the first round both times . Portugal also made it to the semi-finals of the UEFA Euro 1984 final tournament , losing 3-2 after extra time to the hosts and eventual winners France . During this time , Portugal was not part of a group of teams that were candidates to win titles , but from 2000 until this present day , the team evolved , being present in all the final stages of major tournaments , due to the presence of several world-class players such as Lu\u00eds Figo , Rui Costa , Deco , Ricardo Carvalho , and Cristiano Ronaldo , who were dubbed as Portugal 's golden generation , who were considered as the best of the world at their time and among the best in history . Portugal 's golden generation helped Portugal reach the semi-finals of Euro 2000 , losing 2-1 after extra time to eventual winners France , securing the second place at Euro 2004 Final after losing to Greece on home soil , as well reaching the semi-finals of the 2006 World Cup losing to finalist France , after a penalty , leading Portugal to secure the fourth place in the tournament , after losing to 3-1 to hosts Germany , thus being the best result since the 1966 World Cup . Despite losing many players of the golden generation , new players such as F\u00e1bio Coentr\u00e3o , Jo\u00e3o Moutinho , Nani and Pepe helped the Portuguese reach the semi-finals of Euro 2012 , losing to Spain in penalties , with Cristiano Ronaldo finishing as joint top scorer of the tournament with three goals . In 2014 , Fernando Santos was appointed as the new head coach for the national team . Two years later at Euro 2016 , Santos brought Portugal its first ever major trophy , defeating hosts France 1-0 after extra time , with the winning goal scored by Eder . With the win , Portugal qualified and made its first appearance in the FIFA Confederations Cup held in Russia , where they finished in third place . Portugal hosted the brand new 2018-19 UEFA Nations League as well as winning the trophy , defeating the Netherlands 1-0 , with the winning goal scored by Gon\u00e7alo Guedes , making it the second major tournament earned by the Portuguese in three finals .",
