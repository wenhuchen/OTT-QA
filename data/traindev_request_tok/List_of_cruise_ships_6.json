  "/wiki/Ocean_liner": "An ocean liner is a passenger ship primarily used as a form of transportation across seas or oceans . Liners may also carry cargo or mail , and may sometimes be used for other purposes ( such as for pleasure cruises or as hospital ships ) . Cargo vessels running to a schedule are sometimes called liners . The category does not include ferries or other vessels engaged in short-sea trading , nor dedicated cruise ships where the voyage itself , and not transportation , is the prime purpose of the trip . Nor does it include tramp steamers , even those equipped to handle limited numbers of passengers . Some shipping companies refer to themselves as lines and their container ships , which often operate over set routes according to established schedules , as liners . Ocean liners are usually strongly built with a high freeboard to withstand rough seas and adverse conditions encountered in the open ocean . Additionally , they are often designed with thicker hull plating than is found on cruise ships , and have large capacities for fuel , food and other consumables on long voyages . The first ocean liners were built in the mid-19th century . Technological innovations such as the steam engine and steel hull allowed larger and faster liners to be built , giving rise to a competition between world powers of the time , especially between the United Kingdom and Germany . Once the dominant form of travel between continents , ocean liners were rendered largely obsolete by the emergence of long-distance aircraft after World War II . Advances in automobile and railway technology also played a role .",

In 1995 , Regency went bankrupt , and Regent Sea was auctioned off to United States American Cruise Line , who started on a conversion to a casino ship , but which was never completed due to bankruptcy of the new owner . In early 2001 the ship was sold for scrap and began a journey under tow to breakers in India .
