His 1920s syndicated newspaper column and his radio appearances increased his visibility and popularity . Rogers crusaded for aviation expansion and provided Americans with first-hand accounts of his world travels . His earthy anecdotes and folksy style allowed him to poke fun at gangsters , prohibition , politicians , government programs , and a host of other controversial topics in a way that found general acclaim from a national audience with no one offended .

Also an author , Shaw wrote both fiction and non-fiction . Widely regarded as one of jazz 's finest clarinetists , Shaw led one of the United States ' most popular big bands in the late 1930s through the early 1940s . Though he had numerous hit records , he was perhaps best known for his 1938 recording of Cole Porter 's Begin the Beguine . Before the release of Beguine , Shaw and his fledgling band had languished in relative obscurity for over two years and , after its release , he became a major pop artist within short order . The record eventually became one of the era 's defining recordings . Musically restless , Shaw was also an early proponent of what became known much later as Third Stream music , which blended elements of classical and jazz forms and traditions . His music influenced other musicians , such as Monty Norman in England , with the vamp of the James Bond Theme , possibly influenced by 1938 's Nightmare . Shaw also recorded with small jazz groups drawn from within the ranks of the various big bands he led . He served in the US Navy from 1942 to 1944 , ( during which time he led a morale-building band that toured the South Pacific amidst the chaos of World War II ) and , following his discharge in 1944 , he returned to lead a band through 1945 . Following the breakup of that band , he began to focus on other interests and gradually withdrew from the world of being a professional musician and major celebrity , although he remained a force in popular music and jazz before retiring from music completely in 1954 .",

  "/wiki/Normandy_landings": "The Normandy landings were the landing operations on Tuesday , 6 June 1944 of the Allied invasion of Normandy in Operation Overlord during World War II . Codenamed Operation Neptune and often referred to as D-Day , it was the largest seaborne invasion in history . The operation began the liberation of German-occupied France ( and later western Europe ) and laid the foundations of the Allied victory on the Western Front . Planning for the operation began in 1943 . In the months leading up to the invasion , the Allies conducted a substantial military deception , codenamed Operation Bodyguard , to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings . The weather on D-Day was far from ideal , and the operation had to be delayed 24 hours ; a further postponement would have meant a delay of at least two weeks , as the invasion planners had requirements for the phase of the moon , the tides , and the time of day that meant only a few days each month were deemed suitable . Adolf Hitler placed German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in command of German forces and of developing fortifications along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an Allied invasion . The amphibious landings were preceded by extensive aerial and naval bombardment and an airborne assault - the landing of 24,000 American , British , and Canadian airborne troops shortly after midnight . Allied infantry and armoured divisions began landing on the coast of France at 06:30 . The target 50-mile ( 80 km ) stretch of the Normandy coast was divided into five sectors : Utah , Omaha , Gold , Juno , and Sword . Strong winds blew the landing craft east of their intended positions , particularly at Utah and Omaha . The men landed under heavy fire from gun emplacements overlooking the beaches , and the shore was mined and covered with obstacles such as wooden stakes , metal tripods , and barbed wire , making the work of the beach-clearing teams difficult and dangerous .",

  "/wiki/South_Pacific_(musical)": "South Pacific is a musical composed by Richard Rodgers , with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II and book by Hammerstein and Joshua Logan . The work premiered in 1949 on Broadway and was an immediate hit , running for 1,925 performances . The plot is based on James A. Michener 's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1947 book Tales of the South Pacific and combines elements of several of those stories . Rodgers and Hammerstein believed they could write a musical based on Michener 's work that would be financially successful and , at the same time , send a strong progressive message on racism . The plot centers on an American nurse stationed on a South Pacific island during World War II , who falls in love with a middle-aged expatriate French plantation owner but struggles to accept his mixed-race children . A secondary romance , between a U.S. lieutenant and a young Tonkinese woman , explores his fears of the social consequences should he marry his Asian sweetheart . The issue of racial prejudice is candidly explored throughout the musical , most controversially in the lieutenant 's song , You 've Got to Be Carefully Taught . Supporting characters , including a comic petty officer and the Tonkinese girl 's mother , help to tie the stories together . Because he lacked military knowledge , Hammerstein had difficulty writing that part of the script ; the director of the original production , Logan , assisted him and received credit as co-writer of the book . The original Broadway production enjoyed immense critical and box-office success , became the second-longest running Broadway musical to that point ( behind Rodgers and Hammerstein 's earlier Oklahoma ! ( 1943 ) ) , and has remained popular ever since . After they signed Ezio Pinza and Mary Martin as the leads , Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote several of the songs with the particular talents of their stars in mind .",
