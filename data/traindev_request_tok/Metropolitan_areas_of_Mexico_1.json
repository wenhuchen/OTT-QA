  "/wiki/Metropolitan_Area": "A metropolitan area is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories , sharing industry , infrastructure , and housing . A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities : neighborhoods , townships , boroughs , cities , towns , exurbs , suburbs , counties , districts , states , and even nations like the eurodistricts . As social , economic and political institutions have changed , metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions . Metropolitan areas include satellite cities , towns and intervening rural areas that are socioeconomically tied to the urban core , typically measured by commuting patterns . Most metropolitan areas are anchored by one major city such as Paris metropolitan area ( Paris ) and New York metropolitan area ( New York City ) . In some cases metropolitan areas have multiple centers of close to equal importance , such as Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area ( Dallas and Fort Worth ) and Islamabad-Rawalpindi metropolitan area ( Islamabad and Rawalpindi ) . In the United States , the concept of the metropolitan statistical area has gained prominence . Metropolitan areas may themselves be part of larger megalopolises . For urban centres outside metropolitan areas , that generate a similar attraction at smaller scale for their region , the concept of the regiopolis and respectively regiopolitan area or regio was introduced by German professors in 2006 . In the United States , the term micropolitan statistical area is used .",

  "/wiki/U.S._state": "In the United States , a state is a constituent political entity , of which there are currently 50 . Bound together in a political union , each state holds governmental jurisdiction over a separate and defined geographic territory and shares its sovereignty with the federal government . Due to this shared sovereignty , Americans are citizens both of the federal republic and of the state in which they reside . State citizenship and residency are flexible , and no government approval is required to move between states , except for persons restricted by certain types of court orders ( such as paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody ) . States are divided into counties or county-equivalents , which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign . County or county-equivalent structure varies widely by state , and states may also create other local governments . State governments are allocated power by the people ( of each respective state ) through their individual constitutions . All are grounded in republican principles , and each provides for a government , consisting of three branches , each with separate and independent powers : executive , legislative , and judicial . States , unlike U.S. territories , possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution . States and their residents are represented in the United States Congress , a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives . Each state is also entitled to select a number of electors ( equal to the total number of representatives and senators from that state ) to vote in the Electoral College , the body that directly elects the President of the United States . Additionally , each state has the opportunity to ratify constitutional amendments , and , with the consent of Congress , two or more states may enter into interstate compacts with one another .",
