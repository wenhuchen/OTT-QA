  "/wiki/1500_metres_world_record_progression": "The 1500-metre run became a standard racing distance in Europe in the late 19th century , perhaps as a metric version of the mile , a popular running distance since at least the 1850s in English-speaking countries . A distance of 1500 m sometimes is called the metric mile . The French had the first important races over the distance , holding their initial championship in 1888 . When the Olympic games were revived in 1896 , metric distances were run , including the 1500 . However , most of the best milers in the world were absent , and the winning time of 4:33 1/5 by Australian Edwin Flack was almost 18 seconds slower than the amateur mile record , despite the fact the mile is 109 metres longer than the 1500 metres . The 1900 Olympics and 1904 Olympics showed improvements in times run , but it was not until the 1908 Olympics that a meeting of the top milers over the distance took place , and not until the 1912 Olympics that a true world-class race over the distance was run . The distance has now almost completely replaced the mile in major track meets .",

  "/wiki/Mile_run_world_record_progression": "The world record in the mile run is the best mark set by a male or female runner in the middle-distance track and field event . The IAAF is the official body which oversees the records . Hicham El Guerrouj is the current men 's record holder with his time of 3:43.13 , while Sifan Hassan has the women 's record , pending ratification , of 4:12.33 . Since 1976 , the mile has been the only non-metric distance recognized by the IAAF for record purposes . Accurate times for the mile run ( 1.609344 km ) were not recorded until after 1850 , when the first precisely measured running tracks were built . Foot racing had become popular in England by the 17th century , when footmen would race and their masters would wager on the result . [ citation needed ] By the 19th century pedestrianism , as it was called , had become extremely popular and the best times recorded in the period were by professionals . [ citation needed ] Even after professional foot racing died out , it was not until 1915 that the professional record of 4:12\u200b3\u20444 ( set by Walter George in 1886 ) was surpassed by an amateur .

As the oldest town in the country Turku was the most important city in Finland , a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden .

It was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku ( Turun Akatemia ) founded in 1640 , which then became the University of Helsinki . Turku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s , and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port . Because of its long history , it has been the site of many important events , and has extensively influenced Finnish history .
