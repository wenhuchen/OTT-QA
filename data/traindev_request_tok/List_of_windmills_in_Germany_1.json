  "/wiki/Smock_mill": "The smock mill is a type of windmill that consists of a sloping , horizontally weatherboarded or thatched tower , usually with six or eight sides . It is topped with a roof or cap that rotates to bring the sails into the wind . This type of windmill got its name from its resemblance to smocks worn by farmers in an earlier period .",

  "/wiki/Post_mill": "The post mill is the earliest type of European windmill . Its defining feature is that the whole body of the mill that houses the machinery is mounted on a single vertical post , around which it can be turned to bring the sails into the wind . The earliest post mills in England are thought to have been built in the 12th century . The earliest working post mill in England still used today is to be found at Outwood , Surrey . It was built in 1665 . The earliest remaining example of a non-operational mill can be found in Great Gransden in Cambridgeshire , built in 1612 . Their design and usage peaked in the 18th and 19th centuries and then declined after the introduction of high-speed steam-driven milling machinery . Many still exist today , primarily to be found in Northern Europe and Great Britain . The term peg mill or peg and post mill ( in which the post was the tailpole used to turn the mill into the wind ) was used in north west England , and stob mill in north east England , to describe mills of this type . Post mills dominated the scene in Europe until the 19th century when tower mills began to replace them . The advantage of the tower mill over the earlier post mill is that it is not necessary to turn the whole mill ( body , buck ) with all its machinery into the wind ; this allows more space for the machinery as well as for storage .",
  "/wiki/Kreuzberg": "Kreuzberg ( German pronunciation : [ \u02c8k\u0281\u0254\u028ftsb\u025b\u0250\u032fk ] ( listen ) ) , is a district of Berlin , Germany . It is part of the Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg borough located south of Mitte . During the Cold War era , it was one of the poorest areas of West Berlin , but since German reunification in 1990 it has become more gentrified and known for its arts scene . The borough is known for its very large percentage of immigrants and descendants of immigrants , many of whom are of Turkish ancestry . As of 2006 , 31.6% of Kreuzberg 's inhabitants did not have German citizenship . While Kreuzberg thrives on its diverse culture and is still an attractive area for many , the district is also characterized by high levels of unemployment and some of the lowest average incomes in Berlin . The counterculture tradition of Kreuzberg led to a plurality of votes for the Green Party , which is unique among all Berlin boroughs . The local MP Canan Bayram is the only Green politician directly elected to the federal Bundestag parliament .",

  "/wiki/Tower_mill": "A tower mill is a type of vertical windmill consisting of a brick or stone tower , on which sits a wooden 'cap ' or roof , which can rotate to bring the sails into the wind . This rotating cap on a firm masonry base gave tower mills great advantages over earlier post mills , as they could stand much higher , bear larger sails , and thus afford greater reach into the wind . Windmills in general had been known to civilization for centuries , but the tower mill represented an improvement on traditional western-style windmills . The tower mill was an important source of power for Europe for nearly 600 years from 1300-1900 , contributing to 25 percent of the industrial power of all wind machines before the advent of the steam engine and coal power . It represented a modification or a demonstration of improving and adapting technology that had been known by humans for ages . Although these types of mills were effective , some argue that , owing to their complexity , they would have initially been built mainly by the most wealthy individuals ."
