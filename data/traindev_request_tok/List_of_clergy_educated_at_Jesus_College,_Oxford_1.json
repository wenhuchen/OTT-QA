  "/wiki/Westminster_Abbey": "Westminster Abbey , formally titled the Collegiate Church of Saint Peter at Westminster , is a large , mainly Gothic abbey church in the City of Westminster , London , England , just to the west of the Palace of Westminster .

The building itself was a Benedictine monastic church until the monastery was dissolved in 1539 . Between 1540 and 1556 , the abbey had the status of a cathedral . Since 1560 , the building is no longer an abbey or a cathedral , having instead the status of a Church of England Royal Peculiar - a church responsible directly to the sovereign . According to a tradition first reported by Sulcard in about 1080 , a church was founded at the site ( then known as Thorn Ey ( Thorn Island ) ) in the seventh century , at the time of Mellitus , a Bishop of London . Construction of the present church began in 1245 , on the orders of King Henry III . Since the coronation of William the Conqueror in 1066 , all coronations of English and British monarchs have been in Westminster Abbey . There have been 16 royal weddings at the abbey since 1100 . As the burial site of more than 3,300 persons , usually of prominence in British history ( including at least sixteen monarchs , eight Prime Ministers , poets laureate , actors , scientists , military leaders , and the Unknown Warrior ) , Westminster Abbey is sometimes described as 'Britain 's Valhalla ' , after the iconic burial hall of Norse mythology .",

  "/wiki/Modern_History": "The history of the world , in common parlance , is the history of humanity ( or human history ) , as determined from archeology , anthropology , genetics , linguistics , and other disciplines ; and , for periods since the invention of writing , from recorded history and from secondary sources and studies . Humanity 's written history was preceded by its prehistory , beginning with the Palaeolithic Era ( Old Stone Age ) , followed by the Neolithic Era ( New Stone Age ) . The Neolithic saw the Agricultural Revolution begin , between 8000 and 5000 BCE , in the Near East 's Fertile Crescent . During this period , humans began the systematic husbandry of plants and animals . As agriculture advanced , most humans transitioned from a nomadic to a settled lifestyle as farmers in permanent settlements . The relative security and increased productivity provided by farming allowed communities to expand into increasingly larger units , fostered by advances in transportation . Whether in prehistoric or historic times , people always needed to be near reliable sources of potable water . Settlements developed on river banks as early as 3000 BCE in Mesopotamia , on the banks of Egypt 's Nile River , in the Indus River valley , and along China 's rivers . As farming developed , grain agriculture became more sophisticated and prompted a division of labour to store food between growing seasons . Labour divisions led to the rise of a leisured upper class and the development of cities , which provided the foundation for civilization . The growing complexity of human societies necessitated systems of accounting and writing . With civilizations flourishing , ancient history ( Antiquity , including the Classical Age , up to about 500 CE ) saw the rise and fall of empires .",
