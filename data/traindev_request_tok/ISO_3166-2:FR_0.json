It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire , as did all Romance languages . French evolved from Gallo-Romance , the spoken Latin in Gaul , and more specifically in Northern Gaul . Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders . Today , owing to France 's past overseas expansion , there are numerous French-based creole languages , most notably Haitian Creole . A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French . French is an official language in 29 countries across multiple continents , most of which are members of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie ( OIF ) , the community of 84 countries which share the official use or teaching of French . It is spoken as a first language ( in descending order of the number of speakers ) in France , the Canadian provinces of Quebec , Ontario and New Brunswick as well as other Francophone regions , Belgium ( Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region ) , western Switzerland ( cantons of Bern , Fribourg , Geneva , Jura , Neuch\u00e2tel , Vaud , Valais ) , Monaco , partly in Luxembourg , the states of Louisiana , Maine , New Hampshire and Vermont in the United States , and in northwestern Italy ( region of Aosta Valley ) , and by various communities elsewhere . In 2015 , approximately 40% of the francophone population ( including L2 and partial speakers ) lived in Europe , 35% in sub-Saharan Africa , 15% in North Africa and the Middle East , 8% in the Americas , and 1% in Asia and Oceania . French is the fourth most widely spoken mother tongue in the European Union . Of Europeans who speak other languages natively , approximately one-fifth are able to speak French as a second language .",

It became an independent kingdom and then a duchy before being united with the Kingdom of France in 1532 as a province governed as if it were a separate nation under the crown . Brittany has also been referred to as Less , Lesser or Little Britain ( as opposed to Great Britain , with which it shares an etymology ) . It is bordered by the English Channel to the north , Normandy to the northeast , Pays de la Loire to the southeast , the Bay of Biscay to the south , and the Celtic Sea and the Atlantic Ocean to the west . Its land area is 34,023 km\u00b2 ( 13,136 sq mi ) . Brittany is the site of some of the world 's oldest standing architecture , home to the Barnenez , the Tumulus Saint-Michel and others , which date to the early 5th millennium BC .

It is located southeast of the French mainland and west of the Italian Peninsula , with the nearest land mass being the Italian island of Sardinia to the immediate south . A single chain of mountains makes up two-thirds of the island . The island is an administrative region of France ( with the regional capital being Ajaccio ) , divided in two administrative departments , Haute-Corse and Corse-du-Sud . The corresponding regional and departmental territorial collectivities , however , merged on 1 January 2018 , forming the single territorial collectivity of Corsica . As a single territorial collectivity , Corsica enjoys a greater degree of autonomy than other French regional collectivities ; for example , the Corsican Assembly is able to exercise limited executive powers . Bastia , the prefecture city of Haute-Corse , is the second largest town in Corsica . After being ruled by the Republic of Genoa since 1284 , in 1755 Corsica became a self-proclaimed Italian-speaking Republic , until it was officially ceded by Genoa to Louis XV as part of a pledge for debts and subsequently annexed to France in 1769 . Napoleon Bonaparte was born the same year in Ajaccio , and his ancestral home ( Maison Bonaparte ) is today a significant visitor attraction and museum . Due to Corsica 's historical ties with the Italian peninsula , the island retains many Italian cultural elements , and the native tongue is recognized as a regional language by the French government .",
