  "/wiki/System_of_government": "A government is the system or group of people governing an organized community , often a state . In the case of its broad associative definition , government normally consists of legislature , executive , and judiciary . Government is a means by which organizational policies are enforced , as well as a mechanism for determining policy . Each government has a kind of constitution , a statement of its governing principles and philosophy . Typically the philosophy chosen is some balance between the principle of individual freedom and the idea of absolute state authority ( tyranny ) . While all types of organizations have governance , the word government is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately 200 independent national governments on Earth , as well as subsidiary organizations . Historically prevalent forms of government include monarchy , aristocracy , timocracy , oligarchy , democracy , theocracy and tyranny . The main aspect of any philosophy of government is how political power is obtained , with the two main forms being electoral contest and hereditary succession . Libertarianism and anarchism are political ideologies that seek to limit or abolish government , finding government disruptive to self organization and freedom .",

  "/wiki/Unitary_state": "A unitary state is a state governed as a single power in which the central government is ultimately supreme . The central government may create ( or abolish ) administrative divisions ( sub-national units ) . Such units exercise only the powers that the central government chooses to delegate . Although political power may be delegated through devolution to regional or local governments by statute , the central government may abrogate the acts of devolved governments or curtail ( or expand ) their powers . A large majority of the world 's states ( 166 of the 193 UN member states ) have a unitary system of government . Unitary states stand in contrast with federations , also known as federal states . In federations , the provincial governments share powers with the central government as equal actors through a written constitution , to which the consent of both is required to make amendments . This means that the sub-national units have a right of existence and powers that can not be unilaterally changed by the central government . The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is an example of a unitary state . Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland have a degree of autonomous devolved power , but such power is delegated by the Parliament of the United Kingdom , which may enact laws unilaterally altering or abolishing devolution ( England does not have any devolved power ) . Similarly in the Kingdom of Spain , the devolved powers are delegated through the central government . Many unitary states have no areas possessing a degree of autonomy .",

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories .

Situated in the southeast of the Asia-Pacific region , Oceania , when compared to continental regions , is the smallest in land area and the second smallest in population after Antarctica . Oceania has a diverse mix of economies from the highly developed and globally competitive financial markets of Australia and New Zealand , which rank high in quality of life and human development index , to the much less developed economies that belong to countries such as Kiribati and Tuvalu , while also including medium-sized economies of Pacific islands such as Palau , Fiji and Tonga . The largest and most populous country in Oceania is Australia , with Sydney being the largest city of both Oceania and Australia . The first settlers of Australia , New Guinea , and the large islands just to the east arrived more than 60,000 years ago . [ citation needed ] Oceania was first explored by Europeans from the 16th century onward . Portuguese navigators , between 1512 and 1526 , reached the Tanimbar Islands , some of the Caroline Islands and west Papua New Guinea . On his first voyage in the 18th century , James Cook , who later arrived at the highly developed Hawaiian Islands , went to Tahiti and followed the east coast of Australia for the first time . The Pacific front saw major action during the Second World War , mainly between Allied powers the United States and Australia , and Axis power Japan . The arrival of European settlers in subsequent centuries resulted in a significant alteration in the social and political landscape of Oceania . In more contemporary times there has been increasing discussion on national flags and a desire by some Oceanians to display their distinguishable and individualistic identity .",

  "/wiki/Federation": "A federation ( also known as a federal state ) is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing provinces , states , or other regions under a central federal government ( federalism ) . In a federation , the self-governing status of the component states , as well as the division of power between them and the central government , is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party , the states or the federal political body . Alternatively , a federation is a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided between a central authority and a number of constituent regions so that each region retains some degree of control over its internal affairs . It is often argued that federal states where the central government has overriding powers , are not truly federal states . For example , such overriding powers may include : the constitutional authority to suspend a constituent state 's government by invoking gross mismanagement or civil unrest , or to adopt national legislation that overrides or infringe on the constituent states ' powers by invoking the central government 's constitutional authority to ensure peace and good government or to implement obligations contracted under an international treaty . The governmental or constitutional structure found in a federation is considered to be federalist , or to be an example of federalism . It can be considered the opposite of another system , the unitary state . France , for example , has been unitary for multiple centuries . Austria and its Bundesl\u00e4nder was a unitary state with administrative divisions that became federated through the implementation of the Austrian Constitution following the 1918 collapse of Austria-Hungary . Germany , with its 16 states , or Bundesl\u00e4nder , is an example of a federation . Federations are often multi-ethnic and cover a large area of territory ( such as Russia , the United States , Canada , India , or Brazil ) , but neither is necessarily the case ( such as Saint Kitts and Nevis or the Federated States of Micronesia ) . Several ancient chiefdoms and kingdoms , such as the 4th-century BCE League of Corinth , Noricum in Central Europe , and the Iroquois Confederacy in pre-Columbian North America , could be described as federations or confederations .",

The capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence . The Royal Bahamas Defence Force describes the Bahamas ' territory as encompassing 470,000 km2 ( 180,000 sq mi ) of ocean space . The Bahamas were inhabited by the Lucayans , a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Ta\u00edno people , for many centuries . Columbus was the first European to see the islands , making his first landfall in the 'New World ' in 1492 . Later , the Spanish shipped the native Lucayans to slavery on Hispaniola , after which the Bahama islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648 , when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera . The Bahamas became a British crown colony in 1718 , when the British clamped down on piracy . After the American Revolutionary War , the Crown resettled thousands of American Loyalists to the Bahamas ; they took their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants .

  "/wiki/Republic": "A republic ( Latin : res publica , meaning public affair ) is a form of government in which the country is considered a public matter , not the private concern or property of the rulers . The primary positions of power within a republic are attained , through democracy , oligarchy , autocracy , or a mix thereof , rather than being unalterably occupied . As such it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and has therefore no monarch as head of state . In the context of American constitutional law , the definition of republic refers specifically to a form of government in which elected individuals represent the citizen body [ better source needed ] and exercise power according to the rule of law under a constitution , including separation of powers with an elected head of state , referred to as a constitutional republic or representative democracy . As of 2017 [ update ] , 159 of the world 's 206 sovereign states use the word republic as part of their official names - not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments , nor is the word republic used in the names of all nations with elected governments . The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica , which literally means public thing , public matter , or public affair and was used to refer to the state as a whole . The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic , lasting from the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC to the establishment of the Empire in 27 BC . This constitution was characterized by a Senate composed of wealthy aristocrats and wielding significant influence ; several popular assemblies of all free citizens , possessing the power to elect magistrates and pass laws ; and a series of magistracies with varying types of civil and political authority . Most often a republic is a single sovereign state , but there are also sub-sovereign state entities that are referred to as republics , or that have governments that are described as republican in nature . For instance , Article IV of the United States Constitution guarantee [ s ] to every State in this Union a Republican form of Government . In contrast , the former Soviet Union , which described itself as being a group of Republics and also as a federal multinational state composed of 15 republics , was widely viewed as being a totalitarian form of government and not a genuine republic , since its electoral system was structured so as to automatically guarantee the election of government-sponsored candidates .",

  "/wiki/Absolute_monarchy": "Absolute monarchy ( or absolutism as doctrine ) is a form of monarchy in which the monarch holds supreme autocratic authority , principally not being restricted by written laws , legislature , or customs . These are often hereditary monarchies . In contrast , in constitutional monarchies , the head of state 's authority derives from or is legally bound or restricted by a constitution or legislature . The popularity of the notion of absolute monarchy declined substantially after the French Revolution , which promoted theories of government based on popular sovereignty . Some monarchies have a weak or symbolic legislature and other governmental bodies which the monarch can alter or dissolve at will . Countries where monarchs still maintain absolute power are : Brunei , Eswatini , Oman , Saudi Arabia , Vatican City and the individual emirates composing the United Arab Emirates , which itself is a federation of such monarchies - a federal monarchy .",

Cameroon 's coastline lies on the Bight of Biafra , part of the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean . Although Cameroon is not an ECOWAS member state , it is geographically and historically in West Africa with the Southern Cameroons which now form her Northwest and Southwest Regions having a strong West African history . The country is sometimes identified as West African and other times as Central African due to its strategic position at the crossroads between West and Central Africa . Cameroon is home to over 250 native languages spoken by nearly 20 million people . The official languages of the country are English and French . Early inhabitants of the territory included the Sao civilisation around Lake Chad and the Baka hunter-gatherers in the southeastern rainforest . Portuguese explorers reached the coast in the 15th century and named the area Rio dos Camar\u00f5es ( Shrimp River ) , which became Cameroon in English . Fulani soldiers founded the Adamawa Emirate in the north in the 19th century , and various ethnic groups of the west and northwest established powerful chiefdoms and fondoms . Cameroon became a German colony in 1884 known as Kamerun . After World War I , the territory was divided between France and the United Kingdom as League of Nations mandates .",

  "/wiki/Semi-presidential_republic": "A semi-presidential system or dual executive system is a system of government in which a president exists alongside a prime minister and a cabinet , with the latter being responsible to the legislature of the state . It differs from a parliamentary republic in that it has a popularly elected head of state , who is more than a mostly ceremonial figurehead , and from the presidential system in that the cabinet , although named by the president , is responsible to the legislature , which may force the cabinet to resign through a motion of no confidence . While the Weimar Republic ( 1919-1933 ) exemplified an early semi-presidential system , the term semi-presidential was introduced in a 1959 article by journalist Hubert Beuve-M\u00e9ry and popularized by a 1978 work by political scientist Maurice Duverger , both of which intended to describe the French Fifth Republic ( established in 1958 ) .",

Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 .

Archaeological remains from this period include the well-preserved Neolithic village of Khirokitia , and Cyprus is home to some of the oldest water wells in the world . Cyprus was settled by Mycenaean Greeks in two waves in the 2nd millennium BC . As a strategic location in the Middle East , it was subsequently occupied by several major powers , including the empires of the Assyrians , Egyptians and Persians , from whom the island was seized in 333 BC by Alexander the Great . Subsequent rule by Ptolemaic Egypt , the Classical and Eastern Roman Empire , Arab caliphates for a short period , the French Lusignan dynasty and the Venetians , was followed by over three centuries of Ottoman rule between 1571 and 1878 ( de jure until 1914 ) . Cyprus was placed under the UK 's administration based on the Cyprus Convention in 1878 and was formally annexed by the UK in 1914 . While Turkish Cypriots made up 18% of the population , the partition of Cyprus and creation of a Turkish state in the north became a policy of Turkish Cypriot leaders and Turkey in the 1950s . Turkish leaders for a period advocated the annexation of Cyprus to Turkey as Cyprus was considered an extension of Anatolia by them ; while , since the 19th century , the majority Greek Cypriot population and its Orthodox church had been pursuing union with Greece , which became a Greek national policy in the 1950s .

The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical social construct , with no clear physical separation between them ; thus , in some parts of the world , Eurasia is recognized as the largest of the six , five , or even four continents on Earth . In geology , Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock . However , the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on paleomagnetic data . Eurasia covers around 55,000,000 square kilometres ( 21,000,000 sq mi ) , or around 36.2% of the Earth 's total land area . The landmass contains well over 5 billion people , equating to approximately 70% of the human population . Humans first settled in Eurasia between 60,000 and 125,000 years ago . Some major islands , including Great Britain , Iceland , and Ireland , and those of Japan , the Philippines and Indonesia , are often included under the popular definition of Eurasia , in spite of being separate from the contiguous landmass . Physiographically , Eurasia is a single continent . The concepts of Europe and Asia as distinct continents date back to antiquity and their borders are geologically arbitrary .

  "/wiki/Presidential_republic": "A presidential system is a democratic and republican government in which a head of government leads an executive branch that is separate from the legislative branch . This head of government is in most cases also the head of state , which is called president . In presidential countries , the executive is elected and is not responsible to the legislature , which can not in normal circumstances dismiss it . Such dismissal is possible , however , in uncommon cases , often through impeachment . The title president has persisted from a time when such person personally presided over the governing body , as with the President of the Continental Congress in the early United States , prior to the executive function being split into a separate branch of government . A presidential system contrasts with a parliamentary system , where the head of government is elected to power through the legislative . There is also a hybrid system called semi-presidentialism . Countries that feature a presidential or semi-presidential system of government are not the exclusive users of the title of president . Heads of state of parliamentary republics , largely ceremonial in most cases , are called presidents . Dictators or leaders of one-party states , popularly elected or not , are also often called presidents .

Jamaica lies about 145 kilometres ( 90 mi ) south of Cuba , and 191 kilometres ( 119 mi ) west of Hispaniola ( the island containing the countries of Haiti and the Dominican Republic ) ; the British Overseas Territory of the Cayman Islands lies some 215 kilometres ( 134 mi ) to the north-west . Originally inhabited by the indigenous Arawak and Ta\u00edno peoples , the island came under Spanish rule following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494 . Many of the indigenous people were either killed or died of diseases to which they had no immunity , and the Spanish thus forcibly transplanted large numbers of African slaves to Jamaica as labourers . The island remained a possession of Spain until 1655 , when England ( later Great Britain ) conquered it , renaming it Jamaica . Under British colonial rule Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter , with a plantation economy dependent on the African slaves and later their descendants . The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838 , and many freedmen chose to have subsistence farms rather than to work on plantations . Beginning in the 1840s , the British began utilising Chinese and Indian indentured labour to work on plantations . The island achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 6 August 1962 . With 2.9 million people , Jamaica is the third-most populous Anglophone country in the Americas ( after the United States and Canada ) , and the fourth-most populous country in the Caribbean . Kingston is the country 's capital and largest city ."
