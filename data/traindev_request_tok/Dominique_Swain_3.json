  "/wiki/Lolita_(1997_film)": "Lolita is a 1997 American-French drama film directed by Adrian Lyne and written by Stephen Schiff . It is the second screen adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov 's novel of the same name and stars Jeremy Irons as Humbert Humbert and Dominique Swain as Dolores Lolita Haze , with supporting roles by Melanie Griffith as Charlotte Haze , and Frank Langella as Clare Quilty . The film is about a middle-aged male professor , Humbert , who rents a room in the house of the widow Charlotte Haze and becomes sexually attracted to her adolescent daughter Dolores , also called Lo or Lolita . Lyne 's film is more overt with many of the novel 's darker elements compared to Stanley Kubrick 's 1962 version , which used suggestion and innuendo for comic purposes . The film had difficulty finding an American distributor and premiered in Europe before being released in America . The film was eventually picked up in the United States by Showtime , a cable network , before finally being released theatrically by The Samuel Goldwyn Company . The performances by Irons and Swain impressed audiences , but , although praised by some critics for its faithfulness to Nabokov 's narrative , the film received a mixed critical reception in the United States . Lolita was met with much controversy in Australia , where it was not given a theatrical release until April 1999 .",
