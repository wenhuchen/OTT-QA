  "/wiki/Center_(basketball)": "The center ( C ) , also known as the five position , or the big man , is one of the five positions in a basketball game . The center is normally the tallest player on the team , and often has a great deal of strength and body mass as well . In the NBA , the center is usually 6 feet 10 inches ( 2.08 m ) or taller and usually weighs 240 pounds ( 110 kg ) or more . They traditionally have played close to the basket in the low post . Centers are valued for their ability to protect their own goal while scoring with high efficiency . In the 1950s and 1960s , George Mikan and Bill Russell were centerpieces of championship dynasties and defined early prototypical centers . With the addition of a three-point field goal for the 1979-80 season , however , NBA basketball gradually became more perimeter-oriented and saw the importance of the center position diminished . A center with the ability to shoot outside from three-point range is known as stretch five .",

  "/wiki/Forward-center": "Forward-center or bigman is a basketball position for players who play or have played both forward and center on a consistent basis . Typically , this means power forward and center , since these are usually the two biggest player positions on any basketball team , and therefore more often overlap each other . Forward-center came into the basketball jargon as the game evolved and became more specialized in the 1960s . The five positions on court were originally known only as guards , forwards , and the center , but it is now generally accepted that the five primary positions are point guard , shooting guard , small forward , power forward , and center . Typically , a forward-center is a talented forward who also came to play minutes at center on teams that need help at that position . The player could also be a somewhat floor-bound center , under seven feet tall at the NBA level , whose skills suit him to a power forward position , especially if that team has a better center . One such player is Marcus Camby of the New York Knicks . At 6\u2032 11\u2033 ( 211 cm ) , he generally plays as a center , but when he played for the New York Knicks earlier in his career , he mostly played power forward because his team had one of the best pure centers in the league in 7\u2032 0\u2033 ( 213 cm ) Patrick Ewing . Ewing himself was used as a forward-center early in his career to complement the then-incumbent Knicks center , 7\u2032 1\u2033 ( 216 cm ) Bill Cartwright . Ralph Sampson , at 7\u2032 4\u2033 ( 224 cm ) , was another notable forward-center who played center his rookie year in 1983 .

  "/wiki/Point_guard": "The point guard ( PG ) , also called the one or point , is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game . A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position . Point guards are expected to run the team 's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time . Above all , the point guard must understand and accept their coach 's game plan ; in this way , the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football , a catcher in baseball or a playmaker in soccer ( association football ) . They must also be able to adapt to what the defense is allowing and must control the pace of the game . A point guard , like other player positions in basketball , specializes in certain skills . Their primary job is to facilitate scoring opportunities for their team , or sometimes for themselves . Lee Rose has described a point guard as a coach on the floor , who can handle and distribute the ball to teammates . This involves setting up plays on the court , getting the ball to the teammate in the best position to score , and controlling the tempo of the game . A point guard should know when and how to instigate a fast break and when and how to initiate the more deliberate sets . Point guards are expected to be vocal floor leaders . A point guard needs always to have in mind the times on the shot clock and the game clock , the score , the numbers of remaining timeouts for both teams , etc .",
