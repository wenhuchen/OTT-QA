The most rapid period of growth and development in Blackburn 's history coincided with the industrialisation and expansion of textile manufacturing . Blackburn was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution and amongst the first industrialised towns in the world . [ citation needed ] Blackburn 's textile sector fell into decline from the mid-20th century and subsequently faced similar challenges to other post-industrial northern towns , including deindustrialisation , economic deprivation and housing issues . The town has experienced very high levels of immigration , with people of ethnic backgrounds other than white British making up 30.8% of the population . Blackburn has had significant investment and redevelopment since 1958 through government funding and the European Regional Development Fund .",

Ten years later , at the 2011 census , the city 's population had risen to 75,306 , with 107,524 in the wider city . The early history of Carlisle is marked by its status as a Roman settlement , established to serve the forts on Hadrian 's Wall . During the Middle Ages , because of its proximity to the Kingdom of Scotland , Carlisle became an important military stronghold ; Carlisle Castle , still relatively intact , was built in 1092 by William Rufus , and once served as a prison for Mary , Queen of Scots . The castle now houses the Duke of Lancaster 's Regiment and the Border Regiment Museum . In the early 12th century , Henry I allowed the foundation of a priory in Carlisle . The town gained the status of a city when its diocese was formed in 1133 , and the priory became Carlisle Cathedral . The introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution began a process of socioeconomic transformation in Carlisle , which developed into a densely populated mill town . This , combined with its strategic position , allowed for the development of Carlisle as an important railway town , with seven railway companies sharing Carlisle railway station .",
