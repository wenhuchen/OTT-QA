Oil refineries produce olefins and aromatics by fluid catalytic cracking of petroleum fractions . Chemical plants produce olefins by steam cracking of natural gas liquids like ethane and propane . Aromatics are produced by catalytic reforming of naphtha . Olefins and aromatics are the building-blocks for a wide range of materials such as solvents , detergents , and adhesives . Olefins are the basis for polymers and oligomers used in plastics , resins , fibers , elastomers , lubricants , and gels . Global ethylene and propylene production are about 115 million tonnes and 70 million tonnes per annum , respectively . Aromatics production is approximately 70 million tonnes .
