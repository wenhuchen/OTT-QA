A prolific writer who often drew directly on his personal experience , Strindberg 's career spanned four decades , during which time he wrote over sixty plays and more than thirty works of fiction , autobiography , history , cultural analysis , and politics . A bold experimenter and iconoclast throughout , he explored a wide range of dramatic methods and purposes , from naturalistic tragedy , monodrama , and history plays , to his anticipations of expressionist and surrealist dramatic techniques . From his earliest work , Strindberg developed innovative forms of dramatic action , language , and visual composition . He is considered the father of modern Swedish literature and his The Red Room ( 1879 ) has frequently been described as the first modern Swedish novel . In Sweden , Strindberg is known as an essayist , painter , poet , and especially as a novelist and playwright , but in other countries he is known mostly as a playwright . The Royal Theatre rejected his first major play , Master Olof , in 1872 ; it was not until 1881 , when he was thirty-two , that its premi\u00e8re at the New Theatre gave him his theatrical breakthrough . In his plays The Father ( 1887 ) , Miss Julie ( 1888 ) , and Creditors ( 1889 ) , he created naturalistic dramas that - building on the established accomplishments of Henrik Ibsen 's prose problem plays while rejecting their use of the structure of the well-made play - responded to the call-to-arms of \u00c9mile Zola 's manifesto Naturalism in the Theatre ( 1881 ) and the example set by Andr\u00e9 Antoine 's newly established Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Libre ( opened 1887 ) . In Miss Julie , characterisation replaces plot as the predominant dramatic element ( in contrast to melodrama and the well-made play ) and the determining role of heredity and the environment on the vacillating , disintegrated characters is emphasized . Strindberg modeled his short-lived Scandinavian Experimental Theatre ( 1889 ) in Copenhagen on Antoine 's theatre and he explored the theory of Naturalism in his essays On Psychic Murder ( 1887 ) , On Modern Drama and the Modern Theatre ( 1889 ) , and a preface to Miss Julie , the last of which is probably the best-known statement of the principles of the theatrical movement . During the 1890s he spent significant time abroad engaged in scientific experiments and studies of the occult . A series of psychotic attacks between 1894 and 1896 ( referred to as his Inferno crisis ) led to his hospitalization and return to Sweden .",

Small but perfectly formed , The Dumb Waiter might be considered the best of Harold Pinter 's early plays , more consistent than The Birthday Party and sharper than The Caretaker . It combines the classic characteristics of early Pinter - a paucity of information and an atmosphere of menace , working-class small-talk in a claustrophobic setting - with an oblique but palpable political edge and , in so doing , can be seen as containing the germ of Pinter 's entire dramatic oeuvre .
