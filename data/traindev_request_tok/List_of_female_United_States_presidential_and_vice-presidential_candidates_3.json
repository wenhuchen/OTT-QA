Senator from Virginia Tim Kaine , despite losing the popular vote . Trump took office as the 45th president , and Pence as the 48th vice president , on January 20 , 2017 . Trump emerged as his party 's front-runner amidst a wide field of Republican primary candidates , while Clinton defeated Senator Bernie Sanders and became the first female presidential nominee of a major American party . Trump 's populist , nationalist campaign , which promised to Make America Great Again and opposed political correctness , illegal immigration , and many free-trade agreements , garnered extensive free media coverage . Clinton emphasized her extensive political experience , denounced Trump and many of his supporters as bigots , and advocated the expansion of President Obama 's policies ; racial , LGBT , and women 's rights ; and inclusive capitalism . The tone of the general election campaign was widely characterized as divisive and negative . Trump faced controversy over his views on race and immigration , incidents of violence against protestors at his rallies , and numerous sexual misconduct allegations including a controversial tape , while Clinton 's campaign was undermined by declining approval ratings due to concerns about her ethics and trustworthiness , and an FBI investigation of her improper use of a private email server , which received more media coverage than any other topic during the campaign . Clinton led in nearly every pre-election nationwide poll and in most swing state polls , leading some commentators to compare Trump 's victory to that of Harry S. Truman in 1948 as one of the greatest political upsets in modern U.S. history . While Clinton received 2.87 million more votes than Trump did ( the largest margin ever for a losing presidential candidate ) , Trump received the majority in the Electoral College and won upset victories in the pivotal Rust Belt region .

Nixon easily swept aside challenges from two Republican congressmen in the 1972 Republican primaries to win re-nomination . McGovern , who had played a significant role in reforming the Democratic nomination system after the 1968 election , mobilized the anti-war movement and other liberal supporters to win his party 's nomination . Among the candidates he defeated were early front-runner Edmund Muskie , 1968 nominee Hubert Humphrey , and Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm , the first African-American to run for a major party 's presidential nomination . Nixon emphasized the strong economy and his success in foreign affairs , while McGovern ran on a platform calling for an immediate end to the Vietnam War , and the institution of a guaranteed minimum income . Nixon maintained a large and consistent lead in polling . Separately , Nixon 's reelection committee broke into the Watergate complex to wiretap the Democratic National Committee 's headquarters , a scandal that would later be known as Watergate .

  "/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)": "The Republican Party , also referred to as the GOP ( Grand Old Party ) , is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States ; the other is its historic rival , the Democratic Party . The GOP was founded in 1854 by opponents of the Kansas-Nebraska Act , which allowed for the potential expansion of slavery into certain U.S. territories . The party supported classical liberalism , opposed the expansion of slavery , and supported economic reform . Abraham Lincoln was the first Republican president . Under the leadership of Lincoln and a Republican Congress , slavery was banned in the United States in 1865 . The Party was generally dominant during the Third Party System and the Fourth Party System . After 1912 , the Party underwent an ideological shift to the right . Following the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the party 's core base shifted , with Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics . The party 's 21st-century base of support includes people living in rural areas , men , people without college degrees , the elderly , white Americans , and evangelical Christians . The 21st-century Republican Party ideology is American conservatism , which incorporates both economic policies and social values . The GOP supports lower taxes , free market capitalism , restrictions on immigration , increased military spending , gun rights , restrictions on abortion , deregulation and restrictions on labor unions . After the Supreme Court 's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade , the Republican Party opposed abortion in its party platform and grew its support among evangelicals .",

Despite his loss of the 1964 presidential election in a landslide , Goldwater is the politician most often credited with having sparked the resurgence of the American conservative political movement in the 1960s . He also had a substantial impact on the libertarian movement . Goldwater rejected the legacy of the New Deal and fought with the conservative coalition against the New Deal coalition . Although he had supported earlier civil rights legislation , he notably opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as he believed it to be an overreach by the federal government . In 1964 , Goldwater mobilized a large conservative constituency to win the hard-fought Republican presidential primaries . Although raised as an Episcopalian , Goldwater was the first candidate of ethnically Jewish heritage to be nominated for President by a major American party ( his father was Jewish ) . Goldwater 's platform ultimately failed to gain the support of the electorate and he lost the 1964 presidential election to incumbent Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson . Goldwater returned to the Senate in 1969 and specialized in defense and foreign policy . As an elder statesman of the party , Goldwater successfully urged President Richard Nixon to resign in 1974 when evidence of a cover-up in the Watergate scandal became overwhelming and impeachment was imminent . Goldwater 's views grew more libertarian as he reached the end of his career ; he retired from the Senate in 1987 . A significant accomplishment of his career was the passage of the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 .",
