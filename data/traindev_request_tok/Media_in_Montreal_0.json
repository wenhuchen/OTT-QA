  "/wiki/Terrestrial_television": "Terrestrial television is a type of television broadcasting in which the television signal is transmitted by radio waves from the terrestrial ( Earth-based ) transmitter of a television station to a TV receiver having an antenna . The term terrestrial is more common in Europe and Latin America , while in the United States it is called broadcast or over-the-air television ( OTA ) . The term terrestrial is used to distinguish this type from the newer technologies of satellite television ( direct broadcast satellite or DBS television ) , in which the television signal is transmitted to the receiver from an overhead satellite , cable television , in which the signal is carried to the receiver through a cable , and Internet Protocol television , in which the signal is received over an Internet stream or on a network utilizing the Internet Protocol . Terrestrial television stations broadcast on television channels with frequencies between about 52 and 600 MHz in the VHF and UHF bands . Since radio waves in these bands travel by line of sight , reception is limited by the visual horizon to distances of 40-60 miles ( 64-97 km ) . Terrestrial television was the first technology used for television broadcasting . The BBC began broadcasting in 1929 and by 1930 many radio stations had a regular schedule of experimental television programmes . However , these early experimental systems had insufficient picture quality to attract the public , due to their mechanical scan technology , and television did not become widespread until after World War II with the advent of electronic scan television technology . The television broadcasting business followed the model of radio networks , with local television stations in cities and towns affiliated with television networks , either commercial ( in the US ) or government-controlled ( in Europe ) , which provided content . Television broadcasts were in black and white until the transition to color television in the 1950s and 60s . There was no other method of television delivery until the 1950s with the beginnings of cable television and community antenna television ( CATV ) . CATV was , initially , only a re-broadcast of over-the-air signals .",
  "/wiki/Virtual_channel": "In most telecommunications organizations , a virtual channel is a method of remapping the program number as used in H.222 Program Association Tables and Program Mapping Tables to a channel number that can be entered via digits on a receiver 's remote control . Often , virtual channels are implemented in digital television , helping users to find a desired channel easily , or easing the transition from analogue to digital broadcasting in general . The practice of assigning virtual channels is most common in those parts of the world where TV stations were coloquially named after the RF channel they were transmitting on ( channel 6 Springfield ) , as it was common in North America during the analogue TV era . In other parts of the world , such as Europe , virtual channels are rarely used or needed , as TV stations there identify themselves by name , not by RF channel or callsign . A virtual channel was first used for DigiCipher 2 in North America and then later used and referred to as a logical channel number ( LCN ) for private European Digital Video Broadcasting extensions widely used by the NDS Group and NorDig in other markets . Pay television operators were the first to use either of these systems as a method of channel reassignment or rearrangement that suited their need to group multiple channels by their content or origin as well as to a lesser extent to localize advertising to a particular market . Free-to-air ATSC uses the DigiCipher 2 method to maintain the same television frequency channel allocation that the NTSC channel was using when both were simulcasting so the same number could bring up either service . Free-to-air DVB network operators such as DTV Services Ltd. ( d.b.a . Freeview ) and Freeview New Zealand Ltd. use the NorDig method and follow the same practice as pay TV operators . The exception is Freeview Australia Ltd. , which also use the NorDig method and partially follow the ATSC practice of using the same VHF radio frequency channel allocation that the PAL channel is simulcasting on from the metropolitan station 's main transmission point ( i2 , 7 , 9 and 10 ) with the major and minor format emulated by multiplying by ten .",
  "/wiki/Program_and_System_Information_Protocol": "The Program and System Information Protocol ( PSIP ) is the MPEG ( a video and audio industry group ) and privately defined program-specific information originally defined by General Instrument for the DigiCipher 2 system and later extended for the ATSC digital television system for carrying metadata about each channel in the broadcast MPEG transport stream of a television station and for publishing information about television programs so that viewers can select what to watch by title and description . Its FM radio equivalent is Radio Data System ( RDS ) .",

  "/wiki/Ultra_high_frequency": "Ultra high frequency ( UHF ) is the ITU designation for radio frequencies in the range between 300 megahertz ( MHz ) and 3 gigahertz ( GHz ) , also known as the decimetre band as the wavelengths range from one meter to one tenth of a meter ( one decimeter ) . Radio waves with frequencies above the UHF band fall into the super-high frequency ( SHF ) or microwave frequency range . Lower frequency signals fall into the VHF ( very high frequency ) or lower bands . UHF radio waves propagate mainly by line of sight ; they are blocked by hills and large buildings although the transmission through building walls is strong enough for indoor reception . They are used for television broadcasting , cell phones , satellite communication including GPS , personal radio services including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth , walkie-talkies , cordless phones , and numerous other applications . The IEEE defines the UHF radar band as frequencies between 300 MHz and 1 GHz . Two other IEEE radar bands overlap the ITU UHF band : the L band between 1 and 2 GHz and the S band between 2 and 4 GHz .",

Air traffic control communications and air navigation systems ( e.g . VOR & ILS ) work at distances of 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) or more to aircraft at cruising altitude . In the Americas and many other parts of the world , VHF Band I was used for the transmission of analog television .

CHUM Limited was acquired by CTVglobemedia ( now Bell Media ) in 2007 ; to comply with Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) ownership limits , the Citytv stations were sold to Rogers . The network grew through further affiliations with three Jim Pattison Group-owned stations , along with Rogers ' acquisition of the cable-only Saskatchewan Communications Network and Montreal 's CJNT-DT . While patterned after the original station in Toronto , since the 2000s , and particularly since its acquisition by Rogers , Citytv has moved towards a series-based primetime schedule much like its competitors , albeit one still focused on younger demographics ."
