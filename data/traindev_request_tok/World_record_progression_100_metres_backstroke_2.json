In addition , it included two autonomous provinces within Serbia : Kosovo and Vojvodina . The SFRY 's origin is traced to 26 November 1942 , when the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia was formed during World War II . On 29 November 1945 , the Federal People 's Republic of Yugoslavia was proclaimed after the deposition of King Peter II , thus ending the monarchy . Until 1948 , the new communist government originally sided with the Eastern Bloc under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito at the beginning of the Cold War , but after the Tito-Stalin split of 1948 , Yugoslavia pursued a policy of neutrality . It became one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement , and transitioned from a command economy to market-based socialism . The SFRY maintained neutrality during the Cold War as part of its foreign policy . It was a founding member of CERN , the United Nations , Non-Aligned Movement , OSCE , IFAD , WTO , Eutelsat , and BTWC . Following the death of Tito on 4 May 1980 , the Yugoslav economy started to collapse , which increased unemployment and inflation . The economic crisis led to a rise in ethnic nationalism in the late 1980s and early 1990s ; dissidence resulted among the multiple ethnicities within the constituent republics .",

It was later proven that the East German team doctors had systematically administered steroids to their athletes ( albeit without the athletes ' knowledge ) . As she had exhibited symptoms of steroid use in 1976 ( deep voice , overdeveloped body ) , strong suspicion was cast on the validity of Ender 's accomplishments . Ender trained from a young age and won her first Olympic medals as a 13-year-old at the 1972 Olympics in Munich : three silver medals , including one in the 200 m individual medley , finishing behind Australia 's Shane Gould . Over the following years she broke 32 world records in individual events , including the four at the Montreal Games . In 1991 , she addressed the long-held suspicions about her physical condition at the 1976 Games , acknowledging that team doctors and coaches had given her numerous injections of drugs over the preceding months ( cf . doping in East Germany ) . Ender said that she did not know at the time , nor had she ever subsequently found out , exactly what the drugs were . She said she was told only that the drugs would help her regenerate and recuperate and therefore , although she was surprised by the muscle mass she added , she nonetheless attributed it simply to her rigorous training . When she became suspicious and refused to take chlorodehydromethyltestosterone in 1977 she was banned from the team by the Marxist authorities .
