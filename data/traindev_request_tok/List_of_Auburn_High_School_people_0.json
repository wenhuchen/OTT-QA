  "/wiki/Jazz": "Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans , United States . It originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , and developed from roots in blues and ragtime . Jazz is seen by many as America 's classical music . Since the 1920s Jazz Age , jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression . It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles , all linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage with a performance orientation . Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes , call and response vocals , polyrhythms and improvisation . Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression , and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime , as well as European military band music . Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as one of America 's original art forms . As jazz spread around the world , it drew on national , regional , and local musical cultures , which gave rise to different styles . New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s , combining earlier brass-band marches , French quadrilles , biguine , ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation . In the 1930s , heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands , Kansas City jazz , a hard-swinging , bluesy , improvisational style and Gypsy jazz ( a style that emphasized musette waltzes ) were the prominent styles . Bebop emerged in the 1940s , shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging musician 's music which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation .",
  "/wiki/Trombonist": "The trombone is a musical instrument in the brass family . As on all brass instruments , sound is produced when the player 's vibrating lips ( embouchure ) cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate . Nearly all trombones have a telescoping slide mechanism that varies the length of the instrument to change the pitch . Many modern trombone models also use a valve attachment to lower the pitch of the instrument . Variants such as the valve trombone and superbone have three valves similar to those on the trumpet . The word trombone derives from Italian tromba ( trumpet ) and -one ( a suffix meaning large ) , so the name means large trumpet . The trombone has a predominantly cylindrical bore like its valved counterpart , the baritone , in contrast to its conical valved counterparts : the cornet , the euphonium , and the French horn . The most frequently encountered trombones are the tenor trombone and bass trombone . The most common variant , the tenor , is a non-transposing instrument pitched in B\u266d , an octave below the B\u266d trumpet and an octave above the pedal B\u266d tuba . The once common E\u266d alto trombone became less widely used as improvements in technique extended the upper range of the tenor , but it is now resurging due to its lighter sonority which is appreciated in many classical and early romantic works . Trombone music is usually written in concert pitch in either bass or tenor clef , although exceptions do occur , notably in British brass-band music where the tenor trombone is presented as a B\u266d transposing instrument , written in treble clef . A person who plays the trombone is called a trombonist or trombone player .",

  "/wiki/Sakura_Haruno": "Sakura Haruno ( Japanese : \u6625\u91ce \u30b5\u30af\u30e9 , Hepburn : Haruno Sakura ) is a fictional character in the Naruto manga and anime series created by Masashi Kishimoto . Sakura is depicted as a kunoichi affiliated with Konohagakure ( \u6728\u30ce\u8449\u96a0\u308c\u306e\u91cc , English version : Hidden Leaf Village ) and a part of Team 7 , which consists of herself , Naruto Uzumaki , Sasuke Uchiha , and their sensei Kakashi Hatake . Sakura initially has an infatuation for Sasuke , praising him at every juncture , and heaps scorn upon the less-skilled teammate Naruto . Over the course of the series , she begins to shed this singularly driven persona and grows more appreciative and accepting of Naruto . Besides the main series , Sakura has appeared in several pieces of the Naruto media , most notably the spin-off Naruto : The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring ( 2015 ) and the sequel Boruto : Naruto Next Generations ( 2016 ) where she is portrayed as a doctor named Sakura Uchiha ( Japanese : \u3046\u3061\u306f \u30b5\u30af\u30e9 , Hepburn : Uchiha Sakura ) . Sakura has become the series ' female lead , although she was not immediately intended for the role . Kishimoto has had difficulty drawing her character , resulting in Kishimoto inadvertently emphasizing certain parts of her appearance , including her large forehead . In order to make the character more appealing in the second part of the series , Kishimoto designed her costume in a way that makes her look more like a martial artist as well as more beautiful during later chapters . Chie Nakamura voices the character in the animated adaptations of the series , while Kate Higgins plays her in the English dub . Numerous anime and manga publications have praised and criticized Sakura 's character . She was initially noted to be a stereotypical sh\u014dnen character , representing a love interest for the protagonist , and was said to serve little purpose at the beginning of the series beyond being comic relief . Her emergence from this stereotype as the series progressed has been celebrated by many reviewers .",
