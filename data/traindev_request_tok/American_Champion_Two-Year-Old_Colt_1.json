Werblin was born in Brooklyn , New York . A graduate of Rutgers University , he went to work for Music Corporation of America ( MCA ) in 1932 and was so successful that in 1951 he was made president of MCA 's television division . At MCA , Werblin made a considerable name at identifying and managing talent . His managed list of major stars were a who's-who in not only music , but also movies and television . During the 1950s and 1960s , Werblin led a production team that developed television shows for all three major networks , an offshoot of his ability to manage the stars that were featured in them . The list of top-rated television shows MCA developed under Werblin , again , is lengthy . His power as a star-handler was such that eventually forces in the entertainment industry combined against him and MCA , resulting in lawsuits in 1962 . The company 's ability to manage stars would be curtailed greatly under new industry rules after that point . Up to then , he had been known in management circles as Mr. Show Biz , his power in the industry having been so great . Werblin left MCA and found a new business vehicle soon after : the American Football League , which he revolutionized . His impact on professional sports is still well-felt today .",
