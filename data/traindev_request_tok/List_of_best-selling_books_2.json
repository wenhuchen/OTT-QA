Born into an upper-middle-class household , Potter was educated by governesses and grew up isolated from other children . She had numerous pets and spent holidays in Scotland and the Lake District , developing a love of landscape , flora , and fauna , all of which she closely observed and painted . Potters study and watercolours of fungi led to her being widely respected in the field of mycology . In her thirties , Potter self-published the highly successful children 's book The Tale of Peter Rabbit . Following this , Potter began writing and illustrating children 's books full-time . In all , Potter wrote thirty books ; the best known being her twenty-three children 's tales . With the proceeds from the books and a legacy from an aunt , in 1905 Potter bought Hill Top Farm in Near Sawrey , a village in the Lake District which at that time was in Lancashire . Over the following decades , she purchased additional farms to preserve the unique hill country landscape . In 1913 , at the age of 47 , she married William Heelis , a respected local solicitor from Hawkshead . Potter was also a prize-winning breeder of Herdwick sheep and a prosperous farmer keenly interested in land preservation .

He received multiple nominations for the Nobel Prize in Literature every year from 1902 to 1906 , and nominations for Nobel Peace Prize in 1901 , 1902 and 1910 , and the fact that he never won is a major Nobel prize controversy . Born to an aristocratic Russian family in 1828 , he is best known for the novels War and Peace ( 1869 ) and Anna Karenina ( 1877 ) , often cited as pinnacles of realist fiction . He first achieved literary acclaim in his twenties with his semi-autobiographical trilogy , Childhood , Boyhood , and Youth ( 1852-1856 ) , and Sevastopol Sketches ( 1855 ) , based upon his experiences in the Crimean War . Tolstoy 's fiction includes dozens of short stories and several novellas such as The Death of Ivan Ilyich ( 1886 ) , Family Happiness ( 1859 ) , and Hadji Murad ( 1912 ) . He also wrote plays and numerous philosophical essays . In the 1870s Tolstoy experienced a profound moral crisis , followed by what he regarded as an equally profound spiritual awakening , as outlined in his non-fiction work A Confession ( 1882 ) . His literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus , centering on the Sermon on the Mount , caused him to become a fervent Christian anarchist and pacifist . Tolstoy 's ideas on nonviolent resistance , expressed in such works as The Kingdom of God Is Within You ( 1894 ) , were to have a profound impact on such pivotal 20th-century figures as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. Tolstoy also became a dedicated advocate of Georgism , the economic philosophy of Henry George , which he incorporated into his writing , particularly Resurrection ( 1899 ) .",

One of the most discussed Jewish victims of the Holocaust , she gained fame posthumously with the publication of The Diary of a Young Girl ( originally Het Achterhuis in Dutch ; English : The Secret Annex ) , in which she documents her life in hiding from 1942 to 1944 , during the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II . It is one of the world 's best known books and has been the basis for several plays and films . Born in Frankfurt , Germany , she lived most of her life in or near Amsterdam , Netherlands , having moved there with her family at the age of four and a half when the Nazis gained control over Germany . Born a German national , she lost her citizenship in 1941 and thus became stateless . By May 1940 , the Franks were trapped in Amsterdam by the German occupation of the Netherlands . As persecutions of the Jewish population increased in July 1942 , the Franks went into hiding in some concealed rooms behind a bookcase in the building where Anne 's father , Otto Frank , worked . From then until the family 's arrest by the Gestapo in August 1944 , she kept a diary she had received as a birthday present , and wrote in it regularly . Following their arrest , the Franks were transported to concentration camps . In October or November 1944 , Anne and her sister , Margot , were transferred from Auschwitz to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp , where they died ( probably of typhus ) a few months later . They were originally estimated by the Red Cross to have died in March , with Dutch authorities setting 31 March as their official date of death , but research by the Anne Frank House in 2015 suggests it is more likely that they died in February . Otto , the only survivor of the Franks , returned to Amsterdam after the war to find that her diary had been saved by his secretary , Miep Gies , and his efforts led to its publication in 1947 .",
