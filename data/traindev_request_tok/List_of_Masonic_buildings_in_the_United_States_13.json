  "/wiki/Aurora,_Illinois": "Aurora , a suburb of Chicago , is a city in DuPage , Kane , Kendall , and Will counties in the U.S. state of Illinois . Located primarily in DuPage and Kane counties , it is an outer suburb of Chicago and the second most populous city in the state , and the 115th most populous city in the country . The population was 197,899 at the 2010 census , and was estimated to have increased to 199,602 by 2018 . Once a mid-sized manufacturing city , Aurora has grown since the 1960s . Founded within Kane County , Aurora 's city limits and population have expanded into DuPage , Will , and Kendall counties . Between 2000 and 2003 , the U.S. Census Bureau ranked Aurora as the 34th fastest-growing city in the United States . From 2000 to 2009 , the U.S. Census Bureau ranked the city as the 46th fastest growing city with a population of over 100,000 . In 1908 , Aurora adopted the nickname City of Lights , because in 1881 it was one of the first cities in the United States to implement an all-electric street lighting system . Aurora 's historic downtown is located on the Fox River , and centered on Stolp Island . The city is divided into three regions , the West Side , on the west side of the Fox River , the East Side , between the eastern bank of the Fox River and the Kane/DuPage County line , and the Far East Side/Fox Valley , which is from the County Line to the city 's eastern border with Naperville . The Aurora area has some significant architecture , including structures by Frank Lloyd Wright , Ludwig Mies van der Rohe , Bruce Goff and George Grant Elmslie .

  "/wiki/Masonic_Temple_(Chicago,_Illinois)": "The Masonic Temple Building was a skyscraper built in Chicago , Illinois in 1892 , and from 1895 to the 1920s the tallest building in Chicago . Designed by the firm of Burnham and Root and built at the corner of Randolph and State Streets , the building rose 21 stories . When the clock tower was removed from the 1885 Board of Trade Building in 1895 , the Masonic Temple became the tallest in the city . The building featured a central court ringed by nine floors of shops with offices above and meeting rooms for the Masons at the very top . These meeting rooms also served as theaters , which contributed to the building 's obsolescence ; its elevators proved inadequate for these crowds , and the building rapidly fell from favor with commercial tenants . Chicago 's building height regulations enacted in 1892 ( the year the Temple was built ) , did n't allow taller buildings , until that was amended in the 1920s . In 1939 the Masonic Temple was demolished , in part due to its poor internal services , but also due to the construction of the new State Street subway , which would have necessitated expensive foundation retrofitting . A two-story taxpayer housing a Walgreens drug store was erected in its place , and the Joffrey Tower currently stands on the former site of this building . Both the building 's primary designer , John Wellborn Root , and the Masons ' primary representative , Norman Gassette , died of natural causes during its construction .",

With an estimated population of 2,705,994 ( 2018 ) , it is also the most populous city in the Midwestern United States . Chicago is the county seat of Cook County , the second-most-populous county in the US , with a small portion of the northwest side of the city extending into DuPage County near O'Hare Airport . Chicago is the principal city of the Chicago metropolitan area , often referred to as Chicagoland . At nearly 10 million people , the metropolitan area is the third most populous in the United States . Located on the shores of freshwater Lake Michigan , Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837 near a portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed and grew rapidly in the mid-19th century . After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 , which destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless , the city made a concerted effort to rebuild . The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades , and by 1900 , less than 30 years after the great fire , Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world . Chicago made noted contributions to urban planning and zoning standards , including new construction styles ( including the Chicago School of architecture ) , the development of the City Beautiful Movement , and the steel-framed skyscraper . Chicago is an international hub for finance , culture , commerce , industry , education , technology , telecommunications , and transportation . It is the site of the creation of the first standardized futures contracts , issued by the Chicago Board of Trade , which today is the largest and most diverse derivatives market in the world , generating 20% of all volume in commodities and financial futures alone . Depending on the particular year , the city 's O'Hare International Airport is routinely ranked as the world 's fifth or sixth busiest airport according to tracked data by the Airports Council International .",
  "/wiki/Skyscraper": "A skyscraper is a continuously habitable high-rise building that has over 40 floors and is taller than approximately 150 m ( 492 ft ) . Historically , the term first referred to buildings with 10 to 20 floors in the 1880s . The definition shifted with advancing construction technology during the 20th century . Skyscrapers may host offices , residential spaces , and retail spaces . For buildings above a height of 300 m ( 984 ft ) , the term supertall skyscrapers can be used , while skyscrapers reaching beyond 600 m ( 1,969 ft ) are classified as megatall skyscrapers . One common feature of skyscrapers is having a steel framework that supports curtain walls . These curtain walls either bear on the framework below or are suspended from the framework above , rather than resting on load-bearing walls of conventional construction . Some early skyscrapers have a steel frame that enables the construction of load-bearing walls taller than of those made of reinforced concrete . Modern skyscrapers ' walls are not load-bearing , and most skyscrapers are characterised by large surface areas of windows made possible by steel frames and curtain walls . However , skyscrapers can have curtain walls that mimic conventional walls with a small surface area of windows . Modern skyscrapers often have a tubular structure , and are designed to act like a hollow cylinder to resist wind , seismic , and other lateral loads . To appear more slender , allow less wind exposure and transmit more daylight to the ground , many skyscrapers have a design with setbacks , which in some cases is also structurally required .",
  "/wiki/Burnham_and_Root": "Burnham and Root was one of Chicago 's most famous architectural companies of the nineteenth century . It was established by John Wellborn Root and Daniel Hudson Burnham . During their eighteen years of partnership , Burnham and Root designed and built residential and commercial buildings . Their success was crowned with the coordination of the World 's Columbian Exposition ( World 's Fair ) in 1893 . The two men met when they worked as apprentice draftsmen in the offices of Drake , Carter , and Wight in 1872 . A year later they established their own architecture office and began work by building private residences for the wealthy elite of Chicago 's meat industry . Both of them married into wealthy families which allowed them to establish a basis for their business . Daniel Hudson Burnham was one of the handsomest men I ever saw , said Paul Starrett who joined Burnham and Root in 1888 ( later he designed the Empire State Building ) . It was easy to see how he got commissions . His very bearing and looks were half the battle . While Burnham was the pragmatic designer and impressive salesperson , Root became the creative genius of the company . When Burnham and Root were together , one woman said I used always to think of some big strong tree with lightning playing around it .",

  "/wiki/Late_Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",
  "/wiki/Art_Deco": "Art Deco , sometimes referred to as Deco , is a style of visual arts , architecture and design that first appeared in France just before World War I . Art Deco influenced the design of buildings , furniture , jewelry , fashion , cars , movie theatres , trains , ocean liners , and everyday objects such as radios and vacuum cleaners . It took its name , short for Arts D\u00e9coratifs , from the Exposition internationale des arts d\u00e9coratifs et industriels modernes ( International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts ) held in Paris in 1925 . It combined modern styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials . During its heyday , Art Deco represented luxury , glamour , exuberance , and faith in social and technological progress . Art Deco was a pastiche of many different styles , sometimes contradictory , united by a desire to be modern . From its outset , Art Deco was influenced by the bold geometric forms of Cubism and the Vienna Secession ; the bright colors of Fauvism and of the Ballets Russes ; the updated craftsmanship of the furniture of the eras of Louis Philippe I and Louis XVI ; and the exotic styles of China and Japan , India , Persia , ancient Egypt and Maya art . It featured rare and expensive materials , such as ebony and ivory , and exquisite craftsmanship . The Chrysler Building and other skyscrapers of New York built during the 1920s and 1930s are monuments of the Art Deco style . In the 1930s , during the Great Depression , Art Deco became more subdued . New materials arrived , including chrome plating , stainless steel , and plastic . A sleeker form of the style , called Streamline Moderne , appeared in the 1930s ; it featured curving forms and smooth , polished surfaces .",

Horizontal lines were thought to evoke and relate to the wide , flat , treeless expanses of America 's native prairie landscape . The Prairie School was an attempt at developing an indigenous North American style of architecture in symphony with the ideals and design aesthetics of the Arts and Crafts Movement , with which it shared an embrace of handcrafting and craftsman guilds as an antidote to the dehumanizing effects of mass production . The term Prairie School was not actually used by practitioners of the style . Architect Marion Mahony , for example , preferred the phrase The Chicago Group . Its term was coined by H.
