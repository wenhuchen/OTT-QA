  "/wiki/Battle_of_the_Atlantic": "The Battle of the Atlantic was the longest continuous military campaign in World War II , running from 1939 to the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 , and was a major part of the Naval history of World War II . At its core was the Allied naval blockade of Germany , announced the day after the declaration of war , and Germany 's subsequent counter-blockade . It was at its height from mid-1940 through to the end of 1943 . The Battle of the Atlantic pitted U-boats and other warships of the Kriegsmarine ( Navy ) and aircraft of the Luftwaffe ( Air Force ) against the Royal Canadian Navy , Royal Navy , United States Navy , and Allied merchant shipping . Convoys , coming mainly from North America and predominantly going to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union , were protected for the most part by the British and Canadian navies and air forces . These forces were aided by ships and aircraft of the United States beginning September 13 , 1941 . The Germans were joined by submarines of the Italian Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) after their Axis ally Italy entered the war on June 10 , 1940 . As an island nation , the United Kingdom was highly dependent on imported goods . Britain required more than a million tons of imported material per week in order to be able to survive and fight . In essence , the Battle of the Atlantic was a tonnage war : the Allied struggle to supply Britain and the Axis attempt to stem the flow of merchant shipping that enabled Britain to keep fighting . From 1942 onward , the Axis also sought to prevent the build-up of Allied supplies and equipment in the British Isles in preparation for the invasion of occupied Europe . The defeat of the U-boat threat was a prerequisite for pushing back the Axis .",

  "/wiki/B-17_bomber": "The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress is a four-engined heavy bomber developed in the 1930s for the United States Army Air Corps ( USAAC ) . Competing against Douglas and Martin for a contract to build 200 bombers , the Boeing entry ( prototype Model 299/XB-17 ) outperformed both competitors and exceeded the air corps ' performance specifications . Although Boeing lost the contract ( to the Douglas B-18 Bolo ) because the prototype crashed , the air corps ordered 13 more B-17s for further evaluation . From its introduction in 1938 , the B-17 Flying Fortress evolved through numerous design advances , becoming the third-most produced bomber of all time , behind the four-engined B-24 and the multirole , twin-engined Ju 88 . The B-17 was primarily employed by the USAAF in the daylight strategic bombing campaign of World War II against German industrial and military targets . The United States Eighth Air Force , based at many airfields in central , eastern and southern England , and the Fifteenth Air Force , based in Italy , complemented the RAF Bomber Command 's nighttime area bombing in the Combined Bomber Offensive to help secure air superiority over the cities , factories and battlefields of Western Europe in preparation for the invasion of France in 1944 . The B-17 also participated to a lesser extent in the War in the Pacific , early in World War II , where it conducted raids against Japanese shipping and airfields . From its prewar inception , the USAAC ( by June 1941 , the USAAF ) promoted the aircraft as a strategic weapon ; it was a relatively fast , high-flying , long-range bomber with heavy defensive armament at the expense of bombload . It developed a reputation for toughness based upon stories and photos of badly damaged B-17s safely returning to base . The B-17 dropped more bombs than any other U.S. aircraft in World War II . Of approximately 1.5 million tons of bombs dropped on Nazi Germany and its occupied territories by U.S. aircraft , over 640,000 tons were dropped from B-17s .

The Japanese launched the invasion by sea from Formosa over 200 miles ( 320 km ) to the north of the Philippines . The defending forces outnumbered the Japanese by 3 to 2 , however they were a mixed force of non-combat experienced regular , national guard , constabulary and newly created Commonwealth units . The Japanese used first-line troops at the outset of the campaign , and concentrating their forces enabled a swift overrun of most of Luzon during the first month . The Japanese high command , believing they had won the campaign , made a strategic decision to advance by a month their timetable of operations in Borneo and Indonesia , withdrawing their best division and the bulk of their airpower in early January 1942 . This , coupled with the decision of the defenders to withdraw into a defensive holding position in the Bataan Peninsula , enabled the Americans and Filipinos to successfully hold out for four more months .

Despite a lack of supplies , American and Filipino forces managed to fight the Japanese for three months , engaging them initially in a fighting retreat southward . As the combined American and Filipino forces made a last stand , the delay cost the Japanese valuable time and prevented immediate victory across the Pacific . The American surrender at Bataan to the Japanese , with 76,000 soldiers surrendering in the Philippines altogether , was the largest in American and Filipino military histories , and was the largest United States surrender since the American Civil War 's Battle of Harper 's Ferry .

Although a plot employing fictitious landmarks and localities , many of the incidental shots were taken at actual fires caused by the air raids on London in the previous two years .

The German offensive to capture Stalingrad began in August 1942 , using the 6th Army and elements of the 4th Panzer Army . The attack was supported by intense Luftwaffe bombing that reduced much of the city to rubble . The fighting degenerated into house-to-house fighting ; both sides poured reinforcements into the city . By mid-November 1942 , the Germans had pushed the Soviet defenders back at great cost into narrow zones along the west bank of the Volga River . On 19 November 1942 , the Red Army launched Operation Uranus , a two-pronged attack targeting the weaker Romanian and Hungarian armies protecting the German 6th Army 's flanks . The Axis forces on the flanks were overrun and the 6th Army was cut off and surrounded in the Stalingrad area . Adolf Hitler ordered that the army stay in Stalingrad and make no attempt to break out ; instead , attempts were made to supply the army by air and to break the encirclement from the outside . Heavy fighting continued for another two months . By the beginning of February 1943 , the Axis forces in Stalingrad had exhausted their ammunition and food .",

  "/wiki/Chetniks": "The Chetnik Detachments of the Yugoslav Army , commonly known as the Chetniks ( Serbo-Croatian : \u0427\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0438 / \u010cetnici , pronounced [ t\u0283\u025b\u0302tni\u02d0tsi ] ; Slovene : \u010cetniki ) , also the Yugoslav Army in the Homeland and The Ravna Gora Movement , was a Yugoslav Royalist and Serbian nationalist movement in occupied Yugoslavia led by Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 , which was anti-Axis in its long-term goals , and engaged in marginal resistance activities for limited periods . They also engaged in tactical or selective collaboration with the occupying forces for almost all of the war . The Mihailovi\u0107 Chetniks were not a homogeneous movement . The Chetnik movement adopted a policy of collaboration with regard to the Axis , and engaged in cooperation to one degree or another by establishing modus vivendi or operating as legalised auxiliary forces under Axis control . Over a period of time , and in different parts of the country , the Chetnik movement was progressively drawn into collaboration agreements : first with the puppet Government of National Salvation in the German-occupied territory of Serbia , then with the Italians in occupied Dalmatia and Montenegro , with some of the Usta\u0161e forces in northern Bosnia , and , after the Italian capitulation , with the Germans directly . The Chetniks were active in uprising against the German occupiers throughout 1941 . Following the success of the Battle of Loznica , Mihailovi\u0107 's Chetniks were the first to liberate a European city from Axis control . Following this , German occupiers enacted Adolf Hitler 's formula for suppressing anti-Nazi resistance in Eastern Europe , a ratio of 100 hostages executed for every German soldier killed and 50 hostages executed for every soldier wounded . In October 1941 , German soldiers conducted two mass murder campaigns against Serbian civilians in Kraljevo and Kragujevac , with a combined death toll reaching over 4,500 civilians , convincing Chetnik leader Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 that killing German troops would only result in further unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of Serbs . As a result , he decided to scale back Chetnik guerrilla attacks and wait for an Allied landing in the Balkans . While Chetnik collaboration reached extensive and systematic proportions , the Chetniks themselves referred to their policy of collaboration as using the enemy . Sabrina Ramet , a political scientist , has observed , Both the Chetniks ' political program and the extent of their collaboration have been amply , even voluminously , documented ; it is more than a bit disappointing , thus , that people can still be found who believe that the Chetniks were doing anything besides attempting to realize a vision of an ethnically homogeneous Greater Serbian state , which they intended to advance , in the short run , by a policy of collaboration with the Axis forces .",

A staunch royalist , he retreated to the mountains near Belgrade when the Germans overran Yugoslavia in April 1941 and there he organized bands of guerrillas known as the Chetnik Detachments of the Yugoslav Army . The organisation is commonly known as the Chetniks , although the name of the organisation was later changed to the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland ( JVUO , \u0408\u0412\u0423\u041e ) . Founded as the first Yugoslav resistance movement , it was royalist and nationalist , as opposed to the other , Josip Broz Tito 's Partisans who were communist . Initially , the two groups operated in parallel , but by late 1941 began fighting each other in the attempt to gain control of post-war Yugoslavia . Many Chetnik groups collaborated or established modus vivendi with the Axis powers . Mihailovi\u0107 himself collaborated with Milan Nedi\u0107 and Dimitrije Ljoti\u0107 at the end of the war . After the war , Mihailovi\u0107 was captured by the communists . He was tried and convicted of high treason and war crimes by the communist authorities of the Federal People 's Republic of Yugoslavia , and executed by firing squad in Belgrade . The nature and extent of his responsibility for collaboration and ethnic massacres remains controversial . On 14 May 2015 , Mihailovi\u0107 's verdict was overturned on appeal with the ruling showing that his trial amounted to a communist kangaroo court . The Supreme Court of Cassation , and appellate court handed out the rulings .",

  "/wiki/Corvette": "A corvette is a small warship . It is traditionally the smallest class of vessel considered to be a proper ( or rated ) warship . The warship class above the corvette is that of the frigate , while the class below was historically that of the sloop-of-war . The modern types of ship below a corvette are coastal patrol craft , missile boat and fast attack craft . In modern terms , a corvette is typically between 500 tons and 2,000 tons , although recent designs may approach 3,000 tons , which might instead be considered a small frigate . The word corvette is first found in Middle French , a diminutive of the Dutch word corf , meaning a small ship , from the Latin corbis , meaning basket . The rank corvette captain , equivalent in many navies to lieutenant commander , derives from the name of this type of ship . The rank is the most junior of three captain ranks in several European ( e.g. , France , Spain , Italy , Croatia ) and South American ( e.g. , Argentina , Chile ) navies , because a corvette , as the smallest class of rated warship , was traditionally the smallest class of vessel entitled to a commander of a captain rank ."
