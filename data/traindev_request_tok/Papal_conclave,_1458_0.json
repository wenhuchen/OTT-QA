  "/wiki/Cardinal-nephew": "A cardinal-nephew ( Latin : cardinalis nepos ; Italian : cardinale nipote ; Spanish : valido de su t\u00edo ; French : prince de fortune ) was a cardinal elevated by a pope who was that cardinal 's relative . The practice of creating cardinal-nephews originated in the Middle Ages , and reached its apex during the 16th and 17th centuries . The last cardinal-nephew was named in 1689 and the practice was extinguished in 1692 . The word nepotism originally referred specifically to this practice , when it appeared in the English language about 1669 . From the middle of the Avignon Papacy ( 1309-1377 ) until Pope Innocent XII 's anti-nepotism bull ( a papal charter ) , Romanum decet pontificem ( 1692 ) , a pope without a cardinal-nephew was the exception to the rule . Every Renaissance pope who created cardinals appointed a relative to the College of Cardinals , and the nephew was the most common choice , although one of Alexander VI 's creations was his own son . The institution of the cardinal-nephew evolved over seven centuries , tracking developments in the history of the papacy and the styles of individual Popes . From 1566 until 1692 , a cardinal-nephew held the curial office of the Superintendent of the Ecclesiastical State , known as the Cardinal Nephew , and thus the terms are sometimes used interchangeably . The curial office of the Cardinal Nephew as well as the institution of the cardinal-nephew declined as the power of the Cardinal Secretary of State increased and the temporal power of popes decreased in the 17th and 18th centuries . The list of cardinal-nephews includes at least fifteen , and possibly as many as nineteen popes ( Gregory IX , Alexander IV , Adrian V , Gregory XI , Boniface IX , Innocent VII , Eugene IV , Paul II , Alexander VI , Pius III , Julius II , Leo X , Clement VII , Benedict XIII , and Pius VII ; perhaps also John XIX and Benedict IX , if they were really promoted cardinals ; as well as Innocent III and Benedict XII , if in fact they were related to their elevators ) ; one antipope ( John XXIII ) ; and two or three saints ( Charles Borromeo , Guarinus of Palestrina , and perhaps Anselm of Lucca , if he was really a cardinal ) .",

James was taken captive after the battle , but he escaped and , together with his brother John and his sister Beatrice , took refuge in Burgundy , under the protection of his aunt , Isabella of Portugal ( the consort of Duke Philip III the Good ) . James of Portugal studied in Flanders and , on March 23 , 1453 , was appointed Bishop of Arras . On his aunts advice , he traveled to Rome , where Pope Nicholas V , hearing of the disgraces inflicted upon his family after Alfarrobeira , resolved to appoint the young James as the new Archbishop of Lisbon , which had been recently vacated by the death of D. Lu\u00eds Coutinho . However , not being old enough to be consecrated to the dignity , James was only appointed administrator in perpetuity of the Archdiocese on April 30 , 1453 . Given the political situation in Portugal , James was unable to return to Lisbon to take possession of it , and so remained in Italy and governed his archdiocese from afar , via the vicar-general Lu\u00eds Anes . Nicholas V having died in early 1455 , the new Pope Calixtus III elevated James to a cardinal-deacon of the Church ( despite not having the requisite 30 years of age for the office ) , assigning him the titular diaconate of Santa Maria in Portico Octaviae , soon substituted for the diaconate of Sant'Eustachio . Callixtus III also gave James the Bishopric of Paphos , in Cyprus , where his brother , John , had married Charlotte of Lusignan , Princess of Cyprus . Following the death of Callixtus III , James of Portugal participated in the conclave that elected Pius II as the new pope . He was appointed a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece , number 58 , at the 9th Chapter of the order , held in 1456 at The Hague .",
  "/wiki/Portuguese_people": "Portuguese people are a Romance ethnic group indigenous to Portugal who share a common Portuguese culture , ancestry and language . Their predominant religion is Christianity , mainly Roman Catholicism , though large segments of the population , especially the younger generations , have no religious affiliation . The Portuguese people 's heritage largely derives from the pre-Celts ( Lusitanians , Conii ) and Celts ( Gallaecians , Turduli and Celtici ) , who were Romanized after the conquest of the region by the ancient Romans . A number of Portuguese can also trace minor descent from Germanic tribes who arrived after the Roman period as ruling elites , namely the Suebi , Vandals and Visigoths , who ruled for circa three hundred years . Finally , the Moorish occupation left a genetic contribution in the Iberian Peninsula , especially in western and southern regions . The Roman Republic conquered the Iberian Peninsula during the 2nd and 1st centuries B.C . from the extensive maritime empire of Carthage during the series of Punic Wars . As a result of Roman colonization , the Portuguese language stems primarily from Vulgar Latin . Due to the large historical extent from the 16th century of the Portuguese Empire and the subsequent colonization of territories in Asia , Africa and the Americas , as well as historical and recent emigration , Portuguese communities can be found in many diverse regions around the globe , and a large Portuguese diaspora exists . Portuguese people began an Age of Exploration which started in 1415 with the conquest of Ceuta and culminated in an empire with territories that are now part of over 50 countries . The Portuguese Empire lasted nearly 600 years , seeing its end when Macau was returned to China in 1999 . The discovery of several lands unknown to Europeans in the Americas , Africa , Asia and Oceania ( southwest Pacific Ocean ) , forged the Portuguese Empire described as the first global empire in history , also paving the way for the domination of Western civilisation by other neighbouring European nations .",

Born into the prominent Borgia family in X\u00e0tiva in the Crown of Aragon , Rodrigo studied law at the University of Bologna . He was ordained deacon and made a cardinal in 1456 after the election of his uncle as Pope Callistus III , and a year later he became vice-chancellor of the Catholic Church . He proceeded to serve in the Curia under the next four popes , acquiring significant influence and wealth in the process . In 1492 , Rodrigo was elected Pope , taking the name Alexander VI . Alexander 's bulls of 1493 confirmed or reconfirmed the rights of the Spanish crown in the New World following the finds of Christopher Columbus in 1492 . During the second Italian war , Alexander VI supported his son Cesare Borgia as a condottiero for the French King . The scope of his foreign policy was to gain the most advantageous terms for his family . Alexander is considered one of the most controversial of the Renaissance popes , partly because he acknowledged fathering several children by his mistresses . As a result , his Italianized Valencian surname , Borgia , became a byword for libertinism and nepotism , which are traditionally considered as characterizing his pontificate . On the other hand , two of Alexander 's successors , Sixtus V and Urban VIII , described him as one of the most outstanding popes since Saint Peter .",
