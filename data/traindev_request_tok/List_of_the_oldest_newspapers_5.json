  "/wiki/Joseon": "The Joseon dynasty ( also transcribed as Chos\u014fn or Chosen , Korean : \ub300\uc870\uc120\uad6d , lit . Great Korean Country ) was a Korean dynastic kingdom that lasted for approximately five centuries . Joseon was founded by Yi Seong-gye in July 1392 and was replaced by the Korean Empire in October 1897 . It was founded following the aftermath of the overthrow of Goryeo in what is today the city of Kaesong . Early on , Korea was retitled and the capital was relocated to modern-day Seoul . The kingdom 's northernmost borders were expanded to the natural boundaries at the rivers of Amnok and Tuman through the subjugation of the Jurchens . Joseon was the last dynasty of Korea and its longest-ruling Confucian dynasty . During its reign , Joseon encouraged the entrenchment of Chinese Confucian ideals and doctrines in Korean society . Neo-Confucianism was installed as the new dynasty 's state ideology . Buddhism was accordingly discouraged and occasionally faced persecutions by the dynasty . Joseon consolidated its effective rule over the territory of current Korea and saw the height of classical Korean culture , trade , literature , and science and technology . However , the dynasty was severely weakened during the late 16th and early 17th centuries , when the Japanese invasions of Korea in the 1590s and the first and second Manchu invasions nearly overran the Korean Peninsula , leading to an increasingly harsh isolationist policy , for which the country became known as the hermit kingdom in Western literature .",

  "/wiki/British_Malaya": "The term British Malaya ( /m\u0259\u02c8le\u026a\u0259/ ; Malay : Tanah Melayu British ) loosely describes a set of states on the Malay Peninsula and the island of Singapore that were brought under British hegemony or control between the 18th and the 20th centuries . Unlike the term British India , which excludes the Indian princely states , British Malaya is often used to refer to the Federated and Unfederated Malay States , which were British protectorates with their own local rulers , as well as the Straits Settlements , which were under the sovereignty and direct rule of the British Crown , after a period of control by the East India Company . Before the formation of the Malayan Union in 1946 , the territories were not placed under a single unified administration , with the exception during the immediate post-war period when a British military officer became the temporary administrator of Malaya . Instead , British Malaya comprised the Straits Settlements , the Federated Malay States , and the Unfederated Malay States . Under British hegemony , Malaya was one of the most profitable territories of the Empire , being the world 's largest producer of tin and later rubber . During the Second World War , Japan ruled a part of Malaya as a single unit from Singapore . The Malayan Union was unpopular and in 1948 was dissolved and replaced by the Federation of Malaya , which became fully independent on 31 August 1957 . On 16 September 1963 , the federation , along with North Borneo ( Sabah ) , Sarawak , and Singapore , formed the larger federation of Malaysia .",

Over fourteen million people ( 22.2 percent ) lived within the surrounding Bangkok Metropolitan Region at the 2010 census , making Bangkok the nation 's primate city , dwarfing Thailand 's other urban centres in both size and importance to the national economy . Bangkok traces its roots to a small trading post during the Ayutthaya Kingdom in the 15th century , which eventually grew and became the site of two capital cities : Thonburi in 1768 and Rattanakosin in 1782 . Bangkok was at the heart of the modernization of Siam , later renamed Thailand , during the late-19th century , as the country faced pressures from the West . The city was at the centre of Thailand 's political struggles throughout the 20th century , as the country abolished absolute monarchy , adopted constitutional rule , and underwent numerous coups and several uprisings . The city grew rapidly during the 1960s through the 1980s and now exerts a significant impact on Thailand 's politics , economy , education , media and modern society . [ citation needed ] The Asian investment boom in the 1980s and 1990s led many multinational corporations to locate their regional headquarters in Bangkok .

Although nominally the country is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy , the most recent coup , in 2014 , established a de facto military dictatorship under a junta . Tai peoples migrated from southwestern China to mainland Southeast Asia from the 11th century ; the oldest known mention of their presence in the region by the exonym Siamese dates to the 12th century . Various Indianised kingdoms such as the Mon kingdoms , Khmer Empire and Malay states ruled the region , competing with Thai states such as the Kingdoms of Ngoenyang , Sukhothai , Lan Na and Ayutthaya , which rivaled each other . Documented European contact began in 1511 with a Portuguese diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya , now one of the great powers in the region . Ayutthaya reached its peak during cosmopolitan Narai 's reign ( 1656-1688 ) , gradually declining thereafter until being ultimately destroyed in the 1767 Burmese-Siamese War .

Singapore is located about one degree ( 137 kilometres or 85 miles ) north of the equator , and is situated off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula , and by extension , the southernmost extremity of continental Asia . The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia 's Riau Islands , its northern , western , and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia , and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east . It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south , and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans , being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east . The country 's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets , the combined area of which has increased by almost 25% since the country 's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects . Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history , modern Singapore , then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate , was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles , a British colonial officer , established a trading post of the East India Company on the island . In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond . During the Second World War , Imperial Japan successfully invaded Singapore , resulting in an interregnum of British rule corresponding with a brief Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 .

After the brief Kingdom of Tungning in parts of the southern and western areas of the island , the island was annexed in 1683 by the Qing dynasty of China , and ceded to the Empire of Japan in 1895 . Following the surrender of Japan in 1945 , the Republic of China , which had overthrown and succeeded the Qing in 1911 , took control of Taiwan on behalf of the World War II Allies . The resumption of the Chinese Civil War led to the loss of the mainland to the Communist Party of China and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949 . Although the ROC government continued to claim to be the legitimate representative of China , since 1950 its effective jurisdiction has been limited to Taiwan and numerous smaller islands .",

  "/wiki/Taiwan_under_Japanese_rule": "Japanese Taiwan was the period of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands under Japanese rule between 1895 and 1945 . Taiwan became a dependency of Japan in 1895 when the Qing dynasty of China ceded Taiwan Province in the Treaty of Shimonoseki after Japanese victory in the First Sino-Japanese War . The short-lived Republic of Formosa resistance movement was suppressed by Japanese troops and quickly defeated in the Capitulation of Tainan , ending organized resistance to Japanese occupation and inaugurated five decades of Japanese rule . Taiwan was Japan 's first overseas colony and can be viewed as the first steps in implementing their Southern Expansion Doctrine of the late 19th century . Japanese intentions were to turn Taiwan into a showpiece model colony with much effort made to improve the island 's economy , public works , industry , cultural Japanization , and to support the necessities of Japanese military aggression in the Asia-Pacific . Japanese rule of Taiwan ended after the surrender of Japan concluded World War II in August 1945 , and the territory was placed under the control of the Republic of China ( ROC ) with the issuing of General Order No . 1 . Japan formally renounced rights to Taiwan in the Treaty of San Francisco in April 1952 . The experience of Japanese rule , ROC rule and the February 28 massacre of 1947 continues to affect issues such as Taiwan Retrocession Day , national identity , ethnic identity , and the formal Taiwan independence movement .",
