  "/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction": "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction is a subgenre of science fiction , science fantasy , dystopian or horror in which the Earth 's technological civilization is collapsing or has collapsed . The apocalypse event may be climatic , such as runaway climate change ; natural , such as an impact event ; man-made , such as nuclear holocaust or resource depletion ; medical , such as a pandemic , whether natural or man-made ; eschatological , such as the Last Judgment , Second Coming or Ragnar\u00f6k ; or imaginative , such as a zombie apocalypse , cybernetic revolt , technological singularity , dysgenics or alien invasion . The story may involve attempts to prevent an apocalypse event , deal with the impact and consequences of the event itself , or it may be post-apocalyptic , set after the event . The time may be right after the catastrophe , focusing on the psychology of survivors , the way to maintain the human race alive and together as one , or considerably later , often including that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been mythologized . After apocalyptic stories often take place in a non-technological future world or a world where only scattered elements of society and technology remain . Various ancient societies , including the Babylonian and Judaic , produced apocalyptic literature and mythology which dealt with the end of the world and of human society , such as the Epic of Gilgamesh , written c. 2000-1500 BC . Recognizable modern apocalyptic novels had existed since at least the first third of the 19th century , when Mary Shelley 's The Last Man ( 1826 ) was published . However , this form of literature gained widespread popularity after World War II , when the possibility of global annihilation by nuclear weapons entered the public consciousness .",

  "/wiki/Batman_(1989_film)": "Batman is a 1989 American superhero film directed by Tim Burton and produced by Jon Peters and Peter Guber , based on the DC Comics character of the same name . It is the first installment of Warner Bros. ' initial Batman film series . The film stars Jack Nicholson as the Joker and Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne / Batman , alongside Kim Basinger , Robert Wuhl , Pat Hingle , Billy Dee Williams , Michael Gough , and Jack Palance . The film takes place early in the title character 's war on crime , and depicts a battle with the Joker . After Burton was hired as director in 1986 , Steve Englehart and Julie Hickson wrote film treatments before Sam Hamm wrote the first screenplay . Batman was not greenlit until after the success of Burton 's Beetlejuice ( 1988 ) . Numerous A-list actors were considered for the role of Batman before Keaton was cast . Keaton 's casting caused a controversy since , by 1988 , he had become typecast as a comedic actor and many observers doubted he could portray a serious role . Nicholson accepted the role of the Joker under strict conditions that dictated top billing , a portion of the film 's earnings ( including associated merchandise ) , and his own shooting schedule . The tone and themes of the film were influenced in part by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland 's The Killing Joke and Frank Miller 's The Dark Knight Returns . The film primarily adapts the Red Hood origin story for the Joker , in which Batman inadvertently creates the Joker by causing him to fall into Axis Chemical acid , resulting in his transformation into a psychopath , but it adds a unique twist in presenting him specifically as a gangster named Jack Napier . Filming took place at Pinewood Studios from October 1988 to January 1989 .",
  "/wiki/Joker_(character)": "The Joker is a supervillain created by Bill Finger , Bob Kane , and Jerry Robinson who first appeared in the debut issue of the comic book Batman ( April 25 , 1940 ) , published by DC Comics . Credit for the Joker 's creation is disputed ; Kane and Robinson claimed responsibility for the Joker 's design while acknowledging Finger 's writing contribution . Although the Joker was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance , he was spared by editorial intervention , allowing the character to endure as the archenemy of the superhero Batman . In his comic book appearances , the Joker is portrayed as a criminal mastermind . Introduced as a psychopath with a warped , sadistic sense of humor ; the character became a goofy prankster in the late 1950s in response to regulation by the Comics Code Authority , before returning to his darker roots during the early 1970s . As Batman 's nemesis , the Joker has been part of the superhero 's defining stories , including the murder of Jason Todd - the second Robin and Batman 's ward - and the paralysis of one of Batman 's allies , Barbara Gordon . The Joker has had various possible origin stories during his decades of appearances . The most common story involves him falling into a tank of chemical waste that bleaches his skin white and turns his hair green and lips bright red ; the resulting disfigurement drives him insane . The antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance , the Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary . The Joker possesses no superhuman abilities , instead using his expertise in chemical engineering to develop poisonous or lethal concoctions and thematic weaponry , including razor-tipped playing cards , deadly joy buzzers , and acid-spraying lapel flowers . The Joker sometimes works with other Gotham City supervillains , such as the Penguin and Two-Face , and groups like the Injustice Gang and Injustice League , but these relationships often collapse due to the Joker 's desire for unbridled chaos . The 1990s introduced a romantic interest for the Joker in his former psychiatrist , Harley Quinn , who becomes his villainous sidekick .",

  "/wiki/Rhythm_game": "Rhythm game or rhythm action is a genre of music-themed action video game that challenges a player 's sense of rhythm . Games in the genre typically focus on dance or the simulated performance of musical instruments , and require players to press buttons in a sequence dictated on the screen . Many rhythm games include multiplayer modes in which players compete for the highest score or cooperate as a simulated musical ensemble . While conventional control pads may be used as input devices , rhythm games often feature novel game controllers that emulate musical instruments . Certain dance-based games require the player to physically dance on a mat , with pressure-sensitive pads acting as the input device . The 1996 title PaRappa the Rapper has been deemed the first influential rhythm game , whose basic template formed the core of subsequent games in the genre . In 1997 , Konami 's Beatmania sparked an emergent market for rhythm games in Japan . The company 's music division , Bemani , released a series of music-based games over the next several years . The most successful of these was the 1998 dance mat game Dance Dance Revolution , which was the only Bemani title to achieve large-scale success outside Japan , and would see numerous imitations of the game from other publishers . Other Japanese games , particularly Guitar Freaks , led to development of Guitar Hero and Rock Band series that used instrument-shaped controllers to mimic the playing of actual instruments . Spurred by the inclusion of popular rock music , the two series revitalized the rhythm genre in the Western Market , significantly expanded the console video game market and its demographics . The games provided a new source of revenue for the artists whose music appeared on the soundtracks .",

  "/wiki/Prototype": "A prototype is an early sample , model , or release of a product built to test a concept or process . It is a term used in a variety of contexts , including semantics , design , electronics , and software programming . A prototype is generally used to evaluate a new design to enhance precision by system analysts and users . Prototyping serves to provide specifications for a real , working system rather than a theoretical one . In some design workflow models , creating a prototype ( a process sometimes called materialization ) is the step between the formalization and the evaluation of an idea .

  "/wiki/Powerup": "In video games , a power-up is an object that adds temporary benefits or extra abilities to the player character as a game mechanic . This is in contrast to an item , which may or may not have a permanent benefit that can be used at any time chosen by the player . Although often collected directly through touch , power-ups can sometimes only be gained by collecting several related items , such as the floating letters of the word 'EXTEND ' in Bubble Bobble . Well known examples of power-ups that have entered popular culture include the power pellets from Pac-Man ( regarded as the first power-up ) and the Super Mushroom from Super Mario Bros. , which ranked first in UGO Networks ' Top 11 Video Game Powerups . Items that confer power-ups are usually pre-placed in the game world , spawned randomly , dropped by beaten enemies or picked up from opened or smashed containers . They can be differentiated from items in other games , such as role-playing video games , by the fact that they take effect immediately , feature designs that do not necessarily fit into the game world ( often used letters or symbols emblazoned on a design ) , and are found in specific genres of games . Power-ups are mostly found in action-oriented games such as maze games , run and guns , shoot 'em ups , first-person shooters , and platform games .",

  "/wiki/Boxing": "Boxing is a combat sport in which two people , usually wearing protective gloves , throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring . Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a standard fixture in most international games - it also has its own World Championships . Boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds . A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing , disqualification of an opponent , or resignation of an opponent . When the fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing , the judges ' scorecards determine the victor . In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges , professional bouts are considered a draw . In Olympic boxing , because a winner must be declared , judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria . While humans have fought in hand-to-hand combat since the dawn of human history , the earliest evidence of fist-fighting sporting contests date back to the ancient Near East in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC . The earliest evidence of boxing rules date back to Ancient Greece , where boxing was established as an Olympic game in 688 BC . Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights , largely in Great Britain , to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules .",

In 1978 , the game was ported to the Atari 2600 and a sequel was made , Super Breakout , which four years later became the pack-in game for the Atari 5200 console . Breakout spawned an entire genre of Breakout clones , and the concept found new legs with Taito 's 1986 Arkanoid , which itself spawned dozens of imitators . In Breakout , a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen and the goal is to destroy them all . A ball moves straight around the screen , bouncing off the top and two sides of the screen . When a brick is hit , the ball bounces back and the brick is destroyed . The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen ; to prevent this from happening , the player has a horizontally movable paddle to bounce the ball upward , keeping it in play .",
