  "/wiki/Australian_rules_football_positions": "In the sport of Australian rules football , each of the eighteen players in a team is assigned to a particular named position on the field of play . These positions describe both the player 's main role and by implication their location on the ground . As the game has evolved , tactics and team formations have changed , and the names of the positions and the duties involved have evolved too . There are 18 positions in Australian rules football , not including four ( sometimes 6-8 ) interchange players who may replace another player on the ground at any time during play . The fluid nature of the modern game means the positions in football are not as formally defined as in sports such as rugby or American football . Even so , most players will play in a limited range of positions throughout their career , as each position requires a particular set of skills . Footballers who are able to play comfortably in numerous positions are referred to as utility players .",

  "/wiki/Ruckman_(Australian_rules_football)": "In Australian rules football , a ruckman or ruckwoman is typically a tall and athletic player who contests at centre bounces and stoppages ( such as boundary throw-ins and ball-ups ) . The ruckman is one of the most important players on the field . They are often key to coaching strategy and winning centre clearances which result in the most goal kicking opportunities ( inside 50s ) . The role of the ruckman in Australian rules is similar to a lock in rugby union contesting a line-out . The key differences are that with the exception of boundary throw-ins , the ball is almost always thrown straight up high into the air rather than horizontally , so in this respect , the ruckman is similar to a basketball centre . The ruckman needs to be able to control the ball by palm tap or fist with outstretched arms . Unlike rugby , the ruckman must rely on his vertical leap and is not assisted by teammates . Australian football rucking often involves vigorous mid-air collisions with the opposing ruckman . With no offside or knock on rules , the ruckman can tap the ball in any direction . Before a bounce down or ball up , ruckmen confer with the onballers ( rovers and ruck-rovers ) to pre-determine the direction of the tap so that they can position themselves to best receive it to the team 's advantage . The ruckman is typically the tallest player on either team . A typical professional Australian Football League ruckman is over 200 cm or 6 ' 7 .",

A pacy wingman from Western Australia , Wellingham became the fifth Indigenous footballer on the Magpies list having been selected with the 10th pick in the 2006 AFL Rookie Draft . Wellingham 's initial season at the club was spent with Collingwood 's VFL affiliate side , Williamstown . Due to VFL limits on the number of AFL-listed players eligible for selection against non AFL-affiliated clubs , Wellingham was demoted to the Williamstown reserves towards the end of 2007 . Despite this Wellingham was promoted to the Collingwood senior list to replace Chris Egan . Despite being named an emergency in round 19 against Richmond , he did not make his Collingwood debut in 2007 and was subsequently demoted back to 'rookie ' status . He survived the cut post-season , and remained on the Collingwood 2008 rookie list . He then switched guernsey numbers , switching from the lowly 41 to Guy Richards ' old number 21 . In January 2008 , Collingwood lost their sponsorship from the Transport Accident Commission after Wellingham was charged with drink-driving . Wellingham was moving a car 100 metres up the road ( so he says , the other AFL players with him had been drinking ) after being out on Saturday 5 January , when he was pulled over by the police . The club fined him $ 5000 . Before the 2008 Anzac Day Clash between Essendon and Collingwood he was promoted to the senior list again and was initially named as an emergency , but made his debut when Anthony Rocca was unable to play due to injury .",
