He is best remembered for his comic monologues in which he played Uncle Josh Weathersby , a resident of a mythical New England farming town called Punkin Center . Born in Charlotte County , Virginia in 1856 , Stewart spent his early life working in circuses , medicine shows and vaudeville to great acclaim as Uncle Josh Weathersby from Way Down East . It was on the road that he befriended Mark Twain and later Will Rogers , two men who shared similar wit in comedy . Around 1897 , Thomas Edison 's studios hired him to cut several cylinder recordings of his famous speeches and songs . They were well received by the public , and launched an entire series of recordings based on the Uncle Josh character . Stewart 's trademark on these recordings is the easily recognizable laugh that precedes his speeches . Best-selling recordings included Uncle Joshs Arrival in New York ( 1898 ) , I 'm Old But I 'm Awfully Tough ( Laughing Song ) ( 1898 ) , Jim Lawson 's Horse Trade With Deacon Witherspoon ( 1901 ) , Uncle Josh 's Huskin ' Bee Dance ( 1901 ) , and Uncle Josh Buys an Automobile ( 1903 ) . He wrote the song Ticklish Reuben in 1900 . Stewart continued recording on Edison , Columbia , Victor , and independent labels up until his death on December 7 , 1919 .

His most famous post was when he served as the commander of the American Expeditionary Forces ( AEF ) on the Western Front in World War I , 1917-18 . Pershing rejected British and French demands that American forces be integrated with their armies , and insisted that the AEF would operate as a single unit under his command , although some American divisions fought under British command , and he also allowed all-black units to be integrated with the French army . Pershing 's soldiers first saw serious battle at Cantigny , Chateau-Thierry , Belleau Wood , and Soissons . To speed up the arrival of American troops , they embarked for France leaving heavy equipment behind , and used British and French tanks , artillery , airplanes and other munitions . In September 1918 at St. Mihiel , the First Army was directly under Pershing 's command ; it overwhelmed the salient - the encroachment into Allied territory - that the German Army had held for three years . For the Meuse-Argonne Offensive , Pershing shifted roughly 600,000 American soldiers to the heavily defended forests of the Argonne , keeping his divisions engaged in hard fighting for 47 days , alongside the French . The Allied Hundred Days Offensive , which the Argonne fighting was part of , contributed to Germany calling for an armistice . Pershing was of the opinion that the war should continue and that all of Germany should be occupied in an effort to permanently destroy German militarism . Pershing is the only American to be promoted in his own lifetime to General of the Armies rank , the highest possible rank in the United States Army . [ Notes 1 ] Allowed to select his own insignia , Pershing chose to use four gold stars to distinguish himself from those officers who held the rank of General , which was signified with four silver stars . After the creation of the five-star General of the Army rank during World War II , his rank of General of the Armies could unofficially be considered that of a six-star general , but he died before the proposed insignia could be considered and acted on by Congress .",

Morton also wrote the standards King Porter Stomp , Wolverine Blues , Black Bottom Stomp , and I Thought I Heard Buddy Bolden Say , the last a tribute to New Orleans musicians from the turn of the 20th century . Morton 's claim to have invented jazz in 1902 aroused resentment .

Alan Lomax , who recorded extensive biographical interviews of Morton at the Library of Congress in 1938 , did not agree that Morton was an egotist :",

He has maintained worldwide renown as a leading musician of his era , one whose poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation . Chopin was born Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin in the Duchy of Warsaw and grew up in Warsaw , which in 1815 became part of Congress Poland .

Since Wyman 's departure in 1993 , Darryl Jones has served as touring bassist .

After a short period of experimentation with psychedelic rock in the mid-1960s , the group returned to its bluesy roots with Beggars Banquet ( 1968 ) , Let It Bleed ( 1969 ) , Sticky Fingers ( 1971 ) , and Exile on Main St. ( 1972 ) .
