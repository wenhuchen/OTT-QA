  "/wiki/Araguainha_crater": "The Araguainha crater or Araguainha dome is an impact crater on the border of Mato Grosso and Goi\u00e1s states , Brazil , between the villages of Araguainha and Ponte Branca . With a diameter of 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) , it is the largest known impact crater in South America . The crater has most recently been dated to 254.7 \u00b1 2.5 million years ago , when the region was probably a shallow sea . The margins of error of this date overlap the time of the Permian-Triassic extinction event , one of the largest mass extinction events in Earth 's history . The impact punched through Paleozoic sedimentary units belonging to the Paran\u00e1 Basin formations , and exposed the underlying Ordovician granite basement rocks . It is estimated that the crater was initially 24 kilometres ( 15 mi ) wide and 2.4 kilometres ( 1.5 mi ) deep , which then widened to 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) as its walls subsided inwards .",
  "/wiki/Brazil": "Brazil ( Portuguese : Brasil ; Portuguese pronunciation : [ b\u027ea\u02c8ziw ] ) , [ nt 1 ] officially the Federative Republic of Brazil ( Portuguese : Rep\u00fablica Federativa do Brasil , listen ( help\u00b7info ) ) , is the largest country in both South America and Latin America . At 8.5 million square kilometers ( 3.2 million square miles ) and with over 211 million people , Brazil is the world 's fifth-largest country by area and the sixth most populous . Its capital is Bras\u00edlia , and its most populous city is S\u00e3o Paulo . The federation is composed of the union of the 26 states , the Federal District , and the 5,570 municipalities . It is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas ; it is also one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations , due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world . Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east , Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers ( 4,655 mi ) . It borders all other countries in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent 's land area . Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest , home to diverse wildlife , a variety of ecological systems , and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats . This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries , and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection . Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral , who claimed the area for the Portuguese Empire . Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 , when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro . In 1815 , the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil and the Algarves .",
  "/wiki/Campo_del_Cielo_crater": "The Campo del Cielo refers to a group of iron meteorites or to the area where they were found . This area is situated on the border between the provinces of Chaco and Santiago del Estero , 1,000 kilometers ( 620 mi ) northwest of Buenos Aires , Argentina . The crater field covers an area of 3 by 18.5 kilometres ( 1.9 by 11.5 mi ) and contains at least 26 craters , the largest being 115 by 91 metres ( 377 by 299 ft ) . The craters ' age is estimated as 4,000-5,000 years . The craters , containing iron masses , were reported in 1576 , but were already well known to the aboriginal inhabitants of the area . The craters and the area around contain numerous fragments of an iron meteorite . The total weight of the pieces so far recovered is about 100 tonnes , making the meteorite possibly the heaviest one ever recovered on Earth . The largest two fragments , the 30.8-ton Gancedo and 28.8-ton El Chaco , are among the heaviest single-piece meteorite masses recovered on Earth , along with the 60-ton Hoba and a 31-ton fragment of the Cape York meteorite .",
  "/wiki/Argentina": "Argentina ( Spanish : [ a\u027exen\u02c8tina ] ) , officially the Argentine Republic [ A ] ( Spanish : Rep\u00fablica Argentina ) , is a country located mostly in the southern half of South America . Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with Chile to the west , the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north , Brazil to the northeast , Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east , and the Drake Passage to the south . With a mainland area of 2,780,400 km2 ( 1,073,500 sq mi ) , [ B ] Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world , the fourth largest in the Americas , the second largest in South America after Brazil , and the largest Spanish-speaking nation . The sovereign state is subdivided into twenty-three provinces ( Spanish : provincias , singular provincia ) and one autonomous city ( ciudad aut\u00f3noma ) , Buenos Aires , which is the federal capital of the nation ( Spanish : Capital Federal ) as decided by Congress . The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions , but exist under a federal system . Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica , the Falkland Islands ( Spanish : Islas Malvinas ) , and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period . The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times . The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century . Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810-1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with several waves of European immigration , mainly Italians and Spaniards , radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook ; 62.5% of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry , and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture .",
  "/wiki/2007_Carancas_impact_event": "The Carancas impact event refers to the fall of the Carancas chondritic meteorite on September 15 , 2007 , near the village of Carancas in Peru , close to the Bolivian border and Lake Titicaca . The impact created a small crater in the clay soil and scorched earth around its location . A local official , Marco Limache , said that boiling water started coming out of the crater , and particles of rock and cinders were found nearby , as fetid , noxious gases spewed from the crater . Surface impact occurred above 3,800 metres ( 12,500 ft ) . After the impact , villagers who had approached the impact site grew sick from a then-unexplained illness , with a wide array of symptoms . Two days later , Peruvian scientists confirmed that there had indeed been a meteorite strike , quieting widespread speculation that it may have been a geophysical rather than a celestial event . At that point , no further information on the cause of the mystery illness was known . The ground water in the local area is known to contain arsenic compounds , and the illness is now believed to have been caused by arsenic poisoning incurred when residents of the area inhaled the vapor of the boiling arsenic-contaminated water .",

It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia , in the east by Brazil , in the southeast by Bolivia , in the south by Chile , and in the west by the Pacific Ocean . Peru is a megadiverse country with habitats ranging from the arid plains of the Pacific coastal region in the west to the peaks of the Andes mountains vertically extending from the north to the southeast of the country to the tropical Amazon Basin rainforest in the east with the Amazon river . At 1.28 million km2 ( 0.5 million mi2 ) , Peru is the 19th largest country in the world , and the third largest in South America . Peruvian territory was home to several ancient cultures . Ranging from the Norte Chico civilization starting in 3500 BC , the oldest civilization in the Americas and one of the five cradles of civilization , to the Inca Empire , the largest state in pre-Columbian America , the territory now including Peru has one of the longest histories of civilization of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 4th millennia BCE . The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and established a viceroyalty that encompassed most of its South American colonies , with its capital in Lima . Peru formally proclaimed independence in 1821 , and following the military campaigns of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar , and the decisive battle of Ayacucho , Peru completed its independence in 1824 . In the ensuing years , the country enjoyed relative economic and political stability , which ended shortly before the War of the Pacific with Chile . Throughout the 20th century , Peru endured armed territorial disputes , coups , social unrest , and internal conflicts , as well as periods of stability and economic upswing . Alberto Fujimori was elected to the presidency in 1990 ; his government was credited with economically stabilizing Peru and successfully ending the Shining Path insurgency , though he was widely accused of human rights violations and suppression of political dissent . Fujimori left the presidency in 2000 and was charged with human rights violations and imprisoned until his pardon by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in 2017 .",

It borders Peru to the north , Bolivia to the northeast , Argentina to the east , and the Drake Passage in the far south . Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fern\u00e1ndez , Salas y G\u00f3mez , Desventuradas , and Easter Island in Oceania . Chile also claims about 1,250,000 square kilometres ( 480,000 sq mi ) of Antarctica under the Chilean Antarctic Territory . [ nb 3 ] , The arid Atacama Desert in northern Chile contains great mineral wealth , principally copper and lithium . The relatively small central area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources , and is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century when it incorporated its northern and southern regions . Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands , and features a string of volcanoes and lakes . The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords , inlets , canals , twisting peninsulas , and islands . Spain conquered and colonized the region in the mid-16th century , replacing Inca rule in the north and centre , but failing to conquer the independent Mapuche who inhabited what is now south-central Chile . After declaring its independence from Spain in 1818 , Chile emerged in the 1830s as a relatively stable authoritarian republic . In the 19th century , Chile saw significant economic and territorial growth , ending Mapuche resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in the War of the Pacific ( 1879-83 ) after defeating Peru and Bolivia . In the 1960s and 1970s , the country experienced severe left-right political polarization and turmoil .",
