The international border between Nepal ( Province No . 1 ) and China ( Tibet Autonomous Region ) runs across its summit point . The current official elevation of 8,848 m ( 29,029 ft ) , recognised by China and Nepal , was established by a 1955 Indian survey and subsequently confirmed by a Chinese survey in 1975 . In 1865 , Everest was given its official English name by the Royal Geographical Society , as recommended by Andrew Waugh , the British Surveyor General of India , who chose the name of his predecessor in the post , Sir George Everest , despite Everest 's objections . Mount Everest attracts many climbers , some of them highly experienced mountaineers . There are two main climbing routes , one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal ( known as the standard route ) and the other from the north in Tibet . While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route , Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness , weather , and wind , as well as significant hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall . As of 2019 [ update ] , over 300 people have died on Everest , many of whose bodies remain on the mountain . The first recorded efforts to reach Everest 's summit were made by British mountaineers . As Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time , the British made several attempts on the north ridge route from the Tibetan side . After the first reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921 reached 7,000 m ( 22,970 ft ) on the North Col , the 1922 expedition pushed the north ridge route up to 8,320 m ( 27,300 ft ) , marking the first time a human had climbed above 8,000 m ( 26,247 ft ) .",
  "/wiki/Nepal": "Nepal ( Nepali : \u0928\u0947\u092a\u093e\u0932 [ ne\u02c8pal ] ) , officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal , is a landlocked country in South Asia . It is located mainly in the Himalayas , but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain . With an estimated population of 26.4 million , it is 48th largest country by population and 93rd largest country by area . It borders China in the north and India in the south , east and west while Bangladesh is located within only 27 km ( 17 mi ) of its southeastern tip and Bhutan is separated from it by the Indian state of Sikkim . Nepal has a diverse geography , including fertile plains , subalpine forested hills , and eight of the world 's ten tallest mountains , including Mount Everest , the highest point on Earth . Kathmandu is the capital and the largest city . Nepal is a multiethnic country with Nepali as the official language . The name Nepal is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent , the era in ancient India when Hinduism was founded , the predominant religion of the country . In the middle of the first millennium BCE , Gautama Buddha , the founder of Buddhism , was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal . Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet . The centrally located Kathmandu Valley is intertwined with the culture of Indo-Aryans , and was the seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala . The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road was dominated by the valley 's traders .",
  "/wiki/China": "China ( Chinese : \u4e2d\u56fd ; pinyin : Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 ) , officially the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) , is a country in East Asia and is the world 's most populous country , with a population of around 1.428 billion in 2017 . Covering approximately 9,600,000 square kilometers ( 3,700,000 sq mi ) , it is the third largest country by area . [ j ] Governed by the Communist Party of China , the state exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces , [ k ] five autonomous regions , four direct-controlled municipalities ( Beijing , Tianjin , Shanghai , and Chongqing ) , and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty . China , as a whole , was ravaged by feudal warlordism and Japan during World War II .",

It is located in the Mansiri Himal , part of the Nepalese Himalayas , in the west-central part of Nepal . Its name , which means mountain of the spirit , comes from the Sanskrit word manasa , meaning intellect or soul . Manaslu was first climbed on May 9 , 1956 by Toshio Imanishi and Gyalzen Norbu , members of a Japanese expedition . It is said that just as the British consider Everest their mountain , Manaslu has always been a Japanese mountain .",

The massif is 55 kilometres ( 34 mi ) long , and is bounded by the Kali Gandaki Gorge on the west , the Marshyangdi River on the north and east , and by Pokhara Valley on the south . At the western end , the massif encloses a high basin called the Annapurna Sanctuary . The highest peak of the massif , Annapurna I Main , is the tenth highest mountain in the world at 8,091 metres ( 26,545 ft ) above sea level . Maurice Herzog led a French expedition to its summit through the north face in 1950 , making it the first of the eight-thousanders to be climbed and the only 8,000 meter-peak to be conquered on the first try . The entire massif and surrounding area are protected within the 7,629-square-kilometre ( 2,946 sq mi ) Annapurna Conservation Area , the first and largest conservation area in Nepal . The Annapurna Conservation Area is home to several world-class treks , including Annapurna Sanctuary and Annapurna Circuit . Historically , the Annapurna peaks have been among the world 's most treacherous mountains to climb with the particular case of the extremely steep south face of Annapurna I Main - a wall of rock that rises 3,000 meters ( 9,800 feet ) - making it one of the most difficult climbs in the world . By March 2012 , there had been 191 summit ascents of Annapurna I Main , and 61 climbing fatalities on the mountain . This fatality-to-summit ratio ( 1:3.1 , or 32% ) is the highest of any of the eight-thousanders . In October 2014 , at least 43 people were killed as a result of snowstorms and avalanches on and around Annapurna , thus resulting in Nepal 's worst ever trekking disaster . The most recent report of human casualty has been that of January 17 , 2020 due to an avalanche triggered by heavy snowfall .",

Roberts via the West Ridge , approached from the north . The summit party comprised Richard Grant , Chris Bonington , and Sherpa Ang Nyima . In terms of elevation , isolation ( distance to a higher summit , namely Annapurna I East Peak , 29.02 km or 18.03 mi ) and prominence ( 2,437 m or 7,995 ft ) , Annapurna II does not rank far behind Annapurna I Main , which serves as the western anchor . It is a fully independent peak , despite the close association with Annapurna I Main which its name implies . Annapurna II is the 16th highest mountain in the world . Yugoslavs from Slovenia repeated this ascent in 1969 , also climbing Annapurna IV . Kazmir Draslar and Matija Malezic reached the summit . In 1973 Japanese shortcut the route by climbing directly up the north face between IV and V before continuing along the west ridge . Katsuyuki Kondo reached the top in a remarkable solo performance . In 1983 , Tim Macartney-Snape planned and participated in an expedition to Annapurna II ( 7,937 m or 26,040 ft ) successfully reaching the summit via the first ascent of the south spur . The descent was delayed by a blizzard and the expedition ran out of food during the last five days .",

This pass separates the Khumbu and Rolwaling Himalayas .

It is a popular objective for professionally guided parties .",
