An effective ruckman , McKee is best remembered for his four-year stint with Collingwood , where he represented the team in the 2002 AFL Grand Final . After a short two-year stay at Punt Road , Collingwood acquired the services of McKee , along with draft selection seven ( Danny Roach ) in return for Clinton King and draft selection three ( Aaron Fiora ) at the end of season 1999 . McKee 's first season at the club was marred by Legionnaires ' Disease , picked up from one of the spa baths at the club 's headquarters at Victoria Park , though it was not enough to stop him from shutting down Essendon 's key forward Scott Lucas on Anzac Day in the round seven loss . His second season saw gradual improvement , marked by the attention he received for the tactic employed by coach Mick Malthouse midseason , which saw both McKee and fellow ruckman Josh Fraser begin at the centre bounce , with the decision on who rucked made at the last minute , leaving opposing ruckmen flummoxed . McKee 's career flourished in season 2002 , where his ability to drift a kick behind the play and aid his defenders was crucial in the team 's success , as was his ability to act like a fourth midfielder at the stoppages , his efforts twice negating the influence of Port Adelaide powerhouse Matthew Primus , most crucially in the Qualifying Final defeat of the Power . McKee 's efforts in the Grand Final were brave , as although swamped by Clark Keating , McKee still managed to lay an impressive nine tackles , breaking the rucking stereotype . Season 2003 saw McKee all but umpired out of the game by a new rule interpretation which worked against his style of ruckwork , which was to stand toe-to-toe with his opponent , instead of leaping . This paved the way for Fraser to make the position his own , relegating McKee to the role of the second stringer , missing out on the finals action , though many believe the durable McKee should have received a call up when Anthony Rocca was suspended for the Grand Final . His final year at league level , 2004 , was a quiet one , the Pies dropping out of the finals race early in the piece , and despite impressive efforts against Brisbane and the Western Bulldogs late in the season , found himself delisted at season 's end . Since finishing his playing career McKee has worked as a part-time assistant coach at Carlton . McKee will return to football in 2009 , having signed with the Warragul Football Club .",
