  "/wiki/Ashley_Jewish_Homesteaders_Cemetery": "The Ashley Jewish Homesteaders Cemetery is an early 20th century burial site near Ashley , North Dakota . The Russian and Romanian Jews who farmed the area beginning in 1905 arrived as refugees fleeing pogroms and persecution . They had never farmed before , due to restrictions against Jews owning land in their native countries . Despite this lack of experience and the many rocks and boulders that peppered their claims , with the assistance of their German-Russian neighbors , and hard work and persistence , the great majority of them were successful enough to buy their land outright prior to the five-year waiting period contained within the Homestead Act of 1862 , or to own their land at the five year mark . Over the course of the next 20 years , these Jewish farmers moved off their farms to carve out their livelihoods . Though many remained as shopkeepers in the smaller towns in the Dakotas , a significant number chose to eventually move closer to larger Jewish educational and social centers . Established in 1913 , the cemetery remains as the only physical evidence of the largest Jewish agricultural settlement in North Dakota , South Dakota , or Montana . It was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in 2015 , and re-dedicated with explanatory plaques in 2017 . It is the only remaining Jewish homesteader cemetery in the Dakotas that has been continually cared for by the descendants of those buried , and the Ashley residents hired by the descendants to maintain the grounds .",
