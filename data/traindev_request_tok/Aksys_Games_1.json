  "/wiki/PlayStation_3": "The PlayStation 3 ( officially abbreviated as PS3 ) is a home video game console developed by Sony Computer Entertainment . It is the successor to PlayStation 2 , and is part of the PlayStation brand of consoles . It was first released on November 11 , 2006 in Japan , November 17 , 2006 in North America , and March 23 , 2007 in Europe and Australia . The PlayStation 3 competed primarily against Microsoft 's Xbox 360 and Nintendo 's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles . The console was first officially announced at E3 2005 , and was released at the end of 2006 . It was the first console to use Blu-ray Disc as its primary storage medium . The console was the first PlayStation to integrate social gaming services , including the PlayStation Network , as well as the first to be controllable from a handheld console , through its remote connectivity with PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita . In September 2009 , the Slim model of the PlayStation 3 was released . It no longer provided the hardware ability to run PS2 games . It was lighter and thinner than the original version , and featured a redesigned logo and marketing design , as well as a minor start-up change in software . A Super Slim variation was then released in late 2012 , further refining and redesigning the console . During its early years , the system was negatively received , due to its high price ( $ 599 for a 60 gigabyte model , $ 499 for a 20 GB model ) , a complex processor architecture , and lack of quality games but was praised for its Blu-ray capabilities and untapped potential .",

Originally released in Japanese arcades in April 2007 , the title was ported to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 home consoles in Japan in May 2008 , with a North American Xbox 360-exclusive version released in English in September 2008 by Aksys Games .

A Microsoft Windows version , ported in collaboration with DotEmu and distributed via Steam , was released on July 7 , 2015 as Battle Fantasia : Revised Edition . The game 's development was headed by Emiko Iwasaki , who had previously served as illustrator for the company 's Guilty Gear series , and features three-dimensional character models restricted to a two-dimensional plane . Battle Fantasia retains a number of features of its predecessor including fast-paced gameplay , colorful anime-style graphics , and over-the-top effects , yet was designed to be a more basic representation of the fighting genre . The game is notable for its stylistic departure from many fighting games , and is set in a fantasy world depicted as a storybook , and borrows many superficial elements from role-playing games including damage represented as numbers and a text-heavy story mode , which involves a number of heroes answering the call to battle to stop an evil force from once again attempting to destroy the world . Battle Fantasia met with relatively low sales in Japan and received mixed to average reviews from critics .",
