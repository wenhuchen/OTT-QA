  "/wiki/Tropical_cyclone": "A tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by a low-pressure center , a closed low-level atmospheric circulation , strong winds , and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain or squalls . Depending on its location and strength , a tropical cyclone is referred to by different names , including hurricane ( /\u02c8h\u028cr\u026ak\u0259n , -ke\u026an/ ) , typhoon ( /ta\u026a\u02c8fu\u02d0n/ ) , tropical storm , cyclonic storm , tropical depression , and simply cyclone . A hurricane is a tropical cyclone that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean , and a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean ; in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean , comparable storms are referred to simply as tropical cyclones or severe cyclonic storms . Tropical refers to the geographical origin of these systems , which form almost exclusively over tropical seas . Cyclone refers to their winds moving in a circle , whirling round their central clear eye , with their winds blowing counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere . The opposite direction of circulation is due to the Coriolis effect . Tropical cyclones typically form over large bodies of relatively warm water . They derive their energy through the evaporation of water from the ocean surface , which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when moist air rises and cools to saturation . This energy source differs from that of mid-latitude cyclonic storms , such as nor'easters and European windstorms , which are fueled primarily by horizontal temperature contrasts . Tropical cyclones are typically between 100 and 2,000 km ( 62 and 1,243 mi ) in diameter . The strong rotating winds of a tropical cyclone are a result of the conservation of angular momentum imparted by the Earth 's rotation as air flows inwards toward the axis of rotation . As a result , they rarely form within 5\u00b0 of the equator .",
  "/wiki/1900_Galveston_hurricane": "The Great Galveston hurricane , known regionally as the Great Storm of 1900 , was the deadliest natural disaster in United States history , one of the deadliest hurricanes ( or remnants ) to affect Canada , and the fourth-deadliest Atlantic hurricane overall . The hurricane left between 6,000 and 12,000 fatalities in the United States ; the number most cited in official reports is 8,000 . Most of these deaths occurred in and near Galveston , Texas , after storm surge inundated the coastline with 8 to 12 ft ( 2.4 to 3.7 m ) of water . In addition to the number killed , the storm destroyed about 7,000 buildings of all uses in Galveston , which included 3,636 destroyed homes ; every dwelling in the city suffered some degree of damage . The hurricane left approximately 10,000 people in the city homeless , out of a total population of nearly 38,000 . The disaster ended the Golden Era of Galveston , as the hurricane alarmed potential investors , who turned to Houston instead . In response to the storm , three engineers designed and oversaw plans to raise the Gulf of Mexico shoreline of Galveston island by 17 ft ( 5.2 m ) and erect a 10 mi ( 16 km ) seawall . On August 27 , 1900 , a ship east of the Windward Islands detected a tropical cyclone , the first observed during the annual season . Initially at tropical storm status , it remained mostly stagnant in intensity while moving steadily west-northwestward and entered the northeastern Caribbean Sea on August 30 . The storm made landfall in the Dominican Republic as a weak tropical storm on September 2 . It weakened slightly while crossing Hispaniola , before re-emerging into the Caribbean Sea later that day . On September 3 , the cyclone struck modern day Santiago de Cuba Province and then slowly drifted along the southern coast of Cuba .",

Located in the South Central region , Texas shares borders with the states of Louisiana to the east , Arkansas to the northeast , Oklahoma to the north , New Mexico to the west , and the Mexican states of Chihuahua , Coahuila , Nuevo Le\u00f3n , and Tamaulipas to the southwest , and has a coastline with the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast . Houston is the most populous city in Texas and the fourth largest in the U.S. , while San Antonio is the second-most populous in the state and seventh largest in the U.S. Dallas-Fort Worth and Greater Houston are the fourth and fifth largest metropolitan statistical areas in the country , respectively . Other major cities include Austin , the second-most populous state capital in the U.S. , and El Paso . Texas is nicknamed the Lone Star State for its former status as an independent republic , and as a reminder of the state 's struggle for independence from Mexico . The Lone Star can be found on the Texas state flag and on the Texas state seal . The origin of Texas 's name is from the word taysha , which means friends in the Caddo language . Due to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault , Texas contains diverse landscapes common to both the U.S. Southern and Southwestern regions . Although Texas is popularly associated with the U.S. southwestern deserts , less than 10% of Texas 's land area is desert . Most of the population centers are in areas of former prairies , grasslands , forests , and the coastline . Traveling from east to west , one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods , to rolling plains and rugged hills , and finally the desert and mountains of the Big Bend . The term six flags over Texas [ note 1 ] refers to several nations that have ruled over the territory .",

Spanish and English are the official languages of the executive branch of government , though Spanish predominates . Originally populated by the indigenous Ta\u00edno people , Puerto Rico was colonized by Spain following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493 . It was contested by the French , Dutch , and British , but remained a Spanish possession for the next four centuries . The island 's cultural and demographic landscapes were shaped by the displacement and assimilation of the native population , the forced migration of African slaves , and settlement from the Canary Islands and Andalusia . In the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategic role compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain . Spain 's distant administrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century , producing a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined indigenous , African , and European elements .

  "/wiki/Earthquake": "An earthquake ( also known as a quake , tremor or temblor ) is the shaking of the surface of the Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the Earth 's lithosphere that creates seismic waves . Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they can not be felt to those violent enough to propel objects ( and people ) into the air , and wreak destruction across entire cities . The seismicity , or seismic activity , of an area is the frequency , type , and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time . The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling . At the Earth 's surface , earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the ground . When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore , the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami . Earthquakes can also trigger landslides and occasionally , volcanic activity . In its most general sense , the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event - whether natural or caused by humans - that generates seismic waves . Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological faults but also by other events such as volcanic activity , landslides , mine blasts , and nuclear tests . An earthquake 's point of initial rupture is called its focus or hypocenter . The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter .",
  "/wiki/Fire": "Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the exothermic chemical process of combustion , releasing heat , light , and various reaction products . Slower oxidative processes like rusting or digestion are not included by this definition . Fire is hot because the conversion of the weak double bond in molecular oxygen , O2 , to the stronger bonds in the combustion products carbon dioxide and water releases energy ( 418 kJ per 32 g of O2 ) ; the bond energies of the fuel play only a minor role here . At a certain point in the combustion reaction , called the ignition point , flames are produced . The flame is the visible portion of the fire . Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide , water vapor , oxygen and nitrogen . If hot enough , the gases may become ionized to produce plasma . Depending on the substances alight , and any impurities outside , the color of the flame and the fire 's intensity will be different . Fire in its most common form can result in conflagration , which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning . Fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe . The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems . The negative effects of fire include hazard to life and property , atmospheric pollution , and water contamination .",

Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

  "/wiki/Bomb": "A bomb is an explosive weapon that uses the exothermic reaction of an explosive material to provide an extremely sudden and violent release of energy . Detonations inflict damage principally through ground- and atmosphere-transmitted mechanical stress , the impact and penetration of pressure-driven projectiles , pressure damage , and explosion-generated effects . Bombs have been utilized since the 11th century starting in East Asia . The term bomb is not usually applied to explosive devices used for civilian purposes such as construction or mining , although the people using the devices may sometimes refer to them as a bomb . The military use of the term bomb , or more specifically aerial bomb action , typically refers to airdropped , unpowered explosive weapons most commonly used by air forces and naval aviation . Other military explosive weapons not classified as bombs include shells , depth charges ( used in water ) , or land mines . In unconventional warfare , other names can refer to a range of offensive weaponry . For instance , in recent Middle Eastern conflicts , homemade bombs called improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) have been employed by insurgent fighters to great effectiveness . The word comes from the Latin bombus , which in turn comes from the Greek \u03b2\u03cc\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2 ( bombos ) , an onomatopoetic term meaning booming , buzzing .",

Temperatures that people from a hotter climate consider normal can be called a heat wave in a cooler area if they are outside the normal climate pattern for that area . The term is applied both to hot weather variations and to extraordinary spells of hot which may occur only once a century . Severe heat waves have caused catastrophic crop failures , thousands of deaths from hyperthermia , and widespread power outages due to increased use of air conditioning .

  "/wiki/Wildfire": "A wildfire , wildland fire or rural fire is an uncontrolled fire in an area of combustible vegetation occurring in rural areas . Depending on the type of vegetation present , a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire , bushfire ( in Australia ) , desert fire , forest fire , grass fire , hill fire , peat fire , vegetation fire , or veld fire . Many organizations consider wildfire to mean an unplanned and unwanted fire , while wildland fire is a broader term that includes prescribed fire as well as wildland fire use ( WFU ; these are also called monitored response fires ) . Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago . Wildfire 's occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems ' flora and fauna . Earth is an intrinsically flammable planet owing to its cover of carbon-rich vegetation , seasonally dry climates , atmospheric oxygen , and widespread lightning and volcanic ignitions . Wildfires can be characterized in terms of the cause of ignition , their physical properties , the combustible material present , and the effect of weather on the fire . Wildfires can cause damage to property and human life , although naturally occurring wildfires may have beneficial effects on native vegetation , animals , and ecosystems that have evolved with fire . High-severity wildfire creates complex early seral forest habitat ( also called snag forest habitat ) , which often has higher species richness and diversity than unburned old forest . Many plant species depend on the effects of fire for growth and reproduction . Wildfires in ecosystems where wildfire is uncommon or where non-native vegetation has encroached may have strongly negative ecological effects . Wildfire behavior and severity result from a combination of factors such as available fuels , physical setting , and weather .",

Early the following day , the depression intensified into a tropical storm as it headed generally westward toward Florida , strengthening into a hurricane two hours before making landfall at Hallandale Beach on August 25 . After briefly weakening to tropical storm strength over southern Florida , Katrina emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on August 26 and began to rapidly intensify . The storm strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico before weakening to Category 3 strength at its second landfall on August 29 over southeast Louisiana and Mississippi . Over fifty breaches in surge protection levees surrounding the city of New Orleans , Louisiana caused of the majority of the death and destruction during Katrina . Eventually , 80% of the city , as well as large tracts of neighboring parishes , were inundated for weeks . The flooding also destroyed most of New Orleans ' transportation and communication facilities , leaving tens of thousands of people who had not evacuated the city prior to landfall stranded with little access to food , shelter or basic necessities . The scale of the disaster in New Orleans provoked massive national and international response efforts ; federal , local and private rescue operations evacuated displaced persons out of the city over the following weeks . Multiple investigations in the aftermath of the storm concluded that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , which had designed and built the region 's levees decades earlier , was responsible for the failure of the flood-control systems , though federal courts later ruled that the Corps could not be held financially liable because of sovereign immunity in the Flood Control Act of 1928 .

The government of Ohio is composed of the executive branch , led by the governor ; the legislative branch , which comprises the bicameral Ohio General Assembly ; and the judicial branch , led by the state Supreme Court . Ohio occupies 16 seats in the United States House of Representatives . Ohio is known for its status as both a swing state and a bellwether in national elections . Seven presidents of the United States have been elected who had Ohio as their home state .",
  "/wiki/Hurricane_Harvey": "Hurricane Harvey was a Category 4 hurricane that made landfall on Texas and Louisiana in August 2017 , causing catastrophic flooding and many deaths . It is tied with 2005 's Hurricane Katrina as the costliest tropical cyclone on record , [ nb 1 ] inflicting $ 125 billion ( 2017 USD ) in damage , primarily from catastrophic rainfall-triggered flooding in the Houston metropolitan area and Southeast Texas . It was the first major hurricane [ nb 2 ] to make landfall in the United States since Wilma in 2005 , ending a record 12-year span in which no hurricanes made landfall at the intensity of a major hurricane throughout the country . In a four-day period , many areas received more than 40 inches ( 1,000 mm ) of rain as the system slowly meandered over eastern Texas and adjacent waters , causing unprecedented flooding . With peak accumulations of 60.58 in ( 1,539 mm ) , in Nederland , Texas , Harvey was the wettest tropical cyclone on record in the United States . The resulting floods inundated hundreds of thousands of homes , which displaced more than 30,000 people and prompted more than 17,000 rescues . The eighth named storm , third hurricane , and first major hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season , Harvey developed from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles , reaching tropical storm status on August 17 . The storm crossed through the Windward Islands on the following day , making landfall on the southern end of Barbados and a second landfall on Saint Vincent . Upon entering the Caribbean Sea , Harvey began to weaken due to moderate wind shear , and degenerated into a tropical wave north of Colombia , late on August 19 . The remnants were monitored for regeneration as it continued west-northwestward across the Caribbean and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula , before redeveloping over the Bay of Campeche on August 23 . Harvey then began to rapidly intensify on August 24 , regaining tropical storm status and becoming a hurricane later that day . While the storm moved generally northwest , Harvey 's intensification phase stalled slightly overnight from August 24-25 ; however , Harvey soon resumed strengthening and quickly became a major hurricane and attained Category 4 intensity later that day .",
  "/wiki/Submarine": "A submarine ( or sub ) is a watercraft capable of independent operation underwater . It differs from a submersible , which has more limited underwater capability . It is also sometimes used historically or colloquially to refer to remotely operated vehicles and robots , as well as medium-sized or smaller vessels , such as the midget submarine and the wet sub . Submarines are referred to as boats rather than ships irrespective of their size . Although experimental submarines had been built before , submarine design took off during the 19th century , and they were adopted by several navies . Submarines were first widely used during World War I ( 1914-1918 ) , and are now used in many navies large and small . Military uses include attacking enemy surface ships ( merchant and military ) , or other submarines , aircraft carrier protection , blockade running , ballistic missile submarines as part of a nuclear strike force , reconnaissance , conventional land attack ( for example using a cruise missile ) , and covert insertion of special forces . Civilian uses for submarines include marine science , salvage , exploration and facility inspection and maintenance . Submarines can also be modified to perform more specialized functions such as search-and-rescue missions or undersea cable repair . Submarines are also used in tourism and undersea archaeology . Most large submarines consist of a cylindrical body with hemispherical ( or conical ) ends and a vertical structure , usually located amidships , which houses communications and sensing devices as well as periscopes . In modern submarines , this structure is the sail in American usage and fin in European usage .",
  "/wiki/Sinking_of_the_RMS_Lusitania": "The sinking of the Cunard ocean liner RMS Lusitania occurred on Friday , 7 May 1915 during the First World War , as Germany waged submarine warfare against the United Kingdom which had implemented a naval blockade of Germany . The ship was identified and torpedoed by the German U-boat U-20 and sank in 18 minutes , and also took on a heavy starboard list . The vessel went down 11 miles ( 18 km ) off the Old Head of Kinsale , :429 Ireland , killing 1,198 and leaving 761 survivors . The sinking turned public opinion in many countries against Germany , contributed to the American entry into World War I and became an iconic symbol in military recruiting campaigns of why the war was being fought . :497-503 Lusitania fell victim to torpedo attack relatively early in the First World War , before tactics for evading submarines were properly implemented or understood . The contemporary investigations in both the United Kingdom and the United States into the precise causes of the ship 's loss were obstructed by the needs of wartime secrecy and a propaganda campaign to ensure all blame fell upon Germany . Argument over whether the ship was a legitimate military target raged back and forth throughout the war as both sides made misleading claims about the ship . At the time she was sunk , she was carrying over 4 million rounds of small-arms ammunition ( .303 caliber ) , almost 5,000 shrapnel shell casings ( for a total of some 50 tons ) , and 3,240 brass percussion fuses , in addition to 1,266 passengers and a crew of 696 . Several attempts have been made over the years since the sinking to dive to the wreck seeking information about precisely how the ship sank , and argument continues to the present day .",

It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel , the Irish Sea , and St George 's Channel . Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles , the third-largest in Europe , and the twentieth-largest on Earth . Geopolitically , Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland ( officially named Ireland ) , which covers five-sixths of the island , and Northern Ireland , which is part of the United Kingdom . In 2011 , the population of Ireland was about 6.6 million , ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain . As of 2016 , 4.8 million live in the Republic of Ireland , and 1.8 million live in Northern Ireland . The geography of Ireland comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain , with several navigable rivers extending inland . Its lush vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature . Much of Ireland was woodland until the end of the Middle Ages . Today , woodland makes up about 10% of the island , compared with a European average of over 33% , and most of it is non-native conifer plantations . There are twenty-six extant land mammal species native to Ireland . The Irish climate is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and thus very moderate , and winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area , although summers are cooler than those in continental Europe .",
  "/wiki/Ocean_liner": "An ocean liner is a passenger ship primarily used as a form of transportation across seas or oceans . Liners may also carry cargo or mail , and may sometimes be used for other purposes ( such as for pleasure cruises or as hospital ships ) . Cargo vessels running to a schedule are sometimes called liners . The category does not include ferries or other vessels engaged in short-sea trading , nor dedicated cruise ships where the voyage itself , and not transportation , is the prime purpose of the trip . Nor does it include tramp steamers , even those equipped to handle limited numbers of passengers . Some shipping companies refer to themselves as lines and their container ships , which often operate over set routes according to established schedules , as liners . Ocean liners are usually strongly built with a high freeboard to withstand rough seas and adverse conditions encountered in the open ocean . Additionally , they are often designed with thicker hull plating than is found on cruise ships , and have large capacities for fuel , food and other consumables on long voyages . The first ocean liners were built in the mid-19th century . Technological innovations such as the steam engine and steel hull allowed larger and faster liners to be built , giving rise to a competition between world powers of the time , especially between the United Kingdom and Germany . Once the dominant form of travel between continents , ocean liners were rendered largely obsolete by the emergence of long-distance aircraft after World War II . Advances in automobile and railway technology also played a role .",
  "/wiki/World_War_One": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",

  "/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea": "The Mediterranean Sea is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean , surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land : on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia , on the south by North Africa and on the east by the Levant . Although the sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean , it is usually referred to as a separate body of water . Geological evidence indicates that around 5.9 million years ago , the Mediterranean was cut off from the Atlantic and was partly or completely desiccated over a period of some 600,000 years ( the Messinian salinity crisis ) before being refilled by the Zanclean flood about 5.3 million years ago . It covers an area of about 2,500,000 km2 ( 970,000 sq mi ) , representing 0.7% of the global ocean surface , but its connection to the Atlantic via the Strait of Gibraltar - the narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates Spain in Europe from Morocco in Africa - is only 14 km ( 9 mi ) wide . In oceanography , it is sometimes called the Eurafrican Mediterranean Sea or the European Mediterranean Sea to distinguish it from mediterranean seas elsewhere . The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500 m ( 4,900 ft ) and the deepest recorded point is 5,267 m ( 17,280 ft ) in the Calypso Deep in the Ionian Sea . It lies between latitudes 30\u00b0 and 46\u00b0 N and longitudes 6\u00b0 W and 36\u00b0 E. Its west-east length , from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Gulf of Iskenderun , on the southeastern coast of Turkey , is about 4,000 kilometres ( 2,500 mi ) . The sea was an important route for merchants and travellers of ancient times , facilitating trade and cultural exchange between peoples of the region .

  "/wiki/Glide_bomb": "A glide bomb or stand-off bomb is a standoff weapon with flight control surfaces to give it a flatter , gliding flight path than that of a conventional bomb without such surfaces . This allows it to be released at a distance from the target rather than right over it , allowing a successful attack without the aircraft needing to survive until reaching the target . World War II-era glide bombs like the German Fritz X and Henschel Hs 293 pioneered the use of remote control systems , allowing the controlling aircraft to direct the bomb to a pinpoint target as a pioneering form of precision-guided munition . Modern systems are generally self-guided or semi-automated , using GPS or laser designators to hit their target . The term glide bombing does not refer to the use of glide bombs , but a style of shallow-angle dive bombing .",
