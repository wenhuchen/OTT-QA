Managua is the country 's capital and largest city and is also the third-largest city in Central America , behind Tegucigalpa and Guatemala City . The multi-ethnic population of six million includes people of indigenous , European , African , and Asian heritage . The main language is Spanish . Indigenous tribes on the Mosquito Coast speak their own languages and English . Originally inhabited by various indigenous cultures since ancient times , the region was conquered by the Spanish Empire in the 16th century . Nicaragua gained independence from Spain in 1821 . The Mosquito Coast followed a different historical path , being colonized by the English in the 17th century and later coming under British rule . It became an autonomous territory of Nicaragua in 1860 and its northernmost part was transferred to Honduras in 1960 . Since its independence , Nicaragua has undergone periods of political unrest , dictatorship , occupation and fiscal crisis , including the Nicaraguan Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s and the Contra War of the 1980s . The mixture of cultural traditions has generated substantial diversity in folklore , cuisine , music , and literature , particularly the latter , given the literary contributions of Nicaraguan poets and writers such as Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo . Known as the land of lakes and volcanoes , Nicaragua is also home to the second-largest rainforest of the Americas .",

With about 10 million inhabitants , Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union .

Hungary 's capital and largest city is Budapest ; other major urban areas include Debrecen , Szeged , Miskolc , P\u00e9cs and Gy\u0151r . The territory of modern Hungary was for centuries inhabited by a succession of peoples , including Celts , Romans , Germanic tribes , Huns , West Slavs and the Avars . The foundations of the Hungarian state were established in the late ninth century CE by the Hungarian grand prince \u00c1rp\u00e1d following the conquest of the Carpathian Basin . His great-grandson Stephen I ascended the throne in 1000 , converting his realm to a Christian kingdom . By the 12th century , Hungary became a regional power , reaching its cultural and political height in the 15th century . Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 , Hungary was partially occupied by the Ottoman Empire ( 1541-1699 ) . It came under Habsburg rule at the turn of the 18th century , and later joined Austria to form the Austro-Hungarian Empire , a major European power . The Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed after World War I , and the subsequent Treaty of Trianon established Hungary 's current borders , resulting in the loss of 71% of its territory , 58% of its population , and 32% of ethnic Hungarians .",

Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810-1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with several waves of European immigration , mainly Italians and Spaniards , radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook ; 62.5% of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry , and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture .",

An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia .
