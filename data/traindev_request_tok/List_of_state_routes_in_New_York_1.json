  "/wiki/Cross_County_Parkway": "The Cross County Parkway ( CCP ) is a 4.46-mile-long ( 7.18 km ) parkway in lower Westchester County , New York , in the United States . The parkway is a critical east-west connection throughout Westchester , having full interchanges with every major north-south highway in southern Westchester with the exception of Interstate 95 ( New England Thruway ) . Among its junctions , it has access to the New York State Thruway mainline . The western terminus is at the Saw Mill Parkway in Yonkers . The eastern terminus is at the Hutchinson River Parkway in New Rochelle . As evident from stubs and oversized overpasses , it appears that there were plans to expand the Parkway west from exit 2 to Downtown Yonkers and east from exit 9 to I-95 . World War II had slowed this idea until it was shelved . The CCP is the only parkway in New York state that has express and local lanes . The parkway is designated New York State Route 907K ( NY 907K ) , an unsigned reference route .",
