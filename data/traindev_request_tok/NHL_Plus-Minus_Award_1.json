The Islanders are one of three NHL franchises in the New York metropolitan area , along with the New Jersey Devils and New York Rangers , and their fan base resides primarily on Long Island . The team was founded in 1972 as part of the NHL 's maneuvers to keep a team from rival league World Hockey Association ( WHA ) out of the newly built Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in suburban Uniondale , New York . After two years of building up the team 's roster , they found almost instant success by securing fourteen straight playoff berths starting with their third season . The Islanders won four consecutive Stanley Cup championships between 1980 and 1983 , the seventh of eight dynasties recognized by the NHL in its history . Their 19 consecutive playoff series wins between 1980 and 1984 is a feat that remains unparalleled in the history of professional sports .

Following the team 's dynasty era , the franchise ran into problems with money , ownership and management , an aging arena , and low attendance .

The New York Islanders won their first Stanley Cup , defeating the Philadelphia Flyers in six games , in the finals . The season also marked the eighth and final season for the Flames in Atlanta before the franchise relocated to Calgary . The NHL would return to the Georgia capital in 1999 with the Thrashers , but that team would ultimately relocate away from Atlanta as well becoming the second ( and current ) incarnation of the Winnipeg Jets . The collapse of the WHA also saw the much hyped super-star rookie Wayne Gretzky come to the NHL with the Edmonton Oilers . Gretzky would tie Marcel Dionne for the scoring lead with 137 points and capture the Hart Memorial Trophy as the most valuable player while Dionne took home the Art Ross Trophy as the leading scorer by virtue of having scored two more goals . Gretzky aside , many players made their debut in the NHL this season , both due to the WHA merger and to a change in the rules for the Entry Draft allowing eighteen- and nineteen-year-olds to be drafted for the first time ; no fewer than seven Hall of Famers ( Gretzky , Ray Bourque , Mark Messier , Mike Gartner , Michel Goulet , Mark Howe , and an undrafted Joe Mullen ) debuted this season , along with numerous other perennial stars . The big story of the regular season was the record-breaking undefeated streak compiled by the Philadelphia Flyers .
