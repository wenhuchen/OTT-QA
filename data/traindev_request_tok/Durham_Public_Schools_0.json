  "/wiki/Dragon": "A dragon is a large , serpentine legendary creature that appears in the folklore of many cultures around the world . Beliefs about dragons vary drastically by region , but dragons in western cultures since the High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged , horned , four-legged , and capable of breathing fire . Dragons in eastern cultures are usually depicted as wingless , four-legged , serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence . The earliest attested reports of draconic creatures resemble giant snakes . Draconic creatures are first described in the mythologies of the ancient Near East and appear in ancient Mesopotamian art and literature . Stories about storm-gods slaying giant serpents occur throughout nearly all Indo-European and Near Eastern mythologies . Famous prototypical draconic creatures include the mu\u0161\u1e2bu\u0161\u0161u of ancient Mesopotamia ; Apep in Egyptian mythology ; V\u1e5btra in the Rigveda ; the Leviathan in the Hebrew Bible ; Python , Ladon , Wyvern , and the Lernaean Hydra in Greek mythology ; J\u00f6rmungandr , N\u00ed\u00f0h\u00f6ggr , and Fafnir in Norse mythology ; and the dragon from Beowulf . The popular western image of a dragon as winged , four-legged , and capable of breathing fire is an invention of the High Middle Ages , based on a conflation of earlier dragons from different traditions , and of inaccurate scribal drawings of snakes . In western cultures , dragons are portrayed as monsters to be tamed or overcome , usually by saints or culture heroes , as in the popular legend of Saint George and the Dragon . They are often said to have ravenous appetites and to live in caves , where they hoard treasure . These dragons appear frequently in western fantasy literature , including The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien , the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling , and A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin . The word dragon has also come to be applied to the Chinese lung ( traditional \u9f8d , simplified \u9f99 , Pinyin long ) , which are associated with good fortune and are thought to have power over rain .",
  "/wiki/Green": "Green is the color between blue and yellow on the visible spectrum . It is evoked by light which has a dominant wavelength of roughly 495-570 nm . In subtractive color systems , used in painting and color printing , it is created by a combination of yellow and blue , or yellow and cyan ; in the RGB color model , used on television and computer screens , it is one of the additive primary colors , along with red and blue , which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors . By far the largest contributor to green in nature is chlorophyll , the chemical by which plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into chemical energy . Many creatures have adapted to their green environments by taking on a green hue themselves as camouflage . Several minerals have a green color , including the emerald , which is colored green by its chromium content . During post-classical and early modern Europe , green was the color commonly associated with wealth , merchants , bankers and the gentry , while red was reserved for the nobility . For this reason , the costume of the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci and the benches in the British House of Commons are green while those in the House of Lords are red . It also has a long historical tradition as the color of Ireland and of Gaelic culture . It is the historic color of Islam , representing the lush vegetation of Paradise . It was the color of the banner of Muhammad , and is found in the flags of nearly all Islamic countries . In surveys made in American , European , and Islamic countries , green is the color most commonly associated with nature , life , health , youth , spring , hope , and envy .",
  "/wiki/White": "White is the lightest color and is achromatic ( having no hue ) . It is the color of fresh snow , chalk and milk , and is the opposite of black . White objects fully reflect and scatter all the visible wavelengths of light . White on television and computer screens is created by a mixture of red , blue and green light . In ancient Egypt and ancient Rome , priestesses wore white as a symbol of purity , and Romans wore a white toga as a symbol of citizenship . In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a white unicorn symbolized chastity , and a white lamb sacrifice and purity . It was the royal color of the kings of France , and of the monarchist movement that opposed the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War ( 1917-1922 ) . Greek and Roman temples were faced with white marble , and beginning in the 18th century , with the advent of neoclassical architecture , white became the most common color of new churches , capitols and other government buildings , especially in the United States . It was also widely used in 20th century modern architecture as a symbol of modernity and simplicity . According to surveys in Europe and the United States , white is the color most often associated with perfection , the good , honesty , cleanliness , the beginning , the new , neutrality , and exactitude . White is an important color for almost all world religions . The pope , the head of the Roman Catholic Church , has worn white since 1566 , as a symbol of purity and sacrifice .",
  "/wiki/Cougar": "The cougar ( Puma concolor ) is a large felid of the subfamily Felinae . It is native to the Americas . Its range spans from the Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes in South America , and is the widest of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere . It is an adaptable , generalist species , occurring in most American habitat types . Due to its wide range , it has many names including puma , mountain lion , red tiger , and catamount . It is the second-heaviest cat in the New World after the jaguar . Secretive and largely solitary by nature , the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and crepuscular , although daytime sightings do occur . The cougar is more closely related to smaller felines , including the domestic cat , than to any species of subfamily Pantherinae , of which only the jaguar is extant in the Americas . The cougar is an ambush predator that pursues a wide variety of prey . Primary food sources are ungulates , particularly deer . It also hunts species as small as insects and rodents . This cat prefers habitats with dense underbrush and rocky areas for stalking , but can also live in open areas .",
  "/wiki/Orange_(color)": "Orange is the colour between yellow and red on the spectrum of visible light . Human eyes perceive orange when observing light with a dominant wavelength between roughly 585 and 620 nanometres . In painting and traditional colour theory , it is a secondary colour of pigments , created by mixing yellow and red . It is named after the fruit of the same name . The orange colour of carrots , pumpkins , sweet potatoes , oranges , and many other fruits and vegetables comes from carotenes , a type of photosynthetic pigment . These pigments convert the light energy that the plants absorb from the sun into chemical energy for the plants ' growth . Similarly the hues of autumn leaves are from the same pigment after chlorophyll is removed . In Europe and America , surveys show that orange is the colour most associated with amusement , the unconventional , extroverts , warmth , fire , energy , activity , danger , taste and aroma , the autumn and Allhallowtide seasons , as well as having long been the national colour of the Netherlands and the House of Orange . It also serves as the political colour of Christian democracy political ideology and most Christian democratic political parties . In Asia it is an important symbolic colour of Buddhism and Hinduism .",
  "/wiki/Black": "Black is the darkest color , the result of the absence or complete absorption of visible light . It is an achromatic color , a color without hue , like white and gray . It is often used symbolically or figuratively to represent darkness , while white represents light . Black and white have often been used to describe opposites such as good and evil , the Dark Ages versus Age of Enlightenment , and night versus day . Since the Middle Ages , black has been the symbolic color of solemnity and authority , and for this reason is still commonly worn by judges and magistrates , including the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court . Black was one of the first colors used by artists in neolithic cave paintings . In the 14th century , it was worn by royalty , clergy , judges and government officials in much of Europe . It became the color worn by English romantic poets , businessmen and statesmen in the 19th century , and a high fashion color in the 20th century . In the Roman Empire , it became the color of mourning , and over the centuries it was frequently associated with death , evil , witches and magic . According to surveys in Europe and North America , it is the color most commonly associated with mourning , the end , secrets , magic , force , violence , evil , and elegance . Black ink is the most common color used for printing books , newspapers and documents , as it provides the highest contrast with white paper and thus the easiest color to read . Similarly , black text on a white screen is the most common format used on computer screens .",
  "/wiki/Griffin": "The griffin , griffon , or gryphon ( Greek : \u03b3\u03c1\u03cd\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd , gr\u00fdph\u014dn , or \u03b3\u03c1\u03cd\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd , gr\u00fdp\u014dn , early form \u03b3\u03c1\u03cd\u03c8 , gr\u00fdps ; Latin : gryphus , meaning curved , in the sense of a beak or a hooked nose ) is a legendary creature with the body , tail , and back legs of a lion ; the head and wings of an eagle ; and sometimes an eagle 's talons as its front feet . Because the lion was traditionally considered the king of the beasts , and the eagle the king of the birds , by the Middle Ages the griffin was thought to be an especially powerful and majestic creature . Since classical antiquity , griffins were known for guarding treasures and priceless possessions . In Greek and Roman texts , griffins and Arimaspians were associated with gold deposits of Central Asia . Indeed , as Pliny the Elder wrote , griffins were said to lay eggs in burrows on the ground and these nests contained gold nuggets . In medieval heraldry , the griffin became a Christian symbol of divine power and a guardian of the divine .",
  "/wiki/Blue": "Blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments in painting and traditional colour theory , as well as in the RGB colour model . It lies between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light . The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres . Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colours ; azure contains some green , while ultramarine contains some violet . The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering . An optical effect called Tyndall scattering explains blue eyes . Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called aerial perspective . Blue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times . The semi-precious stone lapis lazuli was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery and ornament and later , in the Renaissance , to make the pigment ultramarine , the most expensive of all pigments . In the eighth century Chinese artists used cobalt blue to colour fine blue and white porcelain . In the Middle Ages , European artists used it in the windows of cathedrals . Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye woad until it was replaced by the finer indigo from America .",
  "/wiki/Raid_(military)": "Raiding , also known as depredation , is a military tactic or operational warfare mission which has a specific purpose and is not normally intended to capture and hold a location but instead finish with the raiding force quickly retreating to a previous defended position prior to enemy forces being able to respond in a coordinated manner or formulate a counter-attack . A raiding group may consist of combatants specially trained in this tactic , such as commandos , or as a special mission assigned to any regular troops . Raids are often a standard tactic in irregular warfare , employed by warriors , guerrilla fighters or other irregular military forces . Some raids are large , for example the Sullivan Expedition . The purposes of a raid may include :",
  "/wiki/Viking": "Vikings [ a ] were Scandinavians , who from the late 8th to late 11th centuries , raided and traded from their Northern European homelands across wide areas of Europe , and explored westwards to Iceland , Greenland , and Vinland . The term is also commonly extended in modern English and other vernaculars to include the inhabitants of Norse home communities during what has become known as the Viking Age , 793-1066 AD . This period of Nordic military , mercantile and demographic expansion constitutes an important element in the early medieval history of Scandinavia , Estonia , the British Isles , France , Kievan Rus ' and Sicily . Facilitated by advanced sailing and navigational skills , and characterised by the longship , Viking activities at times also extended into the Mediterranean littoral , North Africa , and the Middle East . Following extended phases of ( primarily sea- or river-borne ) exploration , expansion and settlement , Viking ( Norse ) communities and governments were established in diverse areas of north-western Europe , Belarus , Ukraine and European Russia , the North Atlantic islands and as far as the north-eastern coast of North America . This period of expansion witnessed the wider dissemination of Norse culture , while simultaneously introducing strong foreign cultural influences into Scandinavia itself , with profound developmental implications in both directions . Popular , modern conceptions of the Vikings - the term frequently applied casually to their modern descendants and the inhabitants of modern Scandinavia - often strongly differ from the complex picture that emerges from archaeology and historical sources . A romanticised picture of Vikings as noble savages began to emerge in the 18th century ; this developed and became widely propagated during the 19th-century Viking revival . Perceived views of the Vikings as alternatively violent , piratical heathens or as intrepid adventurers owe much to conflicting varieties of the modern Viking myth that had taken shape by the early 20th century . Current popular representations of the Vikings are typically based on cultural clich\u00e9s and stereotypes , complicating modern appreciation of the Viking legacy . These representations are not always accurate - for example , there is no evidence that they wore horned helmets , a costuming element that first appeared in Wagnerian opera .",

The use of gold as a color term in traditional usage is more often applied to the color metallic gold ( shown below ) . The first recorded use of golden as a color name in English was in 1300 to refer to the element gold and in 1423 to refer to blond hair . Metallic gold , such as in paint , is often called goldtone or gold tone . In heraldry , the French word or is used . In model building , the color gold is different from brass . A shiny or metallic silvertone object can be painted with transparent yellow to obtain goldtone , something often done with Christmas decorations .",
  "/wiki/Leopard": "The leopard ( Panthera pardus ) is one of the five extant species in the genus Panthera , a member of the Felidae . It occurs in a wide range in sub-Saharan Africa , in small parts of Western and Central Asia , on the Indian subcontinent to Southeast and East Asia . It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because leopard populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation , and are declining in large parts of the global range . In Hong Kong , Singapore , Kuwait , Syria , Libya , Tunisia and most likely in Morocco , leopard populations have already been extirpated . Contemporary records suggest that the leopard occurs in only 25% of its historical global range . Leopards are hunted illegally , and their body parts are smuggled in the wildlife trade for medicinal practices and decoration . Compared to other wild cats , the leopard has relatively short legs and a long body with a large skull . Its fur is marked with rosettes . It is similar in appearance to the jaguar , but has a smaller , lighter physique , and its rosettes are generally smaller , more densely packed and without central spots . Both leopards and jaguars that are melanistic are known as black panthers . The leopard is distinguished by its well-camouflaged fur , opportunistic hunting behaviour , broad diet , strength , and its ability to adapt to a variety of habitats ranging from rainforest to steppe , including arid and montane areas . It can run at speeds of up to 58 kilometres per hour ( 36 mph ) .",
  "/wiki/Eagle": "Eagle is the common name for many large birds of prey of the family Accipitridae . Eagles belong to several groups of genera , not all of which are closely related .

  "/wiki/Sheep": "Sheep ( Ovis aries ) are quadrupedal , ruminant mammals typically kept as livestock . Like most ruminants , sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla , the even-toed ungulates . Although the name sheep applies to many species in the genus Ovis , in everyday usage it almost always refers to Ovis aries . Numbering a little over one billion , domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep . An adult female is referred to as a ewe ( /ju\u02d0/ ) , an intact male as a ram , occasionally a tup , a castrated male as a wether , and a young sheep is a lamb . Sheep are most likely descended from the wild mouflon of Europe and Asia and one of the earliest animals to be domesticated for agricultural purposes , sheep are raised for fleeces , meat ( lamb , hogget or mutton ) and milk . A sheep 's wool is the most widely used animal fiber , and is usually harvested by shearing . Ovine meat is called lamb when from younger animals and mutton when from older ones in Commonwealth countries , and lamb in the United States ( including from adults ) . Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today , and are also occasionally raised for pelts , as dairy animals , or as model organisms for science . Sheep husbandry is practised throughout the majority of the inhabited world , and has been fundamental to many civilizations . In the modern era , Australia , New Zealand , the southern and central South American nations , and the British Isles are most closely associated with sheep production . There are a large lexicon of unique terms which vary considerably by region and dialect .",

  "/wiki/Red": "Red is the color at the end of the visible spectrum of light , next to orange and opposite violet . It has a dominant wavelength of approximately 625-740 nanometres . It is a primary color in the RGB color model and the CMYK color model , and is the complementary color of cyan . Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson , and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy . The red sky at sunset results from Rayleigh scattering , while the red color of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite or red ochre , both forms of iron oxide . Iron oxide also gives the red color to the planet Mars . The red color of blood comes from the protein hemoglobin , while ripe strawberries , red apples and reddish autumn leaves are colored by anthocyanins . Red pigment made from ochre was one of the first colors used in prehistoric art . The Ancient Egyptians and Mayans colored their faces red in ceremonies ; Roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate victories . It was also an important color in China , where it was used to color early pottery and later the gates and walls of palaces . :60-61 In the Renaissance , the brilliant red costumes for the nobility and wealthy were dyed with kermes and cochineal . The 19th century brought the introduction of the first synthetic red dyes , which replaced the traditional dyes .",
