  "/wiki/Midland_Cogeneration_Venture": "The Midland Cogeneration Venture ( MCV ) is a natural gas-fired electrical and steam co-generation plant in Midland , Michigan owned by Midland Cogeneration Venture Limited Partnership . When it began operation in 1991 , it was the largest gas-fired steam recovery power plant in the world . Originally designed as the Midland Nuclear Power Plant , the initial design called for two Babcock & Wilcox pressurized water reactors . Reactor one was designed with a 460 MWe rating , and reactor two with an 808 MWe rating . The design called for once-through steam generators ( OTSGs ) similar to those at Oconee . Consumers Power abandoned the project , which was 85% complete , in 1984 citing numerous construction problems , most notably a sinking foundation . These problems included sinking and cracking of some buildings on the site due to poor soil compaction prior to construction , as well as shifting regulatory requirements following the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island . The poor soil preparation was then exacerbated when the 880 acre cooling pond was filled to its approximate average depth of 15 feet . This in turn , seemed to raise the water table in and around the site . Construction was also opposed by environmentalists , led by Midland resident , Mary P. Sinclair . By then , 17 years and US $ 4.3 billion had been invested in the project . Consumers Power , nearly bankrupted by the project , formed a holding company , CMS Energy for it to be a subsidiary of and eventually changed its name to Consumers Energy .",
