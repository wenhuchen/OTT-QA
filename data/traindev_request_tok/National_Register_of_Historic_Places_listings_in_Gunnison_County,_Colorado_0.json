  "/wiki/Alpine_Tunnel": "Alpine Tunnel is a 1,772 ft ( 540 m ) narrow gauge railroad tunnel located east of Pitkin , Colorado on the former Denver , South Park and Pacific Railroad route from Denver to Gunnison . At an elevation of 11,523 feet ( 3,512 m ) , it was the first tunnel constructed through the Continental Divide in Colorado , and according to the U.S. Forest Service remains the highest railroad tunnel and the longest narrow gauge tunnel in North America . However , it did not last long in service . Construction began in January 1880 and was scheduled to last for six months but instead dragged on until July 1882 , and the line was abandoned in 1910 due to minor damage in the tunnel . Now the tunnel is sealed shut and the remaining trackbed serves as a trail for hikers and off-road vehicles .",
  "/wiki/Denver,_South_Park_and_Pacific_Railroad": "The Denver , South Park , and Pacific Railroad ( later called the Denver , Leadville and Gunnison Railway ) was a historic 3 ft ( 914 mm ) narrow gauge railroad that operated in Colorado in the western United States in the late 19th century . The railroad opened up the first rail routes to a large section of the central Colorado mining district in the decades of the mineral boom . The railroad took its name from the fact that its main line from Denver ascended the Platte Canyon and traversed South Park . Founded in 1872 by Colorado Governor John Evans , the company was purchased by the Union Pacific Railway in 1880 , though it continued to be operated independently . The line went bankrupt in 1889 and was reorganized under the new moniker the Denver , Leadville and Gunnison Railway . When the Union Pacific went bankrupt in 1893 , the DL & G lines went into receivership and were eventually sold to the Colorado and Southern Railway . In the first half of the 20th century , nearly all the company 's original lines were dismantled or converted into 4 ft 8 1\u20442 in ( 1,435 mm ) standard gauge . The last train to run the old DSP & P tracks was from Como , Colorado on April 11 , 1937 . A section of the standard gauge line between Leadville and Climax is still operated as a passenger excursion railroad called the Leadville , Colorado and Southern Railroad . At its peak the Denver , South Park and Pacific Railroad had 335 miles ( 539 km ) of narrow gauge line , making it the largest narrow gauge railroad in the state of Colorado .",
