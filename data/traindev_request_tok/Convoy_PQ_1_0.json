  "/wiki/Gross_register_tons": "Gross register tonnage ( GRT , grt , g.r.t. , gt ) or gross registered tonnage , is a ship 's total internal volume expressed in register tons , each of which is equal to 100 cubic feet ( 2.83 m3 ) . Gross register tonnage uses the total permanently enclosed capacity of the vessel as its basis for volume . Typically this is used for dockage fees , canal transit fees , and similar purposes where it is appropriate to charge based on the size of the entire vessel . Net register tonnage subtracts the volume of spaces not available for carrying cargo , such as engine rooms , fuel tanks and crew quarters , from gross register tonnage . Gross register tonnage is not a measure of the ship 's weight or displacement and should not be confused with terms such as deadweight tonnage or displacement .",

  "/wiki/Royal_Navy": "The Royal Navy ( RN ) is the United Kingdom 's naval warfare force . Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels .",

  "/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland": "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was a sovereign state established by the Acts of Union 1800 , which merged the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland . The United Kingdom , having financed the European coalition that defeated France during the Napoleonic Wars , developed a large Royal Navy that enabled the British Empire to become the foremost world power for the next century . The Crimean War with Russia was a relatively small operation in a century where Britain was largely at peace with the Great Powers . Rapid industrialisation that began in the decades prior to the state 's formation continued up until the mid-19th century . The Great Irish Famine , exacerbated by government inaction in the mid-19th century , led to demographic collapse in much of Ireland and increased calls for Irish land reform . The 19th century was an era of rapid economic modernisation and growth of industry , trade and finance , in which Britain largely dominated the world economy . Outward migration was heavy to the principal British overseas possessions and to the United States . The empire was expanded into most parts of Africa and much of South Asia . The Colonial Office and India Office ruled through a small number of administrators who managed the units of the empire locally , while democratic institutions began to develop . British India , by far the most important overseas possession , saw a short-lived revolt in 1857 . In overseas policy , the central policy was free trade , which enabled British and Irish financiers and merchants to operate successfully in many otherwise independent countries , as in South America . London formed no permanent military alliances until the early 20th century , when it began to cooperate with Japan , France and Russia , and moved closer to the United States .",

  "/wiki/Panama": "Panama ( /\u02c8p\u00e6n\u0259m\u0251\u02d0/ ( listen ) PAN-\u0259-mah , /p\u00e6n\u0259\u02c8m\u0251\u02d0/ pan-\u0259-MAH ; Spanish : Panam\u00e1 IPA : [ pana\u02c8ma ] ( listen ) ) , officially the Republic of Panama ( Spanish : Rep\u00fablica de Panam\u00e1 ) , is a transcontinental country in Central America and South America , bordered by Costa Rica to the west , Colombia to the southeast , the Caribbean Sea to the north , and the Pacific Ocean to the south . The capital and largest city is Panama City , whose metropolitan area is home to nearly half the country 's 4 million people . Panama was inhabited by indigenous tribes before Spanish colonists arrived in the 16th century . It broke away from Spain in 1821 and joined the Republic of Gran Colombia , a union of Nueva Granada , Ecuador , and Venezuela . After Gran Colombia dissolved in 1831 , Panama and Nueva Granada eventually became the Republic of Colombia . With the backing of the United States , Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903 , allowing the construction of the Panama Canal to be completed by the US Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914 . The 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties led to the transfer of the Canal from the United States to Panama on December 31 , 1999 . Revenue from canal tolls continues to represent a significant portion of Panama 's GDP , although commerce , banking , and tourism are major and growing sectors . It is regarded as a high-income country . In 2018 Panama ranked 66th in the world in terms of the Human Development Index . In 2018 , Panama was ranked seventh-most competitive economy in Latin America , according to the World Economic Forum 's Global Competitiveness Index . Covering around 40 percent of its land area , Panama 's jungles are home to an abundance of tropical plants and animals - some of them found nowhere else on earth .",
  "/wiki/Soviet_Union": "The Soviet Union , [ b ] officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR or \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 ) , [ c ] was a federal sovereign state in northern Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991 . Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas .",

  "/wiki/HMS_Hussar_(J82)": "HMS Hussar was a Royal Navy Halcyon-class minesweeper of World War II . As the Allied armies advanced following the invasion of Normandy , Hussar , Britomart , Jason and Salamander were assigned to the 1st Minesweeping Flotilla ( 1MF ) clearing Axis minefields north of Normandy to open additional ports to supply the advance . On the afternoon of 27 August 1944 , they were sweeping off Cap d'Antifer in preparation for the battleship Warspite and monitors Erebus and Roberts to engage Le Havre coastal artillery delaying the advance of Canadian troops . The headquarters officer assigning the minesweeping project to 1MF neglected to inform the Flag Officer British Assault Area ( Rear - Admiral Rivett - Carnac ) , who was responsible for defending the invasion beaches from E-boats operating out of Le Havre . 1MF was observed on a southwesterly leg of the minesweeping operation and assumed to be German ships proceeding to attack Allied shipping off the invasion beaches . The Admiral 's staff requested No . 263 Squadron RAF and No . 266 Squadron RAF to attack the presumed enemy ships . The squadrons responded with 16 Typhoons armed with 20 mm cannon and High Explosive 60 lb RP-3 unguided rockets . RAF pilots identified 1MF as apparently friendly shipping , but upon questioning their orders were told the Royal Navy had no ships in the area . In a well-executed attack out of the sun at 13:30 , the Typhoons sank Hussar and Britomart ; and Salamander was damaged far beyond economical repair and written off as a constructive total loss . Eighty-six British sailors were killed and 124 more were injured .",
