  "/wiki/Vijayanagar_dynasty": "The Vijayanagara Empire ( also called Karnata Empire , and the Kingdom of Bisnegar by the Portuguese ) was based in the Deccan Plateau region in South India . It was established in 1336 by Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I of Sangama Dynasty . The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the southern powers to ward off Islamic invasions by the end of the 13th century . It lasted until 1646 , although its power declined after a major military defeat in the Battle of Talikota in 1565 by the combined armies of the Deccan sultanates . The empire is named after its capital city of Vijayanagara , whose ruins surround present day Hampi , now a World Heritage Site in Karnataka , India . The writings of medieval European travelers such as Domingo Paes , Fern\u00e3o Nunes , and Niccol\u00f2 Da Conti , and the literature in local languages provide crucial information about its history . Archaeological excavations at Vijayanagara have revealed the empire 's power and wealth . The empire 's legacy includes many monuments spread over South India , the best known of which is the group at Hampi . Different temple building traditions in South and Central India came together in the Vijayanagara Architecture style . This synthesis inspired architectural innovation in Hindu temples ' construction . Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation . The empire 's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in Kannada , Telugu , Tamil , and Sanskrit , while Carnatic music evolved into its current form .",

The historical meaning of the term Hindu has evolved with time . Starting with the Persian and Greek references to the land of the Indus in the 1st millennium BCE through the texts of the medieval era , the term Hindu implied a geographic , ethnic or cultural identifier for people living in the Indian subcontinent around or beyond the Sindhu ( Indus ) river . By the 16th century , the term began to refer to residents of the subcontinent who were not Turkic or Muslims . [ a ] [ b ] The historical development of Hindu self-identity within the local South Asian population , in a religious or cultural sense , is unclear . Competing theories state that Hindu identity developed in the British colonial era , or that it may have developed post-8th century CE after the Islamic invasion and medieval Hindu-Muslim wars . A sense of Hindu identity and the term Hindu appears in some texts dated between the 13th and 18th century in Sanskrit and Bengali . The 14th- and 18th-century Indian poets such as Vidyapati , Kabir and Eknath used the phrase Hindu dharma ( Hinduism ) and contrasted it with Turaka dharma ( Islam ) . The Christian friar Sebastiao Manrique used the term 'Hindu ' in religious context in 1649 . In the 18th century , the European merchants and colonists began to refer to the followers of Indian religions collectively as Hindus , in contrast to Mohamedans for Mughals and Arabs following Islam .
