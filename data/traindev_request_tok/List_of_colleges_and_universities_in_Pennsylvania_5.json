  "/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism": "Orthodox Judaism is a collective term for the traditionalist branches of contemporary Judaism . Theologically , it is chiefly defined by regarding the Torah , both Written and Oral , as literally revealed by God on Mount Sinai and faithfully transmitted ever since . Orthodox Judaism therefore advocates a strict observance of Jewish Law , or halakha , which is to be interpreted and determined only according to traditional methods and in adherence to the continuum of received precedent through the ages . It regards the entire halakhic system as ultimately grounded in immutable revelation , essentially beyond external and historical influence . More than any theoretical issue , obeying the dietary , purity , ethical , and other laws of halakha is the hallmark of Orthodoxy . Other key doctrines include belief in a future bodily resurrection of the dead , divine reward and punishment for the righteous and the sinners , the Election of Israel as a people bound by a covenant with God , and an eventual Messianic Age ruled by a salvific Messiah-King who will restore the Temple in Jerusalem . Orthodox Judaism is not a centralized denomination . Relations between its different subgroups are sometimes strained , and the exact limits of Orthodoxy are subject to intense debate . Very roughly , it may be divided between Haredi Judaism ( ultra-Orthodox ) , which is more conservative and reclusive , and Modern Orthodox Judaism , which is relatively open to outer society . Each of those is itself formed of independent streams . They are almost uniformly exclusionist , regarding Orthodoxy as the only authentic form of Judaism and rejecting all competing non-Orthodox philosophies as illegitimate . While adhering to traditional beliefs , the movement is a modern phenomenon .",

  "/wiki/Baptist": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and doing so by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or aspersion ) . Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency ( the responsibility and accountability of every person before God ) , sola fide ( salvation by faith alone ) , sola scriptura ( scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice ) and congregationalist church government . Baptists generally recognize two ordinances : baptism and communion . Diverse from their beginning , those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe , how they worship , their attitudes toward other Christians , and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship . Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam , Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law , so that individuals might have freedom of religion . Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the 18th and 19th centuries , the First and Second Great Awakening increased church membership in the United States . Baptist missionaries have spread their faith to every continent .",

  "/wiki/Reformed_Presbyterian_Church_of_North_America": "The Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America ( RPCNA ) is a Presbyterian church with congregations and missions throughout the United States , Canada , and Japan . Its beliefs - formulated via membership in the Reformed Presbyterian Church and RP Global Alliance - place it in the conservative wing of the Reformed family of Protestant churches . Below the Bible - which is held as divinely inspired and without error - the church is committed to several subordinate standards , together considered with its constitution : the Westminster Confession of Faith and Larger and Shorter Catechisms , along with its Testimony , Directory for Church Government , the Book of Discipline , and Directory for Worship . Primary doctrinal distinctions which separate the RPCNA from other Reformed and Presbyterian denominations in North America are : its continued adherence to the historical practice of Reformed Christianity , contained in the Westminster Confession of Faith , of practicing exclusive psalmody , and its continuing affirmation of Jesus as mediatorial king , ruling over all nations . Prior to the 1960s , the RPCNA refused to vote or participate in government in the United States due to it not directly acknowledging Christ 's authority over it , and since has continued ( at some times more heavily than others ) , to lobby the federal government to expressly submit to the authority of Jesus Christ in the U.S. Constitution . The RPCNA has a long history , having been a separate denomination in the United States since colonial days . In Scotland ( where the denomination originated ) , Reformed Presbyterians have been a separate branch since the late 17th century , and prior to that , a part of the original Presbyterian Church of Scotland that came out of the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century . As its name suggests , the RPCNA is governed through the presbyterian system ( which the church considers to be the only divinely-appointed method of church government ) , with each individual congregation being governed by two or more elders . As with most Presbyterian denominations , the RPCNA is divided into several presbyteries , but unlike several other smaller Presbyterian denominations , the supreme governing body is a single synod , not a general assembly . Each congregation may send one ruling elder delegate ( two for larger congregations ) to its presbytery meeting , as well as to the annual Synod meeting . Each minister ( teaching elder ) , whether serving as the pastor of a congregation or not , is automatically a delegate to his presbytery and to the synod .",

The movement originated as a semi-organized stream within Conservative Judaism and developed from the late 1920s to 1940s , before it seceded in 1955 and established a rabbinical college in 1967 . There is substantial theological diversity within the movement . Halakha , the collective body of Jewish Law , is considered normative and binding , but is also an evolving process subject to interpretation in every time period . Kaplan believed that Jewish life [ is ] meaningless without Jewish law. , and one of the planks he wrote for The proto-Reconstructionist Society for the Jewish Renascence stated : We accept the halakha , which is rooted in the Talmud , as the norm of Jewish life , availing ourselves , at the same time , of the method implicit therein to interpret and develop the body of Jewish Law in accordance with the actual conditions and spiritual needs of modern life . The movement also emphasizes positive views toward modernity , and has an approach to Jewish custom which aims toward communal decision-making through a process of education and distillation of values from traditional Jewish sources .",

It is the world 's second-largest religion with over 1.8 billion followers or 24.1% of the world 's population , commonly known as Muslims . Muslims make up a majority of the population in 49 countries . Islam teaches that God is merciful , all-powerful , and unique , and has guided mankind through prophets , revealed scriptures and natural signs . The primary scriptures of Islam are the Quran , believed to be the verbatim word of God , and the teachings and normative examples ( called the sunnah , composed of accounts called hadith ) of Muhammad ( c. 570 - 8 June 632 CE ) . Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before through prophets including Adam , Abraham , Moses and Jesus . Muslims consider the Quran in its Arabic to be the unaltered and final revelation of God . Like other Abrahamic religions , Islam also teaches a final judgment with the righteous rewarded in paradise and unrighteous punished in hell . Religious concepts and practices include the Five Pillars of Islam , which are obligatory acts of worship , and following Islamic law ( sharia ) , which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society , from banking and welfare to women and the environment . The cities of Mecca , Medina and Jerusalem are home to the three holiest sites in Islam . Aside from the theological narrative , Islam is historically believed to have originated in the early 7th century CE in Mecca , and by the 8th century the Umayyad Caliphate extended from Iberia in the west to the Indus River in the east . The Islamic Golden Age refers to the period traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 13th century , during the Abbasid Caliphate , when much of the historically Muslim world was experiencing a scientific , economic and cultural flourishing .",

In 2011 , it had an estimated 84,900 members in the United States . The OCA has its origins in a mission established by eight Russian Orthodox monks in Alaska , then part of Russian America , in 1794 . This grew into a full diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church after the United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867 . By the late 19th century , the Russian Orthodox Church had grown in other areas of the United States due to the arrival of immigrants from areas of Eastern and Central Europe , many of them formerly of the Eastern Catholic Churches ( Greek Catholics ) , and from the Middle East . These immigrants , regardless of nationality or ethnic background , were united under a single North American diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church . After the Bolshevik Revolution , Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow directed all Russian Orthodox churches outside of Russia to govern themselves autonomously . Orthodox churches in America became a self-governing Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in America in 1924 under the leadership of Metropolitan Platon ( Rozhdestvensky ) , popularly called the Metropolia ( from Russian \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u044f ) .

Its hierarchs are part of the Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of the United States of America . Unlike most orthodox jurisdictions in the United States , the OCA does not have an affinity towards any particular foreign nationality , but most OCA members are ethnically Euro-American , and most OCA clergy are those who are born and raised in the United States ."
