Most unique features of the YOG , such as mixed-NOCs teams ( comprising youths from different countries ) and the Culture and Education Programme ( CEP ) , made their debut at the 2010 Games .

The Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee ( SYOGOC ) prepared eighteen competition venues and twelve training venues . The Float @ Marina Bay hosted the opening and closing ceremonies and the Youth Olympic Village was located at Nanyang Technological University ( NTU ) .

Online media , Asian newspapers and 166 television broadcasters provided extensive coverage of the Games .
