  "/wiki/Chess": "Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an 8\u00d78 grid . The game is played by millions of people worldwide . Chess is believed to be derived from the Indian game chaturanga sometime before the 7th century . Chaturanga is also the likely ancestor of the Eastern strategy games xiangqi ( Chinese chess ) , janggi ( Korean chess ) , and shogi ( Japanese chess ) . Chess reached Europe by the 9th century , due to the Umayyad conquest of Hispania . The pieces assumed their current powers in Spain in the late 15th century ; the modern rules were standardized in the 19th century . Play involves no hidden information . Each player begins with 16 pieces : one king , one queen , two rooks , two knights , two bishops , and eight pawns . Each piece type moves differently , with the most powerful being the queen and the least powerful the pawn . The objective is to checkmate [ note 1 ] the opponent 's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture . To this end , a player 's pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent 's pieces , while supporting each other . During the game , play typically involves exchanging pieces for the opponent 's similar pieces , and finding and engineering opportunities to trade advantageously or to get a better position .",

  "/wiki/Kick_Boxing": "Kickboxing is a group of stand-up combat sports based on kicking and punching , historically developed from karate mixed with boxing . Kickboxing is practiced for self-defence , general fitness , or as a contact sport . Japanese kickboxing originated in the late 1950s , with competitions held since then . American kickboxing originated in the 1970s and was brought to prominence in September 1974 , when the Professional Karate Association ( PKA ) held the first World Championships . Historically , kickboxing can be considered a hybrid martial art formed from the combination of elements of various traditional styles . This approach became increasingly popular since the 1970s , and since the 1990s , kickboxing has contributed to the emergence of mixed martial arts via further hybridization with ground fighting techniques from Brazilian jiu-jitsu and folk wrestling . There is no single international governing body . International governing bodies include the World Association of Kickboxing Organizations , World Kickboxing Association , International Sport Karate Association , International Kickboxing Federation , and World Kickboxing Network , among others . Consequently , there is no single kickboxing world championship , and champion titles are issued by individual promotions , such as Glory , SUPERKOMBAT , ONE FC , K-1 and Kunlun Fight among others . Bouts organized under different governing bodies apply different rules , such as allowing the use of knees or clinching , etc .",
