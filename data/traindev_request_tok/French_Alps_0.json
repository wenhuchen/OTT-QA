  "/wiki/Mont_Blanc_Massif": "The Mont Blanc massif ( French : Massif du Mont-Blanc ; Italian : Massiccio del Monte Bianco ) is a mountain range in the Alps , located mostly in France and Italy , but also straddling Switzerland at its northeastern end . It contains eleven major independent summits , each over 4,000 metres ( 13,123 ft ) in height . It is named after Mont Blanc ( 4,808 metres ( 15,774 ft ) ) , the highest point in western Europe and the European Union . Because of its considerable overall altitude , a large proportion of the massif is covered by glaciers , which include the Mer de Glace and the Miage Glacier - the longest glaciers in France and Italy , respectively . The massif forms a watershed between the vast catchments of the rivers Rh\u00f4ne and Po , and a tripoint between France , Italy and Switzerland ; it also marks the border between two climate regions by separating the northern and western Alps from the southern Alps . The mountains of the massif consist mostly of granite and gneiss rocks and at high altitudes the vegetation is an arctic-alpine flora . The valleys that delimit the massif were used as communication routes by the Romans until they left around the 5th century AD . The region remained of some military importance through to the mid-20th century . A peasant farming economy operated within these valleys for many centuries until the glaciers and mountains were discovered by the outside world in the 18th century . Word of these impressive sights began to spread , and Mont Blanc was first climbed in 1786 , marking the start of the sport of mountaineering . The region is now a major tourist destination , drawing in over six million visitors per year . It provides a wide range of opportunities for outdoor recreation and activities such as sight-seeing , hiking , rock climbing , mountaineering and skiing .",

The Mont Blanc massif is popular for outdoor activities like hiking , climbing , trail running and winter sports like skiing , and snowboarding . The three towns and their communes which surround Mont Blanc are Courmayeur in Aosta Valley , Italy ; and Saint-Gervais-les-Bains and Chamonix in Haute-Savoie , France .
