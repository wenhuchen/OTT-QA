  "/wiki/National_Party_(South_Africa)": "The National Party ( NP ) ( Afrikaans : Nasionale Party ) , also known as the Nationalist Party , was a political party in South Africa founded in 1914 and disbanded in 1997 . The party was originally an Afrikaner ethnic nationalist party that promoted Afrikaner interests in South Africa . However in the early 1990s it became a South African civic nationalist party seeking to represent all South Africans . It first became the governing party of the country in 1924 . It was an opposition party during World War II but it returned to power and was again in the government from 4 June 1948 until 9 May 1994 . Beginning in 1948 the party as the governing party of South Africa began implementing its policy of racial segregation , known as apartheid ( the Afrikaans term for separateness ) . Although White-minority rule and racial segregation based on White supremacy were already in existence in South Africa with non-Whites not having voting rights and efforts made to encourage segregation , apartheid intensified the segregation with stern penalties for non-Whites entering into areas designated for Whites-only without having a pass to permit them to do so ( known as the pass laws ) , interracial marriage and sexual relationships were illegal and punishable offences , and blacks faced significant restrictions on property rights . Upon South Africa being condemned in the British Commonwealth for its policies of apartheid , the NP-led government had South Africa leave the Commonwealth , abandon its monarchy led by the British monarch and become an independent republic . During the 1970s and 1980s , the NP-led government faced internal unrest in South Africa and international pressure for accommodation of non-Whites in South Africa . It resulted in policies of granting concessions to the non-White population , while still retaining the apartheid system , such as the creation of Bantustans that were autonomous self-governing Black homelands ( criticized for several of them being broken up into unconnected pieces and that they were still dominated by the White minority South African government ) , removing legal prohibitions on interracial marriage , and legalizing non-White and multiracial political parties ( however the outlawed though very popular African National Congress ( ANC ) , was not legalized due to the government identifying it as a terrorist organization ) . Those identified as Coloureds and Indian South Africans were granted separate legislatures in 1983 alongside the main legislature that represented Whites to provide them self-government while maintaining apartheid , but no such legislature was provided to the Black population as their self-government was to be provided through the Bantustans . The NP-led government began changing laws affected by the apartheid system that had come under heavy domestic and international condemnation such as removing the pass laws , granting Blacks full property rights that ended previous major restrictions on Black ownership of land , and the right to form trade unions .",

  "/wiki/African_National_Congress": "The African National Congress ( ANC ) is the Republic of South Africa 's governing political party . It has been the ruling party of post-apartheid South Africa since the election of Nelson Mandela in the 1994 election , winning every election since then . Cyril Ramaphosa , the incumbent President of South Africa , has served as leader of the ANC since 18 December 2017 . Founded on 8 January 1912 by John Langalibalele Dube in Bloemfontein as the South African Native National Congress ( SANNC ) , its primary mission was to bring all Africans together as one people , to defend their rights and freedoms . This included giving full voting rights to black South Africans and mixed-race South Africans and , from 1948 onwards , to end the system of apartheid introduced by the Nationalist Party government after their election ( by White voters only ) in that year . The ANC originally attempted to use non-violent protests to end apartheid ; however , the Sharpeville massacre in March 1960 , in which 69 black Africans were shot and killed by police and hundreds wounded during a peaceful protest , contributed to deteriorating relations with the South African government . On 8 April 1960 , the administration of Charles Robberts Swart banned the ANC in South Africa . After the ban , the ANC formed the Umkhonto we Sizwe ( Spear of the Nation ) to fight against apartheid utilising guerrilla warfare and sabotage . After 30 years of exiled struggle , during which many ANC members had been imprisoned or forced abroad , the country began its move towards full democracy . On 3 February 1990 , State President F. W. de Klerk lifted the ban on the ANC and released Nelson Mandela from prison on 11 February 1990 . On 17 March 1992 , the apartheid referendum was passed by the white only electorate , removing apartheid and allowing the ANC to run in the 1994 election , which for the first time allowed all South Africans to vote for their national government . Since the 1994 election the ANC has performed better than 55% in all general elections , including the most recent 2019 election .",
