  "/wiki/Fort_de_Cormeilles-en-Parisis": "The Fort de Cormeilles-en-Parisis was constructed between 1874 and 1877 as part of a new plan for the defense of Paris developed by General Raymond Adolphe S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res , near the town of Cormeilles-en-Parisis . During the Franco-Prussian War , German troops had used the hill upon which the fort sits as a spotting and firing location , ideal for the siting of new rifled guns whose range was increased over old-fashioned smooth-bore guns . These weapons could attack Paris from Cormeilles , so a new outer ring of forts had to be built outside the first ring of forts built in 1840-1860 to deny the area to enemy gunners . The S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system was designed as a response to these technological innovations , and to the loss of French territories in Alsace and Lorraine .",
