  "/wiki/Vulture": "A vulture is a scavenging bird of prey . The two types of vultures are the New World vultures , including the Californian and Andean condors , and the Old World vultures , including the birds that are seen scavenging on carcasses of dead animals on African plains . Some traditional Old World vultures ( including the bearded vulture ) are not closely related to the others , which is why the vultures are to be subdivided into three taxa rather than two . New World vultures are found in North and South America ; Old World vultures are found in Europe , Africa , and Asia , meaning that between the two groups , vultures are found on every continent except Australia and Antarctica ( though Trigonoceps vultures have crossed the Wallace line ) . A particular characteristic of many vultures is a bald head , devoid of normal feathers . Although it has been historically believed to help keep the head clean when feeding , the bare skin may play an important role in thermoregulation . Vultures have been observed to hunch their bodies and tuck in their heads in the cold , and open their wings and stretch their necks in the heat . Vultures also use urine as a way to keep themselves cool by urinating on themselves . A group of vultures is called a kettle , committee or wake . The term kettle refers to vultures in flight , while committee refers to vultures resting on the ground or in trees . Wake is reserved for a group of vultures that are feeding . The word Geier ( taken from the German language ) does not have a precise meaning in ornithology ; it is occasionally used to refer to a vulture in English , as in some poetry .",

  "/wiki/Condorito": "Condorito ( Little Condor in Spanish ) is a Chilean comic book and comic strip that features an anthropomorphic condor living in a fictitious town named Pelotillehue - a typical small Chilean provincial town . He is meant to be a representation of the Chilean people . Condorito was created by the Chilean cartoonist Ren\u00e9 R\u00edos , known as Pepo . Despite his Chilean origin , Condorito is very popular throughout Latin America , where the character is considered part of the general popular culture . [ citation needed ] Condorito and his friends appear in a daily comic strip . The structure of Condorito is very simple : each page is an independent joke , without any continuity with others ( though some jokes are larger or shorter than one page ) . Some of the details included in the artwork are gender-dependent , but the humor is usually couched in double-entendres that children would be unlikely to understand . One peculiar characteristic of Condorito is that the character that goes through the embarrassing moment and/or serves as the butt of the joke in a given strip almost always falls backwards to the floor ( legs visible or out of frame ) in the final panel , although new comic strips have now put the victim of the joke looking at the reader instead . This classic comic strip flop take is accompanied by a free-fall onomatopoeic sound ( usually \u00a1Plop ! ) . From time to time , this is replaced by the victim of the joke saying \u00a1Exijo una explicaci\u00f3n ! ( I demand an explanation ! ) , usually as a twist or downbeat ending .",
  "/wiki/Andean_condor": "The Andean condor ( Vultur gryphus ) is a South American bird in the New World vulture family Cathartidae and is the only member of the genus Vultur . Found in the Andes mountains and adjacent Pacific coasts of western South America , the Andean condor is the largest flying bird in the world by combined measurement of weight and wingspan . It has a maximum wingspan of 3.3 m ( 10 ft 10 in ) exceeded only by the wingspans of four seabirds and water birds - the roughly 3.5 m ( 11 ft 6 in ) maximum of the wandering albatross , southern royal albatross , great white pelican and Dalmatian pelican . It is a large black vulture with a ruff of white feathers surrounding the base of the neck and , especially in the male , large white patches on the wings . The head and neck are nearly featherless , and are a dull red color , which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird 's emotional state . In the male , there is a wattle on the neck and a large , dark red comb or caruncle on the crown of the head . Unlike most birds of prey , the male is larger than the female . The condor is primarily a scavenger , feeding on carrion . It prefers large carcasses , such as those of deer or cattle . It reaches sexual maturity at five or six years of age and nests at elevations of up to 5,000 m ( 16,000 ft ) , generally on inaccessible rock ledges . One or two eggs are usually laid . It is one of the world 's longest-living birds , with a lifespan of over 70 years in some cases .",

  "/wiki/Merlin_(bird)": "The merlin was described and illustrated by the English naturalist Mark Catesby ( as the pigeon hawk ) in his Natural history of Carolina , Florida and the Bahama Islands published in 1729-1732 . Based on this description , in 1758 Carl Linnaeus included the species in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae and introduced the present binomial name Falco columbarius with the type locality as America . The genus name is Late Latin ; falco derives from falx , falcis , a sickle , referring to the claws of the bird . The species name columbarius is Latin for of doves from columba , dove . Thirteen years after Linnaeus 's description Marmaduke Tunstall recognized the Eurasian birds as a distinct taxon Falco aesalon in his Ornithologica Britannica . If two species of merlins are recognized , the Old World birds would thus bear the scientific name F. aesalon . The name merlin is derived from Old French esmerillon via Anglo-Norman merilun or meriliun . There are related Germanic words derived through older forms such as Middle Dutch smeerle , Old High German smerle and Old Icelandic smyrill . Wycliffe 's Bible , around 1382 , mentions An Egle , & agriffyn , & a merlyon . The species was once known as 'pigeon hawk ' in North America .",
