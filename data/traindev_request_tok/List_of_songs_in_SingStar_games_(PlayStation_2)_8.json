  "/wiki/Big_Star": "Big Star was an American rock band formed in Memphis , Tennessee , in 1971 by Alex Chilton , Chris Bell , Jody Stephens , and Andy Hummel . The group broke up in early 1975 , and reorganized with a new lineup 18 years later following a reunion concert at the University of Missouri . In its first era , the band 's musical style drew on the Beatles , the Rolling Stones , and the Byrds . Big Star produced a style that foreshadowed the alternative rock of the 1980s and 1990s . Before they broke up , Big Star created a seminal body of work that never stopped inspiring succeeding generations , in the words of Rolling Stone , as the quintessential American power pop band , and one of the most mythic and influential cult acts in all of rock & roll . Big Star 's first album - 1972 's # 1 Record - was met by enthusiastic reviews , but ineffective marketing by Stax Records , and limited distribution stunted its commercial success . Frustration took its toll on band relations : Bell left not long after the first record 's commercial progress stalled , and Hummel left to finish his college education after a second album , Radio City , was completed in December 1973 . Like # 1 Record , Radio City received excellent reviews , but label issues again thwarted sales - Columbia Records , which had assumed control of the Stax catalog , likewise effectively vetoed its distribution . After a third album , recorded in the fall of 1974 , was deemed commercially unviable and shelved before receiving a title , the band broke up late in 1974 . Four years later , the first two Big Star LPs were released together in the UK as a double album . The band 's third album was finally issued soon afterward ; titled Third/Sister Lovers , it found limited commercial success , but has since become a cult classic . Shortly thereafter , Chris Bell was killed in a car accident at the age of 27 .",
