This is the first time in Olympic history that the 50 kilometre race is run as a mass start , where all skiers start at the same time , and the winner of the race is the first to cross the finish line . This is unlike the individual start , where skiers start one by one at 30-second intervals , and the winner is the skier whoever runs the distance the fastest . The 50 kilometre had previously been skied only once as a mass start event at the World Championships , in 2005 , with Frode Estil of Norway winning . However , that was in the classical style . The last 50 kilometre freestyle race at a World Championship was in 2003 , and Martin Koukal of the Czech Republic won that event . Mikhail Ivanov of Russia was defending Olympic champion on 50 kilometre , but that event was held in classical technique with individual start . The last Olympic mass start race in 2002 , won by Christian Hoffmann of Austria , was a shorter 30 kilometre event . With a pack of 10-15 skiers coming together towards the finish , Giorgio Di Centa won Italy 's second gold medal in cross-country skiing . This was the closest Olympic 50 km ever ( 0.8 seconds ) , eclipsing the 4.9 seconds that separated Thomas Wassberg from Gunde Svan ( both from Sweden ) at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo .
