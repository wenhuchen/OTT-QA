  "/wiki/American_Football_League": "The American Football League ( AFL ) was a major professional American football league that operated for ten seasons from 1960 until 1969 , when it merged with the older National Football League ( NFL ) , and became the American Football Conference . The upstart AFL operated in direct competition with the more established NFL throughout its existence . It was more successful than earlier rivals to the NFL with the same name , the 1926 , 1936 and 1940 leagues , and the later All-America Football Conference ( which existed between 1944 and 1950 but only played between 1946 and 1949 ) . This fourth version of the AFL was the most successful , created by a number of owners who had been refused NFL expansion franchises or had minor shares of NFL franchises . The AFL 's original lineup consisted of an Eastern division of the New York Titans , Boston Patriots , Buffalo Bills , and the Houston Oilers , and a Western division of the Los Angeles Chargers , Denver Broncos , Oakland Raiders , and Dallas Texans . The league first gained attention by signing 75% of the NFL 's first-round draft choices in 1960 , including Houston 's successful signing of college star and Heisman Trophy winner Billy Cannon . While the first years of the AFL saw uneven competition and low attendance , the league was buttressed by a generous television contract with the American Broadcasting Company ( ABC ) ( followed by a contract with the competing National Broadcasting Company ( NBC ) for games starting with the 1965 season ) that broadcast the more offense-oriented football league nationwide . Continuing to attract top talent from colleges and the NFL by the mid-1960s , as well as successful franchise shifts of the Chargers from L.A. south to San Diego and the Texans north to Kansas City ( becoming the Kansas City Chiefs ) , the AFL established a dedicated following . The transformation of the struggling Titans into the New York Jets under new ownership further solidified the league 's reputation among the major media . As fierce competition made player salaries skyrocket in both leagues , especially after a series of raids , the leagues agreed to a merger in 1966 . Among the conditions were a common draft and a championship game played between the two league champions first played in early 1967 , which would eventually become known as the Super Bowl . The AFL and NFL operated as separate leagues until 1970 , with separate regular season and playoff schedules except for the championship game .",
  "/wiki/Boston_Patriots": "The New England Patriots are a professional American football team based in the Greater Boston area . The Patriots compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member club of the league 's American Football Conference ( AFC ) East division . The team plays its home games at Gillette Stadium in the town of Foxborough , Massachusetts , which is located 28 miles ( 45 km ) southwest of Boston , Massachusetts . The Patriots are also headquartered at Gillette Stadium . Founded in 1959 as the Boston Patriots , an original member of the American Football League ( AFL ) , the team joined the NFL in the leagues ' 1970 merger , then changed its name when it moved to Foxborough in 1971 . The New England Patriots played their home games at Foxboro Stadium through 2001 , then moved to Gillette Stadium at the start of the 2002 season . The Patriots ' rivalry with the New York Jets is considered one of the most bitter rivalries in the NFL . Since the arrival of head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady in 2000 , the Patriots have become one of the most successful teams in NFL history , claiming 16 AFC East titles as part of 18 consecutive winning seasons since 2001 . The franchise has since set numerous notable records , including most wins in a ten-year period ( 126 , in 2003-2012 ) , an undefeated 16-game regular season in 2007 , the longest winning streak consisting of regular season and playoff games in NFL history ( a 21-game streak from October 2003 to October 2004 ) , and the most consecutive division titles won by a team in NFL history ( eleven straight division titles from 2009 to 2019 ) .

  "/wiki/American_Football_League_Players_Association": "The National Football League Players Association , or NFLPA , is the labor organization representing the professional American football players in the National Football League ( NFL ) . The NFLPA , which has headquarters in Washington , D.C. , is led by president Eric Winston and executive director DeMaurice Smith . Founded in 1956 , the NFLPA is the second-oldest labor union of the four major professional sports leagues ; it was established to provide players with formal representation to negotiate compensation and the terms of a collective bargaining agreement ( CBA ) . The NFLPA is a member of the AFL-CIO , the largest federation of unions in the United States . In the early years of the NFL , contractual negotiations took place between individual players and management ; team owners were reluctant to engage in collective bargaining . A series of strikes and lockouts have occurred throughout the union 's existence largely due to monetary and benefit disputes between the players and the owners . League rules that punished players for playing in rival football leagues resulted in litigation ; the success of such lawsuits impelled the NFL to negotiate some work rules and minimum payments with the NFLPA . However , the organization was not recognized by the NFL as the official bargaining agent for the players until 1968 , when a CBA was signed . The most recent CBA negotiations took place in 2011 . In addition to conducting labor negotiations , the NFLPA represents and protects the rights of the players ; the organization 's actions include filing grievances against player discipline that it deems too severe . The union also ensures that the terms of the collective bargaining agreement are adhered to by the league and the teams . It negotiates and monitors retirement and insurance benefits and enhances and defends the image of players and their profession .",
