The name comes from the Cree or Innu term kaniapiskau or kaneapiskak which means rocky point or place where there is a rocky point . Albert Peter Low had noted in 1895 that a high rocky headland jutts into the lake . He probably referred to the northwest facing peninsula that gives the reservoir the shape of an arc as we know it now . In the 19th century , Lake Caniapiscau was frequented by hunters and fur traders . In 1834 , the Hudson 's Bay Company opened there an outpost to link its facilities in the James Bay region with those of Ungava Bay . The Kaniapiskau Post closed its doors in 1870 .",
