Palmerston dominated British foreign policy during the period 1830 to 1865 , when Britain was at the height of its imperial power . He held office almost continuously from 1807 until his death in 1865 . He began his parliamentary career as a Tory , defected to the Whigs in 1830 , and became the first Prime Minister of the newly formed Liberal Party in 1859 . Palmerston succeeded to his father 's Irish peerage in 1802 . He became a Tory MP in 1807 ( his Irish peerage did not bar him from a seat in the House of Commons , because it did not entitle him to a seat in the House of Lords ) . From 1809 to 1828 he served as Secretary at War , in which post he was responsible for the organisation of the finances of the army . He first attained Cabinet rank in 1827 , when George Canning became Prime Minister , but , like other Canningites , he resigned from office one year later . He served as Foreign Secretary 1830-34 , 1835-41 , and 1846-51 . In this office , Palmerston responded effectively to a series of conflicts in Europe . His belligerent actions as Foreign Secretary , some of which were highly controversial , have been considered to be prototypes of the practice of liberal interventionism .
