Blyton 's books are still enormously popular , and have been translated into 90 languages . She wrote on a wide range of topics including education , natural history , fantasy , mystery , and biblical narratives and is best remembered today for her Noddy , Famous Five and Secret Seven series . Her first book , Child Whispers , a 24-page collection of poems , was published in 1922 . Following the commercial success of her early novels such as Adventures of the Wishing-Chair ( 1937 ) and The Enchanted Wood ( 1939 ) , Blyton went on to build a literary empire , sometimes producing fifty books a year in addition to her prolific magazine and newspaper contributions . Her writing was unplanned and sprang largely from her unconscious mind : she typed her stories as events unfolded before her . The sheer volume of her work and the speed with which it was produced led to rumours that Blyton employed an army of ghost writers , a charge she vigorously denied . Blyton 's work became increasingly controversial among literary critics , teachers and parents from the 1950s onwards , because of the alleged unchallenging nature of her writing and the themes of her books , particularly the Noddy series . Some libraries and schools banned her works , which the BBC had refused to broadcast from the 1930s until the 1950s because they were perceived to lack literary merit . Her books have been criticised as being elitist , sexist , racist , xenophobic and at odds with the more liberal environment emerging in post-war Britain , but they have continued to be best-sellers since her death in 1968 . Blyton felt she had a responsibility to provide her readers with a strong moral framework , so she encouraged them to support worthy causes . In particular , through the clubs she set up or supported , she encouraged and organised them to raise funds for animal and paediatric charities .",

  "/wiki/Harold_Bride": "Harold Sydney Bride ( 11 January 1890 - 29 April 1956 ) was a British sailor and the junior wireless officer on the ocean liner RMS Titanic during its ill-fated maiden voyage . After the Titanic struck an iceberg at 11:40 pm 14 April 1912 , Bride and his senior colleague Jack Phillips were responsible for relaying CQD messages to ships in the vicinity , which led to the survivors being picked up by the RMS Carpathia . The men remained at their posts until the ship 's power was almost completely out . Bride was washed off the ship as the boat deck flooded , but managed to scramble onto the upturned lifeboat Collapsible ' B ' , and was rescued by the Carpathia later in the morning . Despite being injured , he helped Harold Cottam , the Carpathia 's wireless operator and a personal friend of his , transmit survivor lists and personal messages from the ship .",
  "/wiki/RMS_Titanic": "RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner operated by the White Star Line that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of April 15 , 1912 , after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City . Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard , more than 1,500 died , making the sinking one of modern history 's deadliest peacetime commercial marine disasters . RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time she entered service and was the second of three Olympic-class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line . She was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast . Thomas Andrews , chief naval architect of the shipyard at the time , died in the disaster . Titanic was under the command of Capt . Edward Smith , who also went down with the ship . The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest people in the world , as well as hundreds of emigrants from Great Britain and Ireland , Scandinavia and elsewhere throughout Europe , who were seeking a new life in the United States . The first-class accommodation was designed to be the pinnacle of comfort and luxury , with a gymnasium , swimming pool , libraries , high-class restaurants and opulent cabins . A high-powered radiotelegraph transmitter was available for sending passenger marconigrams and for the ship 's operational use . Although Titanic had advanced safety features , such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors , it only carried enough lifeboats for 1,178 people - about half the number on board , and one third of her total capacity - due to outdated maritime safety regulations . The ship carried 16 lifeboat davits which could lower three lifeboats each , for a total of 48 boats .",
