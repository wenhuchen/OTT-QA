During the 1990s , Boyz II Men found fame on Motown Records as a quartet including bass Michael McCary , who left the group in 2003 due to multiple sclerosis . During the 1990s , Boyz II Men gained international success . This began with the release of top 5 singles Motownphilly and It 's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday in 1991 , followed by the number one single End of the Road in 1992 , which reached the top of charts worldwide . End of the Road set a new record for longevity , staying at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for thirteen weeks , breaking the decades-old record held by Elvis Presley . Boyz II Men proceeded to break this record with the subsequent releases of I 'll Make Love to You and One Sweet Day ( with Mariah Carey ) , which , at fourteen and sixteen weeks respectively , each set new records for the total number of weeks at number one . I 'll Make Love to You also topped the charts in Australia ( for four weeks ) and garnered international success . Consequently , Boyz II Men is among the music industry 's elite with regard to time spent at number one in Billboard history with 50 cumulative weeks , ranking fourth behind Presley , The Beatles , and Carey . Furthermore , when On Bended Knee took the number one spot away from I 'll Make Love to You , Boyz II Men became only the third artists ever ( after The Beatles and Presley ) to replace themselves at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 . These achievements were enough to earn Boyz II Men recognition as Billboard magazine 's biggest boy band during the period of 1987 to 2012 . Boyz II Men continue to perform worldwide , as a trio .",

Like when recording 21 , Adele worked with producer and songwriter Paul Epworth and Ryan Tedder , along with new collaborations with Max Martin and Shellback , Greg Kurstin , Danger Mouse , the Smeezingtons , Samuel Dixon , and Tobias Jesso Jr . Upon its release , 25 received generally positive reviews from critics , who commended Adele 's vocal performance and the album 's production .

As pioneers in recording , songwriting and artistic presentation , the group revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era 's youth and sociocultural movements . Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney , the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960 , initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass . The core trio of Lennon , McCartney and Harrison , together since 1958 , went through a succession of drummers , including Pete Best , before asking Starr to join them in 1962 . Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings , greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit , Love Me Do , in late 1962 . As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed Beatlemania , the band acquired the nickname the Fab Four , with Epstein , Martin and other members of the band 's entourage sometimes given the informal title of fifth Beatle .
