  "/wiki/Henry_de_Beaumont": "Henry de Beaumont ( before 1280 - 10 March 1340 ) , jure uxoris 4th Earl of Buchan and suo jure 1st Baron Beaumont , was a key figure in the Anglo-Scots wars of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries , known as the Wars of Scottish Independence . Henry de Beaumont was a veteran campaigner who participated in every major engagement , from the Battle of Falkirk in 1298 to the Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333 . Although not now a widely known figure , he was , nevertheless , of considerable military and political importance . His long experience of the Scottish wars led him to develop a battle technique later used to great effect at Cr\u00e9cy and Agincourt . As one of a group of Anglo-Scots nobles known as the 'disinherited ' - those who had fought against King Robert Bruce - he was to do much to overturn the peace between England and Scotland established by the Treaty of Northampton and bring about a Second War of Scottish Independence . By his marriage shortly before 14 July 1310 to Alice Comyn , Countess of Buchan ( died 3 July 1349 ) , the niece and heir of John Comyn , Earl of Buchan , he was recognised as Earl in right of his wife .",
