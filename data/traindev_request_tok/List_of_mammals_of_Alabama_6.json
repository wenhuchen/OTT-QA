  "/wiki/Eastern_chipmunk": "The eastern chipmunk ( Tamias striatus ) is a chipmunk species found in eastern North America . It is the only living member of the chipmunk subgenus Tamias , sometimes recognised as a separate genus .

The squirrel family includes tree squirrels , ground squirrels , chipmunks , marmots ( including groundhogs ) , flying squirrels , and prairie dogs amongst other rodents . Squirrels are indigenous to the Americas , Eurasia , and Africa , and were introduced by humans to Australia .

  "/wiki/Groundhog": "The groundhog ( Marmota monax ) , also known as a woodchuck , is a rodent of the family Sciuridae , belonging to the group of large ground squirrels known as marmots . It was first scientifically described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 . The groundhog is also referred to as a chuck , wood-shock , groundpig , whistlepig , whistler , thickwood badger , Canada marmot , monax , moonack , weenusk , red monk and , among French Canadians in eastern Canada , siffleux . The name thickwood badger was given in the Northwest to distinguish the animal from the prairie badger . Monax ( M\u00f3onack ) is an Algonquian name of the woodchuck , which meant digger ( cf . Lenape monachgeu ) . Young groundhogs may be called chucklings . :66 Other marmots , such as the yellow-bellied and hoary marmots , live in rocky and mountainous areas , but the groundhog is a lowland creature . It is found through much of the eastern United States across Canada and into Alaska .",

They are commonly known for their extensive tunneling activities and their ability to destroy farms and gardens . The name pocket gopher on its own may be used to refer to any of a number of genera within the Geomyidae family . These are the true gophers , but several ground squirrels in the distantly related Sciuridae family are often called gophers , as well . The origin of the word 'gopher ' is uncertain ; French gaufre , meaning 'waffle ' , has been suggested , on account of the gopher tunnels resembling the honeycomb-like pattern of holes in a waffle ; another suggestion is that the word is of Muskogean origin .",
  "/wiki/North_American_beaver": "The North American beaver ( Castor canadensis ) is one of two extant beaver species . It is native to North America and introduced in South America ( Patagonia ) and Europe ( primarily Finland and Karelia ) . In the United States and Canada , the species is often referred to simply as beaver , though this causes some confusion because another distantly related rodent , Aplodontia rufa , is often called the mountain beaver . Other vernacular names , including American beaver and Canadian beaver , distinguish this species from the other extant beaver species , Castor fiber , which is native to Eurasia .

  "/wiki/Marsh_rice_rat": "The marsh rice rat ( Oryzomys palustris ) is a semiaquatic North American rodent in the family Cricetidae . It usually occurs in wetland habitats , such as swamps and salt marshes . It is found mostly in the eastern and southern United States , from New Jersey and Kansas south to Florida and northeasternmost Tamaulipas , Mexico ; its range previously extended further west and north , where it may have been a commensal in corn-cultivating communities . Weighing about 40 to 80 g ( 1.4 to 2.8 oz ) , the marsh rice rat is a medium-sized rodent that resembles the common black and brown rat . The upperparts are generally gray-brown , but are reddish in many Florida populations . The feet show several specializations for life in the water . The skull is large and flattened , and is short at the front . John Bachman discovered the marsh rice rat in 1816 , and it was formally described in 1837 . Several subspecies have been described since the 1890s , mainly from Florida , but disagreement exists over their validity . The Florida Keys population is sometimes classified as a different species , the silver rice rat ( Oryzomys argentatus ) . Data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene indicate a deep divergence between populations east of Mississippi and those further west , which suggests that the western populations may be recognized as a separate species , Oryzomys texensis . The species is part of the genus Oryzomys , which also includes several others occurring further south in Mexico , Central America , and northwestern South America , some of which have previously been regarded as subspecies of the marsh rice rat .",

It is found in the southeastern United States on sandy beaches , in corn and cotton fields , and in hedge rows and open timber tracts . Coloration varies with geographic location ; inland populations are generally fawn-colored , while coastal populations are lighter or white . The mouse eats seeds , fruits , and occasionally insects , and lives and raises its three to four young ( at a time ) in a simple burrow . Weaning occurs at 20-25 days , and females may mate at 30 days of age . Predators are those that prey on small mammals . One individual lived in captivity for about five years . The mouse is of least concern to conservationists because it is abundant and widespread , and no major threats exist for the species as a whole , but several subspecies with small distributions are endangered or even extinct .",
  "/wiki/Alabama_beach_mouse": "The Alabama beach mouse ( Peromyscus polionotus ammobates ) is a federally endangered species which lives along the Alabama coast . The range of the Alabama beach mouse historically included much of the Fort Morgan Peninsula on the Alabama Gulf coast and extends from Ono Island to Fort Morgan . Coastal residential and commercial development and roadway construction have fragmented and destroyed habitat used by this species . Hurricanes , tropical storms , and dune use by pedestrians have also damaged or destroyed sand dunes and related habitats . Stalking by domestic and wild cats , as well as other animals , plus competition from other rodents have also contributed to Alabama beach mouse declines .",
