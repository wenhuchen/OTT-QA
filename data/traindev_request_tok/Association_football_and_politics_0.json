The constitution of Iceland provides for six electoral constituencies with the possibility of an increase to seven . The constituency boundaries and the number of seats allocated to each constituency are fixed by legislation . No constituency can be represented by fewer than six seats . Furthermore , each party with more than 5% of the national vote is allocated seats based on its proportion of the national vote in order that the number of members in parliament for each political party should be more or less proportional to its overall electoral support . If the number of voters represented by each member of the Althing in one constituency would be less than half of the comparable ratio in another constituency , the Icelandic National Electoral Commission is tasked with altering the allocation of seats to reduce that difference .",

Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization .

It is approximately 1,070 km ( 665 mi ) east-southeast of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina ; 1,236 km ( 768 mi ) south of Cape Sable Island , Nova Scotia ; and 1,759 km ( 1,093 mi ) northeast of Cuba .

As of July 2018 , it has a population of 71,176 , making it the most populous of the British overseas territories . Bermuda 's largest economic sectors are offshore insurance , reinsurance , and tourism . Bermuda had one of the world 's highest GDP per capita for most of the 20th century . It has a subtropical climate and lies in the hurricane belt and thus is prone to related severe weather ; however , it is somewhat protected by a coral reef and by its position at the north of the belt , which limits the direction and severity of approaching storms .",

  "/wiki/New_York_Cosmos_(1971\u20131985)": "The New York Cosmos ( simply the Cosmos in 1977-1978 ) was an American professional soccer club based in New York City and its suburbs . The team played home games in three stadiums around New York before moving in 1977 to Giants Stadium , East Rutherford , New Jersey , where it remained for the rest of its history . Founded in December 1970 , the team competed in the North American Soccer League ( NASL ) until 1984 and was the strongest franchise in that league , both competitively and financially - based largely around its backing by Warner Communications President Steve Ross , which enabled it to sign internationally famous stars such as the Brazilian forward Pel\u00e9 , Italian striker Giorgio Chinaglia and the West German sweeper Franz Beckenbauer . The acquisition of these foreign players , particularly Pel\u00e9 , made the Cosmos into what Gavin Newsham called the most glamorous team in world football , and contributed to the development of soccer across the United States , a country where it had previously been largely ignored . As the Cosmos declined following Pel\u00e9 's retirement , so did the NASL . Attendances fell , the league 's television deal was lost , and it finally folded in 1985 after playing its last season in 1984 . The Cosmos attempted to continue operations in the Major Indoor Soccer League , but attendances were so low that the club withdrew without completing a season . The team attempted an independent schedule in 1985 , but also cancelled that because of low attendance . The Cosmos folded , though the team 's youth camps continued to operate under the Cosmos name and label , run by the franchise 's former general manager , G. Peppe Pinton . The Cosmos name remained very well known , even after it stopped competing . Numerous attempts were made to revive it during the 1990s and 2000s , most notably as a Major League Soccer ( MLS ) club . Seeking to retain the Cosmos ' heritage , Pinton refused to sell the name and image rights , believing that MLS would not honor them .",
