Fox , an American anthropologist of the National Museum of the Philippines , on May 28 , 1962 . These remains , the fossilized fragments of a skull of a female and the jawbones of three individuals , were believed to be the earliest human remains known in the Philippines , which date back to 16,500 years ago , until a metatarsal from the Callao Man discovered in 2007 was dated in 2010 by uranium-series dating as being 67,000 years old . However , some scientists think additional evidence is necessary to confirm those fossils as a new species , rather than a locally adapted population of other Homo populations , such as H. erectus or Denisovan . The Tabon fragments are named after the Tabon Caves , where they were found on the west coast of Palawan . The cave complex appears to have been a kind of Stone Age factory , with both finished stone flake tools and waste core flakes having been found at four separate levels in the main chamber . Charcoal left from three assemblages of cooking fires there has been Carbon-14-dated to roughly 7000 , 20,000 , and 22,000 BCE .

The Tabon tibia fragment , a bone from the lower leg , was found during the re-excavation of the Tabon Cave complex by the National Museum of the Philippines .",
