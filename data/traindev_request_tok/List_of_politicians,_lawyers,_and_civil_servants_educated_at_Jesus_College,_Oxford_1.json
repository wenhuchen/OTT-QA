The House is almost always dissolved earlier , usually alone but sometimes in a double dissolution of both Houses . Elections for members of the House of Representatives are often held in conjunction with those for the Senate . A member of the House may be referred to as a Member of Parliament ( MP or Member ) , while a member of the Senate is usually referred to as a Senator . The government of the day and by extension the Prime Minister must achieve and maintain the confidence of this House in order to gain and remain in power . The House of Representatives currently consists of 151 members , elected by and representing single member districts known as electoral divisions ( commonly referred to as electorates or seats ) . The number of members is not fixed but can vary with boundary changes resulting from electoral redistributions , which are required on a regular basis . The most recent overall increase in the size of the House , which came into effect at the 1984 election , increased the number of members from 125 to 148 . It reduced to 147 at the 1993 election , returned to 148 at the 1996 election , has been 150 since the 2001 election , and has increased to 151 at the 2019 Australian federal election .

These representatives meet at Parliament House in Canberra to discuss legislation and make laws for the benefit of the nation . The issues that they can make laws on are defined by sections 51 and 122 of the Constitution . The Parliament of the Commonwealth comprises two separate chambers : the House of Representatives ( or 'the lower house ' ) and the Senate ( or 'the upper house ' ) . The House of Representatives has 151 members , each representing a different area of the country ( 'electorate ' ) . Each electorate has roughly the same number of registered voters within its boundary , meaning that states with larger populations have more electorates and therefore more representatives in the House . The Senate is composed of 76 members . Unlike the House of Representatives , membership of the Senate is divided evenly between the states . Each state has 12 senators , and the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory have 2 senators each . The Senate was established this way to ensure that the larger states could not use their majority in the House of Representatives to pass laws that disadvantaged the smaller states .",

  "/wiki/United_States_Republican_Party": "The Republican Party , also referred to as the GOP ( Grand Old Party ) , is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States ; the other is its historic rival , the Democratic Party . The GOP was founded in 1854 by opponents of the Kansas-Nebraska Act , which allowed for the potential expansion of slavery into certain U.S. territories . The party supported classical liberalism , opposed the expansion of slavery , and supported economic reform . Abraham Lincoln was the first Republican president . Under the leadership of Lincoln and a Republican Congress , slavery was banned in the United States in 1865 . The Party was generally dominant during the Third Party System and the Fourth Party System . After 1912 , the Party underwent an ideological shift to the right . Following the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the party 's core base shifted , with Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics . The party 's 21st-century base of support includes people living in rural areas , men , people without college degrees , the elderly , white Americans , and evangelical Christians . The 21st-century Republican Party ideology is American conservatism , which incorporates both economic policies and social values . The GOP supports lower taxes , free market capitalism , restrictions on immigration , increased military spending , gun rights , restrictions on abortion , deregulation and restrictions on labor unions . After the Supreme Court 's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade , the Republican Party opposed abortion in its party platform and grew its support among evangelicals .",
  "/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives": "The United States House of Representatives is the lower house of the United States Congress , the Senate being the upper house . Together they compose the national legislature of the United States . The composition of the House is established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The House is composed of representatives who sit in congressional districts that are allocated to each of the 50 states on a basis of population as measured by the U.S. Census , with each district entitled to one representative . Since its inception in 1789 , all representatives have been directly elected . The total number of voting representatives is fixed by law at 435 . As of the 2010 Census , the largest delegation is that of California , with fifty-three representatives . Seven states have only one representative : Alaska , Delaware , Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota , Vermont , and Wyoming . The House is charged with the passage of federal legislation , known as bills , which , after concurrence by the Senate , are sent to the president for consideration . In addition to this basic power , the House has certain exclusive powers , among them the power to initiate all bills related to revenue ; the impeachment of federal officers , who are sent to trial before the Senate ; and , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for president , the duty falls upon the House to elect one of the top three recipients of electors for that office , with one vote given to each state for that purpose . The House meets in the south wing of the United States Capitol . The presiding officer is the speaker of the House , who is elected by the members thereof ( and is therefore traditionally the leader of the controlling party ) .",
