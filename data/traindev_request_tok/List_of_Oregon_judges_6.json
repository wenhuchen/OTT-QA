  "/wiki/Senior_status": "Senior status is a form of semi-retirement for United States federal judges and judges in some state court systems . To qualify , a judge must be at least 65 years of age , and the combination of the judge 's age and years of service in federal courts must be at least 80 years .

Additionally , senior judges do not occupy seats ; instead , their seats become vacant , and the president may appoint new full-time judges to fill their spots . Depending on how heavy a caseload they carry , senior judges remain entitled to maintain a staffed office , including a secretary and one or more law clerks . States having a similar system include Iowa ( for judges on the Iowa Court of Appeals ) , Pennsylvania , and Virginia ( for Justices of the Virginia Supreme Court ) . In the United Kingdom , retired Justices of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and certain other retired senior British judges may , at the request of the President of the Supreme Court , sit as acting judges on a supplementary panel of the Court , provided that they are below the age of 75 at the time of the request .",

  "/wiki/Recess_appointment": "In the United States , a recess appointment is an appointment by the President of a federal official when the U.S. Senate is in recess . Under the U.S. Constitution 's Appointments Clause , the president is empowered to nominate , and with the advice and consent ( confirmation ) of the United States Senate , make appointments to high-level policy-making positions in federal departments , agencies , boards , and commissions . A recess appointment under Article II , Section 2 , Clause 3 of the Constitution is an alternative method of appointing officials that allows the filling of vacancies to maintain the continuity of administrative government through the temporary filling of offices during periods when the Senate is not in session . On occasion , and controversially , this power has also been used by presidents to temporarily install an unpopular nominee by sidestepping the Senate 's role in the confirmation process , and the Senate has taken measures from time to time to prevent a President making recess appointments . A recess appointment must be confirmed by the Senate by the end of the next session of Congress , or the appointment expires . In current practice this means that a recess appointment must be approved by roughly the end of the next calendar year , and thus could last for almost two years .",

  "/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Claims": "The Court of Claims was a federal court that heard claims against the United States government . It was established in 1855 , renamed in 1948 to the United States Court of Claims ( 67 Stat . 226 ) , and abolished in 1982 . Then , its jurisdiction was assumed by the newly created United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and United States Claims Court ( 96 Stat . 25 ) , which was later renamed the Court of Federal Claims . Before the Court of Claims was established , monetary claims against the federal government were normally submitted through petitions to Congress . By the time of the Court 's creation , the workload had become unwieldy so Congress gave the Court jurisdiction to hear all monetary claims based upon a law , a regulation , or a federal government contract . The Court was required to report its findings to Congress and to prepare bills for payments to claimants whose petitions were approved by the Court . Since only Congress was constitutionally empowered to make appropriations , Congress still had to approve the bills and reports , but it usually did so pro forma . The Court originally had three judges , who were given lifetime appointments . The judges were authorized to appoint commissioners to take depositions and issue subpoenas . The federal government was represented in the Court by a solicitor appointed by the President .",

A Republican lawyer from New England , born in Vermont , Coolidge worked his way up the ladder of Massachusetts state politics , eventually becoming governor of Massachusetts .

The next year , he was elected vice president of the United States , and he succeeded to the presidency upon the sudden death of Warren G. Harding in 1923 . Elected in his own right in 1924 , he gained a reputation as a small government conservative and also as a man who said very little and had a rather dry sense of humor . Coolidge restored public confidence in the White House after the scandals of his predecessor 's administration , and left office with considerable popularity . As a Coolidge biographer wrote : He embodied the spirit and hopes of the middle class , could interpret their longings and express their opinions . That he did represent the genius of the average is the most convincing proof of his strength . Scholars have ranked Coolidge in the lower half of those presidents that they have assessed . He is praised by advocates of smaller government and laissez-faire economics , while supporters of an active central government generally view him less favorably , although most praise his stalwart support of racial equality .",
