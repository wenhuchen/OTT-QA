  "/wiki/Film_producer": "A film producer is a person who oversees film production . Either employed by a production company or working independently , producers plan and coordinate various aspects of film production , such as selecting the script ; coordinating writing , directing , and editing ; and arranging financing . During the discovery stage , the producer finds and selects promising material for development . Then , unless the film is based on an existing script , the producer has to hire a screenwriter and oversee the development of the script . Once a script is completed , the producer will lead a pitch to secure the financial backing ( a green light ) to allow production to begin . The producer also supervises the pre-production , production , and post-production stages of filmmaking . One of the most important tasks is to hire the director and other key crew members . Whereas the director makes the creative decisions during the production , the producer typically manages the logistics and business operations , though some directors also produce their own films . The producer is tasked with making sure the film is delivered on time and within budget , and has the final say on creative decisions . Finally , the producer will oversee the marketing and distribution . For various reasons , producers can not always supervise all of the production . In this case , the main producer or executive producer may hire and delegate work to associate producers , assistant producers , line producers or unit production managers .",
  "/wiki/Film_director": "A film director is a person who directs the making of a film . A film director controls a film 's artistic and dramatic aspects and visualizes the screenplay ( or script ) while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfilment of that vision . The director has a key role in choosing the cast members , production design , and the creative aspects of filmmaking . Under European Union law , the director is viewed as the author of the film . The film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized , or noticed . Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay within the budget . There are many pathways to becoming a film director . Some film directors started as screenwriters , cinematographers , producers , film editors or actors . Other film directors have attended a film school . Directors use different approaches . Some outline a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue , while others control every aspect , and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely . Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners .",
