Madoff avoided most direct financial scrutiny by accepting investments only through these feeder funds , while obtaining false auditing statements for his firm . The liquidation trustee of Madoff 's firm has implicated managers of the feeder funds for ignoring signs of Madoff 's deception . Although Madoff claimed to have executed the scheme alone , subsequent investigation has shown that he was assisted by a small group of close associates , as well as the feeders ' self-interested indifference to the source of his investment returns .",

  "/wiki/Ponzi_scheme": "A Ponzi scheme ( /\u02c8p\u0252nzi/ , Italian : [ \u02c8pontsi ] ; also a Ponzi game ) is a form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors . The scheme leads victims to believe that profits are coming from product sales or other means , and they remain unaware that other investors are the source of funds . A Ponzi scheme can maintain the illusion of a sustainable business as long as new investors contribute new funds , and as long as most of the investors do not demand full repayment and still believe in the non-existent assets they are purported to own . The scheme is named after Charles Ponzi , who became notorious for using the technique in the 1920s . The idea had already been carried out from 1869 to 1872 by Adele Spitzeder in Germany and by Sarah Howe in the United States in the 1880s through the Ladies ' Deposit . Howe offered a solely female clientele an eight-percent monthly interest rate , and then stole the money that the women had invested . She was eventually discovered and served three years in prison . The Ponzi scheme was also previously described in novels ; Charles Dickens ' 1844 novel Martin Chuzzlewit and his 1857 novel Little Dorrit both feature such a scheme . Ponzi carried out this scheme and became well known throughout the United States because of the huge amount of money that he took in . His original scheme was based on the legitimate arbitrage of international reply coupons for postage stamps , but he soon began diverting new investors ' money to make payments to earlier investors and to himself .",
  "/wiki/Bernard_Madoff": "Bernard Lawrence Madoff ( /\u02c8me\u026ad\u0254\u02d0f/ ; born April 29 , 1938 ) is an American former market maker , investment advisor and financier who is currently serving a federal prison sentence for offenses related to a massive Ponzi scheme . He is the former non-executive chairman of the NASDAQ stock market , the confessed operator of the largest Ponzi scheme in world history , and the largest financial fraud in U.S. history . Prosecutors estimated the fraud to be worth $ 64.8 billion based on the amounts in the accounts of Madoff 's 4,800 clients as of November 30 , 2008 . Madoff founded a penny stock brokerage in 1960 which eventually grew into Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities . He served as its chairman until his arrest on December 11 , 2008 . The firm was one of the top market maker businesses on Wall Street , which bypassed specialist firms by directly executing orders over the counter from retail brokers . At the firm , he employed his brother Peter Madoff as senior managing director and chief compliance officer , Peter 's daughter Shana Madoff as the firm 's rules and compliance officer and attorney , and his now deceased sons Andrew and Mark . Peter was sentenced to 10 years in prison and Mark committed suicide by hanging exactly two years after his father 's arrest . Andrew died of lymphoma on September 3 , 2014 . On December 10 , 2008 , Madoff 's sons told authorities that their father had confessed to them that the asset management unit of his firm was a massive Ponzi scheme , and quoted him as saying that it was one big lie . The following day , FBI agents arrested Madoff and charged him with one count of securities fraud . The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) had previously conducted multiple investigations into his business practices but had not uncovered the massive fraud .",
  "/wiki/Conspiracy_(crime)": "In criminal law , a conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime at some time in the future . Criminal law in some countries or for some conspiracies may require that at least one overt act be undertaken in furtherance of that agreement , to constitute an offense . There is no limit on the number participating in the conspiracy and , in most countries , no requirement that any steps have been taken to put the plan into effect ( compare attempts which require proximity to the full offense ) . For the purposes of concurrence , the actus reus is a continuing one and parties may join the plot later and incur joint liability and conspiracy can be charged where the co-conspirators have been acquitted or can not be traced . Finally , repentance by one or more parties does not affect liability ( unless , in some cases , it occurs before the parties have committed overt acts ) but may reduce their sentence . An unindicted co-conspirator , or unindicted conspirator , is a person or entity that is alleged in an indictment to have engaged in conspiracy , but who is not charged in the same indictment . Prosecutors choose to name persons as unindicted co-conspirators for a variety of reasons including grants of immunity , pragmatic considerations , and evidentiary concerns .",

  "/wiki/Fraud": "In law , fraud is intentional deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain , or to deprive a victim of a legal right . Fraud can violate civil law ( i.e. , a fraud victim may sue the fraud perpetrator to avoid the fraud or recover monetary compensation ) , a criminal law ( i.e. , a fraud perpetrator may be prosecuted and imprisoned by governmental authorities ) , or it may cause no loss of money , property or legal right but still be an element of another civil or criminal wrong . The purpose of fraud may be monetary gain or other benefits , for example by obtaining a passport , travel document , or driver 's license , or mortgage fraud , where the perpetrator may attempt to qualify for a mortgage by way of false statements . A hoax is a distinct concept that involves deliberate deception without the intention of gain or of materially damaging or depriving a victim .",
  "/wiki/Insider_trading": "Insider trading is the trading of a public company 's stock or other securities ( such as bonds or stock options ) based on material , nonpublic information about the company . In various countries , some kinds of trading based on insider information is illegal . This is because it is seen as unfair to other investors who do not have access to the information , as the investor with insider information could potentially make larger profits than a typical investor could make . The rules governing insider trading are complex and vary significantly from country to country . The extent of enforcement also varies from one country to another . The definition of insider in one jurisdiction can be broad , and may cover not only insiders themselves but also any persons related to them , such as brokers , associates , and even family members . A person who becomes aware of non-public information and trades on that basis may be guilty of a crime . Trading by specific insiders , such as employees , is commonly permitted as long as it does not rely on material information not in the public domain . Many jurisdictions require that such trading be reported so that the transactions can be monitored . In the United States and several other jurisdictions , trading conducted by corporate officers , key employees , directors , or significant shareholders must be reported to the regulator or publicly disclosed , usually within a few business days of the trade . In these cases , insiders in the United States are required to file a Form 4 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) when buying or selling shares of their own companies . The authors of one study claim that illegal insider trading raises the cost of capital for securities issuers , thus decreasing overall economic growth .",

  "/wiki/Underboss": "Underboss ( Italian : sottocapo ) is a position within the leadership structure of certain organized crime groups , particularly in Sicilian , Greek , and Italian-American Mafia crime families . The underboss is second in command to the boss . The underboss is sometimes a family member , such as a son , who will take over the family if the boss is sick , killed , or imprisoned . However the position of street boss has somewhat challenged the rank of underboss in the modern era . The position was installed within the Genovese crime family since at least the mid 1960s . It has also been used in the Detroit crime family and the Chicago Outfit . The power of an underboss greatly varies ; some are marginal figures , while others are the most powerful individuals in the family . Traditionally they run day-to-day affairs of the family . In some crime families , the appointment is for life . If a new boss takes over a family with an existing underboss , that boss may marginalize or even murder the underboss appointed by his predecessor . On the other hand , if a boss is incarcerated , the underboss may become acting boss . As bosses often serve large periods of time in prison , an acting boss will often become the crime family 's effective boss .",
  "/wiki/Gambino_crime_family": "The Gambino crime family ( pronounced [ \u0261am\u02c8bi\u02d0no ] ) is one of the Five Families that dominate organized crime activities in New York City , United States , within the nationwide criminal phenomenon known as the American Mafia . The group , which went through five bosses between 1910 and 1957 , is named after Carlo Gambino , boss of the family at the time of the McClellan hearings in 1963 , when the structure of organized crime first gained public attention . The group 's operations extend from New York and the eastern seaboard to California . Its illicit activities include labor and construction racketeering , gambling , loansharking , extortion , money laundering , prostitution , fraud , hijacking , and fencing . The family was one of the five families that were founded in New York after the Castellammarese War of 1931 . For most of the next quarter-century , it was a minor player in organized crime . Its most prominent member during this time was its underboss Albert Anastasia , who rose to infamy as the operating head of the underworld 's enforcement arm , Murder , Inc . He remained in power even after Murder , Inc. was smashed in the late 1940s , and took over his family in 1951 - by all accounts , after murdering the family 's founder Vincent Mangano . The rise of what was the most powerful crime family in America for a time began in 1957 , when Anastasia was assassinated while sitting in a barber chair at the Park Sheraton Hotel in Manhattan . Experts believe that Anastasia 's underboss Carlo Gambino helped orchestrate the hit to take over the family . Gambino partnered with Meyer Lansky to control gambling interests in Cuba . The family 's fortunes grew through 1976 , when Gambino appointed his brother-in-law Paul Castellano as boss upon his death .",

Gotti and his brothers grew up in poverty and turned to a life of crime at an early age . Gotti quickly became one of the crime family 's biggest earners and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Gambino family underboss Aniello Dellacroce , operating out of the Ozone Park neighborhood of Queens . Early in his criminal career and following the FBI 's indictment of members of Gotti 's crew for selling narcotics , Gotti began to fear that he and his brother would be killed by Gambino boss Paul Castellano for selling drugs . As this fear continued to grow , and amidst growing dissent over the leadership of the crime family , Gotti organized the murder of Castellano in December 1985 and took over the family shortly thereafter , leaving Gotti as the boss of what has been described as America 's most powerful crime syndicate , and one that made hundreds of millions of dollars a year from racketeering , hijacking , loan sharking , drug trafficking , bookmaking , prostitution , extortion , pornography , illegal gambling and other criminal activities . At his peak , Gotti was one of the most powerful and dangerous crime bosses in the United States . During his era he became widely known for his outspoken personality and flamboyant style , which gained him favor with some of the general public . While his peers avoided attracting attention , especially from the media , Gotti became known as The Dapper Don , for his expensive clothes and personality in front of news cameras . He was later given the nickname The Teflon Don after three high-profile trials in the 1980s resulted in his acquittal , though it was later revealed that the trials had been tainted by jury tampering , juror misconduct , and witness intimidation . Law enforcement authorities continued gathering evidence against Gotti that helped lead to his downfall . According to Sammy Gravano , Gotti earned between $ 5-20 million per year during his tenure as Gambino boss . Gotti 's underboss Salvatore Sammy the Bull Gravano aided the FBI in finally convicting Gotti .",
  "/wiki/Racketeering": "A racket , according to the current common and most general definition , is an organized criminal act in which the criminal act is some form of substantial business , or a way to earn illegal money either regularly , or briefly but repeatedly . A racket is therefore generally a repeated or continuous organized criminal operation . However , according to the more specific definition , racketeering constitutes extortion or criminal coercion . Originally and often still specifically , a racket referred to a criminal act in which the perpetrator or perpetrators fraudulently offer a service that will not be put into effect , a service to solve a nonexistent problem , or to solve a problem that would not exist without the racket . Conducting a racket is racketeering . Particularly , the potential problem may be caused by the same party that offers to solve it , but that fact may be concealed , with the specific intent to engender continual patronage for this party . The most common example of a racket is the protection racket , which promises to protect the target business or person from dangerous individuals in the neighborhood and then either collects the money or causes damage to the business until the owner pays . The racket exists as both the problem and its solution , and it is used as a method of extortion . However , the term racket has expanded in definition and may now be used less strictly to refer to any continuous or repeated illegal organized crime operation , including those that do not necessarily involve fraudulent practices . For example , racket may be used to refer to the numbers racket or the drug racket , neither of which generally involve fraud or deception with regard to the intended clientele . Racketeering is most often associated with organized crime , and the term was coined by the Employers ' Association of Chicago in June 1927 in a statement about the influence of organized crime in the Teamsters union .",

  "/wiki/Tax_fraud": "Tax evasion is the illegal evasion of taxes by individuals , corporations , and trusts . Tax evasion often entails taxpayers deliberately misrepresenting the true state of their affairs to the tax authorities to reduce their tax liability and includes dishonest tax reporting , such as declaring less income , profits or gains than the amounts actually earned , or overstating deductions . Tax evasion is an activity commonly associated with the informal economy . One measure of the extent of tax evasion ( the tax gap ) is the amount of unreported income , which is the difference between the amount of income that should be reported to the tax authorities and the actual amount reported . In contrast , tax avoidance is the legal use of tax laws to reduce one 's tax burden . Both tax evasion and avoidance can be viewed as forms of tax noncompliance , as they describe a range of activities that intend to subvert a state 's tax system , although such classification of tax avoidance is not indisputable , given that avoidance is lawful , within self-creating systems .",

  "/wiki/Child_molester": "Child sexual abuse , also called child molestation , is a form of child abuse in which an adult or older adolescent uses a child for sexual stimulation . Forms of child sexual abuse include engaging in sexual activities with a child ( whether by asking or pressuring , or by other means ) , indecent exposure ( of the genitals , female nipples , etc . ) , child grooming , child sexual exploitation or using a child to produce child pornography . Child sexual abuse can occur in a variety of settings , including home , school , or work ( in places where child labor is common ) . Child marriage is one of the main forms of child sexual abuse ; UNICEF has stated that child marriage represents perhaps the most prevalent form of sexual abuse and exploitation of girls . The effects of child sexual abuse can include depression , post-traumatic stress disorder , anxiety , complex post-traumatic stress disorder , propensity to further victimization in adulthood , and physical injury to the child , among other problems . Sexual abuse by a family member is a form of incest and can result in more serious and long-term psychological trauma , especially in the case of parental incest . The global prevalence of child sexual abuse has been estimated at 19.7% for females and 7.9% for males . Most sexual abuse offenders are acquainted with their victims ; approximately 30% are relatives of the child , most often brothers , fathers , uncles , or cousins ; around 60% are other acquaintances , such as friends of the family , babysitters , or neighbors ; strangers are the offenders in approximately 10% of child sexual abuse cases . Most child sexual abuse is committed by men ; studies on female child molesters show that women commit 14% to 40% of offenses reported against boys and 6% of offenses reported against girls . The word pedophile is commonly applied indiscriminately to anyone who sexually abuses a child , but child sexual offenders are not pedophiles unless they have a strong sexual interest in prepubescent children . Under the law , child sexual abuse is often used as an umbrella term describing criminal and civil offenses in which an adult engages in sexual activity with a minor or exploits a minor for the purpose of sexual gratification .",
  "/wiki/FBI_Ten_Most_Wanted_Fugitive": "The FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives is a most wanted list maintained by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) . The list arose from a conversation held in late 1949 between J. Edgar Hoover , Director of the FBI , and William Kinsey Hutchinson , International News Service ( the predecessor of the United Press International ) editor-in-chief , who were discussing ways to promote capture of the FBI 's toughest guys . This discussion turned into a published article , which received so much positive publicity that on March 14 , 1950 , the FBI officially announced the list to increase law enforcement 's ability to capture dangerous fugitives . Individuals are generally only removed from the list if the fugitive is captured , dies , or if the charges against them are dropped ; they are then replaced by a new entry selected by the FBI . In ten cases , the FBI removed individuals from the list after deciding that they were no longer a particularly dangerous menace to society . Machetero member V\u00edctor Manuel Gerena , added to the list in 1984 , was on the list for 32 years , which was longer than anyone else . Billie Austin Bryant spent the shortest amount of time on the list , being listed for two hours in 1969 . The oldest person to be added to the list was Eugene Palmer on May 29 , 2019 , at 80 years old . On rare occasions , the FBI will add a Number Eleven if that individual is extremely dangerous but the Bureau does not feel any of the current ten should be removed . Despite occasional references in the media , the FBI does not rank their list ; no suspect is considered # 1 on the FBI 's Most Wanted List or The Most Wanted . The list is commonly posted in public places such as post offices . In many cases , fugitives on the list have turned themselves in on becoming aware of their listing .",
  "/wiki/Child_pornography": "Child pornography is pornography that exploits children for sexual stimulation . It may be produced with the direct involvement or sexual assault of a child ( also known as child sexual abuse images ) or it may be simulated child pornography . Abuse of the child occurs during the sexual acts or lascivious exhibitions of genitals or pubic areas which are recorded in the production of child pornography . Child pornography may use a variety of media , including writings , magazines , photos , sculpture , drawing , cartoon , painting , animation , sound recording , film , video , and video games . Laws regarding child pornography generally include sexual images involving prepubescents , pubescent or post-pubescent minors and computer-generated images that appear to involve them . Most possessors of child pornography who are arrested are found to possess images of prepubescent children ; possessors of pornographic images of post-pubescent minors are less likely to be prosecuted , even though those images also fall within the statutes . Producers of child pornography try to avoid prosecution by distributing their material across national borders , though this issue is increasingly being addressed with regular arrests of suspects from a number of countries occurring over the last few years . The prepubescent pornography is viewed and collected by pedophiles for a variety of purposes , ranging from private sexual uses , trading with other pedophiles , preparing children for sexual abuse as part of the process known as child grooming , or enticement leading to entrapment for sexual exploitation such as production of new child pornography or child prostitution . Children themselves also sometimes produce child pornography on their own initiative or by the coercion of an adult . Child pornography is illegal and censored in most jurisdictions in the world . Ninety-four of 187 Interpol member states had laws specifically addressing child pornography as of 2008 , though this does not include nations that ban all pornography . Of those 94 countries , 58 criminalized possession of child pornography regardless of intent to distribute ."
