  "/wiki/Counties_of_Ireland": "The counties of Ireland ( Irish : contaetha na h\u00c9ireann ; Ulster-Scots : coonties o Airlann ) are sub-national divisions that have been , and in some cases continue to be , used to geographically demarcate areas of local government . These land divisions were formed following the Norman invasion of Ireland in imitation of the counties then in use as units of local government in the Kingdom of England . The older term shire was historically equivalent to county . The principal function of the county was to impose royal control in the areas of taxation , security and the administration of justice at the local level . Cambro-Norman control was initially limited to the southeastern parts of Ireland ; a further four centuries elapsed before the entire island was shired . At the same time , the now obsolete concept of county corporate elevated a small number of towns and cities to a status which was deemed to be no less important than the existing counties in which they lay . This double control mechanism of 32 counties plus 10 counties corporate remained unchanged for a little over two centuries until the early 19th century . Since then , counties have been adapted and in some cases divided by legislation to meet new administrative and political requirements . The powers exercised by the Cambro-Norman barons and the Old English nobility waned over time . New offices of political control came to be established at a county level . In the Republic of Ireland , some counties have been split resulting in the creation of new counties . Along with certain defined cities , counties still form the basis for the demarcation of areas of local government in the Republic of Ireland .",
  "/wiki/Provinces_of_Ireland": "Since the early 17th century , there have been four Provinces of Ireland : Connacht , Leinster , Munster and Ulster . The Irish word for this territorial division , c\u00faige , meaning fifth part , indicates that there were once five ; however , in the medieval period there were more . The number of provinces and their delimitation fluctuated until 1610 , when they were permanently set by the English administration of James I . The provinces of Ireland no longer serve administrative or political purposes but function as historical and cultural entities .",

The Leinster province comprises the ancient Kingdoms of Meath , Leinster and Osraige .

The ancient kingdoms were shired into a number of counties for administrative and judicial purposes . In later centuries , local government legislation has seen further sub-division of the historic counties . Leinster has no official function for local-government purposes . However , the province is an officially recognised subdivision of Ireland .
