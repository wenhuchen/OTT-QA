  "/wiki/Latitude": "In geography , latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the north-south position of a point on the Earth 's surface . Latitude is an angle ( defined below ) which ranges from 0\u00b0 at the Equator to 90\u00b0 ( North or South ) at the poles . Lines of constant latitude , or parallels , run east-west as circles parallel to the equator . Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth . On its own , the term latitude should be taken to be the geodetic latitude as defined below . Briefly , geodetic latitude at a point is the angle formed by the vector perpendicular ( or normal ) to the ellipsoidal surface from that point , and the equatorial plane . Also defined are six auxiliary latitudes which are used in special applications .",
  "/wiki/Longitude": "Longitude ( /\u02c8l\u0252nd\u0292\u026atju\u02d0d/ , AU and UK also /\u02c8l\u0252\u014b\u0261\u026a-/ ) , is a geographic coordinate that specifies the east-west position of a point on the Earth 's surface , or the surface of a celestial body . It is an angular measurement , usually expressed in degrees and denoted by the Greek letter lambda ( \u03bb ) . Meridians ( lines running from pole to pole ) connect points with the same longitude . By convention , one of these , the Prime Meridian , which passes through the Royal Observatory , Greenwich , England , was allocated the position of 0\u00b0 longitude . The longitude of other places is measured as the angle east or west from the Prime Meridian , ranging from 0\u00b0 at the Prime Meridian to +180\u00b0 eastward and \u2212180\u00b0 westward . Specifically , it is the angle between a plane through the Prime Meridian and a plane through both poles and the location in question . ( This forms a right-handed coordinate system with the z-axis ( right hand thumb ) pointing from the Earth 's center toward the North Pole and the x-axis ( right hand index finger ) extending from the Earth 's center through the Equator at the Prime Meridian . ) A location 's north-south position along a meridian is given by its latitude , which is approximately the angle between the local vertical and the equatorial plane . If the Earth were perfectly spherical and radially homogeneous , then the longitude at a point would be equal to the angle between a vertical north-south plane through that point and the plane of the Greenwich meridian . Everywhere on Earth the vertical north-south plane would contain the Earth 's axis . But the Earth is not radially homogeneous and has rugged terrain , which affect gravity and so can shift the vertical plane away from the Earth 's axis . The vertical north-south plane still intersects the plane of the Greenwich meridian at some angle ; that angle is the astronomical longitude , calculated from star observations .",
  "/wiki/Diameter": "In geometry , a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle . It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle . Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere . In more modern usage , the length of a diameter is also called the diameter . In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter ( which refers to the line segment itself ) , because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length , this being twice the radius r .",

It has the longest documented history of any living Indo-European language , spanning at least 3,500 years of written records . Its writing system has been the Greek alphabet for the major part of its history ; other systems , such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary , were used previously . The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin , Cyrillic , Armenian , Coptic , Gothic , and many other writing systems . The Greek language holds an important place in the history of the Western world and Christianity ; the canon of ancient Greek literature includes works in the Western canon such as the epic poems Iliad and Odyssey . Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science , especially astronomy , mathematics and logic and Western philosophy , such as the Platonic dialogues and the works of Aristotle , are composed ; the New Testament of the Christian Bible was written in Koin\u00e9 Greek . Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world , the study of the Greek texts and society of antiquity constitutes the discipline of Classics . During antiquity , Greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world , West Asia and many places beyond . It would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire and develop into Medieval Greek . In its modern form , Greek is the official language in two countries , Greece and Cyprus , a recognised minority language in seven other countries , and is one of the 24 official languages of the European Union . The language is spoken by at least 13.2 million people today in Greece , Cyprus , Italy , Albania , and Turkey and by the Greek diaspora . Greek roots are often used to coin new words for other languages ; Greek and Latin are the predominant sources of international scientific vocabulary .",

Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders .

It makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey . The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , the Armenian Highlands to the east and the Aegean Sea to the west . The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the Balkan peninsula of Europe . The eastern border of Anatolia is traditionally held to be a line between the Gulf of Alexandretta and the Black Sea , bounded by the Armenian Highland to the east and Mesopotamia to the southeast . Thus , traditionally Anatolia is the territory that comprises approximately the western two-thirds of the Asian part of Turkey . Today , Anatolia is also often considered to be synonymous with Asian Turkey , which comprises almost the entire country ; its eastern and southeastern borders are widely taken to be Turkey 's eastern border . By some definitions , the Armenian Highlands lies beyond the boundary of the Anatolian plateau . The official name of this inland region is the Eastern Anatolia Region . The ancient inhabitants of Anatolia spoke the now-extinct Anatolian languages , which were largely replaced by the Greek language starting from classical antiquity and during the Hellenistic , Roman and Byzantine periods . Major Anatolian languages included Hittite , Luwian , and Lydian , among other more poorly attested relatives . The Turkification of Anatolia began under the Seljuk Empire in the late 11th century and continued under the Ottoman Empire between the late 13th and early 20th centuries .",

The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided . Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn . Mont Blanc spans the French-Italian border , and at 4,810 m ( 15,781 ft ) is the highest mountain in the Alps . The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4,000 metres ( 13,000 ft ) . The altitude and size of the range affects the climate in Europe ; in the mountains precipitation levels vary greatly and climatic conditions consist of distinct zones . Wildlife such as ibex live in the higher peaks to elevations of 3,400 m ( 11,155 ft ) , and plants such as Edelweiss grow in rocky areas in lower elevations as well as in higher elevations . Evidence of human habitation in the Alps goes back to the Palaeolithic era . A mummified man , determined to be 5,000 years old , was discovered on a glacier at the Austrian-Italian border in 1991 . By the 6th century BC , the Celtic La T\u00e8ne culture was well established . Hannibal famously crossed the Alps with a herd of elephants , and the Romans had settlements in the region . In 1800 , Napoleon crossed one of the mountain passes with an army of 40,000 .",

The rim of Gruithuisen is relatively smooth and circular , projecting only slightly above the surrounding mare . The interior is relatively featureless with a small floor , with mounds of material deposited along the edges of the sloping inner walls .",
  "/wiki/Mons_Gruithuisen_Gamma": "Mons Gruithuisen Gamma ( \u03b3 ) is a lunar dome that lies to the north of the crater Gruithuisen at the western edge of the Mare Imbrium . It is located at selenographic coordinates 36.6\u00b0 N , 40.5\u00b0 W. This massif is shaped as a rounded dome in the surface , occupying a diameter of 20 km and climbing gently to a height of 900 meters . At the crest is a small crater . This formation appears foreshortened when viewed from the Earth , and it has been described by Antonin Rukl as resembling an upturned bathtub . To the east lies the similar Mons Gruithuisen Delta ( \u03b4 ) . Together they are often informally called the Gruithuisen domes .",
  "/wiki/Mons_Hadley": "Mons Hadley is a massif in the northern portion of the Montes Apenninus , a range in the northern hemisphere of the Moon . It has a height of 4.2 km ( 14,000 ft ) above the adjacent plain and a maximum diameter of 25 km at the base . To the southwest of this mountain is a valley that served as the landing site for the Apollo 15 expedition . To the southwest of this same valley is the slightly smaller Mons Hadley Delta ( \u03b4 ) peak with a height of about 3.5 km above the valley floor . Mons Hadley Delta was visited and sampled by the astronauts , but Mons Hadley itself was only photographed from the surface . To the west of these peaks is the sinuous Rima Hadley rille . These features were named after the English mathematician John Hadley .",

  "/wiki/Mons_Hansteen": "Mons Hansteen is a mountain on the Moon , also known as Hansteen Alpha ( \u03b1 ) , named after Christopher Hansteen . It is roughly triangular in shape and occupies an area about 30 km across on the western margin of Oceanus Procellarum , southeast of the crater Hansteen and north of the dark-floored crater Billy . It is thought to be an extrusion of volcanic material that is younger than the crater Hansteen .",
  "/wiki/Hansteen_(crater)": "Hansteen is a lunar impact crater that lies near the southwest edge of the Oceanus Procellarum . To the southeast is the flooded crater Billy . The rim of Hansteen is somewhat polygonal in form , especially along the eastern side . There are a few terraces along the northwestern inner wall . The inner floor contains several ridges , hills , and some grooves , many of which parallel the outer rim . There is a flat patch of lower-albedo material in the northeast part of the interior . Paralleling the southwest outer wall is the brief rille designated Rima Hansteen , a formation with a length of about 25 kilometers . To the southeast of the crater rises Mons Hansteen , or Hansteen Alpha ( \u03b1 ) . This is roughly triangular in shape and occupies an area about 30 km across on the mare . This feature is younger than Hansteen crater and is thought to be an extrusion of volcanic material .",
  "/wiki/Mons_Herodotus": "Mons Herodotus is a small lunar mountain north of the crater Herodotus . It lies on the rugged Aristarchus Plateau and rises approximately 1 km above the surrounding terrain .",
  "/wiki/Herodotus_(crater)": "Herodotus is a lunar impact crater located on a low shelf in the midst of the Oceanus Procellarum . To the east is the slightly larger crater Aristarchus . West across the mare is Schiaparelli . Almost due south on the mare surface is a solitary lunar dome designated Herodotus Omega ( \u03c9 ) . The crater Herodotus has a slightly irregular , narrow rim that appears somewhat oblong due to foreshortening . The inner floor has been flooded with lava , and has a lower albedo than its brighter and more prominent neighbor Aristarchus . There is a small craterlet overlapping the northwest rim , but otherwise the outer wall has not suffered significant wear . Nevertheless , the rim is unusually thin in relation to its size . To the north of Herodotus is the start of the Vallis Schr\u00f6teri , a valley that has a length of 160 kilometers and a maximum depth of nearly a kilometer . It begins at a small crater 25 km north of the rim , then winds across the surface to the north , before turning northwest and finally to the southwest before coming to a precipitous end at the edge of the raised shelf on which Herodotus is located . The valley is wider at its crater head than elsewhere , which has given it the nickname of the Cobra Head .",
  "/wiki/Mons_Huygens": "Mons Huygens is the Moon 's tallest hill ( but not its highest point , which is Selenean Summit ) . It is about 5,500 m ( 18,000 ft ) high and is located in the Montes Apenninus . Adjacent to the west is Mons Amp\u00e8re . The Montes Apenninus were formed by the impact that created Mare Imbrium .

In physics , Huygens made groundbreaking contributions in optics and mechanics , while as an astronomer he is chiefly known for his studies of the rings of Saturn and the discovery of its moon Titan . As an inventor , he improved the design of the telescope with the invention of the Huygenian eyepiece . His most famous invention , however , was the pendulum clock in 1656 , which was a breakthrough in timekeeping and became the most accurate timekeeper for almost 300 years . Because he was the first to use mathematical formulae to describe the laws of physics , Huygens has been called the first theoretical physicist and the founder of mathematical physics . In 1659 , Huygens was the first to derive the now standard formula for the centripetal force in his work De vi centrifuga . The formula played a central role in classical mechanics . Huygens was also the first to formulate the correct laws of elastic collision in his work De motu corporum ex percussione , but his findings were not published until 1703 , after his death . In the field of optics , he is best known for his wave theory of light , which he proposed in 1678 and described in 1690 in his Treatise on Light , which is regarded as the first mathematical theory of light . His theory was initially rejected in favor of Isaac Newton 's corpuscular theory of light , until Augustin-Jean Fresnel adopted Huygens ' principle in 1818 and showed that it could explain the rectilinear propagation and diffraction effects of light . Today this principle is known as the Huygens-Fresnel principle . Huygens invented the pendulum clock in 1656 , which he patented the following year .",

  "/wiki/Philippe_de_la_Hire": "Philippe de La Hire ( or Lahire , La Hyre or Phillipe de La Hire ) ( 18 March 1640 - 21 April 1718 ) was a French painter , mathematician , astronomer , and architect . According to Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle he was an academy unto himself . He was born in Paris , the son of Laurent de La Hire , a distinguished artist and Marguerite Coquin . In 1660 , he moved to Venice for four years to study painting . Upon his return to Paris , he became a disciple of Girard Desargues from whom he learned geometrical perspective and was received as a master painter on 4 August 1670 . His paintings have sometimes been confused with those of his son , Jean Nicolas de La Hire , who was a doctor but also a painter . He also began to study science and showed an aptitude for mathematics . He was taught by the French Jesuit theologian , mathematician , physicist and controversialist Honor\u00e9 Fabri and became part of a circle formed by Fabri which included Giovanni Domenico Cassini , Claude Francois Milliet Deschales , Christiaan Huygens and his brother Constantijn , Gottfried Leibniz , Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Marin Mersenne . He became a member of French Academy of Sciences in 1678 , and subsequently became active as an astronomer , calculating tables of the movements of the Sun , Moon , and planets and designing contrivances for aiming aerial telescopes . From 1679-1682 he made several observations and measurements of the French coastline , and in 1683 aided in mapping France by extending the Paris meridian to the north . In 1683 La Hire assumed the chair of mathematics at the Coll\u00e8ge Royal . From 1687 onwards he taught at the Acad\u00e9mie darchitecture ."
