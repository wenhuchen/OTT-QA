  "/wiki/Hyperlink": "In computing , a hyperlink , or simply a link , is a reference to data that the user can follow by clicking or tapping . A hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document . Hypertext is text with hyperlinks . The text that is linked from is called anchor text . A software system that is used for viewing and creating hypertext is a hypertext system , and to create a hyperlink is to hyperlink ( or simply to link ) . A user following hyperlinks is said to navigate or browse the hypertext . The document containing a hyperlink is known as its source document . For example , in an online reference work such as Wikipedia , or Google , many words and terms in the text are hyperlinked to definitions of those terms . Hyperlinks are often used to implement reference mechanisms such as tables of contents , footnotes , bibliographies , indexes , letters and glossaries . In some hypertext , hyperlinks can be bidirectional : they can be followed in two directions , so both ends act as anchors and as targets . More complex arrangements exist , such as many-to-many links . The effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system and may sometimes depend on the link itself ; for instance , on the World Wide Web most hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the document being displayed , but some are marked to cause the target document to open in a new window .",

Spanish and English are the official languages of the executive branch of government , though Spanish predominates . Originally populated by the indigenous Ta\u00edno people , Puerto Rico was colonized by Spain following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493 . It was contested by the French , Dutch , and British , but remained a Spanish possession for the next four centuries . The island 's cultural and demographic landscapes were shaped by the displacement and assimilation of the native population , the forced migration of African slaves , and settlement from the Canary Islands and Andalusia . In the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategic role compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain . Spain 's distant administrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century , producing a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined indigenous , African , and European elements . On September 23 , 1868 , Ram\u00f3n Emeterio Betances unleashed a revolt against Spanish rule , declaring for the first time the idea of Puerto Ricans as a distinct people , with right to sovereignty .",
