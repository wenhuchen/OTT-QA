  "/wiki/Ant": "Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and , along with the related wasps and bees , belong to the order Hymenoptera . Ants appear suddenly across the globe during the earliest part of the Late Cretaceous , but are already considerably diversified by this time , suggesting an earlier origin . Ants evolved from vespoid wasp ancestors in the Cretaceous period , and diversified after the rise of flowering plants . More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified . They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists . Ants form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy large territories and consist of millions of individuals . Larger colonies consist of various castes of sterile , wingless females , most of which are workers ( ergates ) , as well as soldiers ( dinergates ) and other specialised groups . Nearly all ant colonies also have some fertile males called drones ( aner ) and one or more fertile females called queens ( gynes ) . The colonies are described as superorganisms because the ants appear to operate as a unified entity , collectively working together to support the colony .",

For three decades in the 20th century , it was a prominent force and leader in American television animation as it created a variety of popular animated characters and a succession of cartoon series , including The Huckleberry Hound Show , The Flintstones , The Yogi Bear Show , The Jetsons , Wacky Races , Scooby-Doo , Where Are You ! and The Smurfs . Its cartoons won eight Emmys and seven Oscars and in addition , Hanna and Barbera were honored a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame . The two men and Sidney sold the studio to Taft Broadcasting on December 29 , 1966 . By the mid-1980s , when the profitability of Saturday-morning cartoons was eclipsed by weekday afternoon syndication , Hanna-Barbera 's fortunes had declined . Turner Broadcasting System purchased the studio from Taft ( by then renamed Great American Broadcasting ) in late 1991 and used much of its back catalog as the foundation and programming for Cartoon Network and later Boomerang . After Turner purchased the company , Hanna and Barbera continued to serve as creative consultants and mentors . The studio became a subsidiary of Warner Bros . Animation in 1996 following Turner 's merger with Time Warner and was ultimately absorbed into Warner Bros . Animation in 2001 , existing in name only . As of 2020 , Warner Bros. continues to produce new animation based on Hanna-Barbera 's catalog using the Hanna-Barbera brand name .",

  "/wiki/Honey_bee": "A honey bee ( also spelled honeybee ) is a eusocial flying insect within the genus Apis of the bee clade , all native to Eurasia but spread to four other continents by human beings . They are known for construction of perennial , colonial nests from wax , for the large size of their colonies , and for their surplus production and storage of honey , distinguishing their hives as a prized foraging target of many animals , including honey badgers , bears and human hunter-gatherers . In the early 21st century , only seven species of honey bee are recognized , with a total of 44 subspecies , though historically seven to eleven species are recognized . The best known honey bee is the western honey bee which has been domesticated for honey production and crop pollination ; modern humans also value the wax for candlemaking , soapmaking , lip balms , and other crafts . Honey bees represent only a small fraction of the roughly 20,000 known species of bees . Some other types of related bees produce and store honey and have been kept by humans for that purpose , including the stingless honey bees , but only members of the genus Apis are true honey bees . The study of bees , which includes the study of honey bees , is known as melittology .",
  "/wiki/Beehive": "A beehive is an enclosed , man-made structure in which some honey bee species of the subgenus Apis live and raise their young . Though the word beehive is commonly used to describe the nest of any bee colony , scientific and professional literature distinguishes nest from hive . Nest is used to discuss colonies which house themselves in natural or artificial cavities or are hanging and exposed . Hive is used to describe an artificial , man-made structure to house a honey bee nest . Several species of Apis live in colonies , but for honey production the western honey bee ( Apis mellifera ) and the eastern honey bee ( Apis cerana ) are the main species kept in hives . The nest 's internal structure is a densely packed group of hexagonal prismatic cells made of beeswax , called a honeycomb . The bees use the cells to store food ( honey and pollen ) and to house the brood ( eggs , larvae , and pupae ) . Beehives serve several purposes : production of honey , pollination of nearby crops , housing supply bees for apitherapy treatment , and to try to mitigate the effects of colony collapse disorder . In America , hives are commonly transported so that bees can pollinate crops in other areas . A number of patents have been issued for beehive designs .",
  "/wiki/Sheep_Meadow,_Central_Park": "Sheep Meadow is a 15-acre ( 61,000 m2 ) meadow near the southwestern section of Central Park from 66th to 69th streets in Manhattan , New York City . It is adjacent to Central Park Mall to the east , The Ramble and Lake to the north , West Drive to the west , and Heckscher Playground and Ballfields to the south . Sheep Meadow was originally designed as a parade ground and incorporated into the Greensward Plan , the original plan for Central Park developed in the 1850s . However , Central Park 's designers Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux opposed the use of the meadow for military purposes , so it was instead converted to a pasture with sheep . Housed in a nearby sheepfold that now contains the Tavern on the Green restaurant , the sheep were removed in 1934 . Sheep Meadow has a long history as a gathering place for large-scale demonstrations and political movements . These have included festivals , rallies , concerts , and protests such as the be-ins of the 1960s . Though sports and gatherings were gradually allowed through the late 19th century , Sheep Meadow saw significant deterioration because of overuse . A regulation prohibiting sports was enacted following a 1980 renovation , and the meadow was restored again in 2000 .",

There are dung beetle species of different colours and sizes , and some functional traits such as body mass ( or biomass ) and leg length can have high levels of variability . All the species belong to the superfamily Scarabaeoidea , most of them to the subfamilies Scarabaeinae and Aphodiinae of the family Scarabaeidae ( scarab beetles ) . As most species of Scarabaeinae feed exclusively on feces , that subfamily is often dubbed true dung beetles .

  "/wiki/Pinocchio_(1940_film)": "Pinocchio is a 1940 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Productions , distributed by RKO Radio Pictures and based on the Italian children 's novel The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi . It was the second animated feature film produced by Disney , made after the first animated success Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ( 1937 ) . The plot involves an old wood-carver named Geppetto who carves a wooden puppet named Pinocchio . The puppet is brought to life by a blue fairy , who informs him that he can become a real boy if he proves himself to be brave , truthful , and unselfish . Pinocchio 's efforts to become a real boy involve encounters with a host of unsavory characters . The film was adapted by Aurelius Battaglia , William Cottrell , Otto Englander , Erdman Penner , Joseph Sabo , Ted Sears , and Webb Smith from Collodi 's book . The production was supervised by Ben Sharpsteen and Hamilton Luske , and the film 's sequences were directed by Norman Ferguson , T. Hee , Wilfred Jackson , Jack Kinney , and Bill Roberts . Pinocchio was a groundbreaking achievement in the area of effects animation , giving realistic movement to vehicles , machinery and natural elements such as rain , lightning , smoke , shadows and water . The film was released to theaters by RKO Radio Pictures on February 7 , 1940 . Critical analysis of Pinocchio identifies it as a simple morality tale that teaches children of the benefits of hard work and conventional values . Although it became the first animated feature to win a competitive Academy Award - winning two for Best Music , Original Score and for Best Music , Original Song for When You Wish Upon a Star - it was initially a box office disaster , in great part due to World War II cutting off the European and Asian markets overseas .

  "/wiki/Walt_Disney": "Walter Elias Disney ( /\u02c8d\u026azni/ ; December 5 , 1901 - December 15 , 1966 ) was an American entrepreneur , animator , voice actor and film producer . A pioneer of the American animation industry , he introduced several developments in the production of cartoons . As a film producer , Disney holds the record for most Academy Awards earned by an individual , having won 22 Oscars from 59 nominations . He was presented with two Golden Globe Special Achievement Awards and an Emmy Award , among other honors . Several of his films are included in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress . Born in Chicago in 1901 , Disney developed an early interest in drawing . He took art classes as a boy and got a job as a commercial illustrator at the age of 18 . He moved to California in the early 1920s and set up the Disney Brothers Studio with his brother Roy . With Ub Iwerks , Walt developed the character Mickey Mouse in 1928 , his first highly popular success ; he also provided the voice for his creation in the early years . As the studio grew , Disney became more adventurous , introducing synchronized sound , full-color three-strip Technicolor , feature-length cartoons and technical developments in cameras . The results , seen in features such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ( 1937 ) , Pinocchio , Fantasia ( both 1940 ) , Dumbo ( 1941 ) , and Bambi ( 1942 ) , furthered the development of animated film .

Many speakers of Italian are native bilinguals of both Italian ( either in its standard form or regional varieties ) and other regional languages . Italian is a major European language , being one of the official languages of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and one of the working languages of the Council of Europe . It is the fourth most widely spoken first language in the European Union with 69 million native speakers ( 13% of the EU population ) and it is spoken as a second language by 16 million EU citizens ( 3% ) . Including Italian speakers in non-EU European countries ( such as Switzerland and Albania ) and on other continents , the total number of speakers is around 90 million .",

It is about the mischievous adventures of an animated marionette named Pinocchio and his father , a poor woodcarver named Geppetto . It was originally published in a serial form as The Story of a Puppet ( Italian : La storia di un burattino ) in the Giornale per i bambini , one of the earliest Italian weekly magazines for children , starting from 7 July 1881 . The story stopped after nearly 4 months and 8 episodes at Chapter 15 , but by popular demand from readers , the episodes were resumed on 16 February 1882 . In February 1883 , the story was published in a single book . Since then , the spread of Pinocchio on the main markets for children 's books of the time has been continuous and uninterrupted , and it was met with enthusiastic reviews worldwide . A universal icon and a metaphor of the human condition , the book is considered a canonical piece of children 's literature and has had great impact on world culture . Philosopher Benedetto Croce reputed it as one of the greatest works of Italian literature . Since its first publication , it has inspired hundreds of new editions , stage plays , merchandising , television series and movies , such as Walt Disney 's iconic animated version , and commonplace ideas such as a liar 's long nose . According to extensive research done by the Fondazione Nazionale Carlo Collodi in the late 1990s and based on UNESCO sources , the book has been adapted in over 260 languages worldwide , while as of 2018 it has been translated into over 300 languages . That makes it the most translated non-religious book in the world and one of the best-selling books ever published , with over 80 million copies sold in recent years ( the total sales since its first publication are unknown because of the many public domain re-releases begun in 1940 ) . According to Francelia Butler , it remains the most translated Italian book and , after the Bible , the most widely read .",

  "/wiki/Cockroach": "Cockroaches are insects of the order Blattodea , which also includes termites . About 30 cockroach species out of 4,600 are associated with human habitats . About four species are well known as pests . The cockroaches are an ancient group , dating back at least as far as the Carboniferous period , some 320 million years ago . Those early ancestors however lacked the internal ovipositors of modern roaches . Cockroaches are somewhat generalized insects without special adaptations like the sucking mouthparts of aphids and other true bugs ; they have chewing mouthparts and are likely among the most primitive of living neopteran insects . They are common and hardy insects , and can tolerate a wide range of environments from Arctic cold to tropical heat . Tropical cockroaches are often much bigger than temperate species , and , contrary to popular belief , extinct cockroach relatives and 'roachoids ' such as the Carboniferous Archimylacris and the Permian Apthoroblattina were not as large as the biggest modern species . Some species , such as the gregarious German cockroach , have an elaborate social structure involving common shelter , social dependence , information transfer and kin recognition . Cockroaches have appeared in human culture since classical antiquity . They are popularly depicted as dirty pests , though the great majority of species are inoffensive and live in a wide range of habitats around the world .",

  "/wiki/Mickey_Mouse_universe": "The Mickey Mouse universe is a fictional shared universe which is the setting for stories involving Disney cartoon characters Mickey and Minnie Mouse , Pluto , Goofy and many other characters . The universe originated from the Mickey Mouse animated short films produced by Disney starting in 1928 , but its first consistent version was created by Floyd Gottfredson in the Mickey Mouse newspaper comic strip . Real-world versions also exist in Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland , called Mickey 's Toontown . Since 1990 , the city in which Mickey lives is typically called Mouseton in American comics . In modern continuity , Mouseton is often depicted as being located in the fictional U.S. state of Calisota , analogous to Northern California . This fictional state was invented by comics writer Carl Barks in 1952 as the location for Donald Duck 's home city , Duckburg . The most consistent aspect of the Mickey Mouse universe is the characters . The most well-known include Mickey 's girlfriend Minnie , pet dog Pluto , friends Goofy , Horace Horsecollar , Clarabelle Cow , and nemesis Pete . Some Disney productions incorporate characters from Disney 's animated feature films , such as Bath Day ( 1946 ; in which Figaro from Pinocchio appears as Minnie 's cat ) , Mickey 's Christmas Carol ( 1983 ) , and - most extensively - Disney 's House of Mouse ( 2001-2003 ) . The term Mickey Mouse universe is not officially used by the Walt Disney Company , but it has been used by Disney comics author and animation historian David Gerstein . The Walt Disney Company typically uses terms such as Mickey & Friends or Mickey & the Gang to refer to the character franchise .",
  "/wiki/Beetle": "Beetles are a group of insects that form the order Coleoptera , in the superorder Endopterygota . Their front pair of wings are hardened into wing-cases , elytra , distinguishing them from most other insects . The Coleoptera , with about 400,000 species , is the largest of all orders , constituting almost 40% of described insects and 25% of all known animal life-forms ; new species are discovered frequently . The largest of all families , the Curculionidae ( weevils ) , with some 83,000 member species , belongs to this order . Found in almost every habitat except the sea and the polar regions , they interact with their ecosystems in several ways : beetles often feed on plants and fungi , break down animal and plant debris , and eat other invertebrates . Some species are serious agricultural pests , such as the Colorado potato beetle , while others such as Coccinellidae ( ladybirds or ladybugs ) eat aphids , scale insects , thrips , and other plant-sucking insects that damage crops . Beetles typically have a particularly hard exoskeleton including the elytra , though some such as the rove beetles have very short elytra while blister beetles have softer elytra . The general anatomy of a beetle is quite uniform and typical of insects , although there are several examples of novelty , such as adaptations in water beetles which trap air bubbles under the elytra for use while diving . Beetles are endopterygotes , which means that they undergo complete metamorphosis , with a series of conspicuous and relatively abrupt changes in body structure between hatching and becoming adult after a relatively immobile pupal stage . Some , such as stag beetles , have a marked sexual dimorphism , the males possessing enormously enlarged mandibles which they use to fight other males . Many beetles are aposematic , with bright colours and patterns warning of their toxicity , while others are harmless Batesian mimics of such insects . Many beetles , including those that live in sandy places , have effective camouflage .",

  "/wiki/Honeybee": "A honey bee ( also spelled honeybee ) is a eusocial flying insect within the genus Apis of the bee clade , all native to Eurasia but spread to four other continents by human beings . They are known for construction of perennial , colonial nests from wax , for the large size of their colonies , and for their surplus production and storage of honey , distinguishing their hives as a prized foraging target of many animals , including honey badgers , bears and human hunter-gatherers . In the early 21st century , only seven species of honey bee are recognized , with a total of 44 subspecies , though historically seven to eleven species are recognized . The best known honey bee is the western honey bee which has been domesticated for honey production and crop pollination ; modern humans also value the wax for candlemaking , soapmaking , lip balms , and other crafts . Honey bees represent only a small fraction of the roughly 20,000 known species of bees . Some other types of related bees produce and store honey and have been kept by humans for that purpose , including the stingless honey bees , but only members of the genus Apis are true honey bees . The study of bees , which includes the study of honey bees , is known as melittology .",

  "/wiki/Queen_bee": "The term queen bee is typically used to refer to an adult , mated female ( gyne ) that lives in a honey bee colony or hive ; she is usually the mother of most , if not all , of the bees in the beehive . Queens are developed from larvae selected by worker bees and specially fed in order to become sexually mature . There is normally only one adult , mated queen in a hive , in which case the bees will usually follow and fiercely protect her . The term queen bee can be more generally applied to any dominant reproductive female in a colony of a eusocial bee species other than honey bees . However , as in the Brazilian stingless bee Schwarziana quadripunctata , a single nest may have multiple queens or even dwarf queens , ready to replace a dominant queen in a case of sudden death .",
  "/wiki/Wasp": "A wasp is any insect of the order Hymenoptera and suborder Apocrita that is neither a bee nor an ant . The Apocrita have a common evolutionary ancestor and form a clade ; wasps as a group do not form a clade , but are paraphyletic with respect to bees and ants . The most commonly known wasps , such as yellowjackets and hornets , are in the family Vespidae and are eusocial , living together in a nest with an egg-laying queen and non-reproducing workers . Eusociality is favoured by the unusual haplodiploid system of sex determination in Hymenoptera , as it makes sisters exceptionally closely related to each other . However , the majority of wasp species are solitary , with each adult female living and breeding independently . Females typically have an ovipositor for laying eggs in or near a food source for the larvae , though in the Aculeata the ovipositor is often modified instead into a sting used for defense or prey capture . Wasps play many ecological roles . Some are predators or pollinators , whether to feed themselves or to provision their nests . Many , notably the cuckoo wasps , are kleptoparasites , laying eggs in the nests of other wasps . Many of the solitary wasps are parasitoidal , meaning they lay eggs on or in other insects ( any life stage from egg to adult ) and often provision their own nests with such hosts . Unlike true parasites , the wasp larvae eventually kill their hosts . Solitary wasps parasitize almost every pest insect , making wasps valuable in horticulture for biological pest control of species such as whitefly in tomatoes and other crops .",
  "/wiki/Cleaner_Shrimp": "Cleaner shrimp is a common name for a number of swimming decapod crustaceans , that clean other organisms of parasites . They belong to any of three families , Hippolytidae ( including the Pacific cleaner shrimp , Lysmata amboinensis ) , Palaemonidae ( including the spotted Periclimenes magnificus ) , and Stenopodidae ( including the banded coral shrimp , Stenopus hispidus ) . The last of these families is more closely related to lobsters and crabs than it is to the remaining families . The term cleaner shrimp is sometimes used more specifically for the family Hippolytidae and the genus Lysmata . Cleaner shrimp are so called because they exhibit a cleaning symbiosis with client fish where the shrimp clean parasites from the fish . The fish benefit by having parasites removed from them , and the shrimp gain the nutritional value of the parasites . The shrimp also eat the mucus and parasites around the wounds of injured fish , which reduces infections and helps healing . The action of cleansing further aids the health of client fish by reducing their stress levels . In many coral reefs , cleaner shrimp congregate at cleaning stations . In this behaviour cleaner shrimps are similar to cleaner fish , and sometimes may join with cleaner wrasse and other cleaner fish attending to client fish . Shrimp of the genus Urocaridella are often cryptic or live in caves on the reef and are not associated commensally with other animals . These shrimp assemble around cleaning stations where up to 25 shrimp live in proximity .",
