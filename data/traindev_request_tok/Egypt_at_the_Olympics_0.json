It marked the second and final time the International Olympic Committee gathered to vote in a city that was bidding to host those Games .

The games were the first to be televised , and radio broadcasts reached 41 countries . Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl was commissioned by the German Olympic Committee to film the Games for $ 7 million . Her film , titled Olympia , pioneered many of the techniques now common in the filming of sports . Hitler saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy and antisemitism , and the official Nazi party paper , the V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter , wrote in the strongest terms that Jews should not be allowed to participate in the Games . German Jewish athletes were barred or prevented from taking part by a variety of methods , although some women swimmers from the Jewish sports club , Hakoah Vienna , did take part . Jewish athletes from other countries seem to have been side-lined in order not to offend the Nazi regime . Total ticket revenues were 7.5 million Reichsmark , generating a profit of over one million \u211b\u2133 .
