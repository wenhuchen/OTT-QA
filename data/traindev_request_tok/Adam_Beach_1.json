Within the United States , the government federally recognizes the Comanche people as the Comanche Nation , headquartered in Lawton , Oklahoma . The Comanche became the dominant tribe on the southern Great Plains in the 18th and 19th centuries . They are often characterized [ by whom ? ] as Lords of the Plains and , reflecting their erstwhile prominence , they presided over a large area called Comancheria , which came to include large portions of present-day Texas , Colorado , New Mexico , Oklahoma and Kansas . Comanche power depended on bison , horses , trading , and raiding . The Comanche hunted the bison of the Great Plains for food and skins ; their adoption of the horse from Spanish colonists in New Mexico made them more mobile ; they traded with the Spanish , French , Americans and neighboring Native-American peoples ; and ( most famously ) they waged war on and raided European settlements as well as other Native Americans . They took captives from weaker tribes during warfare , using them as slaves or selling them to the Spanish and ( later ) Mexican settlers . They also took thousands of captives from the Spanish , Mexican , and American settlers and incorporated them into Comanche society . Decimated by European diseases , warfare , and encroachment by Americans on Comancheria , most Comanches were forced into life on the reservation ; a few however sought refuge with the Mescalero Apaches in New Mexico , or with the Kickapoos in Mexico . A number of them returned in the 1890s and early 1900s . In the 21st century , the Comanche Nation has 17,000 members , around 7,000 of whom reside in tribal jurisdictional areas around Lawton , Fort Sill , and the surrounding areas of southwestern Oklahoma ."
