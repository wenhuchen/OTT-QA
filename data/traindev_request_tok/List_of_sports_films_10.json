Among the period 's most dominant champions , Johnson remains a boxing legend , with his 1910 fight against James J. Jeffries dubbed the fight of the century . According to filmmaker Ken Burns , for more than thirteen years , Jack Johnson was the most famous and the most notorious African-American on Earth . Transcending boxing , he became part of the culture and the history of racism in America . In 1912 , Johnson opened a successful and luxurious black and tan ( desegregated ) restaurant and nightclub , which in part was run by his wife , a white woman . Major newspapers of the time soon claimed that Johnson was attacked by the government only after he became famous as a black man married to a white woman , and was linked to other white women . Johnson was arrested on charges of violating the Mann Act - forbidding one to transport a woman across state lines for immoral purposes - a racially motivated charge that embroiled him in controversy for his relationships , including marriages , with white women . There were also allegations of domestic violence . Sentenced to a year in prison , Johnson fled the country and fought boxing matches abroad for seven years until 1920 when he served his sentence at the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth .

Short was an abbreviation for either term . The increasingly rare industry term short subject carries more of an assumption that the film is shown as part of a presentation along with a feature film . Short films are often screened at local , national , or international film festivals and made by independent filmmakers with either a low budget or no budget at all . They are usually funded by film grants , nonprofit organizations , sponsor , or personal funds . Short films are generally used for industry experience and as a platform to showcase talent to secure funding for future projects from private investors , a production company , or film studios .",

Arbuckle was the defendant in three widely publicized trials between November 1921 and April 1922 for the alleged rape and manslaughter of actress Virginia Rappe . Rappe had fallen ill at a party hosted by Arbuckle at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco in September 1921 , and she died four days later . A friend of Rappe accused Arbuckle of raping and accidentally killing her . The first two trials resulted in hung juries , but Buster Keaton defended him in the third trial , which acquitted him , and the jury gave him a formal written statement of apology . Despite Arbuckle 's acquittal , the scandal has mostly overshadowed his legacy as a pioneering comedian . His films were banned by motion picture industry censor Will H. Hays after the trial and he was publicly ostracized . Hays lifted the ban within a year , but Arbuckle only worked sparingly through the 1920s . Keaton made an agreement to give him 35 percent of his profit from Buster Keaton Comedies Co .",
