The name Beaufort refers to a castle in Champagne , France ( now Montmorency-Beaufort ) . It is the only current dukedom to take its name from a place outside the British Isles . [ citation needed ] The Dukes of Beaufort descend in the male line from the House of Plantagenet through John of Gaunt , son of Edward III . This statement was challenged after the analysis of the Y chromosomal DNA of the remains of Richard III . Most living male heirs of the 5th Duke of Beaufort were found to carry a relatively common Y chromosome type , which is different from the rare lineage found in Richard III 's remains . The instance of false paternity could have occurred anywhere in the numerous generations separating Richard III from the 5th Duke of Beaufort . The break also could have occurred with Richard III 's grandfather Richard of Conisburgh , whose paternity has been called into question although he was acknowledged by his father . The Beaufort Castle was in possession of John of Gaunt , and the surname Beaufort was given to Gaunt 's four legitimised children by his mistress and third wife , Katherine Swynford .

The title was created again , this time for the Stanley family , in 1485 .
