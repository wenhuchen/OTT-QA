  "/wiki/Juno_Awards_of_1994": "The Juno Awards of 1994 , representing Canadian music industry achievements of the previous year , were awarded on 20 March 1994 in Toronto at a ceremony in the O'Keefe Centre . Roch Voisine was the host for the ceremonies , which were taped that afternoon for broadcast that evening on CBC Television . Nominations were announced 8 February 1994 . Starting in 1994 , the Best New Solo Artist combined the former Most Promising Male and Female Vocalist categories . Reggae also received its own category , after years of being included under banners such as world beat or mixed with calypso . A new category for aboriginal music was also introduced and was awarded by Robbie Robertson . The award faced controversy after nominee Sazacha Red Sky was accused of cultural appropriation by Leonard George son of Chief Dan George , the alleged writer of the song that has since been registered as Public Domain , because she was not personally a member of the Tsleil-Waututh First Nation and according to Leonard George did not have the right to record it under their cultural traditions . His son Leonard George sought a legal injunction to prevent the award from being presented at the Juno Awards ceremony at all , and a final compromise revising Red Sky 's nomination to reflect the album instead of the song was announced on the morning of the ceremony . Around the time of the 1994 ceremonies , there were plans to host the 1995 ceremonies in Winnipeg . However , Juno organisers CARAS was demanding substantial funding from the Winnipeg committee attempting to host the awards . Atlantic group The Rankin Family was the major winner in 1994 , winning awards in four categories including Entertainer of the Year .",
