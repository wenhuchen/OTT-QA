It borders Bosnia-Herzegovina to the northwest , Serbia to the northeast , Kosovo [ a ] to the east , Albania to the southeast , the Adriatic Sea to the southwest , and Croatia to the west . Montenegro has an area of 13,812 square kilometres and a population of 620,079 ( 2011 census ) . Its capital Podgorica is one of the twenty-three municipalities in the country . Cetinje is designated as the Old Royal Capital . During the Early Medieval period , three principalities were located on the territory of modern-day Montenegro : Duklja , roughly corresponding to the southern half ; Travunia , the west ; and Rascia proper , the north . In 1042 , archon Stefan Vojislav led a revolt that resulted in the independence of Duklja from the Byzantine Empire and the establishment of the Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty . After being ruled by the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty for two centuries , the independent Principality of Zeta emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries , ruled by the House of Bal\u0161i\u0107 between 1356 and 1421 , and by the House of Crnojevi\u0107 between 1431 and 1498 , when the name Montenegro started being used for the country . After falling under Ottoman rule , Montenegro regained de facto independence in 1697 under the rule of the House of Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 , first under the theocratic rule of prince-bishops , before being transformed into a secular principality in 1852 . Montenegro 's de jure independence was recognised by the Great Powers at the Congress of Berlin in 1878 , following the Montenegrin-Ottoman War . In 1905 , the country became a kingdom . After World War I , it became part of Yugoslavia .",

  "/wiki/Turkish_bath": "A Turkish bath ( Turkish : hamam , Arabic : \u062d\u0645\u0651\u0627\u0645 , romanized : \u1e25amm\u0101m ) is a place of public bathing associated with the culture of the Ottoman Empire and more widely the Islamic world . A variation on it as a method of cleansing and relaxation became popular during the Victorian era , and then spread through the British Empire and Western Europe . The buildings are similar to Roman thermae . Unlike Russian saunas ( banya ) , which use steam , Turkish baths focus on water . The particular bathing process roughly parallels ancient Roman bathing practices . It starts with relaxation in a room heated by a continuous flow of hot , dry air , allowing the bather to perspire freely . Bathers may then move to an even hotter room before they wash in cold water . After performing a full body wash and receiving a massage , bathers finally retire to the cooling-room for a period of relaxation . Unlike a hammam , Victorian Turkish baths use hot , dry air ; in the Islamic hammam the air is often steamy . The bather in a Victorian Ottoman bath will often take a plunge in a cold pool after the hot rooms ; the Islamic hammam usually does not have a pool unless the water is flowing from a spring . In the Islamic hammams , the bathers splash themselves with cold water . The Victorian Turkish bath was described by Johann Ludwig Wilhelm Thudichum in a lecture to the Royal Society of Medicine given in 1861 , one year after the first such bath was opened in London :",
