Even before the Republicans finally took control of the seat , the 4th had been a rather conservative district . Like in most of the state , the old-line Southern Democrats began splitting their tickets as early as the 1940s . However , this area 's white conservatives became increasingly willing to support Republicans at the state and local level as early as the 1970s , well before the rest of the state swung Republican . The district is a major destination for presidential candidates in election years , as South Carolina is one of the first states to hold a presidential primary . Republican William Timmons has represented the district since January 3 , 2019 . He succeeded Republican Trey Gowdy who did not seek reelection ."
