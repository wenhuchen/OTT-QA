The club was founded in 1908 as H\u0160K Zagreb , meaning Hrvatski \u0160portski Klub Zagreb ( English : Croatian Athletic Club Zagreb ) . In 2018 after managing Stadion Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva as their home ground since 1946 for 72 years , NK Zagreb was denied of new managing contract by the city 's officials which in the end led to eviction from the venue in October 2018 . So , as of 2018-19 season NK Zagreb is using their training camp ZAGREBello venue as a home ground for its official fixtures which is located in Vesla\u010dka street . The team 's traditional home colours are white shirts , shorts and socks which is the reason why they are referred to as Bijeli in Croatian , meaning The Whites . Another popular nickname of the club is The Poets , Pjesnici in Croatian , due to their former location of home ground at Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva street which is named after Croatian poet Silvije Strahimir Kranj\u010devi\u0107 .

Also , NK Zagreb participated several times in the European competitions like UEFA Champions League ( 2 ) , UEFA Cup Winners ' Cup ( 4 ) , UEFA Intertoto Cup ( 10 ) and Inter-Cities Fairs Cup ( 10 ) ."
