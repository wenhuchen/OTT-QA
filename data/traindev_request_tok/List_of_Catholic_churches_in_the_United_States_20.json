  "/wiki/Minor_basilica": "A minor basilica ( Latin : Basilica minor , Basilic\u00e6 minores in plural ) is a Catholic church building that has been granted the title of basilica by the Holy See or immemorial custom . Presently , the authorising decree is granted by the Pope through the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments . In relation to churches , writers on architecture use the term basilica to describe a church built in a particular style . The early Christian purpose-built cathedral basilica of the bishop was in this style , constructed on the model of the semi-public secular basilicas , and its growth in size and importance signalled the gradual transfer of civic power into episcopal hands , which was under way in the 5th century . In the 18th century , the term took on a canonical sense , unrelated to this architectural style . Basilicas in this canonical sense are divided into major ( greater ) and minor basilicas . Today only four , all in Rome , are classified as major basilicas .",
  "/wiki/Benjamin_Henry_Latrobe": "Benjamin Henry Boneval Latrobe ( May 1 , 1764 - September 3 , 1820 ) was a British-American neoclassical architect who emigrated to the United States . He was one of the first formally trained , professional architects in the new United States , drawing on influences from his travels in Italy , as well as British and French Neoclassical architects such as Claude Nicolas Ledoux . In his thirties , he emigrated to the new United States and designed the United States Capitol , on Capitol Hill in Washington , D.C. , as well as the Old Baltimore Cathedral or The Baltimore Basilica , ( later renamed the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary ) . It is the first Cathedral constructed in the United States for any Christian denomination . Latrobe also designed the largest structure in America at the time , the Merchants ' Exchange in Baltimore . With extensive balconied atriums through the wings and a large central rotunda under a low dome which dominated the city , it was completed in 1820 after five years of work and endured into the early twentieth century . Latrobe emigrated in 1796 , initially settling in Virginia where he worked on the Virginia State Penitentiary in Richmond . Latrobe then moved to Philadelphia where he established his practice . In 1803 , he was hired as Surveyor of the Public Buildings of the United States , and spent much of the next fourteen years working on projects in the new national capital of Washington , D.C. , ( in the newly-laid out Federal capital of the District of Columbia ) where he served as the second Architect of the Capitol . He also was responsible for the design of the White House porticos . Latrobe spent the later years of his life in New Orleans , Louisiana working on a waterworks project , and died there in 1820 from yellow fever . Latrobe has been called the father of American architecture .",
  "/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland .",

It was built from 1806 through 1808 by French architect J. Maximilian M. Godefroy for the French Sulpician priests of St. Mary 's Seminary . Godefroy claimed that his design was the first Gothic building in America . St. Mary 's Seminary ( now St. Mary 's Seminary and University ) , founded in 1791 , is the oldest Roman Catholic seminary in the United States and the site also included a secular St. Mary 's College , from 1805-1852 . Godefroy also designed in Baltimore , the First Unitarian Church at West Franklin and North Charles Streets during 1817 and the Battle Monument , constructed 1815-1822 in the old Courthouse Square at North Calvert Street , between East Lexington and East Fayette Streets , commemorating the city 's dead during the British attack in the War of 1812 's Battle of Baltimore with the bombardment of Fort McHenry and the Battle of North Point in September 1814 . It is located adjacent to the Mother Seton House . Originally the chapel was surrounded by a quadrangle of four-story buildings of brick Georgian/Federal design with peaked roofs and dormer windows . On one side was a long seminary building and on the other was an L-shaped larger , but similar architectured structure built for the secular College , after it was established in 1805 . These were later replaced on the same site by buildings in 1876-78 of Victorian/Second Empire style with mansard roofs although the central chapel of Godefroy endured . In the 1970s , the Victorian buildings were unfortunately also razed leaving St. Mary 's Park with a historic bandstand to now surround the old Chapel and Mother Seton House .
