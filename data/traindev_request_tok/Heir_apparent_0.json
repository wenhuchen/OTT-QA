The Duchy of Brabant was a feudal elevation of the existing ( since 1085/1086 ) title of landgrave of Brabant . This was an Imperial fief which was assigned to Count Henry III of Leuven shortly after the death of the preceding count of Brabant , Herman II of Lotharingia ( born 20 September 1085 ) . Although the corresponding county was quite small ( limited to the territory between the rivers Senne and Dender ) its name was applied to the entire country under control of the dukes from the 13th century on . In 1190 , after the death of Godfrey III , Henry I also became duke of Lotharingia . Formerly Lower Lotharingia , this title was now practically without territorial authority , but was borne by the later dukes of Brabant as an honorific title . In 1288 , the dukes of Brabant became also dukes of Limburg . The title fell to the dukes of Burgundy in 1430 . Later on , it followed with the Burgundian inheritance until the French Revolution , although the northern part of the territory of Brabant was actually governed by the United Provinces during the 17th and 18th century ( see Generality Lands ) . Today , the title of duke or duchess of Brabant designates , since the Royal Decree of December 16 1840 ( amended in 1991 ) , the heir apparent to the throne of Belgium .
