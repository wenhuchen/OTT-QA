Mostly located in the Southern Hemisphere , it is the third largest country subdivision in the Southern Hemisphere after the Australian states of Western Australia and Queensland . It would be the sixteenth largest country in land area , slightly larger than Mongolia . Neighbouring states are ( from the north clockwise ) Roraima , Par\u00e1 , Mato Grosso , Rond\u00f4nia , and Acre . It also borders the nations of Peru , Colombia and Venezuela . This includes the Departments of Amazonas , Vaup\u00e9s and Guain\u00eda in Colombia , as well as the Amazonas state in Venezuela , and the Loreto Region in Peru . Amazonas is named after the Amazon River , and was formerly part of the Spanish Empire 's Viceroyalty of Peru , a region called Spanish Guyana . It was settled by the Portuguese moving northwest from Brazil in the early 18th century and incorporated into the Portuguese empire after the Treaty of Madrid in 1750 . It became a state under the First Brazilian Republic in 1889 . Most of the state is tropical jungle ; cities are clustered along navigable waterways and are accessible only by boat or plane .

With a visual apparent magnitude of \u22121.46 , Sirius is almost twice as bright as Canopus , the next brightest star . Sirius is a binary star consisting of a main-sequence star of spectral type A0 or A1 , termed Sirius A , and a faint white dwarf companion of spectral type DA2 , termed Sirius B . The distance between the two varies between 8.2 and 31.5 astronomical units as they orbit every 50 years . Sirius appears bright because of its intrinsic luminosity and its proximity to the Solar System . At a distance of 2.64 parsecs ( 8.6 ly ) , the Sirius system is one of Earth 's nearest neighbours . Sirius is gradually moving closer to the Solar System , so it will slightly increase in brightness over the next 60,000 years . After that time , its distance will begin to increase , and it will become fainter , but it will continue to be the brightest star in the Earth 's night sky for the next 210,000 years . Sirius A is about twice as massive as the Sun ( M\u2609 ) and has an absolute visual magnitude of +1.42 .

Parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission provide an estimated distance to this star of around 63.7 light-years ( 19.5 parsecs ) from the Sun . Epsilon Scorpii has a stellar classification of K1 III , which indicates it has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and evolved into a giant star .

The state is also known for its natural environment , and is a destination for domestic and international tourism . The Pantanal lowlands cover 12 municipalities and presents a variety of flora and fauna , with forests , natural sand banks , savannahs , open pasture , fields and bushes . The city Bonito , in the mountain of Bodoquena , has prehistoric caves , natural rivers , waterfalls , swimming pools and the Blue Lake cave . The name Mato Grosso do Sul is Portuguese for Thick Bushes of the South ; the name is inherited from its northern neighbour state of Mato Grosso , of which it was part until the 1970s . It is not uncommon for people to mistakenly refer to Mato Grosso do Sul as simply Mato Grosso . Other names that were proposed , at the time of the split and afterwards , include Pantanal ( a reference to its best known geographical feature ) and Maracaju ( a reference to the Maracaju Mountain Range that crosses the state from north to south ) .",

  "/wiki/Acre_(state)": "Acre ( [ \u02c8ak\u027ei ] ( listen ) ) is a state located in the northern region of Brazil . Located in the westernmost part of the country with a two hour time difference from Bras\u00edlia , Acre is bordered clockwise by the Brazilian states of Amazonas to the north and northeast , Rond\u00f4nia to the east , the Bolivian department of Pando to the southeast , and the Peruvian regions of Madre de Dios , Ucayali and Loreto to the south and west . It occupies an area of 152,581.4 km2 . Its capital and largest city is Rio Branco . Other important places include Cruzeiro do Sul , Sena Madureira , Tarauac\u00e1 and Feij\u00f3 . Intense extractive activity , which reached its height in the 20th century , attracted Brazilians from many regions to the state . From the mixture of sulista , southeastern Brazil , nordestino , and indigenous traditions arose a diverse cuisine , which unites sun-dried meat ( carne-de-sol ) with pirarucu , a typical fish of the region . Such dishes are seasoned with tucupi , a sauce made from manioc . Fluvial transport , concentrated on the Juru\u00e1 and Moa rivers , in the western part of the state , and the Tarauac\u00e1 and Envira Rivers in the northwest , is the principal form of transportation , especially between November and June , when rain leaves impassable the BR-364 , which connects Rio Branco to Cruzeiro do Sul .",
  "/wiki/Gamma_Hydrae": "Gamma Hydrae ( \u03b3 Hya , \u03b3 Hydrae ) is a star in the equatorial constellation of Hydra . It has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.0 , placing it second in brightness among the members of this generally faint constellation . Based upon parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission , this star is at a distance of around 133.8 light-years ( 41.0 parsecs ) from Earth . The stellar spectrum matches a stellar classification of G8 III , with the luminosity class of III indicating it has evolved into a giant star after exhausting the supply of hydrogen at its core . It has nearly three times the mass of the Sun and 16 times the Sun 's radius . The star is radiating 115 times the Sun 's luminosity from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 5,019 K. This heat gives it the yellow glow of a K-type star . Despite having reached an advanced stage in its evolution , it is considerably younger than the Sun with an age of around 372 million years . This is because higher mass stars consume their nuclear fuel at a more rapid rate .",

As the richest Brazilian state and a major industrial complex , often dubbed the locomotive of Brazil , the state is responsible for 33.9% of the Brazilian GDP . S\u00e3o Paulo also has the second highest Human Development Index ( HDI ) and GDP per capita , the fourth lowest infant mortality rate , the third highest life expectancy , and the third lowest rate of illiteracy among the federative units of Brazil , being by far , the safest state in the country . The homicide rate is 3.8 per 100 thousand as of 2018 , almost 1/4 of the Brazilian rate . S\u00e3o Paulo alone is richer than Argentina , Uruguay , Paraguay and Bolivia combined . The economy of S\u00e3o Paulo State is the most developed in Brazil . With more than 46 million inhabitants in 2019 , S\u00e3o Paulo is the most populous Brazilian state , the most populous national subdivision in the Americas , and the third most populous political unit of South America , surpassed only by the rest of the Brazilian Federation and Colombia . The local population is one of the most diverse in the country and descended mostly from Italians , who began immigrating to the country in the late 19th century ; of the Portuguese , who colonized Brazil and installed the first European settlements in the region ; indigenous peoples , many distinct ethnic groups ; Africans , who were brought from Africa as slaves in the colonial era and migrants from other regions of the country . In addition , Arabs , Germans , Spanish , Japanese , Chinese , and Greeks also are present in the ethnic composition of the local population . The area that today corresponds to the state territory was already inhabited by indigenous peoples from approximately 12,000 BC . In the early 16th century , the coast of the region was visited by Portuguese and Spanish explorers and navigators . In 1532 Martim Afonso de Sousa would establish the first Portuguese permanent settlement in the Americas - the village of S\u00e3o Vicente , in the Baixada Santista .",
