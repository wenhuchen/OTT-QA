However , that is not the only possible inference . HoheLied has been translated as ode hosannas praises and used in purely secular as well as religious contexts . Most telling in this case is the use in German of the entire phrase to describe the great song of love or ode to love in Pauls First Epistle to the Corinthians . This creates a double layer of meaning to the title of the novel in German , one that could not be duplicated in an English rendition . The 1914 play , The Song of Songs by Edward Sheldon also contributed to this version .
