The island remained rural until the growth of Barrow-in-Furness ' industries in the nineteenth century . In particular , the development between 1867 and 1881 of docks at Barrow Island , in Walney Channel opposite Walney , encouraged the growth of Walney as a settlement . The planned worker town of Vickerstown was built on the island in 1898 , resulting in a large population increase , and the construction of Jubilee Bridge connecting Walney to the mainland in 1908 .

  "/wiki/Askam-in-Furness": "Askam and Ireleth is a civil parish close to Barrow-in-Furness in the county of Cumbria , in North West England . Historically part of Lancashire , it originally consisted of two separate coastal villages with different origins and histories which , in recent times , have merged to become one continuous settlement . The population of the civil parish taken at the 2011 Census was 3,632 . Ireleth has its origins as a mediaeval farming village clustered on the hillside overlooking the flat sands of the Duddon Estuary . Askam was established following the discovery of large quantities of iron ore near the village in the middle of the 18th century . The pair originally fell within the boundaries of the Hundred of Lonsdale 'north of the sands ' in the historic county of Lancashire , but following local government reforms in 1974 became part of the county of Cumbria , along with the rest of Furness . The nearby River Duddon estuary and surrounding countryside have made the area well known for its wildlife , while the villages ' exposed position on the eastern bank facing the Irish Sea have encouraged the establishment of wind energy generation , amid local controversy .",

  "/wiki/Borough_of_Copeland": "The Borough of Copeland is a local government district and borough in western Cumbria , England . Its council is based in Whitehaven . It was formed on 1 April 1974 by the merger of the Borough of Whitehaven , Ennerdale Rural District and Millom Rural District . The population of the Non-Metropolitan district at the 2011 Census was 70,603 . The name is derived from an alternative name for the Cumberland ward of Allerdale above Derwent , which covered roughly the same area . There are different explanations for the name . According to a document issued at the time of the borough 's grant of arms , the name is derived from kaupland , meaning bought land , referring to an area of the Forest bought from the estate of St Bees Priory . However , Angus Winchester ( 1985 ) holds that the name derives from the time of the Irish-Norse invasion of the area in the tenth century ( Wainwright 1975 ) . According to this explanation , the area was purchased from the Kingdom of Strathclyde , possibly with loot from Ireland . Geoffrey Hodgson ( 2008 ) argues that this Viking invasion accounts for the high frequency of the surname Hodgson in the area .",
