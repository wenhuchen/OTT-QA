  "/wiki/Cleeve_Abbey": "Cleeve Abbey is a medieval monastery located near the village of Washford , in Somerset , England . It is a Grade I listed building and has been scheduled as an ancient monument . The abbey was founded in the late twelfth century as a house for monks of the austere Cistercian order . Over its 350-year monastic history Cleeve was undistinguished amongst the abbeys of its order , frequently ill-governed and often financially troubled . The sole member of the community to achieve prominence was John Hooper , who became a bishop during the Reformation . In 1536 Cleeve was closed by Henry VIII in the course of the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the abbey was converted into a country house . Subsequently , the status of the site declined and the abbey was used as farm buildings until the latter half of the nineteenth century when steps were taken to conserve the remains . In the twentieth century Cleeve was taken into state care ; the abbey is now looked after by English Heritage and is open to the public . Today Cleeve Abbey is one of the best-preserved medieval Cistercian monastic sites in Britain . While the church is no longer standing , the conventual buildings are still roofed and habitable and contain many features of particular interest including the 'angel ' roof in the refectory and the wall paintings in the painted chamber .",
  "/wiki/Abbey": "An abbey is a complex of buildings , a type of monastery used by members of a religious order under the governance of an abbot or abbess . It provides a place for religious activities , work , and housing of Christian monks and nuns . The concept of the abbey has developed over many centuries from the early monastic ways of religious men and women where they would live isolated from the lay community about them . Religious life in an abbey may be monastic . An abbey may be the home of an enclosed religious order or may be open to visitors . The layout of the church and associated buildings of an abbey often follows a set plan determined by the founding religious order . Abbeys are often self-sufficient while using any abundance of produce or skill to provide care to the poor and needy , refuge to the persecuted , or education to the young . Some abbeys offer accommodation to people who are seeking spiritual retreat . There are many famous abbeys across Europe .",
  "/wiki/Dunster_Butter_Cross": "The Butter Cross in Dunster within the English county of Somerset is a Grade II* listed building and ancient monument . The cross was originally erected in the late 14th or early 15th century in the main street , and was moved to its current site in the late 18th or early 19th century . Although the head of the cross is missing , the shaft and socket stone are original . The cross is in the care of English Heritage and is managed by the National Trust .",
  "/wiki/High_cross": "A high cross or standing cross ( Irish : cros ard / ardchros , Scottish Gaelic : crois \u00e0rd / \u00e0rd-chrois , Welsh : croes uchel / croes eglwysig ) is a free-standing Christian cross made of stone and often richly decorated . There was a unique Early Medieval tradition in Ireland and Britain of raising large sculpted stone crosses , usually outdoors . These probably developed from earlier traditions using wood , perhaps with metalwork attachments , and earlier pagan Celtic memorial stones ; the Pictish stones of Scotland may also have influenced the form . The earliest surviving examples seem to come from the territory of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria , which had been converted to Christianity by Irish missionaries ; it remains unclear whether the form first developed in Ireland or Britain . Their relief decoration is a mixture of religious figures and sections of decoration such as knotwork , interlace and in Britain vine-scrolls , all in the styles also found in insular art in other media such as illuminated manuscripts and metalwork . They were probably normally painted , perhaps over a modelled layer of plaster ; with the loss of paint and the effects of weathering the reliefs , in particular scenes crowded with small figures , are often now rather indistinct and hard to read . The earlier crosses were typically up to about two metres or eight feet high , but in Ireland examples up to three times higher appear later , retaining thick massive proportions , giving large surface areas for carving . The tallest of the Irish crosses is the so-called Tall Cross at Monasterboice , County Louth . It stands at seven metres or twenty-two feet high . Anglo-Saxon examples mostly remained slender in comparison , but could be large ; except in earlier Northumbrian examples their decoration is mostly ornamental rather than figures . The crosses often , though not always , feature a stone ring around the intersection , forming a Celtic cross ; this seems clearly an innovation of Celtic Christianity , perhaps at Iona . The term high cross is mainly used in Ireland and Scotland , but the tradition across Britain and Ireland is essentially a single phenomenon , though there are certainly strong regional variations .",
  "/wiki/Gallox_Bridge,_Dunster": "The Gallox Bridge in Dunster , Somerset , England dates from the 15th century . It has been designated as a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument . The bridge is in the guardianship of English Heritage . The stone packhorse bridge crosses the River Avill at the southern end of the village , below Dunster Castle at a point which may have been the limit of tidal flow during the medieval period . It was important for the transport of wool and other goods to the market within the village which was established by 1222 . The name is derived from the nearby gallows . The narrow bridge is approach via a raised causeway for pedestrians , while wheeled traffic uses the adjacent ford .",
  "/wiki/Arch_bridge": "An arch bridge is a bridge with abutments at each end shaped as a curved arch . Arch bridges work by transferring the weight of the bridge and its loads partially into a horizontal thrust restrained by the abutments at either side . A viaduct ( a long bridge ) may be made from a series of arches , although other more economical structures are typically used today .",
  "/wiki/Yarn_Market,_Dunster": "The Yarn Market in Dunster , Somerset , England was built in the early 17th century . It has been designated as a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument . Dunster was an important market place in the Middle Ages particularly following the construction of Dunster Castle and the establishment of the Priory Church of St George . The market cross was probably built in 1609 by the Luttrell family who were the local lords of the manor to maintain the importance of the village as a market , particularly for wool and cloth . It still bears the damage caused by cannon fire in the Civil War . Nearby was an older cross known as the Butter Cross which has subsequently been moved to the outskirts of the village . The Yarn Market is an octagonal building constructed around a central pier . The tiled roof provides shelter from the rain .",
  "/wiki/Market_hall": "A Market hall is a covered space or a building where food and other articles are sold from stalls by independent vendors . A market hall is a type of indoor market and is especially common in many European countries . A food hall , the most usual variation of a market hall , is a large section of a department store , where food is sold according to the Oxford Dictionary . Market halls and food halls can also be unconnected to department stores and operate independently , often in a separate building . A modern market hall may also exist in the form of what is nominally a gourmet food hall or a public market , for example in Stockholm 's \u00d6stermalm Saluhall or Mexico City 's Mercado Roma . The terms Food hall and Food court must not be confused with each other . A food court means a place where the fast food chain outlets are located in a shopping mall . Unlike food courts made up of fast food chains , food halls typically mix local artisan restaurants , butcher shops and other food-oriented boutiques under one roof . The term food hall in the British sense , meaning an equivalent of a market hall , is increasingly used in the United States . In some Asia-Pacific countries , food hall is equivalent to a North American food court , or the terms are used interchangeably .",
  "/wiki/Farleigh_Hungerford_Castle": "Farleigh Hungerford Castle , sometimes called Farleigh Castle or Farley Castle , is a medieval castle in Farleigh Hungerford , Somerset , England . The castle was built in two phases : the inner court was constructed between 1377 and 1383 by Sir Thomas Hungerford , who made his fortune as steward to John of Gaunt . The castle was built to a quadrangular design , already slightly old-fashioned , on the site of an existing manor house overlooking the River Frome . A deer park was attached to the castle , requiring the destruction of the nearby village . Sir Thomass son , Sir Walter Hungerford , a knight and leading courtier to Henry V , became rich during the Hundred Years War with France and extended the castle with an additional , outer court , enclosing the parish church in the process . By Walter 's death in 1449 , the substantial castle was richly appointed , and its chapel decorated with murals . The castle largely remained in the hands of the Hungerford family over the next two centuries , despite periods during the War of the Roses in which it was held by the Crown following the attainder and execution of members of the family . At the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 , the castle , modernized to the latest Tudor and Stuart fashions , was held by Sir Edward Hungerford . Edward declared his support for Parliament , becoming a leader of the Roundheads in Wiltshire . Farleigh Hungerford was seized by Royalist forces in 1643 , but recaptured by Parliament without a fight near the end of the conflict in 1645 . As a result , it escaped slighting following the war , unlike many other castles in the south-west of England . The last member of the Hungerford family to hold the castle , Sir Edward Hungerford , inherited it in 1657 , but his gambling and extravagance forced him to sell the property in 1686 .",
  "/wiki/Castle": "A castle is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages predominantly by the nobility or royalty and by military orders . Scholars debate the scope of the word castle , but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble . This is distinct from a palace , which is not fortified ; from a fortress , which was not always a residence for royalty or nobility ; and from a fortified settlement , which was a public defence - though there are many similarities among these types of construction . Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses . Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built , they took on a great many forms with many different features , although some , such as curtain walls , arrowslits , and portcullises , were commonplace . European-style castles originated in the 9th and 10th centuries , after the fall of the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes . These nobles built castles to control the area immediately surrounding them and the castles were both offensive and defensive structures ; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as offered protection from enemies . Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies , the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power . Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes , and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community , such as mills , fertile land , or a water source . Many northern European castles were originally built from earth and timber , but had their defences replaced later by stone . Early castles often exploited natural defences , lacking features such as towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep . In the late 12th and early 13th centuries , a scientific approach to castle defence emerged .",
  "/wiki/The_Tribunal,_Glastonbury": "The Tribunal in Glastonbury , Somerset , England , was built in the 15th century as a merchant 's house . It has been designated as a Grade I listed building . The history of the building is not well documented , although the majority of the present stone house was constructed in the 15th century on the site of a 12th-century wooden building . The current front wall was added in the 16th century . It has been used as a merchant 's house and possibly a shop and school . It was thought that it was the venue for court proceedings , hence the title Tribunal , however there is no evidence this ever occurred . One of the ground floor rooms still has the window and ceiling panels from the Elizabethan era . The front room upstairs has an arched braced , wooden , truss roof . The building is currently in the guardianship of English Heritage and used as a tourist information centre . On the first floor is the museum of the Glastonbury Antiquarian Society which houses artefacts from Glastonbury Lake Village including the Glastonbury Bowl . The bottom part of the bowl dates from the Iron Age and the upper part was added in the 1st century AD .",

It is the only surviving monastic fishery building in England . Fishing was an important source of food for the monks of Glastonbury Abbey . Fishing was carried out in artificial ponds , which were mentioned at Meare in the Domesday Book and from the River Brue and Meare Pool . The present rectangular stone building was constructed by the abbot between 1322 and 1335 for the storage and processing of the fish and as a residence for the chief fisherman . After the Dissolution of the Monasteries the building fell into disrepair and it was seriously damaged by fire in the 1880s .

  "/wiki/Fish_house": "An ice shanty ( also called an ice shack , ice house , fishing shanty , fish house , fish coop , bobhouse , ice hut , or darkhouse ) is a portable shed placed on a frozen lake to provide shelter during ice fishing . They can be as small and cheap as a plastic tarp draped over a frame of two-by-fours , or as expensive as a small cabin with heat , bunks , electricity and cooking facilities . More durable ice houses are generally left on a lake for the duration of the ice fishing season , although this can cause problems , such as thaws and re-freezing causing houses to be immoveably frozen onto the lake . Lighter , cheaper versions can collapse into a package to be moved from lake to lake during the season . Many northern communities have developed bodies of laws about the operation of ice shanties - frequently including dates by which they must be removed , even if the ice can still hold them .",

  "/wiki/Stanton_Drew_stone_circles": "The Stanton Drew stone circles are just outside the village of Stanton Drew in the English county of Somerset . The largest stone circle is the Great Circle , 113 metres ( 371 ft ) in diameter and the second largest stone circle in Britain ( after Avebury ) ; it is considered to be one of the largest Neolithic monuments to have been built . The date of construction is not known , but is thought to be between 3000 and 2000 BCE , which places it in the Late Neolithic to Early Bronze Age . It was made a scheduled monument in 1982 . The Great Circle was surrounded by a ditch and is accompanied by smaller stone circles to the northeast and southwest . There is also a group of three stones , known as The Cove , in the garden of the local pub . Slightly further from the Great Circle is a single stone , known as Hautville 's Quoit . Some of the stones are still vertical , but the majority are now recumbent , and some are no longer present . The stone circles have been studied since John Aubrey 's visit in 1664 , and some excavations of the site were performed in the 18th century . In the late 20th and early 21st centuries , geophysical surveys have confirmed the size of the stone circles and identified additional pits and postholes . The Cove has been shown to be around 1000 years older than the stone circles , and so date from 4000-3000 BCE . A variety of myths and legends about the stone circles have been recorded , including one about dancers at a celebration who have been turned to stone .",

  "/wiki/Neolithic": "The Neolithic ( /\u02ccni\u02d0o\u028a\u02c8l\u026a\u03b8\u026ak/ ( listen ) , also known as the New Stone Age ) , the final division of the Stone Age , began about 12,000 years ago when the first developments of farming appeared in the Epipalaeolithic Near East , and later in other parts of the world . The division lasted until the transitional period of the Chalcolithic from about 6,500 years ago ( 4500 BC ) , marked by the development of metallurgy , leading up to the Bronze Age and Iron Age . In Northern Europe , the Neolithic lasted until about 1700 BC , while in China it extended until 1200 BC . Other parts of the world ( including the New World ) remained broadly in the Neolithic stage of development until European contact . The Neolithic comprises a progression of behavioral and cultural characteristics and changes , including the use of wild and domestic crops and of domesticated animals . [ a ] The term Neolithic derives from the Greek \u03bd\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2 n\u00e9os , new and \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 l\u00edthos , stone , literally meaning New Stone Age .

  "/wiki/Megalithic_tomb": "A megalith is a large stone that has been used to construct a structure or monument , either alone or together with other stones . The adjective megalithic describes structures made of such large stones without the use of mortar [ citation needed ] or concrete , as well as the periods of prehistory characterised by such constructions . There are over 35,000 megaliths in Europe alone , ranging from Sweden to the Mediterranean sea The word was first used in 1849 by the British antiquarian Algernon Herbert in reference to Stonehenge and derives from the Ancient Greek \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 ( transliteration m\u00e9gas , meaning great ) and \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 ( transliteration l\u00edthos meaning stone ) .
