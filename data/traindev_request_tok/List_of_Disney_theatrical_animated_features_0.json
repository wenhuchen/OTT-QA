  "/wiki/The_Thief_and_the_Cobbler": "The Thief and the Cobbler is an animated fantasy film directed by Canadian-British animator Richard Williams . Originally conceived in the 1960s , the film was in and out of production for nearly three decades due to independent funding and ambitiously complex animation . It was finally placed into full production in 1989 when Warner Bros. agreed to finance and distribute the film . When production went over budget and fell behind schedule , the film was heavily cut and re-edited by producer Fred Calvert without Williams ' involvement ; it was eventually released in 1993 by Allied Filmmakers under the title The Princess and the Cobbler . Two years later , Miramax Films released another re-edit entitled Arabian Knight . Both versions of the film performed poorly and received mixed reviews . Over the years , various people and companies , including The Walt Disney Company 's Roy E. Disney , have discussed restoring the film to its original version . In 2013 , the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences archived Richard Williams ' own 35mm workprint . Williams himself acknowledged the film 's rehabilitated reputation , thanks to projects like the popular fan edit , The Recobbled Cut , and Persistence of Vision , a 2012 documentary of the film 's production . With The Thief and the Cobbler being in and out of production from 1964 until 1995 , a total of 31 years , it surpasses the 20-year Guinness record previously held by Tiefland ( 1954 ) . It was also the final film for several actors and artists , including animators Ken Harris ( died 1982 ) ; Grim Natwick ( died 1990 ) ; and Art Babbit ( died 1992 ) , as well as actors Felix Aylmer ( died 1979 ) ; Kenneth Williams ( died 1988 ) ; Sir Anthony Quayle ( died 1989 ) ; and Vincent Price ( died 1993 , a month after the film 's initial release ) .",
