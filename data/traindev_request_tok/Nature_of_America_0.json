  "/wiki/Rain_Forest": "Rainforests are forests characterized by high and continuous rainfall , with annual rainfall in the case of tropical rainforests between 2.5 and 4.5 metres ( 98 and 177 in ) and definitions varying by region for temperate rainforests . The monsoon trough , alternatively known as the intertropical convergence zone , plays a significant role in creating the climatic conditions necessary for the Earth 's tropical rainforests : which are distinct from monsoonal areas of seasonal tropical forest . Estimates vary from 40% to 75% of all biotic species are indigenous to the rainforests . There may be many millions of species of plants , insects and microorganisms still undiscovered in tropical rainforests . Tropical rainforests have been called the jewels of the Earth and the world 's largest pharmacy , because over one quarter of natural medicines have been discovered there . Rainforests are also responsible for 28% of the world 's oxygen turnover , sometimes misnamed oxygen production , processing it through photosynthesis from carbon dioxide and consuming it through respiration . The undergrowth in some areas of a rainforest can be restricted by poor penetration of sunlight to ground level . If the leaf canopy is destroyed or thinned , the ground beneath is soon colonized by a dense , tangled growth of vines , shrubs and small trees , called a jungle . The term jungle is also sometimes applied to tropical rainforests generally . Rainforests as well as endemic rainforest species are rapidly disappearing due to deforestation , the resulting habitat loss and pollution of the atmosphere .",

Net primary production is estimated at 21.9 gigatonnes carbon per year for tropical forests , 8.1 for temperate forests , and 2.6 for boreal forests . Forests at different latitudes and elevations form distinctly different ecozones : boreal forests around the poles , tropical forests around the Equator , and temperate forests at the middle latitudes . Higher elevation areas tend to support forests similar to those at higher latitudes , and amount of precipitation also affects forest composition . Human society and forests influence each other in both positive and negative ways . Forests provide ecosystem services to humans and serve as tourist attractions . Forests can also affect people 's health . Human activities , including harvesting forest resources , can negatively affect forest ecosystems .",

Unlike sea anemones , corals secrete hard carbonate exoskeletons that support and protect the coral . Most reefs grow best in warm , shallow , clear , sunny and agitated water . Coral reefs first appeared 485 million years ago , at the dawn of the Early Ordovician , displacing the microbial and sponge reefs of the Cambrian . Sometimes called rainforests of the sea , shallow coral reefs form some of Earth 's most diverse ecosystems . They occupy less than 0.1% of the world 's ocean area , about half the area of France , yet they provide a home for at least 25% of all marine species , including fish , mollusks , worms , crustaceans , echinoderms , sponges , tunicates and other cnidarians .

  "/wiki/Wetland": "A wetland is a distinct ecosystem that is flooded by water , either permanently or seasonally , where oxygen-free processes prevail . The primary factor that distinguishes wetlands from other land forms or water bodies is the characteristic vegetation of aquatic plants , adapted to the unique hydric soil . Wetlands play a number of functions , including water purification , water storage , processing of carbon and other nutrients , stabilization of shorelines , and support of plants and animals . Wetlands are also considered the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems , serving as home to a wide range of plant and animal life . Whether any individual wetland performs these functions , and the degree to which it performs them , depends on characteristics of that wetland and the lands and waters near it . Methods for rapidly assessing these functions , wetland ecological health , and general wetland condition have been developed in many regions and have contributed to wetland conservation partly by raising public awareness of the functions and the ecosystem services some wetlands provide . Wetlands occur naturally on every continent . The main wetland types are swamp , marsh , bog , and fen ; sub-types include mangrove forest , carr , pocosin , floodplains , mire , vernal pool , sink , and many others . Many peatlands are wetlands . The water in wetlands is either freshwater , brackish , or saltwater . Wetlands can be tidal ( inundated by tides ) or non-tidal .

Alpine tundra transitions to sub-alpine forests below the tree line ; stunted forests occurring at the forest-tundra ecotone are known as Krummholz . With increasing elevation it ends at the snow line where snow and ice persist through summer . Alpine tundra occurs in mountains worldwide . The flora of the alpine tundra is characterized by dwarf shrubs close to the ground . The cold climate of the alpine tundra is caused by adiabatic cooling of air , and is similar to polar climate .",
