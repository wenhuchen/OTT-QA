  "/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science": "A Bachelor of Science ( Latin Baccalaureus Scientiae , B.S. , BS , B.Sc . or BSc ; or , less commonly , S.B. , SB , or Sc.B. , from the equivalent Latin Scientiae Baccalaureus ) is an undergraduate academic degree awarded for programs that generally last three to five years . The first university to admit a student to the degree of Bachelor of Science was the University of London in 1860 . Whether a student of a particular subject is awarded a Bachelor of Science degree or a Bachelor of Arts degree can vary between universities . For example , an economics degree may be given as a Bachelor of Arts ( BA ) by one university but as a BS by another , and some universities offer the choice of either . Some liberal arts colleges in the United States offer only the BA , even in the natural sciences , while some universities offer only the BS , even in non-science fields . At universities that offer both BA and BS degrees in the same discipline , the BS degree is usually more extensive in that particular discipline and is targeted toward students who are pursuing graduate school or a profession in that field .",

  "/wiki/Gambler": "Gambling ( also known as betting ) is the wagering of money or something of value ( referred to as the stakes ) on an event with an uncertain outcome , with the primary intent of winning money or material goods . Gambling thus requires three elements to be present : consideration ( an amount wagered ) , risk ( chance ) , and a prize . The outcome of the wager is often immediate , such as a single roll of dice , a spin of a roulette wheel , or a horse crossing the finish line , but longer time frames are also common , allowing wagers on the outcome of a future sports contest or even an entire sports season . The term gaming in this context typically refers to instances in which the activity has been specifically permitted by law . The two words are not mutually exclusive ; i.e. , a gaming company offers ( legal ) gambling activities to the public and may be regulated by one of many gaming control boards , for example , the Nevada Gaming Control Board . However , this distinction is not universally observed in the English-speaking world . For instance , in the United Kingdom , the regulator of gambling activities is called the Gambling Commission ( not the Gaming Commission ) . The word gaming is used more frequently since the rise of computer and video games to describe activities that do not necessarily involve wagering , especially online gaming , with the new usage still not having displaced the old usage as the primary definition in common dictionaries . Gaming has also been used to circumvent laws against gambling . The media and others have used one term or the other to frame conversations around the subjects , resulting in a shift of perceptions among their audiences . Gambling is also a major international commercial activity , with the legal gambling market totaling an estimated $ 335 billion in 2009 . In other forms , gambling can be conducted with materials which have a value , but are not real money .",
  "/wiki/High_roller": "A high roller , also referred to as a whale , is a gambler who consistently wagers large amounts of money . High rollers often receive lavish comps from casinos to lure them onto the gambling floors , such as free private jet transfers , limousine use and use of the casinos ' best suites . Casinos may also extend credit to a player to continue betting , offer rebates on betting turnover or losses , and salaries of employees may also contain incentive arrangements to bring in high rollers . The definition of a high roller varies . At Crown Casino in Australia , for example , it involves bringing between AUD $ 50,000 and $ 75,000 to the table . High roller players often have very high table limits allowing the high roller exclusive use . Casinos compete on bet limits . In Australia limits of AUD $ 300,000 are common , in Las Vegas they are between US $ 150,000 and $ 300,000 , and in Macau they are up to US $ 500,000 . Only casinos with substantial financial firepower can accommodate high-stakes gambling due to the volatility of results . High rollers may also be subject to exceptions from various rules and regulations ; for example the high roller rooms at Crown Casino in Melbourne , Australia are the only licensed venue in the state not subject to a ban on smoking . High rollers are said to provide only a small fraction of casino business . John Eidsmoe , in his book Legalized Gambling : America 's Bad Bet , claims that it is actually gamblers from the lower and lower-middle classes in the United States that provide much of the gambling money .",
