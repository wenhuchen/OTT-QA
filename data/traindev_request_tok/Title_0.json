  "/wiki/Male": "A male ( \u2642 ) organism is the physiological sex that produces sperm . Each spermatozoon can fuse with a larger female gamete , or ovum , in the process of fertilization . A male can not reproduce sexually without access to at least one ovum from a female , but some organisms can reproduce both sexually and asexually . Most male mammals , including male humans , have a Y chromosome , which codes for the production of larger amounts of testosterone to develop male reproductive organs . Not all species share a common sex-determination system . In most animals , including humans , sex is determined genetically ; however , species such as Cymothoa exigua change sex depending on the number of females present in the vicinity .",
  "/wiki/Female": "Female ( symbol : \u2640 ) is the sex of an organism , or a part of an organism , that produces non-mobile ova ( egg cells ) . Barring rare medical conditions , most female mammals , including female humans , have two X chromosomes . Female characteristics vary between different species with some species containing more well defined female characteristics , such as the presence of pronounced mammary glands . There is no single genetic mechanism behind sex differences in different species and the existence of two sexes seems to have evolved multiple times independently in different evolutionary lineages . The word female comes from the Latin femella , the diminutive form of femina , meaning woman . It is not etymologically related to the word male .",
  "/wiki/Realm": "A realm /\u02c8r\u025blm/ is a community or territory over which a sovereign rules . The term is commonly used to describe a kingdom or other monarchical or dynastic state . A realm may also be a subdivision within an empire , if it has its own monarch , e.g . the German Empire . The Old French word reaume , modern French royaume , was the word first adopted in English ; the fixed modern spelling does not appear until the beginning of the 17th century . The word supposedly derives from medieval Latin regalimen , from regalis , of or belonging to a rex ( king ) . The word rex itself is derived from the Latin verb regere , which means to rule . Thus the literal meaning of the word realm is the territory of a ruler , traditionally a monarch ( emperor , king , grand duke , prince , etc. ) . Realm is particularly used for those states whose name includes the word kingdom ( for example , the United Kingdom ) , as elegant variation , to avoid clumsy repetition of the word in a sentence ( for example , The Queen 's realm , the United Kingdom. ) . It is also useful to describe those countries whose monarchs are called something other than king or queen ; for example , the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is a realm but not a kingdom , since its monarch holds the title Grand Duke rather than King . The term may commonly also be used to describe any one of the Commonwealth realms , which are kingdoms in their own right and share the same person as monarch , though they are fully independent of each other . More broadly , a realm may encompass territories that are subject to a monarch , yet are not a physical part of his or her kingdom ; for example , the Cook Islands and Niue are considered parts of the Realm of New Zealand , although they are not part of New Zealand proper .",
  "/wiki/Adjective": "In linguistics , an adjective is a word that modifies a noun or noun phrase or describes its referent . Its semantic role is to change information given by the noun . Adjectives are one of the main parts of speech of the English language , although historically they were classed together with nouns . Certain words that were traditionally considered to be adjectives , including the , this , my , etc. , are today usually classed separately , as determiners .",

The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets and ultimately from the Phoenician alphabet . Latin was originally spoken in the area around Rome , known as Latium . Through the power of the Roman Republic , it became the dominant language in Italy , and subsequently throughout the western Roman Empire . Latin has contributed many words to the English language . In particular , Latin ( and Ancient Greek ) roots are used in English descriptions of theology , the sciences , medicine , and law . By the late Roman Republic ( 75 BC ) , Old Latin had been standardised into Classical Latin . Vulgar Latin was the colloquial form spoken during the same time and attested in inscriptions and the works of comic playwrights like Plautus and Terence and author Petronius . Late Latin is the written language from the 3rd century and the colloquial form Vulgar Latin developed into the Romance languages , such as French , Italian , Portuguese , Romanian , Catalan and Spanish in the 6th to 9th centuries . Medieval Latin was used as a literary language from the 9th century to the Renaissance which used Renaissance Latin . Later , Early Modern Latin and New Latin evolved . Latin was used as the language of international communication , scholarship and science until well into the 18th century , when it began to be supplanted by vernaculars ( including the Romance languages ) .",
  "/wiki/Emperor": "An emperor ( from Latin : imperator , via Old French : empereor ) is a monarch , and usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm . Empress , the female equivalent , may indicate an emperor 's wife ( empress consort ) , mother ( empress dowager ) , or a woman who rules in her own right ( empress regnant ) . Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings . In Europe , the title of Emperor has been used since the Middle Ages , considered in those times equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope due to the latter 's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of the Catholic part of Western Europe . The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as Emperor . Both emperors and kings are monarchs , but emperor and empress are considered the higher monarchical titles . Inasmuch as there is a strict definition of emperor , it is that an emperor has no relations implying the superiority of any other ruler and typically rules over more than one nation . Therefore a king might be obliged to pay tribute to another ruler , or be restrained in his actions in some unequal fashion , but an emperor should in theory be completely free of such restraints . However , monarchs heading empires have not always used the title in all contexts - the British sovereign did not assume the title Empress of the British Empire even during the incorporation of India , though she was declared Empress of India . In Western Europe , the title of Emperor was used exclusively by the Holy Roman Emperor , whose imperial authority was derived from the concept of translatio imperii , i.e . they claimed succession to the authority of the Western Roman Emperors , thus linking themselves to Roman institutions and traditions as part of state ideology . Although initially ruling much of Central Europe and northern Italy , by the 19th century the Emperor exercised little power beyond the German-speaking states .",
  "/wiki/Empire": "An empire is a sovereign state functioning as an aggregate of nations or people that are ruled over by an emperor or another kind of monarch . The territory and population of an empire is commonly of greater extent than the one of a kingdom . An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories , such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Russian Empire , or of territories far remote from the homeland , such as a colonial empire . Aside from the more formal usage , the word empire can also refer colloquially to a large-scale business enterprise ( e.g . a transnational corporation ) , a political organisation controlled by a single individual ( a political boss ) , or a group ( political bosses ) . The word empire is associated with such other words as imperialism , colonialism , and globalization . Empire is often used to describe a displeasure to overpowering situations . An imperial political structure can be established and maintained in two ways : ( i ) as a territorial empire of direct conquest and control with force or ( ii ) as a coercive , hegemonic empire of indirect conquest and control with power . The former method provides greater tribute and direct political control , yet limits further expansion because it absorbs military forces to fixed garrisons . The latter method provides less tribute and indirect control , but avails military forces for further expansion . Territorial empires ( e.g . the Mongol Empire and Median Empire ) tend to be contiguous areas .",

As a polity it included large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe , North Africa and West Asia ruled by emperors . From the accession of Caesar Augustus to the military anarchy of the third century , it was a principate with Italy as metropole of the provinces and its city of Rome as sole capital ( 27 BC - 286 AD ) . Although fragmented briefly during the military crisis , the empire was forcibly reassembled , then ruled by multiple emperors who shared rule over the Western Roman Empire ( based in Milan and later in Ravenna ) and over the Eastern Roman Empire ( based in Nicomedia and later in Constantinople ) . Rome remained the nominal capital of both parts until 476 AD , when it sent the imperial insignia to Constantinople ( Byzantium - Ancient Greek : \u0392\u03c5\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd , Byz\u00e1ntion ) following the capture of Ravenna by the barbarians of Odoacer and the subsequent deposition of Romulus Augustus . The fall of the Western Roman Empire to Germanic kings , along with the hellenization of the Eastern Roman Empire into the Byzantine Empire , conventionally marks the end of Ancient Rome and the beginning of the Middle Ages . The predecessor state of the Roman Empire , the Roman Republic ( which had replaced Rome 's monarchy in the 6th century BC ) became severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflicts . In the mid-1st century BC Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC . Civil wars and proscriptions continued , culminating in the victory of Octavian , Caesar 's adopted son , over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC . The following year Octavian conquered Ptolemaic Egypt , ending the Hellenistic period that had begun with the conquests of Alexander the Great of Macedon in the 4th century BC . Octavian 's power then became unassailable , and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title Augustus , effectively making him the first Roman emperor . The first two centuries of the Empire saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana ( Roman Peace ) .",
  "/wiki/Byzantine_Empire": "The Byzantine Empire , also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire , or Byzantium , was the continuation of the Roman Empire in its eastern provinces during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages , when its capital city was Constantinople ( modern Istanbul , formerly Byzantium ) . It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 . During most of its existence , the empire was the most powerful economic , cultural and military force in Europe . Byzantine Empire is a term created after the end of the realm ; its citizens continued to refer to their empire simply as the Roman Empire ( Greek : \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd , tr .

Several signal events from the 4th to 6th centuries mark the period of transition during which the Roman Empire 's Greek East and Latin West diverged . Constantine I ( r. 324-337 ) reorganised the empire , made Constantinople the new capital and legalised Christianity . Under Theodosius I ( r. 379-395 ) , Christianity became the state religion and other religious practices were proscribed . In the reign of Heraclius ( r. 610-641 ) , the Empire 's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use in place of Latin . Although the Roman state continued and its traditions were maintained , modern historians distinguish Byzantium from ancient Rome insofar as it was centred on Constantinople , oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture and characterised by Eastern Orthodox Christianity . The borders of the empire fluctuated through cycles of decline and recovery . During the reign of Justinian I ( r. 527-565 ) , the empire reached its greatest extent , after reconquering much of the historically Roman western Mediterranean coast , including North Africa , Italy and Rome , which it held for two more centuries .",

It was founded at the end of the 13th century in northwestern Anatolia in the town of S\u00f6\u011f\u00fct ( modern-day Bilecik Province ) by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman I . Although initially the dynasty was of Turkic origin , it was Persianised in terms of language , culture , literature and habits . After 1354 , the Ottomans crossed into Europe , and with the conquest of the Balkans , the Ottoman beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire . The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror . During the 16th and 17th centuries , at the height of its power under the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent , the Ottoman Empire was a multinational , multilingual empire controlling most of Southeast Europe , parts of Central Europe , Western Asia , parts of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus , North Africa and the Horn of Africa . At the beginning of the 17th century , the empire contained 32 provinces and numerous vassal states . Some of these were later absorbed into the Ottoman Empire , while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries . [ note 7 ] With Constantinople as its capital and control of lands around the Mediterranean Basin , the Ottoman Empire was at the centre of interactions between the Eastern and Western worlds for six centuries . While the empire was once thought to have entered a period of decline following the death of Suleiman the Magnificent , this view is no longer supported by the majority of academic historians . The empire continued to maintain a flexible and strong economy , society and military throughout the 17th and much of the 18th century . However , during a long period of peace from 1740 to 1768 , the Ottoman military system fell behind that of their European rivals , the Habsburg and Russian empires .",
  "/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire": "The Holy Roman Empire ( Latin : Sacrum Imperium Romanum ; German : Heiliges R\u00f6misches Reich ) , also known as Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation , was a multi-ethnic complex of territories in Western and Central Europe that developed during the Early Middle Ages and continued until its dissolution in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars . The largest territory of the empire after 962 was the Kingdom of Germany , though it also included the neighboring Kingdom of Bohemia and Kingdom of Italy , plus numerous other territories , and soon after the Kingdom of Burgundy was added . Its size gradually diminished over time , particularly from 1648 onward , and by the time of its dissolution , it largely contained only German-speaking territories ( although Switzerland and East Prussia were not included ) , plus the Kingdom of Bohemia which was bordered by the German lands on three sides . At the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 , most of the Holy Roman Empire was included in the German Confederation . On 25 December 800 , Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish king Charlemagne as Emperor , reviving the title in Western Europe , more than three centuries after the fall of the earlier ancient Western Roman Empire in 476 . The title continued in the Carolingian family until 888 and from 896 to 899 , after which it was contested by the rulers of Italy in a series of civil wars until the death of the last Italian claimant , Berengar I , in 924 . The title was revived again in 962 when Otto I was crowned emperor , fashioning himself as the successor of Charlemagne and beginning a continuous existence of the empire for over eight centuries . Some historians refer to the coronation of Charlemagne as the origin of the empire , while others prefer the coronation of Otto I as its beginning . Scholars generally concur , however , in relating an evolution of the institutions and principles constituting the empire , describing a gradual assumption of the imperial title and role . The exact term Holy Roman Empire was not used until the 13th century , but the concept of translatio imperii , [ d ] the notion that he - the sovereign ruler - held supreme power inherited from the ancient emperors of Rome , was fundamental to the prestige of the emperor . The office of Holy Roman Emperor was traditionally elective , although frequently controlled by dynasties . The mostly German prince-electors , the highest-ranking noblemen of the empire , usually elected one of their peers as King of the Romans , and he would later be crowned emperor by the Pope ; the tradition of papal coronations was discontinued in the 16th century .",

The rise of the Russian Empire coincided with the decline of neighboring rival powers : the Swedish Empire , the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , Persia and the Ottoman Empire . It played a major role in 1812-1814 in defeating Napoleon 's ambitions to control Europe and expanded to the west and south . The House of Romanov ruled the Russian Empire from 1721 until 1762 . Its matrilineal branch of patrilineal German descent , the House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov , ruled from 1762 to the end of the empire . At the beginning of the 19th century , the Russian Empire extended from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea in the south , from the Baltic Sea on the west into Alaska and Northern California in America on the east . With 125.6 million subjects registered by the 1897 census , it had the third-largest population in the world at the time , after Qing China and India . Like all empires , it featured great diversity in terms of economies , ethnicities , languages , and religion . There were many dissident elements that launched numerous rebellions and assassinations over the centuries . In the 19th century , they were closely watched by the imperial secret police , and thousands were exiled to Siberia .

Following the Austro-Prussian War and the compromise with Hungary , the Dual Monarchy was established . Austria was involved in World War I under Emperor Franz Joseph following the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand , the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne . After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy , the Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed with the intent of the union with Germany , which eventually failed because of the Allied Powers and the state remained unrecognized .",
  "/wiki/Empire_of_Brazil": "The Empire of Brazil was a 19th-century state that broadly comprised the territories which form modern Brazil and ( until 1828 ) Uruguay . Its government was a representative parliamentary constitutional monarchy under the rule of Emperors Dom Pedro I and his son Dom Pedro II . A colony of the Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil became the seat of the Portuguese colonial Empire in 1808 , when the Portuguese Prince regent , later King Dom Jo\u00e3o VI , fled from Napoleon 's invasion of Portugal and established himself and his government in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro . Jo\u00e3o VI later returned to Portugal , leaving his eldest son and heir , Pedro , to rule the Kingdom of Brazil as regent . On 7 September 1822 , Pedro declared the independence of Brazil and , after waging a successful war against his father 's kingdom , was acclaimed on 12 October as Pedro I , the first Emperor of Brazil . The new country was huge , sparsely populated and ethnically diverse . Unlike most of the neighboring Hispanic American republics , Brazil had political stability , vibrant economic growth , constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech , and respect for civil rights of its subjects , albeit with legal restrictions on women and slaves , the latter regarded as property and not citizens . The empire 's bicameral parliament was elected under comparatively democratic methods for the era , as were the provincial and local legislatures . This led to a long ideological conflict between Pedro I and a sizable parliamentary faction over the role of the monarch in the government . He faced other obstacles . The unsuccessful Cisplatine War against the neighboring United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata in 1828 led to the secession of the province of Cisplatina ( later to become Uruguay ) .

Berlin remained its capital , and Otto , Prince of Bismarck , Minister-President of Prussia became Chancellor , the head of government . As these events occurred , the Prussian-led North German Confederation and its southern German allies were still engaged in the Franco-Prussian War . The German Empire consisted of 26 states , most of them ruled by royal families . They included four kingdoms , six grand duchies , five duchies ( six before 1876 ) , seven principalities , three free Hanseatic cities , and one imperial territory . Although Prussia was one of several kingdoms in the realm , it contained about two thirds of Germany 's population and territory . Prussian dominance had also been established constitutionally . After 1850 , the states of Germany had rapidly become industrialized , with particular strengths in coal , iron ( and later steel ) , chemicals , and railways . In 1871 , Germany had a population of 41 million people ; by 1913 , this had increased to 68 million .

At its height , it was the largest empire in history and , for over a century , was the foremost global power . By 1913 , the British Empire held sway over 412 million people , 23% of the world population at the time , and by 1920 , it covered 35,500,000 km2 ( 13,700,000 sq mi ) , 24% of the Earth 's total land area . As a result , its political , legal , linguistic , and cultural legacy is widespread . At the peak of its power , the phrase the empire on which the sun never sets was often used to describe the British Empire , because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories . During the Age of Discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries , Portugal and Spain pioneered European exploration of the globe , and in the process established large overseas empires . Envious of the great wealth these empires generated , England , France , and the Netherlands began to establish colonies and trade networks of their own in the Americas and Asia . A series of wars in the 17th and 18th centuries with the Netherlands and France left England and then , following union between England and Scotland in 1707 , Great Britain , the dominant colonial power in North America . It then became the dominant power in the Indian subcontinent after the East India Company 's conquest of Mughal Bengal at the Battle of Plassey in 1757 . The independence of the Thirteen Colonies in North America in 1783 after the American War of Independence caused Britain to lose some of its oldest and most populous colonies . British attention soon turned towards Asia , Africa , and the Pacific .",
  "/wiki/Japan": "Japan ( Japanese : \u65e5\u672c , Nippon [ \u0272ippo\ua71c\u0274 ] ( listen ) or Nihon [ \u0272iho\ua71c\u0274 ] ( listen ) ) is an island country located in East Asia . It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",

  "/wiki/Queen_regnant": "A queen regnant ( plural : queens regnant ) is a female monarch , equivalent in rank to a king , who reigns in her own right , as opposed to a queen consort , who is the wife of a reigning king , or a queen regent , who is the guardian of a child monarch and reigns temporarily in the child 's stead . An empress regnant is a female monarch who reigns in her own right over an empire . A queen regnant possesses and exercises sovereign powers , whereas a queen consort shares her husband 's rank and titles , but does not share the sovereignty of her husband . The husband of a queen regnant traditionally does not share his wife 's rank , title or sovereignty . However , the concept of a king consort is not unheard of in both contemporary and classical periods . A queen dowager is the widow of a king . A queen mother is a queen dowager who is also the mother of a reigning sovereign .",
  "/wiki/Monarchy": "A monarchy is a form of government in which a person , the monarch , is head of state until death or abdication . The legitimation and governing power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic ( crowned republic ) , to restricted ( constitutional monarchy ) , to fully autocratic ( absolute monarchy ) , combining executive , legislative and judicial power . In most cases , the succession of monarchies is hereditary , but there are also elective and self-proclaimed monarchies , often building dynastic periods . Aristocrats , though not inherent to monarchies , often serve as the pool of persons to draw the monarch from and fill the constituting institutions ( e.g . diet and court ) , giving many monarchies oligarchic elements . A monarchy can be a polity through unity , personal union , vassalage or federation . Its authorities are proclaimed and recognized through the different seats , insignia and titles that a monarch can occupy and be invested with . For example , monarchs can carry titles such as king , queen , emperor , khan , caliph , tsar , or sultan , and can be bound to territories ( e.g. , the Emperor of Japan ) and peoples ( e.g. , the King of the Belgians ) . The republican form of government has been established as the opposing and main alternative to monarchy . Republics though have seen infringements through lifelong or even hereditary heads of state . Republics heads of state are often styled President or a variant thereof . Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 20th century .",
  "/wiki/Viceroy": "A viceroy ( /\u02c8va\u026asr\u0254\u026a/ ) is an official who runs a country , colony , city , province , or sub-national state , in the name of and as the representative of the monarch of the territory . The term derives from the Latin prefix vice- , meaning in the place of and the French word roy , meaning king . A viceroy 's territory may be called a viceroyalty , though this term is not always applied . The adjective form is viceregal , less often viceroyal . The term vicereine is sometimes used to indicate a female viceroy suo jure , although viceroy can serve as a gender-neutral term . Vicereine is more commonly used to indicate a viceroy 's wife . The term has occasionally been applied to the governors-general of the Commonwealth realms , who are viceregal representatives of the monarch . Viceroy is a form of royal appointment rather than noble rank . An individual viceroy often also held a noble title , however , such as Louis Mountbatten , 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma who was also Viceroy of India .",

Its continental European territory is situated on the Iberian Peninsula . Its territory also includes two archipelagoes : the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa , and the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea . The African enclaves of Ceuta , Melilla , and Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera make Spain the only European country to have a physical border with an African country ( Morocco ) . [ h ] Several small islands in the Alboran Sea are also part of Spanish territory . The country 's mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar ; to the north and northeast by France , Andorra , and the Bay of Biscay ; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean . With an area of 505,990 km2 ( 195,360 sq mi ) , Spain is the largest country in Southern Europe , the second largest country in Western Europe and the European Union , and the fourth largest country in the European continent . By population ( about 47 million ) , Spain is the sixth largest in Europe and the fifth in the European Union . Spain 's capital and largest city is Madrid ; other major urban areas include Barcelona , Valencia , Seville , Zaragoza , M\u00e1laga and Bilbao . Modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 35,000 years ago . Iberian cultures along with ancient Phoenician , Greek , Celtic and Carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under Roman rule around 200 BCE , after which the region was named Hispania , based on the earlier Phoenician name Sp ( a ) n or Spania .

  "/wiki/Viceroyalty_of_Rio_de_la_Plata": "The Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata ( Spanish : Virreinato del R\u00edo de la Plata , also called Viceroyalty of the River Plate in some scholarly writings ) was the last to be organized and also the shortest-lived of the Viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire in the Americas . The Viceroyalty was established in 1776 from several former Viceroyalty of Per\u00fa dependencies that mainly extended over the R\u00edo de la Plata Basin , roughly the present-day territories of Argentina , Chile , Bolivia , Paraguay and Uruguay , extending inland from the Atlantic Coast . The colony of Spanish Guinea ( present-day Equatorial Guinea ) also depended administratively on the Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata . Buenos Aires , located on the western shore of the R\u00edo de la Plata estuary flowing into the Atlantic Ocean , opposite the Portuguese outpost of Colonia del Sacramento , was chosen as the capital . Usually considered one of the late Bourbon Reforms , the organization of this viceroyalty was motivated on both commercial grounds ( Buenos Aires was by then a major spot for illegal trade ) , as well as on security concerns brought about by the growing interest of competing foreign powers in the area . The Spanish Crown wanted to protect its territory against Great Britain and the Kingdom of Portugal . But these Enlightenment reforms proved counterproductive , or perhaps too late , to quell the colonies ' demands . The entire history of this Viceroyalty was marked by growing domestic unrest and political instability . Between 1780 and 1782 , the Rebellion of T\u00fapac Amaru II inspired a violent Aymara-led revolt across the Upper Peru highlands , demonstrating the great resentment against colonial authorities by both the mestizo and indigenous populations . Twenty-five years later , the Criollos , native-born people of the colony , successfully defended against two successive British attempts to conquer Buenos Aires and Montevideo . This enhanced their sense of autonomy and power at a time when Spanish troops were unable to help . In 1809 , the Criollo elite revolted against colonial authorities at La Paz and Chuquisaca , establishing revolutionary governments , juntas .",

The territory corresponding to Panama was incorporated later in 1739 , and the provinces of Venezuela were separated from the Viceroyalty and assigned to the Captaincy General of Venezuela in 1777 .

  "/wiki/Portuguese_Empire": "The Portuguese Empire ( Portuguese : Imp\u00e9rio Portugu\u00eas ) , also known as the Portuguese Overseas ( Ultramar Portugu\u00eas ) or the Portuguese Colonial Empire ( Imp\u00e9rio Colonial Portugu\u00eas ) , was composed of the overseas colonies and territories governed by Portugal . One of the longest-lived empires in world history , it existed for almost six centuries , from the capture of Ceuta in 1415 , to the handover of Portuguese Macau to China in 1999 . The empire began in the 15th century , and from the early 16th century it stretched across the globe , with bases in North and South America , Africa , and various regions of Asia and Oceania . The Portuguese Empire originated at the beginning of the Age of Discovery , and the power and influence of the Kingdom of Portugal would eventually expand across the globe . In the wake of the Reconquista , Portuguese sailors began exploring the coast of Africa and the Atlantic archipelagos in 1418-19 , using recent developments in navigation , cartography and maritime technology such as the caravel , with the aim of finding a sea route to the source of the lucrative spice-trade . In 1488 Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope , and in 1498 Vasco da Gama reached India . In 1500 , either by an accidental landfall or by the crown 's secret design , Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral discovered Brazil on the South American coast . Over the following decades , Portuguese sailors continued to explore the coasts and islands of East Asia , establishing forts and factories as they went . By 1571 a string of naval outposts connected Lisbon to Nagasaki along the coasts of Africa , the Middle East , India and South Asia . This commercial network and the colonial trade had a substantial positive impact on Portuguese economic growth ( 1500-1800 ) , when it accounted for about a fifth of Portugal 's per-capita income . When King Philip II of Spain ( Philip I of Portugal ) seized the Portuguese crown in 1580 there began a 60-year union between Spain and Portugal known to subsequent historiography as the Iberian Union . The realms continued to have separate administrations .",
  "/wiki/Viceroy_of_India": "The Governor-general of India ( from 1858 to 1947 the Viceroy and Governor-general of India , commonly shortened to Viceroy of India ) was the representative of the monarch of the United Kingdom and after Indian independence in 1947 , the representative of the Indian head of state . The office was created in 1773 , with the title of Governor-general of the Presidency of Fort William . The officer had direct control only over Fort William , but supervised other East India Company officials in India . Complete authority over all of British India was granted in 1833 , and the official came to be known as the governor-general of India . In 1858 , as a consequence of the Indian Rebellion the previous year , the territories and assets of the East India Company came under the direct control of the British Crown ; as a consequence the Company Raj was succeeded by the British Raj . The Governor-General ( now also the Viceroy ) headed the central government of India , which administered the provinces of British India , including the Punjab , Bengal , Bombay , Madras , the United Provinces , and others . However , much of India was not ruled directly by the British Government ; outside the provinces of British India , there were hundreds of nominally independent princely states or native states , whose relationship was not with the British Government or the United Kingdom , but rather one of homage directly with the British Monarch as sovereign successor to the Mughal Emperors . From 1858 , to reflect the Governor-General 's new additional role as the Monarch 's representative in re the fealty relationships vis the princely states , the additional title of Viceroy was granted , such that the new office was entitled viceroy and governor-general of India . This was usually shortened to viceroy of India . The title of viceroy was abandoned when British India split into the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan , but the office of governor-general continued to exist in each country separately - until they adopted republican constitutions in 1950 and 1956 , respectively . Until 1858 , the governor-general was selected by the Court of Directors of the East India Company , to whom he was responsible . Thereafter , he was appointed by the sovereign on the advice of the British Government ; the secretary of state for India , a member of the UK Cabinet , was responsible for instructing him or her on the exercise of their powers .",
  "/wiki/Colonial_Brazil": "Colonial Brazil ( Portuguese : Brasil Colonial ) comprises the period from 1500 , with the arrival of the Portuguese , until 1815 , when Brazil was elevated to a kingdom in union with Portugal as the United Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil and the Algarves . During the early 300 years of Brazilian colonial history , the economic exploitation of the territory was based first on brazilwood ( pau brazil ) extraction ( 16th century ) , which gave the territory its name ; sugar production ( 16th-18th centuries ) ; and finally on gold and diamond mining ( 18th century ) . Slaves , especially those brought from Africa , provided most of the work force of the Brazilian export economy after a brief period of Indian slavery to cut brazilwood . In contrast to the neighboring Spanish possessions , which had several viceroyalties with jurisdiction initially over New Spain ( Mexico ) and Peru , and in the eighteenth century expanded to viceroyalties of Rio de la Plata and New Granada , the Portuguese colony of Brazil was settled mainly in the coastal area by the Portuguese and a large black slave population working sugar plantations and mines . The boom and bust economic cycles were linked to export products . Brazil 's sugar age , with the development of plantation slavery , merchants serving as middle men between production sites , Brazilian ports , and Europe was undermined by the growth of the sugar industry in the Caribbean on islands that European powers seized from Spain . Gold and diamonds were discovered and mined in southern Brazil through the end of the colonial era . Brazilian cities were largely port cities and the colonial administrative capital was moved several times in response to the rise and fall of export products ' importance . Unlike Spanish America , which fragmented into many republics upon independence , Brazil remained a single administrative unit under a monarch , giving rise to the largest country in Latin America . Just as European Spanish and Roman Catholicism were a core source of cohesion among Spain 's vast and multi-ethnic territories , Brazilian society was united by the Portuguese language and Roman Catholic faith . As the only Lusophone polity in the Americas , the Portuguese language was particularly important to Brazilian identity .",

Its culture , people , and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbours , making it essentially a mixture of French and German cultures , as evident by the nation 's three official languages : French , German , and the national language of Luxembourgish . The repeated invasions by Germany , especially in World War II , resulted in the country 's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and , among other things , led to the foundation of the European Union .

Nowadays , scholars still debate the meaning of the word and there are a few plausible versions . Since Lietuva has a suffix ( -uva ) , the original word should have no suffix .

Lietava , a small river not far from Kernav\u0117 , the core area of the early Lithuanian state and a possible first capital of the eventual Grand Duchy of Lithuania , is usually credited as the source of the name .

It came into existence in the 12th century as the Margraviate of Baden and subsequently split into different lines , which were unified in 1771 . It then became the much-enlarged Grand Duchy of Baden through the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1803-1806 and was a sovereign country until it joined the German Empire in 1871 , remaining a Grand Duchy until 1918 when it became part of the Weimar Republic as the Republic of Baden . Baden was bordered to the north by the Kingdom of Bavaria and the Grand Duchy of Hessen-Darmstadt ; to the west , along most of its length , by the river Rhine , which separated Baden from the Bavarian Rhenish Palatinate and Alsace in modern France ; to the south by Switzerland ; and to the east by the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg , the Principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen and Bavaria . After World War II , the French military government in 1945 created the state of Baden ( originally known as South Baden ) out of the southern half of the former Baden , with Freiburg as its capital . This portion of the former Baden was declared in its 1947 constitution to be the true successor of the old Baden .

Originating in the 16th century as a titular grand duchy held by the King of Sweden , it became autonomous after the Russian annexation in the Finnish War . The Grand Duke of Finland was the Romanov Emperor of Russia , who was represented by the Governor-General . Due to the governmental structure of the Russian Empire and Finnish initiative , the grand duchy 's autonomy expanded until the end of the 19th century . The Senate of Finland was founded in 1809 , which became the most important governmental organ and the precursor to the modern Government of Finland , Supreme Court of Finland and the Supreme Administrative Court of Finland . The economic , social and political changes in the Grand Duchy of Finland were closely connected with those in the Russian Empire and the rest of Europe . The economy grew slowly during the first half of the 19th century . The reign of Alexander II after 1855 saw significant cultural , social and intellectual progress and an industrializing economy . Tensions increased after the Russification policies were enacted in 1889 , which saw the introduction of limited autonomy and reduction of Finnish cultural expression .

The grand duchy 's capital was Florence . Tuscany was nominally a state of the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797 . Initially , Tuscany was ruled by the House of Medici until the extinction of its senior branch in 1737 . While not as internationally renowned as the old republic , the grand duchy thrived under the Medici and it bore witness to unprecedented economic and military success under Cosimo I and his sons , until the reign of Ferdinando II , which saw the beginning of the state 's long economic decline . It peaked under Cosimo III . The Medicis ' only advancement in the latter days of their existence was their elevation to royalty , by the Holy Roman Emperor , in 1691 .

The throne of the Holy Roman Empire was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs from 1438 until their extinction in the male line in 1740 . The house also produced kings of Bohemia , Hungary , Croatia , Galicia , Portugal and Spain with their respective colonies , as well as rulers of several principalities in the Netherlands and Italy . From the 16th century , following the reign of Charles V , the dynasty was split between its Austrian and Spanish branches . Although they ruled distinct territories , they nevertheless maintained close relations and frequently intermarried . The House takes its name from Habsburg Castle , a fortress built in the 1020s in present-day Switzerland , in the canton of Aargau , by Count Radbot of Klettgau , who named his fortress Habsburg . His grandson Otto II was the first to take the fortress name as his own , adding Count of Habsburg to his title . The House of Habsburg gathered dynastic momentum through the 11th , 12th , and 13th centuries . In 1273 , Count Radbot 's seventh generation descendant Rudolph of Habsburg became Roman-German King . He moved the family 's power base to the Duchy of Austria , which the Habsburgs ruled until 1918 . A series of dynastic marriages enabled the family to vastly expand its domains to include Burgundy , Spain and its colonial empire , Bohemia , Hungary , and other territories . In the 16th century , the family separated into the senior Spanish and the junior Austrian branches , who settled their mutual claims in the O\u00f1ate treaty .",

  "/wiki/Princely_state": "A princely state , also called native state , feudatory state or Indian state ( for those states on the subcontinent ) , was a vassal state under a local or indigenous or regional ruler in a subsidiary alliance with the British Raj . Though the history of the princely states of the subcontinent dates from at least the classical period of Indian history , the predominant usage of the term princely state specifically refers to a semi-sovereign principality on the Indian subcontinent during the British Raj that was not directly governed by the British , but rather by a local ruler , subject to a form of indirect rule on some matters . The imprecise doctrine of paramountcy allowed the government of British India to interfere in the internal affairs of princely states individually or collectively and issue edicts that applied to all of India when it deemed it necessary . At the time of the British withdrawal , 565 princely states were officially recognised in the Indian subcontinent , apart from thousands of zamindari estates and jagirs . In 1947 , princely states covered 40% of the area of pre-independence India and constituted 23% of its population . The most important states had their own British Political Residencies : Hyderabad , Mysore and Travancore in the South followed by Jammu and Kashmir , and Sikkim in the Himalayas , and Indore in Central India . The most prominent among those - roughly a quarter of the total - had the status of a salute state , one whose ruler was entitled to a set number of gun salutes on ceremonial occasions . The princely states varied greatly in status , size , and wealth ; the premier 21-gun salute states of Hyderabad , and Jammu and Kashmir were each over 200,000 km2 ( 77,000 sq mi ) in size . In 1941 , Hyderabad had a population of over 16 million , while Jammu and Kashmir had a population of slightly over 4 million . At the other end of the scale , the non-salute principality of Lawa covered an area of 49 km2 ( 19 sq mi ) , with a population of just below 3,000 . Some two hundred of the lesser states had an area of less than 25 km2 ( 10 sq mi ) . The era of the princely states effectively ended with Indian independence in 1947 .",

The Serbian Kingdom obtained recognition by the Holy See and Constantinople in 1217 , reaching its territorial apex in 1346 as the relatively short-lived Serbian Empire . By the mid-16th century , the Ottomans annexed the entirety of modern-day Serbia ; their rule was at times interrupted by the Habsburg Empire , which began expanding towards Central Serbia from the end of the 17th century while maintaining a foothold in Vojvodina .

  "/wiki/Duke": "A duke ( male ) can either be a monarch ranked below the emperor , king , and grand duke ruling over a duchy or a member of royalty or nobility , historically of highest rank , below princes of nobility and grand dukes . The title comes from French duc , itself from the Latin dux , 'leader ' , a term used in republican Rome to refer to a military commander without an official rank ( particularly one of Germanic or Celtic origin ) , and later coming to mean the leading military commander of a province . In most countries , the word duchess is the female equivalent . However , in some countries ( such as the UK ) , the term duke is used even for females , and the word duchess is reserved for those who marry dukes . The title dux survived in the Eastern Roman Empire where it was used in several contexts signifying a rank equivalent to a captain or general . Later on , in the 11th century , the title Megas Doux was introduced for the post of commander-in-chief of the entire navy . During the Middle Ages the title ( as Herzog ) signified first among the Germanic monarchies . Dukes were the rulers of the provinces and the superiors of the counts in the cities and later , in the feudal monarchies , the highest-ranking peers of the king . A duke may or may not be , ipso facto , a member of the nation 's peerage : in the United Kingdom and Spain all dukes are/were also peers of the realm , in France some were and some were not , while the term is not applicable to dukedoms of other nations , even where an institution similar to the peerage ( e.g. , Grandeeship , Imperial Diet , Hungarian House of Magnates ) existed . During the 19th century many of the smaller German and Italian states were ruled by Dukes or Grand Dukes . But at present , with the exception of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg , there are no dukes ruling as monarchs . Duke remains the highest hereditary title ( aside from titles borne by the reigning or formerly reigning dynasty ) in Portugal ( though now a republic ) , Spain , and the United Kingdom .",
  "/wiki/Duchy": "A duchy is a medieval country , territory , fief , or domain ruled by a duke or duchess , a high-ranking nobleman hierarchically second to the king or queen in European tradition . The term is used almost exclusively in Europe , where in the present day there is no sovereign duchy ( i.e . with the status of a nation state ) left . The term duke ( like the corresponding duchy ) should not be confused with the title Grand Duke ( or Grand Duchy , such as the present-day Grand Duchy of Luxembourg ) , as there exists a significant difference of rank between the two . In common European cultural heritage , a grand duke is the third highest monarchic rank , after emperor and king . Its synonym in many Slavic and Baltic European languages ( Russian , Lithuanian , etc . ) is translated as Grand Prince , whereas most Germanic and Romance European languages ( English , French , Spanish , Italian etc . ) use expressions corresponding to Grand Duke . Unlike a duke , the sovereign grand duke is considered royalty ( or in German , 'royal nobility ' , K\u00f6nigsadel ) . The proper form of address for a grand duke is His Royal Highness ( HRH ) , whereas for a non-royal duke in the United Kingdom it is His Grace . In contrast to this , the rank of a duke differs from one country to the next . In Germany , for example , a duke is listed in the aristocratic hierarchy below an emperor ( Kaiser ) , king ( K\u00f6nig ) , grand duke ( Gro\u00dfherzog ) , and elector ( Kurf\u00fcrst ) - in that order - whereas in Britain the duke comes third after king/queen and prince ( there are no British grand dukes or electors ) .",

Monmouth , the eldest illegitimate son of Charles II was attainted after his 1685 rebellion , but his wife 's title was unaffected and passed on to their descendants , who have successively borne the surnames Scott , Montagu-Scott , Montagu Douglas Scott and Scott again . In 1810 , the 3rd Duke of Buccleuch inherited the Dukedom of Queensberry , also in the Peerage of Scotland , thus separating that title from the Marquessate of Queensberry . The substantial origin of the ducal house of the Scotts of Buccleuch dates back to the large grants of lands in Scotland to Sir Walter Scott of Kirkurd and Buccleuch , a border chief , by James II , in consequence of the fall of William Douglas , 8th Earl of Douglas ( 1452 ) , but the family traced their descent back to a Sir Richard le Scott ( 1240-1285 ) . Sir Walter Scott of Branxholme and Buccleuch ( died 1552 ) distinguished himself at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh ( 1547 ) . His great-grandson Sir Walter was created Lord Scott of Buccleuch in 1606 . Other subsidiary titles associated with the Dukedom of Buccleuch are : Earl of Buccleuch ( 1619 ) , Earl of Dalkeith ( 1663 ) and Lord Scott of Whitchester and Eskdaill ( 1619 ) ( all in the Peerage of Scotland ) . The Duke also holds the two subsidiary titles of the attainted Dukedom of Monmouth , namely Earl of Doncaster ( 1663 ) and Baron Scott of Tindale ( 1663 ) ( both in the Peerage of England ) , and several subsidiary titles associated with the Dukedom of Queensberry , namely Marquess of Dumfriesshire ( 1683 ) , Earl of Drumlanrig and Sanquhar ( 1682 ) , Viscount of Nith , Tortholwald and Ross ( 1682 ) and Lord Douglas of Kilmount , Middlebie and Dornock ( 1682 ) ( all in the Peerage of Scotland ) . The Earldom of Doncaster and Barony of Scott of Tindale had been forfeit at the time of the first Duke 's attainder , but the titles were restored to the 2nd Duke of Buccleuch in 1742 . Until 1835 , the Dukes also held lands in the West Riding of Yorkshire and the ancient title of Lord of Bowland . The Duke of Buccleuch is the hereditary chief of Clan Scott . The holder is one of only five people in the UK to hold two or more different dukedoms , the others being the Duke of Cornwall and Rothesay , the Duke of Hamilton and Brandon , the Duke of Argyll ( who holds two dukedoms named Argyll ) , and the Duke of Richmond , Lennox and Gordon .",
  "/wiki/Duke_of_York": "Duke of York is a title of nobility in the Peerage of the United Kingdom . Since the 15th century , it has , when granted , usually been given to the second son of English ( later British ) monarchs . The equivalent title in the Scottish peerage was Duke of Albany . However , King George I and Queen Victoria granted the second sons of their eldest sons the titles Duke of York and Albany and Duke of York respectively . Initially granted in the 14th century in the Peerage of England , the title Duke of York has been created eight times . The title Duke of York and Albany has been created three times . These occurred during the 18th century , following the 1707 unification of the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland into a single , united realm . The double naming was done so that a territorial designation from each of the previously separate realms could be included . The current Duke of York is Prince Andrew , the second son of Queen Elizabeth II . The present Duke 's marriage produced two daughters only , and he has remained unmarried since his 1996 divorce .

  "/wiki/County": "A county is a geographical region of a country used for administrative or other purposes , in certain modern nations . The term is derived from the Old French cont\u00e9 or cunt\u00e9 denoting a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a count ( earl ) or a viscount . The modern French is comt\u00e9 , and its equivalents in other languages are contea , contado , comtat , condado , Grafschaft , graafschap , Gau , etc . ( compare conte , comte , conde , Graf ) . When the Normans conquered England , they brought the term with them . The Saxons had already established the districts that became the historic counties of England , calling them shires ; many county names derive from the name of the county town ( county seat ) with the word shire added on : for example , Gloucestershire and Worcestershire . The Anglo-Saxon terms earl and earldom were taken as equivalent to the continental terms count and county under the conquering Normans , and over time the two blended and became equivalent . Further , the later-imported term became a synonym for the native Old English word s\u010b\u012br ( [ \u0283i\u02d0r ] ) or , in Modern English , shire . Since a shire was an administrative division of the kingdom , the term county evolved to designate an administrative division of a federal state , as in Germany and the United States , or of a national government in most other modern uses . In the United States and Canada , founded 600 years later [ a ] on the British traditions , counties are usually an administrative division set by convenient geographical demarcations , which in governance have certain officeholders ( for example sheriffs and their departments ) as a part of the state and provincial mechanisms , including geographically common court systems .

Thenceforward , the history of the county is subsumed within that of the Crown of Aragon , but the city of Barcelona remained preeminent within it .",
  "/wiki/Margrave_of_Brandenburg": "This article lists the Margraves and Electors of Brandenburg during the period of time that Brandenburg was a constituent state of the Holy Roman Empire . The Mark , or March , of Brandenburg was one of the primary constituent states of the Holy Roman Empire . It was created in 1157 as the Margraviate of Brandenburg by Albert the Bear , Margrave of the Northern March . In 1356 , by the terms of the Golden Bull of Charles IV , the Margrave of Brandenburg was given the permanent right to participate in the election of the Holy Roman Emperor with the title of Elector ( German : Kurf\u00fcrst ) . The early rulers came from several different dynasties , but from 1415 Brandenburg and its successor states were ruled by the House of Hohenzollern for over 500 years . From 1618 onward , Brandenburg was ruled in personal union with the Duchy of Prussia . The Hohenzollerns raised Prussia to a kingdom as the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701 , and from then on Brandenburg was de facto treated as part of the kingdom even though it was legally still part of the Holy Roman Empire . The titles of Margrave of Brandenburg and Elector of Brandenburg were abolished along with the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 , and Brandenburg was formally integrated into Prussia . Despite this , the Prussian kings still included the title Margrave of Brandenburg in their royal style . From 1871 to 1918 the Hohenzollerns were also German Emperors .",

  "/wiki/Feudal_barony": "A feudal baron is a vassal holding a heritable fief called a barony , comprising a specific portion of land , granted by an overlord in return for allegiance and service . Following the end of European feudalism , feudal baronies have largely been superseded by baronies held as a rank of nobility , without any attachment to a fief . However , in Scotland , the feudal dignity of baron remains in existence , and may be bought and sold independently of the land to which it was formerly attached .",

  "/wiki/Clan_chief": "The Scottish Gaelic word clann means children . In early times , and possibly even today , Scottish clan members believed themselves to descend from a common ancestor , the founder of the clan , after whom the clan is named . The clan chief ( ceannard cinnidh ) is the representative of this founder , and represents the clan . In the Scottish clan system , a chief is greater than a chieftain ( ceann-cinnidh ) , a designation applied to heads of branches of a clan . Scottish clans that no longer have a clan chief are referred to as armigerous clans .",
  "/wiki/Scotland": "Scotland ( Scots : Scotland , Scottish Gaelic : Alba [ \u02c8al\u032a\u02e0ap\u0259 ] ( listen ) ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain , with a border with England to the southeast , and is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west , the North Sea to the northeast , the Irish Sea to the south , and more than 790 islands , including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides . The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England . In 1997 , a Scottish Parliament was re-established , in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members , having authority over many areas of domestic policy . The head of the Scottish Government is the first minister of Scotland , who is supported by the deputy first minister of Scotland .",

  "/wiki/List_of_Principal_Chiefs_of_the_Cherokee": "Principal Chief is today the title of the chief executives of the Cherokee Nation , of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians , and of the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians , the three federally recognized tribes of Cherokee . In the eighteenth century , when the people were organized by clans and towns , they would appoint a leader for negotiations with the Europeans . They called him Uku , or First Beloved Man . The title of Principal Chief was created in 1794 when the Cherokee began to formalize a centralized political structure , forming the original Cherokee Nation . The Cherokee Nation-East adopted a written constitution in 1827 , creating a government with three branches : legislative , executive , and judicial . The Principal Chief was elected by the National Council , which was the legislature of the Nation . The Cherokee Nation-West adopted a similar constitution in 1833 . The reunited nation adopted one constitution in 1839 . In 1868 , the Eastern Band created a separate and distinct constitution and formalized the position of Principal Chief . The position had existed in the east since the time of Yonaguska . In 1906 , the US government dismantled the Cherokee Nation 's governmental structure under the Dawes Act ( except for allowing the tribe to retain limited authority to deal with remaining land issues , which lasted until June 1914 ) . Following passage of the federal Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 and the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act of 1936 , the Keetoowah Nighthawk Society organized in 1939 as the United Keetoowah Band .",
  "/wiki/Nigerian_traditional_rulers": "Nigerian traditional rulers often derive their titles from the rulers of independent states or communities that existed before the formation of modern Nigeria . Although they do not have formal political power , in many cases they continue to command respect from their people and have considerable influence . Though their bearers usually maintain the monarchical styles and titles of their sovereign ancestors , both their independent activities and their relations with the central and regional governments of Nigeria are closer in substance to those of the high nobility of old Europe than to those of actual reigning monarchs .",
  "/wiki/Pope": "The Pope ( Latin : papa from Greek : \u03c0\u03ac\u03c0\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2 pappas , father ) , also known as the Supreme Pontiff ( Pontifex Maximus ) , or the Roman Pontiff ( Romanum Pontificem ) , is the Bishop of Rome , leader of the worldwide Catholic Church , and head of state representing the Holy See . Since 1929 , the pope has official residence in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican City , the Holy See 's city-state enclaved within Rome , Italy . The current pope is Francis , who was elected on 13 March 2013 , succeeding Benedict XVI . While his office is called the papacy , the jurisdiction of the episcopal see is called the Holy See . It is the Holy See that is the sovereign entity by international law headquartered in the distinctively independent Vatican City State , established by the Lateran Treaty in 1929 between Italy and the Holy See to ensure its temporal , diplomatic , and spiritual independence . The primacy of the bishop of Rome is largely derived from his role as the apostolic successor to Saint Peter , to whom primacy was conferred by Jesus , giving him the Keys of Heaven and the powers of binding and loosing , naming him as the rock upon which the church would be built . According to Catholic tradition , the apostolic see of Rome was founded by Saint Peter and Saint Paul in the 1st century . The papacy is one of the most enduring institutions in the world and has had a prominent part in world history . In ancient times the popes helped spread Christianity , and intervened to find resolutions in various doctrinal disputes . In the Middle Ages , they played a role of secular importance in Western Europe , often acting as arbitrators between Christian monarchs . Currently , in addition to the expansion of the Christian faith and doctrine , the popes are involved in ecumenism and interfaith dialogue , charitable work , and the defense of human rights . In some periods of history , the papacy , which originally had no temporal powers , accrued wide secular powers rivaling those of temporal rulers .",
  "/wiki/Papal_States": "The Papal States ( Italian : Stato Pontificio ) , officially the State of the Church ( Italian : Stato della Chiesa , Italian pronunciation : [ \u02c8sta\u02d0to della \u02c8kj\u025b\u02d0za ; \u02c8kje\u02d0- ] ; Latin : Status Ecclesiasticus ; also Dicio Pontificia ) were a series of territories in the Italian Peninsula under the direct sovereign rule of the Pope , from the 8th century until 1870 . They were among the major states of Italy from roughly the 8th century until the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia successfully unified the Italian Peninsula by conquest in a campaign virtually concluded in 1861 and definitively in 1870 . At their zenith , the Papal States covered most of the modern Italian regions of Lazio ( which includes Rome ) , Marche , Umbria and Romagna , and portions of Emilia . These holdings were considered to be a manifestation of the temporal power of the pope , as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy . By 1861 , much of the Papal States ' territory had been conquered by the Kingdom of Italy . Only Lazio , including Rome , remained under the Pope 's temporal control . In 1870 , the Pope lost Lazio and Rome and had no physical territory at all , except the Basilica of St Peter and the papal residence and related buildings around the Vatican quarter of Rome , which the new Italian state did not occupy militarily . In 1929 the head of the Italian government , at the time the Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini , ended the crisis between unified Italy and the Holy See by negotiating the Lateran Treaty , signed by the two parties . This recognized the sovereignty of the Holy See over a newly created international territorial entity , the Vatican City State , limited to a token territory .",

Established with the Lateran Treaty ( 1929 ) , it is distinct from , yet under full ownership , exclusive dominion , and sovereign authority and jurisdiction of the Holy See ( Latin : Sancta Sedes ) . [ g ] With an area of 44 hectares ( 110 acres ) , and a population of about 1,000 , it is the smallest sovereign state in the world by both area and population . The Vatican City is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state ( a type of theocracy ) ruled by the pope who is the bishop of Rome and head of the Catholic Church . The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of various national origins . Since the return of the popes from Avignon in 1377 , they have generally resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City , although at times residing instead in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere . The Holy See dates back to early Christianity , and is the primate episcopal see of the Catholic Church , with 1.3 billion Catholic Christians around the world distributed in the Latin Church and 23 Eastern Catholic Churches . The independent Vatican City-state , on the other hand , came into existence on 11 February 1929 by the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy , which spoke of it as a new creation , not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States ( 756-1870 ) , which had previously encompassed much of central Italy . Within the Vatican City are religious and cultural sites such as St. Peter 's Basilica , the Sistine Chapel , and the Vatican Museums . They feature some of the world 's most famous paintings and sculptures . The unique economy of Vatican City is supported financially by the sale of postage stamps and souvenirs , fees for admission to museums , and sales of publications ."
