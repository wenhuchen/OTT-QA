  "/wiki/Al-Yarmouk_SC_(Kuwait)": "Al-Yarmouk is a Kuwaiti professional sports club located in the district of Mishref . It was established on 28 February 1965 in Failaka Island and was the only Kuwaiti club to have been established outside mainland Kuwait at that time . The club was relocated to mainland Kuwait after the 1990-1991 Gulf War , which resulted in the displacement of many inhabitants belonging to Failaka 's island settlements . Therefore , due to inadequate facilities after the liberation of Kuwait , it was inevitable that the team had to move to a better and more sustainable location . Other reasons , aside the Gulf War , for the relocation of the club was due to the insufficient means of transportation for teams and players to travel to Failaka Island for away matches during the regular season . Al Yarmouk is mostly famous for its football team , which gave rise to a plethora of talented Kuwaiti football players during the course of its history . The club has only achieved 4 trophies since it was first established , 2 of which were the Prince Cups in 1970 and 1973 , which is usually regarded as the most prestigious and important trophy in Kuwaiti football . The other 2 trophy achievements were the Second division titles won in 1968 and 1989 . Al Yarmouk sports club went through a major renovation project since 2006 , as part of a grand scheme to regenerate interest within the local Mishref community . A new stadium was built and is also planned for a second phase of renovation . Al Yarmouk also built new swimming facilities as well as an indoor arena for basketball , handball , volleyball and other indoor sports such as table tennis . A track and field team is also widely financed from the club 's department ."
