  "/wiki/Ross\u00f8ya": "Ross\u00f8ya , sometimes referred to as Ross Island in English , is an island located in the Arctic Ocean . It is a part of Sju\u00f8yane , a group of islands in the Svalbard archipelago , some 20 km north of the coast of Nordaustlandet , Svalbard in Arctic Norway . Ross\u00f8ya is located 100 m north-northwest of the somewhat larger island Vesle Tavle\u00f8ya . The northern point of Ross\u00f8ya , at 80\u00b0 49\u2032 44.41\u2033 North , is the northernmost point in Svalbard , and thereby also in the Kingdom of Norway . The distance to the North Pole is 1024.3 kilometers ( 637 mi / 553 nm ) , to Nordkapp on the Norwegian mainland 1084 km and to Pysen , off the southern tip of mainland Norway , 2580 km . Some sources describe Ross\u00f8ya as the northernmost point of Europe , but this requires that Franz Josef Land be considered part of Asia , since Cape Fligely on Rudolf Island , Russia , is located at 81\u00b0 48\u2032 24\u2033 North , which is 109 km closer to the North Pole . The island is named after James Clark Ross ( 1800-1862 ) , a British explorer who was part of William Edward Parry 's 1827 expedition with HMS Hecla to reach the North Pole . After passing by Sju\u00f8yane and Ross\u00f8ya , the expedition was forced to give up , after getting stuck in the ice . However , the expedition set a new record as the expedition that had reached the furthest north at the time . The island may have been sighted as early as 1618 , along with the rest of Sju\u00f8yane , by an Enkhuizen whaler . However , the island was marked on a map as early as 1663 by Hendrick Doncker . This was later followed by cartographers such as Pieter Goos , Cornelis Giles and Outger Rep .",
  "/wiki/Svalbard": "The name Svalbard comes from an older native name for the archipelago , Svalbar\u00f0 , composed of the well-attested Old Norse words svalr ( cold ) and bar\u00f0 ( edge ; ridge ) . The name Spitsbergen originated with Dutch navigator and explorer Willem Barentsz , who described the pointed mountains or , in Dutch , spitse bergen that he saw on the west coast of the main island , Spitsbergen . Barentsz did not recognize that he had discovered an archipelago , and consequently the name Spitsbergen long remained in use both for the main island and for the archipelago as a whole .",

Known among Russians in the Middle Ages as the Murman Sea ( Norwegian Sea ) , the current name of the sea is after the historical Dutch navigator Willem Barentsz . This is a rather shallow shelf sea , with an average depth of 230 metres ( 750 ft ) , and it is an important site for both fishing and hydrocarbon exploration . The Barents Sea is bordered by the Kola Peninsula to the south , the shelf edge towards the Norwegian Sea to the west , and the archipelagos of Svalbard to the northwest , Franz Josef Land to the northeast and Novaya Zemlya to the east . The islands of Novaya Zemlya , an extension of the northern end of the Ural Mountains , separate the Barents Sea from the Kara Sea . Although part of the Arctic Ocean , the Barents Sea has been characterised as turning into the Atlantic because of its status as the Arctic warming hot spot . Hydrologic changes due to global warming have led to a reduction in sea ice and in stratification of the water column , which could produce major changes in weather in Eurasia .",

  "/wiki/Peter_I_Island": "Peter I Island ( Norwegian : Peter I \u00d8y ) is an uninhabited volcanic island in the Bellingshausen Sea , 450 kilometres ( 280 mi ) from continental Antarctica . It is claimed as a dependency of Norway , and along with Bouvet Island and Queen Maud Land comprises one of the three Norwegian dependent territories in the Antarctic and Subantarctic . Peter I Island is 11 by 19 kilometres ( 6.8 by 11.8 mi ) long and 156 square kilometres ( 60 sq mi ) , slightly larger than Staten Island in the state of New York in the United States . The tallest peak is the ultra and 1,640-meter ( 5,380 ft ) tall Lars Christensen Peak . Nearly all of the island is covered by a glacier and it is surrounded most of the year by pack ice , making it inaccessible during these times . There is little vertebrate animal life on the island apart from some seabirds and seals . The island was first sighted by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen on 21 January 1821 and was named for Peter I of Russia . Not until 2 February 1929 did anyone set foot on the island , when Nils Larsen and Ola Olstad 's Second Norvegia Expedition , financed by Lars Christensen , was successful . They claimed it for Norway , who annexed it in 1931 and made it a dependency in 1933 . The next landing occurred in 1948 and the island has been subject to some scientific research and a limited amount of tourism . The island became subject to the Antarctic Treaty in 1961 . Since 1987 , there has been an automated meteorological station on the island .",
  "/wiki/Amundsen_Sea": "The Amundsen Sea , an arm of the Southern Ocean off Marie Byrd Land in western Antarctica , lies between Cape Flying Fish ( the northwestern tip of Thurston Island ) to the east and Cape Dart on Siple Island to the west . Cape Flying Fish marks the boundary between the Amundsen Sea and the Bellingshausen Sea . West of Cape Dart there is no named marginal sea of the Southern Ocean between the Amundsen and Ross Seas . The Norwegian expedition of 1928-1929 under Captain Nils Larsen named the body of water for the Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen while exploring this area in February 1929 . The sea is mostly ice-covered , and the Thwaites Ice Tongue protrudes into it . The ice sheet which drains into the Amundsen Sea averages about 3 km ( 1.9 mi ) in thickness ; roughly the size of the state of Texas , this area is known as the Amundsen Sea Embayment ( ASE ) ; it forms one of the three major ice-drainage basins of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet ."
