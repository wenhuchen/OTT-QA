  "/wiki/Rathcroghan": "Rathcroghan ( Irish : R\u00e1th Cruachan , meaning fort of Cruachan ) is a complex of archaeological sites near Tulsk in County Roscommon , Ireland . It is identified as the site of Cruachan , the traditional capital of the Connachta , the prehistoric and early historic rulers of the western territory . The Rathcroghan Complex ( Cr\u00faachan A\u00ed ) is a unique archaeological landscape with many references found in early Irish medieval manuscripts . Located on the plains of Connacht ( Mag nA\u00ed/Machaire Connacht ) , Rathcroghan is one of the six Royal Sites of Ireland . This landscape which extends over six square kilometres , consists of 240 plus archaeological sites , sixty of which are protected national monuments . These monuments range from the Neolithic ( 4000 - 2500 BC ) , through the Bronze ( 2500 - 500 BC ) and Iron Age ( 500 BC - 400 AD ) , to the early medieval period and beyond . These monuments include burial mounds , ringforts and medieval field boundaries amongst others . The most fascinating of these are the multi period Rathcroghan Mound , the mysterious cave of Oweynagat , the Mucklaghs - a spectacular set of linear earthworks , as well as the Carns medieval complex . There are many interesting historic references to Rathcroghan ( R\u00e1th Cr\u00faachan ) recorded in early medieval manuscripts , including the 12th century Lebor na hUidre . Rathcroghan is recorded as the location of one of the great fairs of Ireland , as well as being one of the island 's three great heathen cemeteries . It is also the location for the beginning and end of a national epic tale - an T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge , and the royal seat of Medb ( Maeve ) , Connacht 's Warrior Queen . Rathcroghan is said to provide entrance to the Otherworld , described in the medieval period as Ireland 's Gate to Hell , via Oweynagat ( the Cave of the Cats ) .",

  "/wiki/High_cross": "A high cross or standing cross ( Irish : cros ard / ardchros , Scottish Gaelic : crois \u00e0rd / \u00e0rd-chrois , Welsh : croes uchel / croes eglwysig ) is a free-standing Christian cross made of stone and often richly decorated . There was a unique Early Medieval tradition in Ireland and Britain of raising large sculpted stone crosses , usually outdoors . These probably developed from earlier traditions using wood , perhaps with metalwork attachments , and earlier pagan Celtic memorial stones ; the Pictish stones of Scotland may also have influenced the form . The earliest surviving examples seem to come from the territory of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria , which had been converted to Christianity by Irish missionaries ; it remains unclear whether the form first developed in Ireland or Britain . Their relief decoration is a mixture of religious figures and sections of decoration such as knotwork , interlace and in Britain vine-scrolls , all in the styles also found in insular art in other media such as illuminated manuscripts and metalwork . They were probably normally painted , perhaps over a modelled layer of plaster ; with the loss of paint and the effects of weathering the reliefs , in particular scenes crowded with small figures , are often now rather indistinct and hard to read . The earlier crosses were typically up to about two metres or eight feet high , but in Ireland examples up to three times higher appear later , retaining thick massive proportions , giving large surface areas for carving . The tallest of the Irish crosses is the so-called Tall Cross at Monasterboice , County Louth . It stands at seven metres or twenty-two feet high . Anglo-Saxon examples mostly remained slender in comparison , but could be large ; except in earlier Northumbrian examples their decoration is mostly ornamental rather than figures . The crosses often , though not always , feature a stone ring around the intersection , forming a Celtic cross ; this seems clearly an innovation of Celtic Christianity , perhaps at Iona . The term high cross is mainly used in Ireland and Scotland , but the tradition across Britain and Ireland is essentially a single phenomenon , though there are certainly strong regional variations .",
