  "/wiki/AAR_wheel_arrangement": "The AAR wheel arrangement system is a method of classifying locomotive ( or unit ) wheel arrangements that was developed by the Association of American Railroads . It is essentially a simplification of the European UIC classification , and it is widely used in North America to describe diesel and electric locomotives . It is not used for steam locomotives which use the Whyte notation instead . The AAR system counts axles instead of wheels . Letters refer to powered axles , and numbers to unpowered ( or idler ) axles . A refers to one powered axle , B to two powered axles in a row , C to three powered axles in a row , and D to four powered axles in a row . 1 refers to one idler axle , and 2 to two idler axles in a row . A dash ( - ) separates trucks , or wheel assemblies . A plus sign ( + ) refers to articulation , either by connecting bogies with span bolsters or by connecting individual locomotives via solid drawbars instead of couplers .",
  "/wiki/Prime_mover_(locomotive)": "In engineering , a prime mover is an engine that converts fuel to useful work . In locomotives , the prime mover is thus the source of power for its propulsion . In an engine-generator set , the engine is the prime mover , as distinct from the generator .",
  "/wiki/Horsepower": "Horsepower ( hp ) is a unit of measurement of power , or the rate at which work is done , usually in reference to the output of engines or motors . There are many different standards and types of horsepower . Two common definitions being used today are the mechanical horsepower ( or imperial horsepower ) , which is about 745.7 watts , and the metric horsepower , which is approximately 735.5 watts . The term was adopted in the late 18th century by Scottish engineer James Watt to compare the output of steam engines with the power of draft horses . It was later expanded to include the output power of other types of piston engines , as well as turbines , electric motors and other machinery . The definition of the unit varied among geographical regions . Most countries now use the SI unit watt for measurement of power . With the implementation of the EU Directive 80/181/EEC on January 1 , 2010 , the use of horsepower in the EU is permitted only as a supplementary unit .",
  "/wiki/EMD_GP7": "The EMD GP7 is a four-axle ( B-B ) road switcher diesel-electric locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division and General Motors Diesel between October 1949 and May 1954 . Power was provided by an EMD 567B 16-cylinder engine which generated 1,500 horsepower ( 1,119 kW ) . The GP7 was offered both with and without control cabs , and those built without control cabs were called a GP7B . Five GP7B 's were built between March and April 1953 . The GP7 was the first EMD road locomotive to use a hood unit design instead of a car-body design . This proved to be more efficient than the car body design as the hood unit cost less to build , was cheaper and easier to maintain , and had much better front and rear visibility for switching . Of the 2,734 GP7 's built , 2,620 were for American railroads ( including 5 GP7B units built for the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway ) , 112 were built for Canadian railroads , and 2 were built for Mexican railroads . This was the first model in EMD 's GP ( General Purpose ) series of locomotives . Concurrently , EMD offered a six-axle ( C-C ) SD ( Special Duty ) locomotive , the SD7 . The GP7 was replaced by the GP9 model in GM-EMD 's GP sequence .",
  "/wiki/A_unit": "An A unit , in railroad terminology , is a diesel locomotive ( or more rarely an electric locomotive ) equipped with a driving cab and a control system to control other locomotives in a multiple unit , and therefore able to be the lead unit in a consist of several locomotives controlled from a single position . This terminology is generally used in North America , since only there was it commonplace to build B units - cabless locomotive units which normally could not lead a train .",
  "/wiki/B_unit": "A B unit , in railroad terminology , is a locomotive unit ( generally a diesel locomotive ) which does not have a control cab or crew compartment , and must therefore be operated in tandem with another coupled locomotive with a cab ( an A unit ) . The terms booster unit and cabless are also used . The concept is largely confined to North America . Elsewhere , locomotives without driving cabs are rare .",
  "/wiki/EMD_567": "The EMD 567 is a line of large medium-speed diesel engines built by General Motors ' Electro-Motive Division . This engine , which succeeded Winton 's 201A , was used in EMD 's locomotives from 1938 until its replacement in 1966 by the EMD 645 . It has a bore of 8 1\u20442 in ( 216 mm ) , a stroke of 10 in ( 254 mm ) and a displacement of 567 cu in ( 9.29 L ) per cylinder . Like the Winton 201A , the EMD 645 and the EMD 710 , the EMD 567 is a two-stroke engine . EMD 's chief competitor , GE , now makes EMD-compatible replacement parts .",
  "/wiki/Watt": "The watt ( symbol : W ) is a unit of power . In the International System of Units ( SI ) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second , and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer . In SI base units , the watt is described as k g m 2 s \u2212 3 { \\displaystyle kg\\ , m^ { 2 } s^ { -3 } } , which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis .

  "/wiki/EMD_GP9": "An EMD GP9 is a four-axle road switcher diesel-electric locomotive built by General Motors ' Electro-Motive Division produced between 1954 and 1959 and it is powered by a sixteen-cylinder engine which generated 1,750 horsepower ( 1.30 MW ) . The GP9 succeeded the GP7 . The lettering GP stands for general purpose . This locomotive type was offered both with and without control cabs ; locomotives built without control cabs were called GP9B locomotives .",
  "/wiki/EMD_GP15-1": "The EMD GP15-1 is a 4-axle switcher diesel-electric locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division between June 1976 and March 1982 . Intended to provide an alternative to the rebuilding programs that many railroads were applying to their early road switchers , it is generally employed as a yard switcher or light road switcher . This locomotive is powered by a 12-cylinder EMD 645E engine , which generates 1,500 hp ( 1,119 kW ) . The GP15-1 uses a 50-foot-9-inch ( 15.47 m ) frame , has a wheelbase of 29 ft 9 in ( 9.07 m ) and has a length over couplers of 54 ft 11 in ( 16.74 m ) . A total of 310 units were built for American railroads . A number of GP15-1s remain in service today for yard work and light road duty . The radiator section is similar to those found on the EMD SD40T-2 and EMD SD45T-2 tunnel motors , leading some observers to incorrectly identify the units as such or as GP15Ts , and giving them the nickname baby tunnel motors .",
  "/wiki/EMD_645": "The EMD 645 family of diesel engines was designed and manufactured by the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors . While the 645 series was intended primarily for locomotive , marine and stationary engine use , one 16-cylinder version powered the 33-19 Titan prototype haul truck designed by GM 's Terex division . The 645 series was an evolution of the earlier 567 series and a precursor to the later 710 series . First introduced in 1965 , the EMD 645 series remained in production on a by-request basis long after it was replaced by the 710 , and most 645 service parts are still in production . The EMD 645 engine series is currently supported by Electro-Motive Diesel , Inc. , which purchased the assets of the Electro-Motive Division from General Motors in 2005 . In 1951 , E. W. Kettering wrote a paper for the ASME entitled , History and Development of the 567 Series General Motors Locomotive Engine , which goes into great detail about the technical obstacles that were encountered during the development of the 567 engine . These same considerations apply to the 645 and 710 , as these engines were a logical extension of the 567C , by applying a cylinder bore increase , 645 , and a cylinder bore increase and a stroke increase , 710 , to achieve a greater power output , without changing the external size of the engines , or their weight , thereby achieving significant improvements in horsepower per unit volume and horsepower per unit weight .",
  "/wiki/EMD_GP15AC": "An EMD GP15AC is a 4-axle switcher built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division between November and December 1982 . This locomotive differs from the otherwise identical EMD GP15-1 due to Missouri Pacific specifying new AR10 AC alternators instead of rebuilt D32 DC generators . The only external difference between the GP15AC and the GP15-1 is a straight side sill ( shared with the EMD GP15T ) not related to the transmission difference . 34 examples of this locomotive model were built for Missouri Pacific Railroad , with four units built for Venezuela 's IFE .",

Power was provided by an EMD 567D2 16-cylinder turbocharged engine which generated 2,000 horsepower ( 1,500 kW ) . EMD was initially hesitant to turbocharge their 567-series diesel engine , but was spurred on to do so following successful tests made by Union Pacific in the form of UP 's experimental Omaha GP20 units . 260 examples of EMD 's production locomotive model ( with the EMD turbocharger ) were built for American railroads . The GP20 was the second EMD production locomotive to be built with an EMD turbocharged diesel engine , sixteen months after the six-axle ( C-C ) model SD24 . Power output of the turbocharged SD24 was 33 percent higher than the 1,800 hp ( 1,340 kW ) of the concurrent Roots blower-equipped SD18s with the same engine displacement , 400 hp ( 298 kW ) per axle , but the power output of the turbocharged GP20 was only 11 percent higher than the 1,800 hp ( 1,340 kW ) of the concurrent Roots blower-equipped GP18s with the same engine displacement 500 hp ( 373 kW ) per axle , due to the limitations of the traction motors then available .
