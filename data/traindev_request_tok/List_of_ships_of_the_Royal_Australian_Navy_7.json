  "/wiki/HMAS_Falie": "Falie is a 33.4-metre ( 110 ft ) ketch that traded for many years in Australian waters . Originally built in 1919/1920 as a speculation by her builder , rigged as a schooner and named Hollands Trouw after the shipyard where she was built , she was purchased by the Spencer 's Gulf Transport Company , renamed , and used for coastal trading in South Australia . The vessel was commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) as HMAS Falie during World War II , serving first as an examination vessel primarily patrolling the Port of Sydney , Australia , then as an armed stores ship . Returned to her owners in 1946 , Falie was used to transport timber , general cargo , grain and explosives around Australia before resuming the South Australian coastal trade to Kangaroo Island and on occasion carrying bulk gypsum from Stenhouse Bay from 1968 . She was retired in 1982 , then purchased by the South Australian government for preservation . Although initially used for day and overnight sails , by 2005 the ship had to be taken out of survey due to lack of maintenance and funds .",

  "/wiki/Royal_Navy": "The Royal Navy ( RN ) is the United Kingdom 's naval warfare force . Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels .",
  "/wiki/HMS_Fantome_(1901)": "HMS Fantome was an Cadmus-class sloop launched in 1901 , transferred to the Royal Australian Navy in 1914 , returned to the Royal Navy in 1920 , and sold in 1924 . She was the fourth ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name , which is from the French fant\u00f4me , meaning ghost .",
  "/wiki/Cadmus-class_sloop": "The Cadmus class was a six-ship class of 10-gun screw steel sloops built for the Royal Navy between 1900 and 1903 . This was the very last class of the Victorian Navy 's multitude of sloops , gunvessels and gunboats to be constructed , and they followed the traditional pattern for 'colonial ' small warships , with a full rig of sails . After them , the Fisher Reforms of the Navy ended the construction and deployment of this type of vessel . Most of the class survived until the 1920s , remaining on colonial stations during World War I .",
  "/wiki/HMAS_Flinders_(GS_312)": "HMAS Flinders ( GS 312/A 312 ) , named for Matthew Flinders ( 1774-1814 ) , was a hydrographic survey ship of the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . Built by HMA Naval Dockyard at Williamstown , Victoria , Flinders was commissioned into the RAN in 1973 , and was used to conduct hydrographic surveys in the waters to Australia 's north , including parts of New Guinea . In 1974 , the ship was tasked with assisting clean up efforts in the wake of Cyclone Tracy , which devastated large parts of Darwin . The ship was decommissioned in 1998 and sold to civilian operators , who have since converted her into a private yacht in the Cayman Islands .",

  "/wiki/Queensland_Maritime_Museum": "The Queensland Maritime Museum is located on the southern bank of the Brisbane River just south of the South Bank Parklands and Queensland Cultural Centre precinct of Brisbane , and close to the Goodwill Bridge . The museum was founded in 1971 and contains a two-level exhibition building presenting historic sailing ship models together with merchant shipping from early cargo ships to modern container ships , tankers and cruise liners . It is housed in the building used for the Pavilion of Promise at World Expo 88 , and the South Brisbane Dry Dock which was built in the 1870s and was 313 feet ( 95 m ) long and 60 feet ( 18 m ) wide . In 1887 the dock was extended to 430 feet ( 131 m ) due to the increasing size of vessels . The museum also includes a library that stocks documents , pictures and other relevant artifacts relating to maritime history . There are several maps that show how early navigators created accurate charts . Information is also provided about some of the 1,500 plus shipwrecks that have occurred along the Queensland coast including the Great Barrier Reef .",

  "/wiki/HMAS_Fremantle_(J246)": "HMAS Fremantle ( J246/M246 ) , named for the port city of Fremantle , Western Australia , was one of 60 Bathurst-class corvettes constructed during World War II , and one of 36 initially manned and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) .",
  "/wiki/Bathurst-class_corvette": "The Bathurst-class corvettes were a class of general purpose vessels produced in Australia during World War II . Originally classified as minesweepers , but widely referred to as corvettes , the Bathurst-class vessels fulfilled a broad anti-submarine , anti-mine , and convoy escort role . Sixty Bathurst-class corvettes were built in eight Australian shipyards to an Australian design . 36 were constructed for the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , 20 were built on British Admiralty orders but manned and commissioned by the RAN , and 4 served in the Royal Indian Navy . Three more were ordered for construction in India , but were cancelled . Although designed for the anti-submarine and anti-mine role , the Bathursts operated as maids-of-all-work during the war ; serving as troop and supply transports , supporting amphibious landings , providing air defence for convoys and disabled ships , participating in shore bombardments , and undertaking hydrographic surveys . Three ships were lost during the war - one to Japanese air attack and two to collisions with friendly merchant ships - while a fourth struck a friendly mine while sweeping the Great Barrier Reef in 1947 and sank . After the war , the Admiralty ships were sold to the Turkish Navy , Royal Netherlands Navy , and civilian operators , while several RAN-owned vessels were transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy , temporarily reactivated to facilitate National Service Training , or sold to civilians . Four of the Netherlands Bathursts were sold onward to the Indonesian Navy , one of which was destroyed in 1956 by rebels opposing the 'Guided Democracy ' political system . The rest of the RAN and Admiralty ships were sold for scrap to help fund other projects . Two vessels are preserved as museum ships .",

Fremantle was the only ship of the class not constructed in Australia , and it is claimed that her delivery voyage was the longest ever made by a patrol boat .",
  "/wiki/Fremantle-class_patrol_boat": "The Fremantle-class patrol boats were coastal patrol vessels operated by the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) from 1979 to 2007 . Designed by British shipbuilder Brooke Marine and constructed in Australia by North Queensland Engineers and Agents , the Fremantle class were larger , more powerful , and more capable than the preceding Attack class , and the two primary patrol boat bases required infrastructure upgrades to support them . Although up to 30 vessels were planned , fifteen were ordered and constructed , with an unexercised option for five more . Their retirement was announced in 2001 and a decommissioning schedule published in 2004 . From May 2005 they were replaced by the Armidale-class patrol boats with the last two Fremantles decommissioning in May 2007 . Most of the class were scrapped , with two marked for preservation as museum ships . The Fremantle class has also appeared in two drama television series based on the Royal Australian Navy ."
