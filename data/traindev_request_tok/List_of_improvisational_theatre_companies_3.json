It has a population of over ten million , making it a megacity and the third-most populous city and fifth-most populous urban agglomeration in India . It is located in southern India , on the Deccan Plateau at an elevation of over 900 m ( 3,000 ft ) above sea level , which is the highest among India 's major cities . Its multi-ethnic , multi-religious , and cosmopolitan character is reflected by its more than 1000 Hindu temples , 400 mosques , 100 churches , 40 Jain Basadis , three Sikh gurdwaras , two Buddhist viharas and one Parsi fire temple located in an area of 741 km\u00b2 of the metropolis .

In 1537 CE , Kemp\u00e9 Gowd\u0101 - a feudal ruler under the Vijayanagara Empire - established a mud fort considered to be the foundation of modern Bengaluru and its oldest areas , or petes , which exist to the present day . After the fall of Vijayanagar empire in 16th century , the Mughals sold Bangalore to Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar ( 1673-1704 ) , the then ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore for three lakh rupees . When Haider Ali seized control of the Kingdom of Mysore , the administration of Bangalore passed into his hands . It was captured by the British East India Company after victory in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War ( 1799 ) , who returned administrative control of the city to the Maharaja of Mysore . The old city developed in the dominions of the Maharaja of Mysore and was made capital of the Princely State of Mysore , which existed as a nominally sovereign entity of the British Raj . In 1809 , the British shifted their cantonment to Bangalore , outside the old city , and a town grew up around it , which was governed as part of British India .",

Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",

Auckland is a diverse , multicultural and cosmopolitan city , home to the largest Polynesian population in the world . The M\u0101ori-language name for Auckland is T\u0101maki Makaurau , meaning T\u0101maki desired by many , in reference to the desirability of its natural resources and geography . Auckland lies between the Hauraki Gulf of the Pacific Ocean to the east , the low Hunua Ranges to the south-east , the Manukau Harbour to the south-west , and the Waitakere Ranges and smaller ranges to the west and north-west . The surrounding hills are covered in rainforest and the landscape is dotted with dozens of dormant volcanic cones . The central part of the urban area occupies a narrow isthmus between the Manukau Harbour on the Tasman Sea and the Waitemat\u0101 Harbour on the Pacific Ocean . Auckland is one of the few cities in the world to have a harbour on each of two separate major bodies of water . The isthmus on which Auckland resides was first settled around 1350 and was valued for its rich and fertile land . The M\u0101ori population in the area is estimated to have peaked at 20,000 before the arrival of Europeans . After a British colony was established in 1840 , William Hobson , then Lieutenant-Governor of New Zealand , chose the area as his new capital .",

New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 mi ) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres ( 600 mi ) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal , fungal , and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , and its most populous city is Auckland . Sometime between 1250 and 1300 , Polynesians settled in the islands and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture . In 1642 , Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight New Zealand . In 1840 , representatives of the United Kingdom and M\u0101ori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi , which declared British sovereignty over the islands .

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",
