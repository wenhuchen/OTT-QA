  "/wiki/Bad_Pass_Trail": "The Bad Pass Trail , also known as the Sioux Trail , was established by Native Americans on the border of present-day Montana and Wyoming as a means of access from the Bighorn Basin in Wyoming to Bison-hunting grounds in the Grapevine Creek area of Montana . Marked by stone cairns , the trail led across Bad Pass and was established in pre-Columbian times . After Europeans arrived in the area it was frequented by fur trappers and mountain men , beginning in 1824 . Trappers assembled pack trains at the junction of the Shoshone River and the Bighorn River , using the Bad Pass Trail to avoid Bighorn Canyon . The trail ended at the mouth of Grapevine Creek on the Bighorn , from which the pack train could float down the Bighorn on rafts to the Yellowstone River and then to the Missouri and on to St. Louis . Approximately three hundred cairns are known to exist along the trail , particularly in Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area . The cairns are believed to have been built incrementally , with passer-by placing stones on the pile as a good luck offering . Much of the trail itself has been altered beyond recognition by the construction of an access road for area ranches . The trail runs along the western side of Bighorn Canyon . It is estimated to have been in use for ten to twelve thousand years . The trail features as many as one thousand tipi rings on either side of the trail , some of which have been evaluated by archeologists . The Bad Pass Trail was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 29 , 1975 .",
  "/wiki/Bighorn_River": "The Bighorn River is a tributary of the Yellowstone , approximately 461 miles ( 742 km ) long , in the states of Wyoming and Montana in the western United States . The river was named in 1805 by fur trader Fran\u00e7ois Larocque for the bighorn sheep he saw along its banks as he explored the Yellowstone . The upper reaches of the Bighorn , south of the Owl Creek Mountains in Wyoming , are known as the Wind River . The two rivers are sometimes referred to as the Wind/Bighorn . The Wind River officially becomes the Bighorn River at the Wedding of the Waters , on the north side of the Wind River Canyon near the town of Thermopolis . From there , the river flows through the Bighorn Basin in north central Wyoming , passing through Thermopolis and Hot Springs State Park . At the border with Montana , the river turns northeast , and flows past the north end of the Bighorn Mountains , through the Crow Indian Reservation , where the Yellowtail Dam forms the Bighorn Lake reservoir . The reservoir and the surrounding canyon are part of the Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area . The Little Bighorn River joins the Bighorn near the town of Hardin , Montana . Approximately fifty miles farther downriver , the Bighorn River ends where it joins the Yellowstone .",
  "/wiki/Bighorn_Canyon_National_Recreation_Area": "Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area is a national park unit established by an act of Congress on October 15 , 1966 , following the construction of the Yellowtail Dam by the Bureau of Reclamation . It straddles the border between Wyoming and Montana . The dam , named after the famous Crow leader Robert Yellowtail , harnesses the waters of the Bighorn River by turning that variable watercourse into Bighorn Lake . The lake extends 71 miles ( 114 km ) through Wyoming and Montana , 55 miles ( 89 km ) of which lie within the national recreation area . About one third of the park unit is located on the Crow Indian Reservation . Nearly one-quarter of the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range lies within the Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area .",
  "/wiki/Bighorn_Ditch_Headgate": "The Bighorn Ditch Headgate , also known as the Bighorn Canal Headgate , was built starting in 1892 to provide irrigation to the Crow Indian Reservation in south central Montana . The headgate structure diverted water from the Bighorn River to their lands . It was designed by William F. Graves , and construction was carried out by Crow workers . The project was completed in 1904 . Today the site is included in Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area . The structure includes a diversion dam extending at an angle into the river to divert water through the headgate into a canal flowing parallel to the river . The headgate structure was built of dressed local limestone , and is 35 feet ( 11 m ) wide , allowing a designed flow of 720 cubic feet ( 20,000 L ) of water per second . Five iron gates controlled the flow . The headgate structure is intermittently inundated by water held in the Yellowtail Dam Afterbay reservoir . The Bighorn Ditch was instrumental to the Crow changing from their nomadic lifestyle to a settled , agrarian society . Their initial attempts at farming in the arid climate , beginning in 1885 , resulted in failure . The government at last recognized that irrigation of the lands would be required for the people to gain consistent yields from their crops .",

The ranch was established about 1903 by prospector Grosvener W. Barry on the South Fork Trail Creek . Barry used the ranch as a home for his family and as a base for his mining ventures , all of which failed . His most lucrative venture was the conversion of Cedarvale from a working ranch to a dude ranch , marketed through an arrangement with the Chicago , Burlington and Quincy Railroad . It was the first dude ranch in the area . Barry introduced powered boats to the Bighorn River to carry dudes to the ranch from the railhead at Kane , Wyoming . As a publicity stunt Barry , his stepson and a neighbor piloted the 16-foot ( 4.9 m ) motorized Edith from the Hillsboro landing down the Bighorn , Yellowstone , Missouri and Mississippi rivers , leaving on May 31 , 1913 and arriving in New Orleans on August 1 .

  "/wiki/Dryhead,_Montana": "Dryhead Country is a region in Carbon County and Big Horn County in southern Montana between Bighorn Canyon and the Pryor Mountains .
