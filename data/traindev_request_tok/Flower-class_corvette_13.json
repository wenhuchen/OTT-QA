The town is governed as part of the Borough of Hartlepool , a unitary authority which also controls outlying villages such as Seaton Carew , Greatham , Hart Village , Dalton Piercy and Elwick . Hartlepool was founded in the 7th century , around the monastery of Hartlepool Abbey . The village grew in the Middle Ages and its harbour served as the official port of the County Palatine of Durham . After a railway link from the north was established from the South Durham coal fields , an additional link from the south , in 1835 , together with a new port , resulted in further expansion , with the new town of West Hartlepool . England 's Industrialisation and the start of a shipbuilding industry in the later part of the 19th century caused Hartlepool to be a target for the Imperial German Navy at the beginning of the First World War . A bombardment of 1,150 shells on 16 December 1914 resulted in the death of 117 people . A severe decline in heavy industries and shipbuilding following the Second World War caused periods of high unemployment until the 1990s when major investment projects and the redevelopment of the docks area into a marina saw a rise in the town 's prospects .",

Germany 's military air arms during World War I , the Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte of the Imperial Army and the Marine-Fliegerabteilung of theImperial Navy had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force . During the interwar period , German pilots were trained secretly in violation of the treaty at Lipetsk Air Base in Soviet Union . With the rise of the Nazi Party and the repudiation of the Versailles Treaty , the Luftwaffe 's existence was publicly acknowledged on 26 February 1935 , just over two weeks before open defiance of the Versailles Treaty through German re-armament and conscription would be announced on 16 March . The Condor Legion , a Luftwaffe detachment sent to aid Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War , provided the force with a valuable testing ground for new tactics and aircraft . Partially as a result of this combat experience , the Luftwaffe had become one of the most sophisticated , technologically advanced , and battle-experienced air forces in the world when World War II broke out in 1939 . By the summer of 1939 , the Luftwaffe had twenty-eight Geschwader ( wings ) . The Luftwaffe also operated Fallschirmj\u00e4ger paratrooper units . The Luftwaffe proved instrumental in the German victories across Poland and Western Europe in 1939 and 1940 .

  "/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea": "The Mediterranean Sea is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean , surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land : on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia , on the south by North Africa and on the east by the Levant . Although the sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean , it is usually referred to as a separate body of water . Geological evidence indicates that around 5.9 million years ago , the Mediterranean was cut off from the Atlantic and was partly or completely desiccated over a period of some 600,000 years ( the Messinian salinity crisis ) before being refilled by the Zanclean flood about 5.3 million years ago . It covers an area of about 2,500,000 km2 ( 970,000 sq mi ) , representing 0.7% of the global ocean surface , but its connection to the Atlantic via the Strait of Gibraltar - the narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates Spain in Europe from Morocco in Africa - is only 14 km ( 9 mi ) wide . In oceanography , it is sometimes called the Eurafrican Mediterranean Sea or the European Mediterranean Sea to distinguish it from mediterranean seas elsewhere . The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500 m ( 4,900 ft ) and the deepest recorded point is 5,267 m ( 17,280 ft ) in the Calypso Deep in the Ionian Sea . It lies between latitudes 30\u00b0 and 46\u00b0 N and longitudes 6\u00b0 W and 36\u00b0 E. Its west-east length , from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Gulf of Iskenderun , on the southeastern coast of Turkey , is about 4,000 kilometres ( 2,500 mi ) . The sea was an important route for merchants and travellers of ancient times , facilitating trade and cultural exchange between peoples of the region .

It is the widest of the three outlets for the Gulf of Saint Lawrence into the Atlantic Ocean , the others being the Strait of Belle Isle and Strait of Canso . It is named for the Genoese explorer Giovanni Caboto . The strait 's bathymetry is varied , with the Laurentian Channel creating a deep trench through its centre , and comparatively shallow coastal waters closer to Newfoundland and Cape Breton Island . These bathymetric conditions have been known by mariners to cause rogue waves . The steep slope of the Laurentian Channel was the site of a disastrous submarine landslide at the southeastern end of the strait , triggered by the 1929 Grand Banks earthquake and leading to a tsunami that devastated communities along Newfoundland 's south coast and parts of Cape Breton Island . A strategically important waterway throughout Canadian and Newfoundland history , the strait is also an important international shipping route , being the primary waterway linking the Atlantic with inland ports on the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway . The strait is crossed daily by the Marine Atlantic ferry service linking Channel-Port aux Basques , and North Sydney . Ferries have been operating across the strait since 1898 and a submarine telegraph cable was laid in 1856 as part of the transatlantic telegraph cable project .

Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels .",

At 592,800 square kilometres ( 228,900 sq mi ) Madagascar is the world 's 2nd largest island country . The nation comprises the island of Madagascar ( the fourth- largest island in the world ) and numerous smaller peripheral islands . Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana , Madagascar split from the Indian subcontinent around 88 million years ago , allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation . Consequently , Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot ; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth . The island 's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats . The archaeological evidence of the earliest human foraging on Madagascar may date up to 10,000 years ago . Human settlement of Madagascar occurred between 350 BC and 550 AD by Indianized Austronesian peoples , arriving on outrigger canoes from Indonesia . The social and religious situation of Indonesia during those times were that of Hinduism and Buddhism , along with native Indonesian culture . These were joined around the 9th century AD by Bantu migrants crossing the Mozambique Channel from East Africa . Other groups continued to settle on Madagascar over time , each one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life . The Malagasy ethnic group is often divided into 18 or more subgroups , of which the largest are the Merina of the central highlands .",

Constituting the bulk of the territory of Murmansk Oblast , it lies almost completely inside the Arctic Circle and is bordered by the Barents Sea in the north and the White Sea in the east and southeast . The city of Murmansk is the most populous human settlement on the peninsula , with a population of over 300,000 as of the 2010 Census . While the north of the peninsula was already settled in the 7th-5th millennium BCE , the rest of its territory remained uninhabited until the 3rd millennium BCE , when various peoples started to arrive from the south . However , by the 1st millennium CE only the Sami people remained . This changed in the 12th century , when Russian Pomors discovered the peninsula 's game and fish riches . Soon after , the Pomors were followed by the tribute collectors from the Novgorod Republic , and the peninsula gradually became a part of the Novgorodian lands . No permanent settlements , however , were established by the Novgorodians until the 15th century . The Soviet period saw a rapid increase of the population , although most of it remained confined to urbanized territories along the sea coast and the railroads . The Sami people were subject to forced collectivization , including forced relocation to Lovozero and other centralized settlements , and overall the peninsula was heavily industrialized and militarized , largely due to its strategic position and the discovery of the vast apatite deposits in the 1920s . As a result , the ecology of the peninsula suffered major ecological damage , including contamination by military nuclear waste and nickel smelting . After the dissolution of the Soviet Union , the economy went into decline and the population quickly started to decrease .",

  "/wiki/Naval_trawler": "A naval trawler is a vessel built along the lines of a fishing trawler but fitted out for naval purposes . Naval trawlers were widely used during the First and Second World Wars . Fishing trawlers were particularly suited for many naval requirements because they were robust boats designed to work heavy trawls in all types of weather and had large clear working decks . One could create a mine sweeper simply by replacing the trawl with a mine sweep . Adding depth charge racks on the deck , ASDIC below , and a 3-inch ( 76 mm ) or 4-inch ( 102 mm ) gun in the bow equipped the trawler for anti-submarine duties .",

It has an area of 6.7 km2 ( 2.6 sq mi ) and is bordered to the north by Spain . The landscape is dominated by the Rock of Gibraltar at the foot of which is a densely populated town area , home to over 32,000 people , primarily Gibraltarians . In 1704 , Anglo-Dutch forces captured Gibraltar from Spain during the War of the Spanish Succession on behalf of the Habsburg claim to the Spanish throne . The territory was ceded to Great Britain in perpetuity under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 . During World War II it was an important base for the Royal Navy as it controlled the entrance and exit to the Mediterranean Sea , the Strait of Gibraltar , which is only 14.3 km ( 8.9 mi ) wide at this naval choke point . It remains strategically important , with half the world 's seaborne trade passing through the strait . Today Gibraltar 's economy is based largely on tourism , online gambling , financial services and cargo ship refuelling . The sovereignty of Gibraltar is a point of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations because Spain asserts a claim to the territory . Gibraltarians rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty in a 1967 referendum and , in a 2002 referendum , the idea of shared sovereignty was also rejected ."
