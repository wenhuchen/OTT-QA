Tainan is the oldest city on the island of Taiwan and also commonly known as the Capital City [ II ] for its over 200 years of history as the capital of Taiwan under Koxinga and later Qing rule . Tainan 's complex history of comebacks , redefinitions and renewals inspired its popular nickname the Phoenix City . As Taiwan 's oldest urban area , Tainan was initially established by the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) as a ruling and trading base called Fort Zeelandia during the period of Dutch rule on the island . After Dutch colonists were defeated by Koxinga in 1661 , Tainan remained as the capital of the Tungning Kingdom until 1683 and afterwards the capital of Taiwan Prefecture under Qing Dynasty rule until 1887 , when the new provincial capital was moved to Taipei . Tainan has been historically regarded as one of the oldest cities in Taiwan , and its former name , Tayouan , has been claimed to be the origin of the name Taiwan .
