  "/wiki/Crisis_pregnancy_center": "A crisis pregnancy center ( CPC ) , sometimes called a pregnancy resource center ( PRC ) , is a type of nonprofit organization established to counsel pregnant women against having an abortion . CPCs generally provide peer counseling related to abortion , pregnancy , and childbirth , and may also offer additional non-medical services such as financial assistance , child-rearing resources , and adoption referrals . CPCs that qualify as medical clinics may also provide pregnancy testing , sonograms , and other services . However , CPCs have also frequently been found to disseminate false medical information , usually about the supposed physical and mental health risks of abortion , but sometimes also about the effectiveness of condoms and the prevention of sexually transmitted infections . CPCs are typically run by Christians who adhere to a strictly socially conservative viewpoint , and they often operate in affiliation with one of three non-profit organizations : Care Net , Heartbeat International , and Birthright International . As of 2013 [ update ] , there were approximately 2,500 CPCs in the United States , as compared with 1,800 abortion clinics , and Canada has several times as many CPCs as abortion clinics . Hundreds more CPCs operate outside of the U.S. and Canada . During the Presidency of George W. Bush ( 2001-2009 ) CPCs received tens of millions of dollars in federal grants . As of 2015 [ update ] , more than half of the U.S. states helped to fund crisis pregnancy centers either directly and/or through the sale of Choose Life license plates . Legal and legislative action regarding CPCs has generally attempted to curb deceptive advertising , targeting those that imply that they offer abortion services by requiring centers to disclose that they do not offer certain services or possess certain qualifications . In 1993 , the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates ( NIFLA ) was formed to provide legal advice to CPCs in the U.S .",
