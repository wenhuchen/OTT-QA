  "/wiki/The_Comedy_of_Errors": "The Comedy of Errors is one of William Shakespeare 's early plays . It is his shortest and one of his most farcical comedies , with a major part of the humour coming from slapstick and mistaken identity , in addition to puns and word play . The Comedy of Errors is , along with The Tempest , one of only two Shakespearean plays to observe the Aristotelian principle of unity of time - that is , that the events of a play should occur over 24 hours . It has been adapted for opera , stage , screen and musical theatre numerous times worldwide . In the centuries following its premiere , the play 's title has entered the popular English lexicon as an idiom for an event or series of events made ridiculous by the number of errors that were made throughout . Set in the Greek city of Ephesus , The Comedy of Errors tells the story of two sets of identical twins who were accidentally separated at birth . Antipholus of Syracuse and his servant , Dromio of Syracuse , arrive in Ephesus , which turns out to be the home of their twin brothers , Antipholus of Ephesus and his servant , Dromio of Ephesus . When the Syracusans encounter the friends and families of their twins , a series of wild mishaps based on mistaken identities lead to wrongful beatings , a near-seduction , the arrest of Antipholus of Ephesus , and false accusations of infidelity , theft , madness , and demonic possession .",

  "/wiki/The_Government_Inspector": "The Government Inspector , also known as The Inspector General ( Russian : \u00ab \u0420\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0440 \u00bb , Revizor , literally : Inspector ) , is a satirical play by the Russian and Ukrainian dramatist and novelist Nikolai Gogol . Originally published in 1836 , the play was revised for an 1842 edition . Based upon an anecdote allegedly recounted to Gogol by Pushkin , the play is a comedy of errors , satirizing human greed , stupidity , and the extensive political corruption of Imperial Russia . According to D. S. Mirsky , the play is not only supreme in character and dialogue - it is one of the few Russian plays constructed with unerring art from beginning to end . The great originality of its plan consisted in the absence of all love interest and of sympathetic characters . The latter feature was deeply resented by Gogol 's enemies , and as a satire the play gained immensely from it . There is not a wrong word or intonation from beginning to end , and the comic tension is of a quality that even Gogol did not always have at his beck and call . The dream-like scenes of the play , often mirroring each other , whirl in the endless vertigo of self-deception around the main character , Khlestakov , who personifies irresponsibility , light-mindedness , absence of measure . He is full of meaningless movement and meaningless fermentation incarnate , on a foundation of placidly ambitious inferiority ( D.S . Mirsky ) . The publication of the play led to a great outcry in the reactionary press . It took the personal intervention of Tsar Nicholas I to have the play staged , with Mikhail Shchepkin taking the role of the Mayor .",
