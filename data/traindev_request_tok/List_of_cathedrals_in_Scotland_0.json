  "/wiki/Brechin_Cathedral": "Brechin Cathedral dates from the 13th century . As a congregation of the Church of Scotland , which is Presbyterian , the church is not technically a cathedral , in spite of its name . It is in the Pointed style , but suffered maltreatment in 1806 at the hands of restorers , whose work was subsequently removed during the restoration completed in 1902 . The western gable with its flamboyant window , Gothic door and massive square tower , parts of the ( much truncated ) choir , and the nave pillars and clerestory are all that is left of the original edifice . The modern stained glass in the chancel is reckoned amongst the finest in Scotland . The Cathedral is a category A listed building and the attached Round Tower is a scheduled monument .",
  "/wiki/Presbytery_of_Angus": "The Church of Scotland has a Presbyterian structure , which means it is organised under a hierarchy of courts . Traditionally there were four levels of courts : the Kirk Session ( at congregational level ) , the Presbytery ( at local area level ) , the Synod ( at a regional level ) and the General Assembly ( the Church 's highest court ) . However , the synods were abolished in the early 1990s . Scottish local government was reorganised in 1975 , creating a new system of regions and districts to replace the long-standing counties and burghs . The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland also ordered a major reorganisation of presbyteries in the mid-1970s , redrawing presbytery boundaries to make them broadly contiguous with the then-new local government boundaries . An example was the union of the former Presbyteries of Cupar and St Andrews , creating a new Presbytery of St Andrews ( which also included the Parishes of Newport-on-Tay , Wormit and Tayport , previously in the Presbytery of Dundee ) . This new Presbytery 's boundaries mirrored the North East Fife District Council . Following further local government reorganisation in the 1990s ( replacing regions and districts with a single-tier system of councils ) , it was proposed to further considerably reduce the number of Presbyteries ( possibly to as few as seven ) . This proposal was rejected by the General Assembly . Since 2003 several presbyteries have voluntarily sought permission to merge , as described below . Despite these mergers the existing Presbytery numbering system is being retained , albeit now with some gaps . It is the presbyteries which have oversight of parishes and pastoral responsibility for parish ministers , and the Kirk Sessions of the individual parishes are subordinated to them .",

  "/wiki/St_Giles'_Cathedral": "St Giles ' Cathedral , or the High Kirk of Edinburgh , is a parish church of the Church of Scotland located in the Old Town of Edinburgh . Likely founded in the 12th century and dedicated to Saint Giles , the church was elevated to collegiate status by Pope Paul II in 1467 . In 1559 , the church became Protestant with John Knox , the foremost figure of the Scottish Reformation , as its minister . After the Reformation , St Giles ' was internally partitioned to serve multiple congregations as well as secular purposes , including as a prison , and as meeting places for the Court of Session and the Parliament of Scotland . During periods of episcopacy within the Church of Scotland , St Giles ' briefly served as a cathedral in the 17th century . In 1637 , a riot at St Giles ' against the religious reforms of Charles I precipitated the formation of the Covenanters and the beginnings of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms . In the 19th century , St Giles ' was restored and the internal partitions were removed . The current church building dates from the 14th century onwards and its distinctive crown steeple is one of Edinburgh 's best-known landmarks . Since the medieval period , St Giles ' has been the site of nationally important events and services and the chapel of the Order of the Thistle is located here . The church 's role in the Scottish Reformation and the Covenanters Rebellion has led to its being called the Mother Church of World Presbyterianism . Alongside housing an active congregation , the church is one of Scotland 's most popular visitor sites , welcoming over a million visitors in 2018 .",
