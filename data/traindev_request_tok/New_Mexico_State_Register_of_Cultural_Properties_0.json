  "/wiki/Salmon_Ruins": "Salmon Ruins is an ancient Chacoan and Pueblo site located in the northwest corner of New Mexico , USA . Salmon was constructed by migrants from Chaco Canyon around 1090 CE , with 275 to 300 original rooms spread across three stories , an elevated tower kiva in its central portion , and a great kiva in its plaza . Subsequent use by local Middle San Juan people ( beginning in the 1120s ) resulted in extensive modifications to the original building , with the reuse of hundreds of rooms , division of many of the original large , Chacoan rooms into smaller rooms , and emplacement of more than 20 small kivas into pueblo rooms and plaza areas . The site was occupied by ancient Ancestral Puebloans until the 1280s , when much of the site was destroyed by fire and abandoned ( Reed 2006b ) . The pueblo is situated on the north bank of the San Juan River , just to the west of the modern town of Bloomfield , New Mexico , and about 45 miles ( 72 km ) north of Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon . The site was built on the first alluvial terrace above the San Juan River floodplain . The ruins of Salmon Pueblo were excavated between 1970 and 1979 , under the direction of Cynthia Irwin-Williams of Eastern New Mexico University in partnership with the San Juan County Museum Association ( Irwin-Williams 2006 , p. 17-27 ) . The San Juan Valley Archaeological Program resulted in the excavation of slightly more than one-third of Salmon 's ground floor rooms . More than 1.5 million artifacts and samples were recovered from Salmon . In 1980 , Irwin-Williams and co-principal investigator Phillip Shelley wrote , compiled and edited a multivolume , 1,500-page report . The document fulfilled the reporting requirements for the series of grants under which the project had been completed but it was not intended for publication . Throughout the 1980s , Irwin-Williams and Shelley worked on a modified and greatly reduced manuscript , with the goal of producing a publishable report .",

  "/wiki/Trinity_(nuclear_test)": "Trinity was the code name of the first detonation of a nuclear device . It was conducted by the United States Army at 5:29 a.m. on July 16 , 1945 , as part of the Manhattan Project . The test was conducted in the Jornada del Muerto desert about 35 miles ( 56 km ) southeast of Socorro , New Mexico , on what was then the USAAF Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range , now part of White Sands Missile Range . The only structures originally in the vicinity were the McDonald Ranch House and its ancillary buildings , which scientists used as a laboratory for testing bomb components . A base camp was constructed , and there were 425 people present on the weekend of the test . The code name Trinity was assigned by J. Robert Oppenheimer , the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory , inspired by the poetry of John Donne . The test was of an implosion-design plutonium device , informally nicknamed The Gadget , of the same design as the Fat Man bomb later detonated over Nagasaki , Japan , on August 9 , 1945 . The complexity of the design required a major effort from the Los Alamos Laboratory , and concerns about whether it would work led to a decision to conduct the first nuclear test . The test was planned and directed by Kenneth Bainbridge . Fears of a fizzle led to the construction of a steel containment vessel called Jumbo that could contain the plutonium , allowing it to be recovered , but Jumbo was not used . A rehearsal was held on May 7 , 1945 , in which 108 short tons ( 96 long tons ; 98 t ) of high explosive spiked with radioactive isotopes were detonated . The Gadget 's detonation released the explosive energy of about 22 kilotons of TNT ( 92 TJ ) .",
