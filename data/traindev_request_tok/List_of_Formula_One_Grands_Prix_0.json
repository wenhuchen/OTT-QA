It was both Button and Brawn 's first Championship success , Brawn becoming the first team to win the Constructors ' Championship in their debut season . Button was the tenth British driver to win the championship , and following Lewis Hamilton 's success in 2008 it was the first time the Championship had been won by English drivers in consecutive seasons , and the first time since Graham Hill ( 1968 ) and Jackie Stewart ( 1969 ) that consecutive championships have been won by British drivers . Also notable was the success of Red Bull Racing , as well as the poor performance of McLaren and Ferrari compared to the previous season . Ten teams participated in the Championship after several rule changes were implemented by the FIA to cut costs to try to minimise the impact of the global financial crisis . There were further changes to try to improve the on-track spectacle with the return of slick tyres , changes to aerodynamics and the introduction of Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems ( KERS ) presenting some of the biggest changes in Formula One regulations for several decades . The Brawn team , formed as a result of a management buyout of the Honda team , won six of the first seven races , their ability to make the most of the new regulations being a deciding factor in the Championship . The Red Bull , McLaren and Ferrari teams caught up in an unpredictable second half of the season , with the season being the first time since 2005 that all participating teams had scored World Championship points . Sebastian Vettel and Button 's teammate Rubens Barrichello were his main challengers over the season , winning six races between them to finish in second and third respectively .",

The championship was contested over twenty rounds , which started in Australia on 18 March and ended in Brazil on 25 November . The 2012 season saw the return of the United States Grand Prix , which was held at the Circuit of the Americas , a purpose-built circuit in Austin , Texas . After being cancelled in 2011 due to civil protests , the Bahrain Grand Prix also returned to the calendar . The early season was tumultuous , with seven different drivers winning the first seven races of the championship ; a record for the series . It was not until the European Grand Prix in June that a driver , Ferrari 's Fernando Alonso , won his second race of the year , and with it , emerged as a championship contender . Alonso maintained his hold on the championship lead for the next seven races , taking his third win in Germany and finishing on the podium in the United Kingdom , Italy and Singapore . However , costly first-lap retirements in Belgium and Japan allowed his rivals to catch up , and defending World Champion Sebastian Vettel - like Alonso , a two-time title winner - took the lead in the sixteenth race of the season . Vettel , too , encountered difficulties throughout the season ; contact with a backmarker left him to finish outside the points in Malaysia , while alternator failures at the European and Italian Grands Prix cost him valuable points and exclusion from qualifying in Abu Dhabi led him to start from the pit lane . Vettel entered the final race of the season with a thirteen-point lead over Alonso . Alonso needed a podium finish to stand any chance of becoming World Drivers ' Champion , but in a race of attrition that finished under the safety car , Vettel finished in sixth place , scoring enough points to win his third consecutive championship , becoming just the third driver in the sport 's sixty-three-year history to do so .",
  "/wiki/Belgian_Grand_Prix": "The Belgian Grand Prix ( Dutch : Grote Prijs van Belgi\u00eb ; French : Grand Prix de Belgique ; German : Gro\u00dfer Preis von Belgien ) is an automobile race , part of the Formula One World Championship . The first national race of Belgium was held in 1925 at the Spa region 's race course , an area of the country that had been associated with motor sport since the very early years of racing . To accommodate Grand Prix motor racing , the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps race course was built in 1921 but until 1924 it was used only for motorcycle racing . After the 1923 success of the new 24 hours of Le Mans in France , the Spa 24 Hours , a similar 24-hour endurance race , was run at the Spa track . Since its inception , Spa-Francorchamps has been known for its unpredictable weather . At one stage in its history it had rained at the Belgian Grand Prix for twenty years in a row . Frequently drivers confront a part of the course that is clear and bright while another stretch is rainy and slippery . The Belgian Grand Prix was designated the European Grand Prix six times between 1925 and 1973 , when this title was an honorary designation given each year to one Grand Prix race in Europe . It is one of the most popular races on the Formula One calendar , due to the scenic and historical Spa-Francorchamps circuit being a favourite of drivers and fans .",

Nelson Piquet won the Drivers ' Championship , his second Formula One title and the first to be won by a driver using a turbocharged engine , while Ferrari won the Constructors ' Championship . The Drivers ' Championship developed into a four-way battle between Brabham-BMW driver Piquet , Renault driver Alain Prost and Ferrari duo Ren\u00e9 Arnoux and Patrick Tambay . Prost led the championship from the Belgian Grand Prix in May until the final race in South Africa in October , where a turbo problem forced him to retire and thus enabled Piquet to snatch the title . Ferrari won the Constructors ' Championship despite its better driver , Arnoux , finishing only third overall - a unique feat in Formula One history . The season also included a single non-championship Formula One race , the Race of Champions , which was held at Brands Hatch and won by defending World Champion Keke Rosberg in a Williams-Ford . This was to be the last non-championship race in Formula One history . A major change in technical regulations mandated a flat undertray for the cars , with a complete ban on the ground effect technology pioneered by the Lotus 78 in 1977 . This was done to reduce downforce and cornering speeds , which were deemed to have reached dangerous levels in 1982 , a season in which several violent and fatal accidents occurred .",

It featured the 1993 Formula One World Championship for Drivers and the 1993 Formula One World Championship for Constructors , which were contested concurrently over a sixteen-race series that commenced on 14 March and ended on 7 November . Alain Prost won his fourth and final Drivers ' Championship , and Williams-Renault won their second consecutive Constructors ' Championship , the sixth in all for Williams . The 1993 season saw the return of the European Grand Prix to the calendar after eight years ; the race , held at Donington Park , replaced the Pacific Grand Prix at the Autopolis circuit in Japan after a deal to hold a race there fell through . The Mexican Grand Prix left the calendar for the second time after seven years , due to safety concerns surrounding the very bumpy surface of the Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez ; it would not return until 2015 . 1993 marked the height of the use of electronics technology in Formula One , with perhaps the most advanced and sophisticated F1 cars ever built . The championship-winning Williams car , the FW15C , featured hydraulically- and electronically-controlled active suspension , plus power steering , anti-lock brakes , fly-by-wire controls , traction control , a semi-automatic gearbox that could be switched over to fully automatic , highly sophisticated on-board telemetry , pneumatic valve springs in the engine , and even a push to pass system that , at least in theory , made overtaking easier . Williams also tested a continuously variable transmission , while Benetton-Ford tested a four-wheel steering system late in the season . Nearly all cars in 1993 had an active suspension system , which kept the car 's ride height consistent throughout a lap , making the aerodynamics of the car more efficient and effective . All these systems would be banned for 1994 , except for the on-board telemetry and pneumatic valve springs . In addition to winning his fourth Drivers ' Championship , Prost achieved his 50th F1 victory at the British Grand Prix , becoming the first driver to reach this milestone . His fierce rival , Ayrton Senna , finished runner-up in the championship after winning five races for McLaren-Ford ; these included his home race in Brazil , the European Grand Prix in wet conditions , and , for the fifth year in succession and sixth time in all , the Monaco Grand Prix .",

The Drivers ' Championship was won for a second consecutive time by Mika H\u00e4kkinen , although Eddie Irvine , David Coulthard and Heinz-Harald Frentzen all had a chance of winning the title at various stages . Ferrari won their ninth Constructors ' title , and their first since the 1983 season , paving the way for the Michael Schumacher era of Ferrari dominance beginning in 2000 . However , Schumacher 's participation in the 1999 championship was cut short due to injury at the British Grand Prix , where he suffered a broken leg in a crash . He returned for the last two races of the season in order to assist Irvine in his championship run . The championship finale was set up in controversial circumstances : at the inaugural Malaysian Grand Prix , Ferrari took first and second places , but were disqualified for a breach of the technical regulations . They were reinstated on appeal , ensuring that Irvine had the title lead before the final race in Japan . If Schumacher won , fourth or higher would seal the title for Irvine . Schumacher took pole but lost the start to H\u00e4kkinen who then drove away at the front , never being troubled for position by Schumacher in spite of him running close all race . Had Ferrari switched their cars Irvine would have still lost the title on countback due to H\u00e4kkinen 's five wins compared with Irvine 's four . In the end Irvine finished a distant third and fell short in his championship title bid .",

It has been organised by the Automobilclub von Deutschland ( AvD ) since 1926 . The German Grand Prix was held at Hockenheimring every year between 1977 and 2006 ( except 1985 ) .
