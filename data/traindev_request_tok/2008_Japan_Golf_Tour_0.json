  "/wiki/Japanese_yen": "The yen ( Japanese : \u5186 , Hepburn : en , symbol : \u00a5 ; code : JPY ; also abbreviated as JP\u00a5 ) is the official currency of Japan . It is the third most traded currency in the foreign exchange market after the United States dollar and the euro . It is also widely used as a reserve currency after the U.S. dollar , the euro , and the pound sterling . The concept of the yen was a component of the Meiji government 's modernization program of Japan 's economy , which postulated the pursuit of a uniform currency throughout the country , modelled after the European decimal currency system . Before the Meiji Restoration , Japan 's feudal fiefs all issued their own money , hansatsu , in an array of incompatible denominations . The New Currency Act of 1871 did away with these and established the yen , which was defined as 1.5 g ( 0.048 troy ounces ) of gold , or 24.26 g ( 0.780 troy ounces ) of silver , as the new decimal currency . The former han ( fiefs ) became prefectures and their mints private chartered banks , which initially retained the right to print money . To bring an end to this situation , the Bank of Japan was founded in 1882 and given a monopoly on controlling the money supply . Following World War II the yen lost much of its prewar value . To stabilize the Japanese economy the exchange rate of the yen was fixed at \u00a5360 per US $ 1 as part of the Bretton Woods system . When that system was abandoned in 1971 , the yen became undervalued and was allowed to float . The yen had appreciated to a peak of \u00a5271 per US $ 1 in 1973 , then underwent periods of depreciation and appreciation due to the 1973 oil crisis , arriving at a value of \u00a5227 per US $ 1 by 1980 .",
