  "/wiki/Light_Sky_Blue": "Sky blue is a colour that resembles the colour of the unclouded sky at noon ( azure ) reflecting off a metallic surface . The entry for sky-blue in Murray 's New English Dictionary ( 1919 ) reports a first sighting of the term in the article on silver in Ephraim Chambers 's Cyclopaedia of 1728 . However , many writers had used the term sky blue to name a colour before Chambers . For example , we find sky blue in A Collection of Voyages and Travels ( London : Awnsham and John Churchill , 1704 ) , vol . 2 , p. 322 , where John Nieuhoff describes certain flowers : they are of a lovely sky blue colour , and yellow in the middle . The sense of this colour may have been first used in 1585 in a book by Nicolas de Nicolay where he stated the tulbant [ clarification needed ] of the merchant must be skie coloured .",
  "/wiki/Orange_(colour)": "Orange is the colour between yellow and red on the spectrum of visible light . Human eyes perceive orange when observing light with a dominant wavelength between roughly 585 and 620 nanometres . In painting and traditional colour theory , it is a secondary colour of pigments , created by mixing yellow and red . It is named after the fruit of the same name . The orange colour of carrots , pumpkins , sweet potatoes , oranges , and many other fruits and vegetables comes from carotenes , a type of photosynthetic pigment . These pigments convert the light energy that the plants absorb from the sun into chemical energy for the plants ' growth . Similarly the hues of autumn leaves are from the same pigment after chlorophyll is removed . In Europe and America , surveys show that orange is the colour most associated with amusement , the unconventional , extroverts , warmth , fire , energy , activity , danger , taste and aroma , the autumn and Allhallowtide seasons , as well as having long been the national colour of the Netherlands and the House of Orange . It also serves as the political colour of Christian democracy political ideology and most Christian democratic political parties . In Asia it is an important symbolic colour of Buddhism and Hinduism .",
  "/wiki/Black": "Black is the darkest color , the result of the absence or complete absorption of visible light . It is an achromatic color , a color without hue , like white and gray . It is often used symbolically or figuratively to represent darkness , while white represents light . Black and white have often been used to describe opposites such as good and evil , the Dark Ages versus Age of Enlightenment , and night versus day . Since the Middle Ages , black has been the symbolic color of solemnity and authority , and for this reason is still commonly worn by judges and magistrates , including the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court . Black was one of the first colors used by artists in neolithic cave paintings . In the 14th century , it was worn by royalty , clergy , judges and government officials in much of Europe . It became the color worn by English romantic poets , businessmen and statesmen in the 19th century , and a high fashion color in the 20th century . In the Roman Empire , it became the color of mourning , and over the centuries it was frequently associated with death , evil , witches and magic . According to surveys in Europe and North America , it is the color most commonly associated with mourning , the end , secrets , magic , force , violence , evil , and elegance . Black ink is the most common color used for printing books , newspapers and documents , as it provides the highest contrast with white paper and thus the easiest color to read . Similarly , black text on a white screen is the most common format used on computer screens .",
  "/wiki/White": "White is the lightest color and is achromatic ( having no hue ) . It is the color of fresh snow , chalk and milk , and is the opposite of black . White objects fully reflect and scatter all the visible wavelengths of light . White on television and computer screens is created by a mixture of red , blue and green light . In ancient Egypt and ancient Rome , priestesses wore white as a symbol of purity , and Romans wore a white toga as a symbol of citizenship . In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a white unicorn symbolized chastity , and a white lamb sacrifice and purity . It was the royal color of the kings of France , and of the monarchist movement that opposed the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War ( 1917-1922 ) . Greek and Roman temples were faced with white marble , and beginning in the 18th century , with the advent of neoclassical architecture , white became the most common color of new churches , capitols and other government buildings , especially in the United States . It was also widely used in 20th century modern architecture as a symbol of modernity and simplicity . According to surveys in Europe and the United States , white is the color most often associated with perfection , the good , honesty , cleanliness , the beginning , the new , neutrality , and exactitude . White is an important color for almost all world religions . The pope , the head of the Roman Catholic Church , has worn white since 1566 , as a symbol of purity and sacrifice .",
  "/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory": "The Australian Capital Territory , formerly known as the Federal Capital Territory until 1938 and commonly referred to as the ACT , is a federal territory of Australia containing the Australian capital city of Canberra and some surrounding townships . It is located in the south-east of the country and is an enclave within the state of New South Wales . Founded after Federation as the seat of government for the new nation , all important institutions of the Australian federal government are centred in the territory . On 1 January 1901 , federation of the colonies of Australia was achieved . Section 125 of the new Australian Constitution provided that land , situated in New South Wales and at least 100 miles ( 160 km ) from Sydney , would be ceded to the new federal government . Following discussion and exploration of various areas within New South Wales , the Seat of Government Act 1908 was passed in 1908 which specified a capital in the Yass-Canberra region . The territory was transferred to the Commonwealth by New South Wales in 1911 , two years prior to the capital city being founded and formally named as Canberra in 1913 . While the overwhelming majority of the population reside in the city of Canberra in the ACT 's north-east , the territory also includes some surrounding townships such as Williamsdale , Naas , Uriarra , Tharwa and Hall . The ACT also includes the Namadgi National Park which comprises the majority of land area of the territory . Despite a common misconception , the Jervis Bay Territory is not part of the ACT although the laws of the Australian Capital Territory apply as if Jervis Bay did form part of the ACT .

It is sparsely populated , with a population of only 245,800 , fewer than half as many people as Tasmania . The archaeological history of the Northern Territory begins over 40,000 years ago when Indigenous Australians settled the region . Makassan traders began trading with the indigenous people of the Northern Territory for trepang from at least the 18th century onwards . The coast of the territory was first seen by Europeans in the 17th century . The British were the first Europeans to attempt to settle the coastal regions . After three failed attempts to establish a settlement ( 1824-28 , 1838-49 , and 1864-66 ) , success was achieved in 1869 with the establishment of a settlement at Port Darwin .

The island is believed to have been occupied by indigenous peoples for 30,000 years before British colonisation . It is thought Aboriginal Tasmanians were separated from the mainland Aboriginal groups about 10,000 years ago when the sea rose to form Bass Strait . The Aboriginal population is estimated to have been between 3,000 and 7,000 at the time of colonisation , but was almost wiped out within 30 years by a combination of violent guerrilla conflict with settlers known as the Black War , intertribal conflict , and from the late 1820s , the spread of infectious diseases to which they had no immunity . The conflict , which peaked between 1825 and 1831 , and led to more than three years of martial law , cost the lives of almost 1,100 Aboriginals and settlers .",
  "/wiki/Gold": "Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au ( from Latin : aurum ) and atomic number 79 , making it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally . In its purest form , it is a bright , slightly reddish yellow , dense , soft , malleable , and ductile metal . Chemically , gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element . It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions . Gold often occurs in free elemental ( native ) form , as nuggets or grains , in rocks , in veins , and in alluvial deposits . It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver ( as electrum ) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium . Less commonly , it occurs in minerals as gold compounds , often with tellurium ( gold tellurides ) . Gold is resistant to most acids , though it does dissolve in aqua regia , a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid , which forms a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion . Gold is insoluble in nitric acid , which dissolves silver and base metals , a property that has long been used to refine gold and to confirm the presence of gold in metallic objects , giving rise to the term acid test . Gold also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide , which are used in mining and electroplating . Gold dissolves in mercury , forming amalgam alloys , but this is not a chemical reaction . A relatively rare element , gold is a precious metal that has been used for coinage , jewelry , and other arts throughout recorded history .",

The first European visitor to Western Australia was the Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog , who visited the Western Australian coast in 1616 . The first European settlement of Western Australia occurred following the landing by Major Edmund Lockyer on 26 December 1826 of an expedition on behalf of the New South Wales colonial government . He established a convict-supported military garrison at King George III Sound , at present-day Albany , and on 21 January 1827 formally took possession of the western third of the continent for the British Crown . This was followed by the establishment of the Swan River Colony in 1829 , including the site of the present-day capital , Perth . York was the first inland settlement in Western Australia . Situated 97 kilometres ( 60 miles ) east of Perth , it was settled on 16 September 1831 .

The team was first formed in 1983 to compete in a once-off post-season exhibition match in Mildura , and another once-off game was played in 1994 . Since 2003 , the team has played a regular biennial pre-season match against an Australian Football League ( AFL ) club ; the only exception was in 2011 , when the scheduled match was cancelled due to inclement weather . The matches are usually played in the Northern Territory , either at Marrara Oval in Darwin or Traeger Park in Alice Springs . The AFL promotes the concept as recognition of the indigenous Australians ' contribution to the national competition , with approximately one in ten AFL players identifying as an Indigenous Australian . The AFL has been criticised for letting its clubs prevent the All-Stars from selecting its top Indigenous senior players , or for placing restrictions on their game time . Additionally , the competing club side often treats the match as a preseason practice match , such that winning the match is less important than developing young players or building match fitness prior to the regular season . Despite this , the match remains popular with spectators in the Northern Territory . The best on ground for the Indigenous All-Stars is awarded the Polly Farmer Medal which is in honour of Graham Farmer . As of 2015 , the All-Stars have won six of the eight matches it has played .

The sport is popular elsewhere in the state , and has been the dominant code in the Riverina ( the region of New South Wales closest to Victoria ) and Broken Hill ( located near the South Australian border ) . Its popularity is constantly increasing northward , across what is known as the Barassi Line . The code 's recent growth in popularity in Sydney ( where the majority of the state 's population lives ) has been partly tied to the success of the Sydney Swans which relocated from Melbourne in 1982 . Since 1996 , when it first made the Grand Final , the club has generated media hype and public interest as well as greater participation for the sport . Due to successive finals appearances the interest has been sustained over many seasons , most notably in 2005 and 2006 with two successive Grand Final appearances and the club 's first premiership since its relocation . Another Swans premiership win in 2012 and the introduction of a second AFL team in Sydney , the Greater Western Sydney Giants , has increased the momentum behind Australian football in Sydney . Australian regional rivalries have played a large role in the Swans ' popularity . Ironically , the cultural rivalry between Sydney and Melbourne significantly hampers the sport 's growth in New South Wales .

  "/wiki/Queensland_Australian_rules_football_team": "Australian rules football in Queensland has a history which dates back to the mid-1860s . By the early 1880s it was the most prominent football code in the colony , but was progressively overtaken by the Rugby code , resulting in the local game disbanding in the early 1890s . The sport was revived in the early 1900s and continued to be played throughout the twentieth century , despite the majority of the state being considered for much of the century to be well behind the Barassi Line ( the notional line dividing Australia into Australian rules and Rugby 'territories ' ) . Australian rules football 's continued surge in popularity in south east Queensland is most likely due to the continued success of the Brisbane Lions in the national Australian Football League ( AFL ) competition , combined with the AFL 's financial support for the local game . That support saw the introduction of a second AFL club in Queensland , the Gold Coast Suns in 2011 . [ citation needed ] In Queensland , the sport is typically referred to as AFL , or less frequently Australian Football , Aussie Rules or Australian Rules .",

  "/wiki/Yellow": "Yellow is the color between orange and green on the spectrum of visible light . It is evoked by light with a dominant wavelength of roughly 570-590 nm . It is a primary color in subtractive color systems , used in painting or color printing . In the RGB color model , used to create colors on television and computer screens , yellow is a secondary color made by combining red and green at equal intensity . Carotenoids give the characteristic yellow color to autumn leaves , corn , canaries , daffodils , and lemons , as well as egg yolks , buttercups , and bananas . They absorb light energy and protect plants from photodamage . Sunlight has a slight yellowish hue when the Sun is near the horizon , due to atmospheric scattering of shorter wavelengths ( green , blue , and violet ) . Because it was widely available , yellow ochre pigment was one of the first colors used in art ; the Lascaux cave in France has a painting of a yellow horse 17,000 years old . Ochre and orpiment pigments were used to represent gold and skin color in Egyptian tombs , then in the murals in Roman villas . In the early Christian church , yellow was the color associated with the Pope and the golden keys of the Kingdom , but it was also associated with Judas Iscariot and used to mark heretics . In the 20th century , Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe were forced to wear a yellow star . In China , bright yellow was the color of the Middle Kingdom , and could be worn only by the emperor and his household ; special guests were welcomed on a yellow carpet .",

  "/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)": "Victoria ( abbreviated as Vic ) is a state in south-eastern Australia . Victoria is Australia 's smallest mainland state and its second-most populous state ( after New South Wales ) , making it the most densely populated state . Most of its population lives concentrated in the area surrounding Port Phillip Bay , which includes the metropolitan area of its state capital and largest city , Melbourne , Australia 's second-largest city . Victoria is bordered by Bass Strait and Tasmania to the south , [ note 1 ] New South Wales to the north , the Tasman Sea ( a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean ) to the east , and South Australia to the west . The area that is now known as Victoria is the home of many Aboriginal people groups , including the Boon wurrung , the Bratauolung , the Djadjawurrung , the Gunai/Kurnai , the Gunditjmara , the Taungurong , the Wathaurong , the Wurundjeri , and the Yorta Yorta . There were more than 30 Aboriginal languages spoken in the area prior to the European settlement of Australia . The Kulin nation is an alliance of five Aboriginal nations which makes up much of the central part of the state . With Great Britain having claimed the half of the Australian continent that is east of the 135th meridian east in 1788 , Victoria formed part of the wider colony of New South Wales . The first European settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay , and much of what is now Victoria was included in 1836 in the Port Phillip District , an administrative division of New South Wales . Named in honour of Queen Victoria , who signed the division 's separation from New South Wales , the colony was officially established in 1851 and achieved self government in 1855 . The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony , and by the time of the Federation of Australia in 1901 , Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in Australasia . Melbourne served as federal capital of Australia until the construction of Canberra in 1927 , with the Federal Parliament meeting in Melbourne 's Parliament House and all principal offices of the federal government being based in Melbourne .",
  "/wiki/Victorian_Football_Association": "The Victorian Football League ( VFL ) is the major state-level Australian rules football league in Victoria . The league evolved from the former Victorian Football Association ( VFA ) , and has been known by its current name since 1996 . For historical purposes , the present VFL is sometimes referred to as the VFA/VFL , to distinguish it from the present day Australian Football League , which was known until 1990 as the Victorian Football League and is sometimes referred to as the VFL/AFL . The VFA was formed in 1877 and is the second-oldest Australian rules football league , replacing the loose affiliation of clubs that had been the hallmark of the early years of the game . Initially serving a primarily administrative function , the VFA premiership served as the top level of club competition in Victoria until 1896 . The VFA became the secondary level of club competition from 1897 after its eight strongest clubs seceded to form the VFL . From 1897 until 1995 , the VFA remained independent from the VFL as Victoria 's secondary senior club competition . Although always much less popular than the VFL/AFL , the VFA enjoyed peaks of popularity in the 1940s with a faster-paced rival code of rules , and in the 1970s bolstered by playing on Sundays at a time when the VFL was played solely on Saturdays . Since 1995 , the league has been administered by AFL Victoria ( and its predecessors ) , and serves as one of the second-tier regional Australian semi-professional competitions which sits underneath the fully professional Australian Football League . From the 2018 season it will comprise 15 teams from throughout Victoria , nine of which have a continuous VFA heritage . Since 2000 , the VFL has served partially as a reserves competition for the AFL , with some Victorian-based clubs fielding their reserves teams in the VFL and others affiliated such that their reserves player can play in VFL teams . AFL Victoria also operates a women 's football competition under the Victorian Football League brand , known as the VFL Women 's , which was established in 2016 .",
