  "/wiki/USS_President_(1800)": "USS President was a wooden-hulled , three-masted heavy frigate of the United States Navy , nominally rated at 44 guns . She was launched in April 1800 from a shipyard in New York City . President was one of the original six frigates whose construction the Naval Act of 1794 had authorized , and she was the last to be completed . The name President was among ten names submitted to President George Washington by Secretary of War Timothy Pickering in March of 1795 for the frigates that were to be constructed.Joshua Humphreys designed these frigates to be the young Navy 's capital ships , and so President and her sisters were larger and more heavily armed and built than standard frigates of the period . Forman Cheeseman , and later Christian Bergh were in charge of her construction . Her first duties with the newly formed United States Navy were to provide protection for American merchant shipping during the Quasi War with France and to engage in a punitive expedition against the Barbary pirates in the First Barbary War . On 16 May 1811 , President was at the center of the Little Belt Affair ; her crew mistakenly identified HMS Little Belt as HMS Guerriere , which had impressed an American seaman . The ships exchanged cannon fire for several minutes . Subsequent U.S. and Royal Navy investigations placed responsibility for the attack on each other without a resolution . The incident contributed to tensions between the U.S. and Great Britain that led to the War of 1812 . During the war , President made several extended cruises , patrolling as far away as the English Channel and Norway ; she captured the armed schooner HMS Highflyer and numerous merchant ships . In January 1815 , after having been blockaded in New York for a year by the Royal Navy , President attempted to run the blockade , and was chased by a blockading squadron ."
