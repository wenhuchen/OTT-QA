  "/wiki/Ski_cross": "Ski cross is a type of skiing competition . Despite its being a timed racing event , it is often considered part of freestyle skiing because it incorporates terrain features traditionally found in freestyle . Ski cross courses have both naturally occurring terrain and artificial features including big-air jumps and high-banked turns . What sets ski cross apart from other alpine skiing disciplines is that there 's more than one skier racing down the course . Any intentional contact with other competitors leads to disqualification .",
