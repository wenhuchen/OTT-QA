At the end , Benedick and Beatrice join forces to set things right , and the others join in a dance celebrating the marriages of the two couples .",

  "/wiki/The_Idiot": "The Idiot ( pre-reform Russian : \u0418\u0434\u0456\u043e\u0442\u044a ; post-reform Russian : \u0418\u0434\u0438\u043e\u0442 , tr . Idi\u00f3t ) is a novel by the 19th-century Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky . It was first published serially in the journal The Russian Messenger in 1868-69 . The title is an ironic reference to the central character of the novel , Prince ( Knyaz ) Lev Nikolayevich Myshkin , a young man whose goodness , open-hearted simplicity and guilelessness lead many of the more worldly characters he encounters to mistakenly assume that he lacks intelligence and insight . In the character of Prince Myshkin , Dostoevsky set himself the task of depicting the positively good and beautiful man . The novel examines the consequences of placing such a unique individual at the centre of the conflicts , desires , passions and egoism of worldly society , both for the man himself and for those with whom he becomes involved . Joseph Frank describes The Idiot as the most personal of all Dostoevsky 's major works , the book in which he embodies his most intimate , cherished , and sacred convictions . It includes descriptions of some of his most intense personal ordeals , such as epilepsy and mock execution , and explores moral , spiritual and philosophical themes consequent upon them . His primary motivation in writing the novel was to subject his own highest ideal , that of true Christian love , to the crucible of contemporary Russian society . The artistic method of conscientiously testing his central idea meant that the author could not always predict where the plot was going as he was writing . The novel has an awkward structure , and many critics have commented on its seemingly chaotic organization . According to Gary Saul Morson , The Idiot violates every critical norm and yet somehow manages to achieve real greatness .",
  "/wiki/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray": "The Picture of Dorian Gray is a Gothic and philosophical novel by Oscar Wilde , first published complete in the July 1890 issue of Lippincott 's Monthly Magazine . Fearing the story was indecent , the magazine 's editor deleted roughly five hundred words before publication without Wilde 's knowledge . Despite that censorship , The Picture of Dorian Gray offended the moral sensibilities of British book reviewers , some of whom said that Oscar Wilde merited prosecution for violating the laws guarding public morality . In response , Wilde aggressively defended his novel and art in correspondence with the British press , although he personally made excisions of some of the most controversial material when revising and lengthening the story for book publication the following year . The longer and revised version of The Picture of Dorian Gray published in book form in 1891 featured an aphoristic preface - a defence of the artist 's rights and of art for art 's sake - based in part on his press defences of the novel the previous year . The content , style , and presentation of the preface made it famous in its own right , as a literary and artistic manifesto . In April 1891 , the publishing firm of Ward , Lock and Company , who had distributed the shorter , more inflammatory , magazine version in England the previous year , published the revised version of The Picture of Dorian Gray . The Picture of Dorian Gray is the only novel written by Wilde . It exists in several versions : the 1890 magazine edition ( in 13 chapters ) , with important material deleted before publication by the magazine 's editor , J. M. Stoddart ; the uncensored version submitted to Lippincott 's Monthly Magazine for publication ( also in 13 chapters ) , with all of Wilde 's original material intact , first published in 2011 by Harvard University Press ; and the 1891 book edition ( in 20 chapters ) . As literature of the 19th century , The Picture of Dorian Gray pivots on a gothic plot device with strong themes interpreted from Faust .",

  "/wiki/The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest": "The Importance of Being Earnest , A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde . First performed on 14 February 1895 at the St James 's Theatre in London , it is a farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious personae to escape burdensome social obligations . Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London , the play 's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage , and the resulting satire of Victorian ways . Some contemporary reviews praised the play 's humour and the culmination of Wilde 's artistic career , while others were cautious about its lack of social messages . Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde 's most enduringly popular play . The successful opening night marked the climax of Wilde 's career but also heralded his downfall . The Marquess of Queensberry , whose son Lord Alfred Douglas was Wilde 's lover , planned to present the writer with a bouquet of rotten vegetables and disrupt the show . Wilde was tipped off and Queensberry was refused admission . Their feud came to a climax in court , where Wilde 's homosexuality was revealed to the Victorian public and he was sentenced to imprisonment . Despite the play 's early success , Wilde 's notoriety caused the play to be closed after 86 performances . After his release from prison , he published the play from exile in Paris , but he wrote no further comic or dramatic work . The Importance of Being Earnest has been revived many times since its premiere .",
  "/wiki/The_Old_Testament": "The Old Testament ( abbreviated OT ) is the first part of the Christian biblical canon , which is based primarily upon the twenty-four books of the Hebrew Bible ( or Tanakh ) , a collection of ancient religious Hebrew writings by the Israelites believed by most Christians and religious Jews to be the sacred Word of God . The second part of Christian Bibles is the New Testament , originally written in the Koine Greek language . The books that comprise the Old Testament canon , as well as their order and names , differ between Christian denominations . The Catholic canon comprises 46 books , the canons of the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches comprise up to 49 books , and the most common Protestant canon comprises 39 books . The 39 books in common to all the Christian canons correspond to the 24 books of the Tanakh , with some differences of order , and there are some differences in text . The additional number reflects the splitting of several texts ( Kings , Samuel and Chronicles , Ezra-Nehemiah and the Twelve Minor Prophets ) into separate books in Christian bibles . The books that are part of the Christian Old Testament but that are not part of the Hebrew canon are sometimes described as deuterocanonical . In general , Protestant Bibles do not include the deuterocanonical books in their canon , but some versions of Anglican and Lutheran bibles place such books in a separate section called Apocrypha . These extra books are ultimately derived from the earlier Greek Septuagint collection of the Hebrew scriptures and are also Jewish in origin . Some are also contained in the Dead Sea Scrolls . The Old Testament consists of many distinct books by various authors produced over a period of centuries . Christians traditionally divide the Old Testament into four sections : ( 1 ) the first five books or Pentateuch ( Torah ) ; ( 2 ) the history books telling the history of the Israelites , from their conquest of Canaan to their defeat and exile in Babylon ; ( 3 ) the poetic and Wisdom books dealing , in various forms , with questions of good and evil in the world ; and ( 4 ) the books of the biblical prophets , warning of the consequences of turning away from God .",

  "/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet": "Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare early in his career about two young star-crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families . It was among Shakespeare 's most popular plays during his lifetime and along with Hamlet , is one of his most frequently performed plays . Today , the title characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers . Romeo and Juliet belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back to antiquity . The plot is based on an Italian tale translated into verse as The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke in 1562 and retold in prose in Palace of Pleasure by William Painter in 1567 . Shakespeare borrowed heavily from both but expanded the plot by developing a number of supporting characters , particularly Mercutio and Paris . Believed to have been written between 1591 and 1595 , the play was first published in a quarto version in 1597 . The text of the first quarto version was of poor quality , however , and later editions corrected the text to conform more closely with Shakespeare 's original . Shakespeare 's use of his poetic dramatic structure ( especially effects such as switching between comedy and tragedy to heighten tension , his expansion of minor characters , and his use of sub-plots to embellish the story ) has been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill . The play ascribes different poetic forms to different characters , sometimes changing the form as the character develops . Romeo , for example , grows more adept at the sonnet over the course of the play . Romeo and Juliet has been adapted numerous times for stage , film , musical , and opera venues .",
  "/wiki/Henry_V_(play)": "Henry V is a history play by William Shakespeare , believed to have been written near 1599 . It tells the story of King Henry V of England , focusing on events immediately before and after the Battle of Agincourt ( 1415 ) during the Hundred Years ' War . In the First Quarto text , it was titled The Cronicle History of Henry the fift , :p.6 which became The Life of Henry the Fifth in the First Folio text . The play is the final part of a tetralogy , preceded by Richard II , Henry IV , Part 1 , and Henry IV , Part 2 . The original audiences would thus have already been familiar with the title character , who was depicted in the Henry IV plays as a wild , undisciplined young man . In Henry V , the young prince has matured . He embarks on an expedition to France and , his army badly outnumbered , defeats the French at Agincourt .",
