Victoria is bordered by Bass Strait and Tasmania to the south , [ note 1 ] New South Wales to the north , the Tasman Sea ( a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean ) to the east , and South Australia to the west .

There were more than 30 Aboriginal languages spoken in the area prior to the European settlement of Australia . The Kulin nation is an alliance of five Aboriginal nations which makes up much of the central part of the state . With Great Britain having claimed the half of the Australian continent that is east of the 135th meridian east in 1788 , Victoria formed part of the wider colony of New South Wales . The first European settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay , and much of what is now Victoria was included in 1836 in the Port Phillip District , an administrative division of New South Wales . Named in honour of Queen Victoria , who signed the division 's separation from New South Wales , the colony was officially established in 1851 and achieved self government in 1855 .

  "/wiki/Cyclone_Bobby": "Severe Tropical Cyclone Bobby set numerous monthly rainfall records in parts of the Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia , dropping up to 400 mm ( 16 in ) of rain in February 1995 . The fourth named storm of the 1994-95 Australian region cyclone season , Bobby developed as a tropical low embedded within a monsoon trough situated north of the Northern Territory coastline on 19 February . The storm gradually drifted southwestward and later southward under low wind shear , strengthening enough to be assigned the name Bobby by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology ( BoM ) . The storm rapidly deepened as it approached the coast of Western Australia , and attained its peak intensity of 925 mbar ( hPa ; 27.32 inHg ) at 0900 UTC on 24 February with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 195 km/h ( 120 mph ) . After making landfall as a somewhat weaker cyclone near Onslow , the remnants of Bobby drifted southeastward , gradually weakening , before dissipating over the southern reaches of Western Australia . Bobby inflicted minor damage throughout Western Australia , dropping copious rainfall and forcing the closure of many facilities and roads . The storm 's destruction was most severe in Onslow , where 20 residences suffered damage . Elsewhere , Bobby knocked out power and water supplies , unroofed houses , tore off rain gutters , toppled fences , and smashed windows . The flooding of a 17 km ( 11 mi ) stretch of the Eyre Highway stranded approximately 1000 vehicles , although the backup was later cleared more than a week later . Flooding disrupted mining and drilling operations throughout southwestern Australia , costing the industry upwards of $ 50 million ( 1995 AUD ; $ 38.7 million USD ) . Numerous Australian Army and State Emergency Service ( SES ) personnel were involved in cleanup and recovery efforts after the cyclone 's passage , while power and water service was restored to those cut off during the storm . Overall , the cyclone caused eight deaths and $ 11 million ( 1995 AUD ; $ 8.5 million USD ) in damage along its course across Western Australia .",

  "/wiki/Whyalla_Airlines_Flight_904": "Whyalla Airlines Flight 904 was a scheduled commuter flight , operated by a Piper PA-31 Navajo which crashed while attempting to ditch in the Spencer Gulf , South Australia after suffering failures of both engines on the evening of 31 May 2000 . All 8 people on board the aircraft were killed as a result of the accident . The findings of a subsequent investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau highlighting the airline 's operating procedures as a key factor leading to the accident were later overturned after they were contradicted by evidence presented at a Coronial inquiry into the deaths of those on board the flight . The safety implications arising from the accident were subject to a recall by engine manufacturer Textron Lycoming which saw close to 1000 aircraft grounded worldwide while defects were rectified at an estimated cost of $ A66 million . Australia 's aviation regulator , the Civil Aviation Safety Authority also mandated lifejackets be carried on all aircraft operating over water after the crash ."
