The leading roles are played by Vivien Leigh ( Scarlett ) , Clark Gable ( Rhett ) , Leslie Howard ( Ashley ) , and Olivia de Havilland ( Melanie ) . Production was difficult from the start .

The original screenplay was written by Sidney Howard and underwent many revisions by several writers in an attempt to get it down to a suitable length . The original director , George Cukor , was fired shortly after filming began and was replaced by Fleming , who in turn was briefly replaced by Sam Wood while Fleming took some time off due to exhaustion . The film received positive reviews upon its release in December 1939 , although some reviewers found it overlong . The casting was widely praised , and many reviewers found Leigh especially suited to her role as Scarlett .
