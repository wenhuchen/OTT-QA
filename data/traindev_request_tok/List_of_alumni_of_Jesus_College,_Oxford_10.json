ITV is the oldest commercial network in the UK . Since the passing of the Broadcasting Act 1990 , its legal name has been Channel 3 , to distinguish it from the other analogue channels at the time , namely BBC 1 , BBC 2 and Channel 4 . In part , the number 3 was assigned because television sets would usually be tuned so that the regional ITV station would be on the third button , with the other stations being allocated to the number within their name . ITV is a network of television companies that operate regional television services and also share programmes between each other to be shown on the entire network . In recent years , several of these companies have merged , so currently the fifteen regional franchises are in the hands of two companies . The ITV network is to be distinguished from ITV plc , the company that resulted from the merger of Granada plc and Carlton Communications in 2004 and which holds the Channel 3 broadcasting licences in England , Wales , southern Scotland , the Isle of Man , the Channel Islands and Northern Ireland .
