  "/wiki/Gotthard_Base_Tunnel": "The Gotthard Base Tunnel ( GBT ; German : Gotthard-Basistunnel , Italian : Galleria di base del San Gottardo , Romansh : Tunnel da basa dal Son Gottard ) is a railway tunnel through the Alps in Switzerland . It opened on 1 June 2016 , and full service began on 11 December 2016 . With a route length of 57.09 km ( 35.5 mi ) , it is the world 's longest railway and deepest traffic tunnel [ note 1 ] and the first flat , low-level route through the Alps . It lies at the heart of the Gotthard axis and constitutes the third tunnel connecting the cantons of Uri and Ticino , after the Gotthard Tunnel and the Gotthard Road Tunnel . The link consists of two single-track tunnels connecting Erstfeld ( Uri ) with Bodio ( Ticino ) and passing below Sedrun ( Graub\u00fcnden ) . It is part of the New Railway Link through the Alps ( NRLA ) project , which also includes the Ceneri Base Tunnel further south ( scheduled to open late 2020 ) and the L\u00f6tschberg Base Tunnel on the other main north-south axis . It is referred to as a base tunnel since it bypasses most of the existing Gotthard railway line , a winding mountain route opened in 1882 across the Saint-Gotthard Massif , which was operating at its capacity before the opening of the GBT . The new base tunnel establishes a direct route usable by high-speed rail and heavy freight trains . The main purpose of the Gotthard Base Tunnel is to increase local transport capacity through the Alpine barrier , especially for freight , notably on the Rotterdam-Basel-Genoa corridor , and more specifically to shift freight volumes from trucks to freight trains . This both significantly reduces the danger of fatal road crashes involving trucks , and reduces the environmental damage caused by heavy trucks . The tunnel provides a faster connection between the canton of Ticino and the rest of Switzerland , as well as between northern and southern Europe , cutting the Basel/Z\u00fcrich-Lugano-Milan journey time for passenger trains by one hour ( and from Lucerne to Bellinzona by 45 minutes ) . After 64 percent of Swiss voters accepted the NRLA project in a 1992 referendum , first preparatory and exploratory work began in 1996 .",
  "/wiki/Swiss_Alps": "The Alpine region of Switzerland , conventionally referred to as the Swiss Alps ( German : Schweizer Alpen , French : Alpes suisses , Italian : Alpi svizzere , Romansh : Alps svizras ) , represents a major natural feature of the country and is , along with the Swiss Plateau and the Swiss portion of the Jura Mountains , one of its three main physiographic regions . The Swiss Alps extend over both the Western Alps and the Eastern Alps , encompassing an area sometimes called Central Alps . While the northern ranges from the Bernese Alps to the Appenzell Alps are entirely in Switzerland , the southern ranges from the Mont Blanc massif to the Bernina massif are shared with other countries such as France , Italy , Austria and Liechtenstein . The Swiss Alps comprise almost all the highest mountains of the Alps , such as Dufourspitze ( 4,634 m ) , the Dom ( 4,545 m ) , the Liskamm ( 4,527 m ) , the Weisshorn ( 4,506 m ) and the Matterhorn ( 4,478 m ) . The other following major summits can be found in this list of mountains of Switzerland . Since the Middle Ages , transit across the Alps played an important role in history . The region north of St Gotthard Pass became the nucleus of the Swiss Confederacy in the early 14th century .",
  "/wiki/Gotthardbahn": "The Gotthard railway ( German : Gotthardbahn ; Italian : Ferrovia del Gottardo ) is the Swiss trans-alpine railway line from northern Switzerland to the canton of Ticino . The line forms a major part of an important international railway link between northern and southern Europe , especially on the Rotterdam-Basel-Genoa corridor . The Gotthard Railway Company ( German : Gotthardbahn-Gesellschaft ) was the former private railway company which financed the construction of , and originally operated , that line . The railway comprises a main line from Immensee to Chiasso , together with branches , from Immensee to Lucerne and Rotkreuz , from Arth-Goldau to Zug , and from Bellinzona to Locarno and Luino . The main line , second highest standard railway in Switzerland , penetrates the Alps by means of the Gotthard Tunnel at 1,151 metres ( 3,776 ft ) above sea level . The line then descends as far as Bellinzona , at 241 metres ( 791 ft ) above sea level , before climbing again to the pass of Monte Ceneri , on the way to Lugano and Chiasso . The extreme differences in altitude necessitate the use of long ramped approaches on each side , together with several spirals . Construction of the line started in 1872 , with some lowland sections opening by 1874 . The full line opened in 1882 , following completion of the Gotthard Tunnel . The line was incorporated into the Swiss Federal Railways in 1909 , and electrified in 1922 . The approaches to the existing tunnel continue to restrict speed and capacity on this important international route , and in 1992 it was decided to build a new lower level route on the Gotthard axis as part of the NRLA project . This route involves the construction of the new Gotthard Base Tunnel and Ceneri Base Tunnel .",

The track level is about 100 m ( 330 ft ) below the seabed and 240 m ( 790 ft ) below sea level . The tunnel is part of the standard gauge Hokkaido Shinkansen and the narrow gauge Kaiky\u014d Line of the Hokkaido Railway Company ( JR Hokkaido ) 's Tsugaru-Kaiky\u014d Line . The name Seikan comes from combining the on'yomi readings of the first characters of Aomori ( \u9752\u68ee ) , the nearest major city on the Honshu side of the strait , and Hakodate ( \u51fd\u9928 ) , the nearest major city on the Hokkaido side .

It was named after the western part of Aomori Prefecture . The Seikan Tunnel passes under it at its narrowest point 12.1 miles ( 19.5 km ) between Tappi Misaki on the Tsugaru Peninsula in Aomori Prefecture , Honshu , and Shirakami Misaki on the Matsumae Peninsula in Hokkaido . Japan 's territorial waters extend to three nautical miles ( 5.6 km ) into the strait instead of the usual twelve , reportedly to allow nuclear-armed United States Navy warships and submarines to transit the strait without violating Japan 's prohibition against nuclear weapons in its territory . The part of the Seikan Tunnel that passes under the strait is considered to be under Japanese sovereignty . The part of the Tsugaru Strait considered to be in international waters is still within Japan 's exclusive economic zone . The Tsugaru Strait has eastern and western necks , both approximately 20 km across with maximum depths of 200 m and 140 m respectively . There are also ferry services that operate across the strait , including the Tsugaru Kaiky\u014d Ferry and the Seikan ferry . On September 26 , 1954 , 1,172 lives were lost when the ferry T\u014dya Maru sank in the strait . Thomas Blakiston , an English explorer and naturalist , noticed that animals in Hokkaido were related to northern Asian species , whereas those on Honshu to the south were related to those from southern Asia .

China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty . China , as a whole , was ravaged by feudal warlordism and Japan during World War II .",
