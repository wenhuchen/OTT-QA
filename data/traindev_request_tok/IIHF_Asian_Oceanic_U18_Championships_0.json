The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia .

News of the finds intensified the Victorian gold rush , bringing an influx of migrants to the city from around the world within a year and transforming it from a sheep station to a major settlement in the newly proclaimed Colony of Victoria . Once the alluvial gold had been mined out , mining companies were formed to exploit the rich underground quartz reef gold . Since 1851 , about 780,000 kilograms ( 25 million troy ounces ) of gold have been extracted from Bendigo 's goldmines , making it the highest producing goldfield in Australia in the 19th century and the largest gold-mining economy in eastern Australia . It is also notable for its Victorian architectural heritage . The city took its name from the Bendigo Creek and its residents from the earliest days of the gold rush have been called Bendigonians .

The most populous urban area in the country , Auckland has an urban population of around 1,570,100 ( June 2018 ) . It is located in the Auckland Region - the area governed by Auckland Council - which includes outlying rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf , resulting in a total population of 1,618,400 . Auckland is a diverse , multicultural and cosmopolitan city , home to the largest Polynesian population in the world . The M\u0101ori-language name for Auckland is T\u0101maki Makaurau , meaning T\u0101maki desired by many , in reference to the desirability of its natural resources and geography . Auckland lies between the Hauraki Gulf of the Pacific Ocean to the east , the low Hunua Ranges to the south-east , the Manukau Harbour to the south-west , and the Waitakere Ranges and smaller ranges to the west and north-west . The surrounding hills are covered in rainforest and the landscape is dotted with dozens of dormant volcanic cones . The central part of the urban area occupies a narrow isthmus between the Manukau Harbour on the Tasman Sea and the Waitemat\u0101 Harbour on the Pacific Ocean . Auckland is one of the few cities in the world to have a harbour on each of two separate major bodies of water . The isthmus on which Auckland resides was first settled around 1350 and was valued for its rich and fertile land . The M\u0101ori population in the area is estimated to have peaked at 20,000 before the arrival of Europeans . After a British colony was established in 1840 , William Hobson , then Lieutenant-Governor of New Zealand , chose the area as his new capital .",
  "/wiki/New_Zealand": "New Zealand ( M\u0101ori : Aotearoa [ a\u0254\u02c8t\u025ba\u027e\u0254a ] ) is a sovereign island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean . The country has two main landmasses - the North Island ( Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui ) , and the South Island ( Te Waipounamu ) - and around 600 smaller islands . It has a total land area of 268,000 square kilometres ( 103,500 sq mi ) . New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 mi ) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres ( 600 mi ) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal , fungal , and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , and its most populous city is Auckland . Sometime between 1250 and 1300 , Polynesians settled in the islands and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture . In 1642 , Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight New Zealand . In 1840 , representatives of the United Kingdom and M\u0101ori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi , which declared British sovereignty over the islands . In 1841 , New Zealand became a colony within the British Empire and in 1907 it became a dominion ; it gained full statutory independence in 1947 and the British monarch remained the head of state ."
