Due to multilingualism among Lebanese people ( a majority of the Lebanese people are bilingual or trilingual ) , it is not uncommon for Lebanese people to mix Lebanese Arabic , English and French into their daily speech . Lebanese Arabic is descended from the Arabic dialects introduced to the Levant in the 7th century CE , which gradually supplanted various indigenous Northwest Semitic languages to become the regional lingua franca . As a result of this prolonged process of language shift , Lebanese Arabic possesses a significant Aramaic substratum , along with later non-Semitic adstrate influences from Ottoman Turkish , English , and French .
