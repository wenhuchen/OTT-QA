  "/wiki/Tikal": "Tikal ( /ti\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0l/ ) ( Tikal in modern Mayan orthography ) is the ruin of an ancient city , which was likely to have been called Yax Mutal , found in a rainforest in Guatemala . It is one of the largest archaeological sites and urban centers of the pre-Columbian Maya civilization . It is located in the archaeological region of the Pet\u00e9n Basin in what is now northern Guatemala . Situated in the department of El Pet\u00e9n , the site is part of Guatemala 's Tikal National Park and in 1979 it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Tikal was the capital of a conquest state that became one of the most powerful kingdoms of the ancient Maya . Though monumental architecture at the site dates back as far as the 4th century BCE , Tikal reached its apogee during the Classic Period , c. 200 to 900 CE . During this time , the city dominated much of the Maya region politically , economically , and militarily , while interacting with areas throughout Mesoamerica such as the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico . There is evidence that Tikal was conquered by Teotihuacan in the 4th century CE . Following the end of the Late Classic Period , no new major monuments were built at Tikal and there is evidence that elite palaces were burned . These events were coupled with a gradual population decline , culminating with the site 's abandonment by the end of the 10th century . Tikal is the best understood of any of the large lowland Maya cities , with a long dynastic ruler list , the discovery of the tombs of many of the rulers on this list and the investigation of their monuments , temples and palaces .",
