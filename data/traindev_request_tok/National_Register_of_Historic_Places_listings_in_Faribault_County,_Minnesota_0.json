  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",

  "/wiki/Oneota": "Oneota is a designation archaeologists use to refer to a cultural complex that existed in the eastern plains and Great Lakes area of what is now occupied by the United States from around AD 900 to around 1650 or 1700 . Based on classification defined in Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips ' 1958 book Method and Theory in American Archaeology , the Oneota culture belongs to formative stage . The culture is believed to have transitioned into various Siouan cultures of the protohistoric and historic times , such as the Ioway [ citation needed ] . A long-accepted ancestry to the Ho-chunk has yet to be conclusively demonstrated . Oneota is considered a major component of Upper Mississippian culture . It is characterized by globular , shell-tempered pottery that is often coarse in fibre . Pieces often had a spherical body , short necks and/or a flat lip . Sometimes the vessels had strap handles . Decoration includes wavy and zigzag lines , often in parallel . Most decoration was done on the top half of the vessel . Analytically , the culture has been broken down into various stages or horizons . Generally accepted are the following :",
  "/wiki/Chicago,_Milwaukee,_St._Paul_and_Pacific_Depot_and_Lunchroom": "The Chicago , Milwaukee , St. Paul and Pacific Railroad Depot and Lunchroom are two buildings located in Wells , Minnesota , and built by the Chicago , Milwaukee , St. Paul and Pacific Railroad ( otherwise known as The Milwaukee Road ) in 1903 . The town of Wells was platted by a precursor to The Milwaukee Road in 1869 . As the town grew , it became a junction , with one branch of the railroad continuing west toward Sioux Falls , South Dakota and a second branch going north toward Farmington , Minnesota . The railroad placed a railyard at Wells . In 1903 , as railroad operations expanded , The Milwaukee Road built the present station out of brick . It also built the lunchroom ( or beanery ) to serve the train crews as well as passengers and the town . The lunchroom was also built of brick and is located adjacent to the depot . The depot is a single-story , rectangular building with a passenger waiting area on one end and a freight room on the other . The agent 's office was located between the two . The lunchroom is also a single-story , rectangular building . It was altered from its original appearance with the addition of a wood-frame room and garage . The lunchroom would have had a kitchen and dining area ; however , at the time of nomination to the National Register of Historic Places , the lunchroom had already been sold to private individuals who converted it into a residence .",

The city of Blue Earth was established in 1856 , and although most of its early settlers were Methodists , Episcopalians and Presbyterians also arrived in the city . The first Episcopal service in the city was held in the Presbyterian church in town on December 10 , 1867 . In 1870 , Bishop Henry Whipple asked the Reverend Solomon Stephens Burleson to visit the city and consider serving the Episcopal community as its resident pastor . Whipple and Burleson returned in 1871 , and Whipple offered the parish $ 3000 for construction of a church if the parish would pay for the rectory . The parish accepted the offer , and Burleson moved from his parish in Northfield to establish the church . Burleson designed the building himself . It has a rectangular shape , with a steeply-pitched roof . A tower topped with a shingled steeple is located on one side of the building . Construction was completed on March 21 , 1872 , and Whipple returned to consecrate the building on August 13 , 1872 . It was added to the National Register in 1980 .

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",
