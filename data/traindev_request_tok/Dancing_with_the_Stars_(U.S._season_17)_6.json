  "/wiki/Duke_Ellington": "Edward Kennedy Duke Ellington ( April 29 , 1899 - May 24 , 1974 ) was an American composer , pianist , and leader of a jazz orchestra , which he led from 1923 until his death over a career spanning more than six decades . Born in Washington , D.C. , Ellington was based in New York City from the mid-1920s onward and gained a national profile through his orchestra 's appearances at the Cotton Club in Harlem . In the 1930s , his orchestra toured in Europe . Although widely considered to have been a pivotal figure in the history of jazz , Ellington embraced the phrase beyond category as a liberating principle and referred to his music as part of the more general category of American Music rather than to a musical genre such as jazz . Some of the jazz musicians who were members of Ellington 's orchestra , such as saxophonist Johnny Hodges , are considered to be among the best players in the idiom . Ellington melded them into the best-known orchestral unit in the history of jazz . Some members stayed with the orchestra for several decades . A master at writing miniatures for the three-minute 78 rpm recording format , Ellington wrote more than one thousand compositions ; his extensive body of work is the largest recorded personal jazz legacy , with many of his pieces having become standards . Ellington also recorded songs written by his bandsmen , for example Juan Tizol 's Caravan , and Perdido , which brought a Spanish tinge to big band jazz . In the early 1940s , Ellington began a nearly thirty-year collaboration with composer-arranger-pianist Billy Strayhorn , whom he called his writing and arranging companion . With Strayhorn , he composed many extended compositions , or suites , as well as additional short pieces . Following an appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival , in July 1956 , Ellington and his orchestra enjoyed a major revival and embarked on world tours .",

  "/wiki/William_Tell_Overture": "The William Tell Overture is the overture to the opera William Tell ( original French title Guillaume Tell ) , whose music was composed by Gioachino Rossini . William Tell premiered in 1829 and was the last of Rossini 's 39 operas , after which he went into semi-retirement ( he continued to compose cantatas , sacred music and secular vocal music ) . The overture is in four parts , each following without pause . There has been repeated use ( and sometimes parody ) of parts of this overture in both classical music and popular media . It was the theme music for The Lone Ranger in radio , television and film . Two different parts were also used as theme music for the British television series The Adventures of William Tell , the fourth part ( popularly identified in the US with The Lone Ranger ) in the UK , and the third part , rearranged as a stirring march , in the US . Franz Liszt prepared a piano transcription of the overture in 1838 ( S.552 ) which became a staple of his concert repertoire . There are also transcriptions by other composers , including versions by Louis Gottschalk for two and four pianos and a duet for piano and violin .",
  "/wiki/Gioachino_Rossini": "Gioachino Antonio Rossini [ n 1 ] [ n 2 ] ( 29 February 1792 - 13 November 1868 ) was an Italian composer who gained fame for his 39 operas , although he also wrote many songs , some chamber music and piano pieces , and some sacred music . He set new standards for both comic and serious opera before retiring from large-scale composition while still in his thirties , at the height of his popularity . Born in Pesaro to parents who were both musicians ( his father a trumpeter , his mother a singer ) , Rossini began to compose by the age of 12 and was educated at music school in Bologna . His first opera was performed in Venice in 1810 when he was 18 years old . In 1815 he was engaged to write operas and manage theatres in Naples . In the period 1810-1823 he wrote 34 operas for the Italian stage that were performed in Venice , Milan , Ferrara , Naples and elsewhere ; this productivity necessitated an almost formulaic approach for some components ( such as overtures ) and a certain amount of self-borrowing . During this period he produced his most popular works including the comic operas L'italiana in Algeri , Il barbiere di Siviglia ( known in English as The Barber of Seville ) and La Cenerentola , which brought to a peak the opera buffa tradition he inherited from masters such as Domenico Cimarosa . He also composed opera seria works such as Otello , Tancredi and Semiramide . All of these attracted admiration for their innovation in melody , harmonic and instrumental colour , and dramatic form . In 1824 he was contracted by the Op\u00e9ra in Paris , for which he produced an opera to celebrate the coronation of Charles X , Il viaggio a Reims ( later cannibalised for his first opera in French , Le comte Ory ) , revisions of two of his Italian operas , Le si\u00e8ge de Corinthe and Mo\u00efse , and in 1829 his last opera , Guillaume Tell . Rossini 's withdrawal from opera for the last 40 years of his life has never been fully explained ; contributary factors may have been ill-health , the wealth his success had brought him , and the rise of spectacular grand opera under composers such as Giacomo Meyerbeer . From the early 1830s to 1855 , when he left Paris and was based in Bologna , Rossini wrote relatively little .",

  "/wiki/Vaudeville": "Vaudeville ( /\u02c8v\u0254\u02d0d ( \u0259 ) v\u026al/ ; French : [ vodvil ] ) is a theatrical genre of variety entertainment born in France at the end of the 19th century . A vaudeville was originally a comedy without psychological or moral intentions , based on a comical situation : a kind of dramatic composition or light poetry , interspersed with songs or ballets . It became popular in the United States and Canada from the early 1880s until the early 1930s , but the idea of vaudeville 's theatre changed radically from its French antecedent . In some ways analogous to music hall from Victorian Britain , a typical American vaudeville performance was made up of a series of separate , unrelated acts grouped together on a common bill . Types of acts have included popular and classical musicians , singers , dancers , comedians , trained animals , magicians , ventriloquists , strongmen , female and male impersonators , acrobats , clowns , illustrated songs , jugglers , one-act plays or scenes from plays , athletes , lecturing celebrities , minstrels , and movies . A vaudeville performer is often referred to as a vaudevillian . Vaudeville developed from many sources , also including the concert saloon , minstrelsy , freak shows , dime museums , and literary American burlesque . Called the heart of American show business , vaudeville was one of the most popular types of entertainment in North America for several decades .",

  "/wiki/Tron:_Legacy": "Tron : Legacy is a 2010 American science fiction/action film directed by Joseph Kosinski , in his feature directorial debut , from a screenplay written by Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis , based on a story by Horowitz , Kitsis , Brian Klugman and Lee Sternthal . It is a sequel to the 1982 film Tron , whose director Steven Lisberger returned to produce . The cast includes Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner reprising their roles as Kevin Flynn and Alan Bradley , respectively , as well as Garrett Hedlund , Olivia Wilde , James Frain , Beau Garrett and Michael Sheen . The story follows Flynn 's adult son Sam , who responds to a message from his long-lost father and is transported into a virtual reality called the Grid , where Sam , his father , and the algorithm Quorra must stop the malevolent program Clu from invading the real world . Interest in creating a sequel to Tron arose after the film garnered a cult following . After much speculation , Walt Disney Pictures began a concerted effort in 2005 to devise Tron : Legacy , with the hiring of Klugman and Sternthal as writers . Kosinski was recruited as director two years later . As he was not optimistic about Disney 's Matrix-esque approach to the film , Kosinski filmed a high-concept , which he used to conceptualise the universe of Tron : Legacy and convince the studio to greenlight the film . Principal photography took place in Vancouver over 67 days , in and around the city 's central business district . Most sequences were shot in 3D and ten companies were involved with the extensive visual effects work . Chroma keying and other techniques were used to allow more freedom in creating effects . Daft Punk composed the musical score , incorporating orchestral sounds with their trademark electronic music ."
