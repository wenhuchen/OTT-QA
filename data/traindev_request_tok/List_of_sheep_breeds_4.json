  "/wiki/Easycare": "Easycare is a breed of sheep developed in the 1960s in the United Kingdom for meat . It was originally bred by Iolo Owen in Angelsey by crossing Nelson Welsh Mountain sheep ( a Welsh Mountain and Cheviot cross ) which were crossed twice to the Wiltshire Horn , which is a wool-shedding breed . The progeny were selected for : wool shedding , no horns , and easy-care traits , reduced need for assistance at lambing , less flystrike and lameness . Some Easycare breeders are now selecting for sheep that need less worming . Most animals in the wild thicken up their coats in winter and then moult when spring comes , but many modern sheep breeds were selectively bred for thick coats which are retained for shearing . With the decline in the worldwide wool markets , a thick coat is now less desirable , especially where the cost of shearing is higher than the value of the wool produced . In this respect , the Easycare breed is an interesting reversal of centuries of practice in sheep breed development as the sheep naturally shed their coats in spring , a process called rooing . Unlike many other sheep breeds , Easycare sheep can live without the necessity of shearing .",

  "/wiki/Tail_fat": "Tail fat is the fat of some breeds of sheep , especially of fat-tailed sheep . It is fat accumulated in baggy deposits in the hind parts of a sheep on both sides of its tail and on the first 3-5 vertebrae of the tail . The weight of this part of a sheep 's anatomy may be up to 30 kg ( 66 lb ) . These hind parts are used to accumulate fat for subsequent use during dry seasons , similar to a camel 's humps . It is known under the name kurdyuk in Russian and in Central Asian languages , from the proto-Turkic *kudruk 'tail ' . Tail fat is known in Arabic as \u0644\u064a\u0629 , ( leeyeh , leyyah , or layeh ) , zaaka in Algeria , kuyruk ya\u011f\u0131 'tail fat ' in Turkish , and donbeh or dombeh in Iran , \u05d0\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05d4 ( Alya ) in Hebrew , words which may be found in ancient texts as well as in local food culture and in sheep breeds ' names . The rendered tail fat does not solidify at room temperature and is used in cuisine . Crackling left after the rendering or frying of kurdyuk may be used as an appetizer . When being rendered , kurdyuk emits a strong odour , described as acidy-poisonous . However , it has a rich flavor when ready to eat . In particular it is used to cook kofta , pilav , and other traditional dishes .",

  "/wiki/Tasmania": "Tasmania ( /t\u00e6z\u02c8me\u026ani\u0259/ ; abbreviated as TAS , nicknamed Tassie ) is an island state of Australia . It is located 240 km ( 150 mi ) to the south of the Australian mainland , separated by Bass Strait . The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania , the 26th-largest island in the world , and the surrounding 334 islands . The state has a population of around 533,308 as of March 2019 [ update ] . Just over forty percent of the population resides in the Greater Hobart precinct , which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city , Hobart . Tasmania 's area is 68,401 km2 ( 26,410 sq mi ) , of which the main island covers 64,519 km2 ( 24,911 sq mi ) . It is promoted as a natural state , and protected areas of Tasmania cover about 42% of its land area , which includes national parks and World Heritage Sites . Tasmania was the founding place of the first environmental political party in the world . The island is believed to have been occupied by indigenous peoples for 30,000 years before British colonisation . It is thought Aboriginal Tasmanians were separated from the mainland Aboriginal groups about 10,000 years ago when the sea rose to form Bass Strait . The Aboriginal population is estimated to have been between 3,000 and 7,000 at the time of colonisation , but was almost wiped out within 30 years by a combination of violent guerrilla conflict with settlers known as the Black War , intertribal conflict , and from the late 1820s , the spread of infectious diseases to which they had no immunity . The conflict , which peaked between 1825 and 1831 , and led to more than three years of martial law , cost the lives of almost 1,100 Aboriginals and settlers .",

  "/wiki/Estonian_Ruhnu": "Estonian Ruhnu sheep ( Estonian : Ruhnu maalammas ) are a breed of native domesticated sheep found on the small Estonian island of Ruhnu in the Gulf of Riga in the Baltic Sea . The Estonian Ruhnu sheep population is thought to descend from sheep left on Ruhnu by Swedish-speaking inhabitants who settled on the island in the 14th century . In 1944 a population of 300 sheep was documented . The current population of the breed is around 30 animals . It is thought that Estonian Ruhnu sheep were originally raised for producing meat and wool . Physical adaptations of the Estonian Ruhnu sheep population to seaside pastures and small paddocks suggests that these sheep have had a rather long period to adapt to their environment . Most of the small population of Ruhnu sheep are white or cream colored with greyish head and legs and some have a distinctive badgerface pattern . The ewes are polled and approximately 10% of rams are horned . The sheep have short or medium length tails . Distinctive from many other breeds of sheep , some Estonian Ruhnu sheep have one or two beads under the jaw . The wool is double coated and of two fibre types and it is generally used for making hand knitting yarn and clothing , such as sweaters . Adult live weight of rams is maximum 80 kg ( 175 lb ) and of the ewes 50 kg ( 110 lb ) .",

It is bordered to the north by the Gulf of Finland with Finland on the other side , to the west by the Baltic Sea with Sweden on the other side , to the south by Latvia ( 343 km ) , and to the east by Lake Peipus and Russia ( 338.6 km ) . The territory of Estonia consists of the mainland and of 2,222 islands in the Baltic Sea , covering a total area of 45,227 km2 ( 17,462 sq mi ) , water 2,839 km2 ( 1,096 sq mi ) , land area 42,388 km2 ( 16,366 sq mi ) , and is influenced by a humid continental climate . The official language of the country , Estonian , is the second-most-spoken Finnic language . The territory of Estonia has been inhabited since at least 9,000 BC . Ancient Estonians became some of the last European pagans to adopt Christianity - following the Livonian Crusade in the 13th century . After centuries of successive rule by Germans , Danes , Swedes , Poles and Russians , a distinct Estonian national identity began to emerge in the 19th and early 20th centuries . This culminated in independence from Russia in 1920 after a brief War of Independence at the end of World War I . Initially democratic prior to the Great Depression , Estonia experienced authoritarian rule from 1934 during the Era of Silence . During World War II ( 1939-1945 ) , Estonia was repeatedly contested and occupied by the Soviet Union and Germany , ultimately being incorporated into the former . After the loss of its de facto independence , Estonia 's de jure state continuity was preserved by diplomatic representatives and the government-in-exile . In 1987 the peaceful Singing Revolution began against Soviet rule , resulting in the restoration of de facto independence on 20 August 1991 .",

It is bordered by Romania to the north , Serbia and North Macedonia to the west , Greece and Turkey to the south , and the Black Sea to the east . The capital and largest city is Sofia ; other major cities are Plovdiv , Varna and Burgas . With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres ( 42,855 sq mi ) , Bulgaria is Europe 's 16th-largest country . One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture , which dates back to 6,500 BC . In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for Thracians , Persians , Celts and ancient Macedonians ; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45 . The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries . The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State .",
  "/wiki/Exmoor_Horn_(sheep)": "The Exmoor Horn is a white faced , horned breed of sheep . It was developed in Exmoor , Devon , in the 19th century , but is a descendant of sheep that had roamed on the moors for several hundred years . Research by the Exmoor National Park has found that numbers have gradually declined : it estimates that in 1947 over 27% of sheep in the Somerset part of Exmoor were pure bred Exmoor Horns . As the number of sheep in the region has increased , so the percentage has dropped , and today breeding Exmoor Horn ewes represent only about 10% of the total on Exmoor . The National Park reports that there are about 19,000 registered breeding ewes today , of which around 15,000 are on Exmoor . Small numbers are also found on neighbouring Dartmoor . Exmoors are a hardy breed , so well suited to the high moors . They are dual purpose - bred not just for their wool , but also for the fact that they are prolific sheep and good mothers , producing quality lamb .",
  "/wiki/Exmoor": "Exmoor is loosely defined as an area of hilly open moorland in west Somerset and north Devon in South West England . It is named after the River Exe , the source of which is situated in the centre of the area , two miles north-west of Simonsbath . Exmoor is more precisely defined as the area of the former ancient royal hunting forest , also called Exmoor , which was officially surveyed 1815-1818 as 18,810 acres ( 7,610 ha ) in extent . The moor has given its name to a National Park , which includes the Brendon Hills , the East Lyn Valley , the Vale of Porlock and 55 km ( 34 mi ) of the Bristol Channel coast . The total area of the Exmoor National Park is 692.8 km2 ( 267.5 sq mi ) , of which 71% is in Somerset and 29% in Devon . The upland area is underlain by sedimentary rocks dating from the Devonian and early Carboniferous periods with Triassic and Jurassic age rocks on lower slopes . Where these reach the coast , cliffs are formed which are cut with ravines and waterfalls . It was recognised as a heritage coast in 1991 . The highest point on Exmoor is Dunkery Beacon ; at 519 metres ( 1,703 ft ) it is also the highest point in Somerset . The terrain supports lowland heath communities , ancient woodland and blanket mire which provide habitats for scarce flora and fauna . There have also been reports of the Beast of Exmoor , a cryptozoological cat roaming Exmoor . Several areas have been designated as Nature Conservation Review and Geological Conservation Review sites ."
