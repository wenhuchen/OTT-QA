  "/wiki/Ice_hockey": "Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice , usually in a rink , in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent 's net to score goals . The sport is known to be fast-paced and physical , with teams usually fielding six players at a time : one goaltender , and five players who skate the span of the ice trying to control the puck and score goals against the opposing team . Ice hockey is most popular in Canada , central and eastern Europe , the Nordic countries , Russia , and the United States . Ice hockey is the official national winter sport of Canada . In addition , ice hockey is the most popular winter sport in Belarus , Croatia , the Czech Republic , Finland , Latvia , Russia , Slovakia , Sweden , and Switzerland . North America 's National Hockey League ( NHL ) is the highest level for men 's ice hockey and the strongest professional ice hockey league in the world .

The International Ice Hockey Federation ( IIHF ) is the formal governing body for international ice hockey , with the IIHF managing international tournaments and maintaining the IIHF World Ranking . Worldwide , there are ice hockey federations in 76 countries . In Canada , the United States , Nordic countries , and some other European countries the sport is known simply as hockey ; the name ice hockey is used in places where hockey more often refers to the more popular field hockey , such as countries in South America , Asia , Africa , Australasia , and some European countries including the United Kingdom , Ireland and the Netherlands . Ice hockey is believed to have evolved from simple stick and ball games played in the 18th and 19th centuries in the United Kingdom and elsewhere . These games were brought to North America and several similar winter games using informal rules were developed , such as shinny and ice polo .",

More informal varieties also exist , like seven-a-side bandy with normally sized goal cages but without corner strokes . Those rules were applied at Davos Cup in 2016 . Rink bandy has in turn led to the creation of the sport rinkball .

The Games featured 72 medal events in five sports , and saw the debut of snowboarding at the Winter Paralympics . The lead-up to these Paralympics were met with concerns regarding Russia 's military intervention in the nearby Crimean peninsula of Ukraine the month before the opening of the games . The head of Ukraine 's NPC stated that it would pull its athletes if the situation escalated , while the United Kingdom and United States chose not to send governmental delegations to the Games . The crisis ultimately had no impact on athlete participation , but members of the Ukrainian team did stage symbolic protests of the crisis during the Games ( including most notably , all but the country 's flagbearer sitting out of the opening ceremony 's parade of nations ) . With 80 medals , 30 of them being gold , the host country of Russia won the most medals during these Games , and set a record for the most medals won by a single country during a single Winter Paralympic Games . Additionally , Russian skier Roman Petushkov won the most individual gold medals in Winter Paralympic history , with six golds across skiing and biathlon events . However , following the Games , the IPC discovered evidence that Russia 's performance had been aided by a wider state-sponsored doping program .

Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number approximately one billion worldwide . They are the principal means of transportation in many parts of the world . Cycling is widely regarded as a very effective and efficient mode of transportation optimal for short to moderate distances . Bicycles provide numerous benefits in comparison with motor vehicles , including the sustained physical exercise involved in cycling , easier parking , increased maneuverability , and access to roads , bike paths and rural trails . Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels , less air or noise pollution , and much reduced traffic congestion . These lead to less financial cost to the user as well as to society at large ( negligible damage to roads , less road area required ) . By fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses , transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve . In addition , cycling provides a variety of health benefits .

From intermediate through senior-level competition , skaters generally perform two programs ( short and free skate ) , which may include spins , jumps , moves in the field , lifts , throw jumps , death spirals , and other elements or moves , depending on the discipline . The blade has a groove on the bottom creating two distinct edges : inside and outside . Judges prefer that skaters glide on one edge of the blade and not on both at the same time , which is referred to as a flat edge . During a spin , skaters use the sweet spot of the blade , formally called a rocker , which is the roundest portion of the blade , just behind the toe pick and near the middle of the blade . Skates used in singles and pair skating have a set of large , jagged teeth called toe picks on the front of the blade . Toe picks are mainly used for the take-off on jumps .

It is played on a rectangular table covered with a green cloth ( or baize ) , with pockets at each of the four corners and in the middle of each long side . Using a cue stick and 21 coloured balls , players must strike the white ball ( or cue ball ) to pot or pocket the remaining balls in the correct sequence , accumulating points for each pot . An individual game ( or frame ) , is won by the player scoring the most points . A match is won when a player wins a predetermined number of frames . Snooker gained its identity in 1875 when army officer Sir Neville Chamberlain ( 1856-1944 ) , stationed in Ooty , Tamil Nadu , devised a set of rules that combined pyramid and black pool . The word snooker was a long-used military term for inexperienced or first-year personnel . The game grew in popularity in the United Kingdom , and the Billiards Association and Control Club was formed in 1919 . It is now governed by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association ( WPBSA ) . The World Snooker Championship has taken place since 1927 . Joe Davis , a key figure in the early growth of the sport , won the championship 15 straight times between 1927 and 1946 .

  "/wiki/Ski_flying": "Ski flying is a winter sport discipline derived from ski jumping , in which much greater distances can be achieved . It is a form of competitive individual Nordic skiing where athletes descend at very fast speeds along a specially designed takeoff ramp using skis only ; jump from the end of it with as much power as they can generate ; then glide - or 'fly ' - as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill ; and ultimately land within a target zone in a stable manner . Points are awarded for distance and stylistic merit by five judges , and events are governed by the International Ski Federation ( F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Ski ; FIS ) . The rules and scoring in ski flying are mostly the same as they are in ski jumping , and events under the discipline are usually contested as part of the FIS Ski Jumping World Cup season , but the hills ( of which there are only five remaining , all in Europe ) are constructed to different specifications in order to enable jumps of up to 66% longer in distance . There is also a stronger emphasis on aerodynamics and harnessing the wind , as well as an increased element of danger due to athletes flying much higher and faster than in ski jumping . From its beginnings in the 1930s , ski flying has developed its own distinct history and since given rise to all of the sport 's world records . The first hill designed specifically for ski flying was built in Yugoslavia in 1934 , after which both Germany and Austria built their own hills in 1950 . This was followed by Norway in 1966 , the United States in 1970 , and Czechoslovakia in 1980 . From the 1960s to 1980s , a friendly rivalry between the European venues saw world records being set regularly , together with hill upgrades and evolutions in technique to fly longer distances . Ski flying remains at its most popular in Norway and Slovenia , where the most recent world records over the past three decades have been set in front of audiences numbering 30,000-60,000 .",
