Otago is also the old name of the European settlement on the Otago Harbour , established by the Weller Brothers in 1831 , which lies close to the modern harbourside community of Otakou . The place later became the focus of the Otago Association , an offshoot of the Free Church of Scotland , notable for its adoption of the principle that ordinary people , not the landowner , should choose the ministers . Major centres include Dunedin ( the principal city ) , Oamaru ( made famous by Janet Frame ) , Balclutha , Alexandra , and the major tourist centres Queenstown and Wanaka .
