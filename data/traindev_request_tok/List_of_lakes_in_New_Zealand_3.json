  "/wiki/Waikato_River": "The Waikato River is the longest river in New Zealand , running for 425 kilometres ( 264 mi ) through the North Island . It rises in the eastern slopes of Mount Ruapehu , joining the Tongariro River system and flowing through Lake Taupo , New Zealand 's largest lake . It then drains Taupo at the lake 's northeastern edge , creates the Huka Falls , and flows northwest through the Waikato Plains . It empties into the Tasman Sea south of Auckland , at Port Waikato . It gives its name to the Waikato Region that surrounds the Waikato Plains . The present course of the river was largely formed about 17,000 years ago . Contributing factors were climate warming , forest being reestablished in the river headwaters and the deepening , rather than widening , of the existing river channel . The channel was gradually eroded as far up river as Piarere , leaving the old Hinuera channel through the Hinuera Gap high and dry . The remains of the old river path can be clearly seen at Hinuera where the cliffs mark the ancient river edges . The river 's main tributary is the Waipa River , which has its confluence with the Waikato at Ngaruawahia . The name Waikato comes from the M\u0101ori language and translates as flowing water . The Waikato River has spiritual meaning for various local M\u0101ori tribes , including the large Tainui , who regard it as a source of their mana , or pride .",

  "/wiki/Peat_bog": "A bog or bogland is a wetland that accumulates peat , a deposit of dead plant material - often mosses , and in a majority of cases , sphagnum moss . It is one of the four main types of wetlands . Other names for bogs include mire , quagmire , and muskeg ; alkaline mires are called fens . They are frequently covered in ericaceous shrubs rooted in the sphagnum moss and peat . The gradual accumulation of decayed plant material in a bog functions as a carbon sink . Bogs occur where the water at the ground surface is acidic and low in nutrients . In some cases , the water is derived entirely from precipitation , in which case they are termed ombrotrophic ( cloud-fed ) . Water flowing out of bogs has a characteristic brown colour , which comes from dissolved peat tannins . In general , the low fertility and cool climate result in relatively slow plant growth , but decay is even slower owing to the saturated soil . Hence , peat accumulates . Large areas of the landscape can be covered many meters deep in peat . Bogs have distinctive assemblages of animal , fungal and plant species , and are of high importance for biodiversity , particularly in landscapes that are otherwise settled and farmed .",

Encompassing a land area of about 110 km2 ( 42 sq mi ) on the banks of the Waikato River , Hamilton is part of the wider Hamilton Urban Area , which also encompasses the nearby towns of Ngaruawahia , Te Awamutu and Cambridge . The area now covered by the city was originally the site of several M\u0101ori villages , including Kirikiriroa , from which the city takes its M\u0101ori name . By the time English settlers arrived , most of these villages , which sat beside the Waikato River , were abandoned as a result of the Invasion of Waikato and land-confiscation ( Raupatu ) by the Crown . The new British settlement was renamed Hamilton after Captain John Fane Charles Hamilton , the commander of HMS Esk , who was killed in the Battle of Gate P\u0101 , Tauranga . Initially an agricultural service centre , Hamilton now has a diverse economy and is the third fastest growing urban area in New Zealand , behind Pukekohe and Auckland .

  "/wiki/Hydroelectric": "Hydroelectricity is electricity produced from hydropower . In 2015 , hydropower generated 16.6% of the world 's total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity , and was expected to increase by about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years . Hydropower is produced in 150 countries , with the Asia-Pacific region generating 33 percent of global hydropower in 2013 . China is the largest hydroelectricity producer , with 920 TWh of production in 2013 , representing 16.9% of domestic electricity use . The cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low , making it a competitive source of renewable electricity . The hydro station consumes no water , unlike coal or gas plants . The typical cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt hour . With a dam and reservoir it is also a flexible source of electricity , since the amount produced by the station can be varied up or down very rapidly ( as little as a few seconds ) to adapt to changing energy demands . Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed , the project produces no direct waste , and it generally has a considerably lower output level of greenhouse gases than photovoltaic power plants and certainly fossil fuel powered energy plants ( see also Life-cycle_greenhouse-gas_emissions_of_energy_sources ) . However , when constructed in lowland rainforest areas , where inundation of a part of the forest is necessary , they actually emit up to 3 to 4 times more greenhouse gases [ clarification needed ] ( see also Environmental_impact_of_reservoirs # Greenhouse_gases ) .",

  "/wiki/Volcanic_dam": "A volcanic dam is a type of natural dam produced directly or indirectly by volcanism , which holds or temporarily restricts the flow of surface water in existing streams , like a man-made dam . There are two main types of volcanic dams , those created by the flow of molten lava , and those created by the primary or secondary deposition of pyroclastic material and debris . This classification generally excludes other , often larger and longer lived dam-type geologic features , separately termed crater lakes , although these volcanic centers may be associated with the source of material for volcanic dams , and the lowest portion of its confining rim may be considered as such a dam , especially if the lake level within the crater is relatively high . Volcanic dams generally occur worldwide , in association with former and active volcanic provinces , and are known to have existed in the geologic record , in historic times and occur in the present day . Their removal or failure is similarly recorded . The longevity , and extent varies widely , having periods ranging from a few days , weeks or years to several hundred thousand years or more , and dimensions ranging from a few meters to hundreds , to several thousand . The emplacement , internal structure , distribution and longevity of such dams can be related variously to the amount , rapidity and duration of ( primary ) geothermal energy released , and the rock material made available ; other considerations include the rock types produced , their physical and toughness characteristics , and their various modes of deposition . Depositional modes include gravity flow of molten lava at the surface , gravity flow or fall of pyroclastics through the air , as well as the redistribution and transportation of those materials by gravity and water .",

Sinkholes vary in size from 1 to 600 m ( 3.3 to 2,000 ft ) both in diameter and depth , and vary in form from soil-lined bowls to bedrock-edged chasms . Sinkholes may form gradually or suddenly , and are found worldwide .",
  "/wiki/Turlough_(lake)": "A turlough , or turlach , is a type of disappearing lake found mostly in limestone areas of Ireland , west of the River Shannon . The name comes from the Irish tur , meaning dry , with the suffix -lach , meaning a place ( in an abstract sense ) . The -lach suffix is often mistakenly spelled and/or thought to refer to the word loch , the Irish , Scottish Gaelic and Scots word for lake . The landforms are found in Irish karst ( exposed limestone ) areas . The features are almost unique to Ireland , although there is one example in Great Britain , at Cernydd Carmel near Llandeilo . They are of great interest to many scientists : geomorphologists are interested in how turloughs were formed , hydrologists try to explain what makes turloughs flood , botanists study the unusual vegetation which covers the turlough floor , and zoologists study the animals associated with the turloughs .",
