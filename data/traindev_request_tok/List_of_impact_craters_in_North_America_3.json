  "/wiki/Alamo_bolide_impact": "The Alamo bolide impact occurred 367 million years ago , when one or more hypervelocity objects from space slammed into shallow marine waters at a site that is now the Devonian Guilmette Formation of the Worthington Mountains and Schell Creek Range of southeastern Nevada ; the event is named for breccias of metamorphosed crushed rock deposits , found as far as the town of Alamo , Nevada ( the Alamo Breccia ) . This catastrophic impact event resulted in what is one of the best-exposed and has become the most accurately dated impact events ; it occurred within the Frasnian age of the Devonian at about 367 Ma , a moment in time that was about 3.5 Ma prior to the Frasnian/Famennian extinction events , which it is unlikely to have affected .",

It is bordered by Oregon to the northwest , Idaho to the northeast , California to the west , Arizona to the southeast , and Utah to the east . Nevada is the 7th most extensive , the 32nd most populous , and the 9th least densely populated of the U.S. states . Nearly three-quarters of Nevada 's people live in Clark County , which contains the Las Vegas-Paradise metropolitan area , including three of the state 's four largest incorporated cities . Nevada 's capital is Carson City . Nevada is officially known as the Silver State because of the importance of silver to its history and economy . It is also known as the Battle Born State because it achieved statehood during the Civil War ( the words Battle Born also appear on the state flag ) ; as the Sagebrush State , for the native plant of the same name ; and as the Sage-hen State . Nevada is largely desert and semi-arid , much of it within the Great Basin . Areas south of the Great Basin are within the Mojave Desert , while Lake Tahoe and the Sierra Nevada lie on the western edge . About 86% of the state 's land is managed by various jurisdictions of the U.S. federal government , both civilian and military . Before European contact , American Indians of the Paiute , Shoshone , and Washoe tribes inhabited the land that is now Nevada . The first Europeans to explore the region were Spanish .",

Panama was inhabited by indigenous tribes before Spanish colonists arrived in the 16th century . It broke away from Spain in 1821 and joined the Republic of Gran Colombia , a union of Nueva Granada , Ecuador , and Venezuela . After Gran Colombia dissolved in 1831 , Panama and Nueva Granada eventually became the Republic of Colombia . With the backing of the United States , Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903 , allowing the construction of the Panama Canal to be completed by the US Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914 . The 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties led to the transfer of the Canal from the United States to Panama on December 31 , 1999 .

It is believed to have been caused by a 1,200 feet ( 370 m ) meteoroid between 335 and 340 million years ago during the middle Mississippian Period ( Latest Osagean to Earliest Meramecian ) . It is listed by the Impact Field Studies Group as a probable impact structure . The structure consists of an area of severe structural deformation and extensive brecciation that was poorly understood and had been thought to be the result of either thrusting over a dome or a cryptoexplosive event . A 12 mi ( 19 km ) circular structure was discovered by geologist Kevin R. Evans through examination of digital elevation data . The structure was originally called the Weaubleau-Osceola structure after Weaubleau Creek and Osceola . It is now known as the Weaubleau structure . Because the site was covered by later Pennsylvanian Period sediments , and only partially exposed to erosion relatively recently , its structure is well preserved , and its age can be determined with fair accuracy . It is one of a series of known or suspected impact sites along the 38th parallel in the states of Illinois , Missouri , and Kansas . These 38th parallel structures are thought to possibly be the result of a serial impact , similar to that of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on Jupiter , an extremely unlikely event on Earth . The argument for a serial strike would be greatly strengthened if the ages of the other 38th parallel structures could be constrained to the same period as the Weaubleau structure . The Weaubleau structure is one of the fifty largest known impact craters on earth and the fourth largest in the United States .",
