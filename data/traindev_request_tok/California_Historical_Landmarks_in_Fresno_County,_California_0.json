  "/wiki/Forestiere_Underground_Gardens": "The Forestiere Underground Gardens , located at 5021 West Shaw Avenue in Fresno , California , are a series of subterranean structures built by Baldasare Forestiere , an immigrant from Sicily , over a period of 40 years from 1906 to his death in 1946 . The gardens are operated by members of the Forestiere family through the Forestiere Historical Center , and can be considered a spectacular and unconventional example of vernacular architecture . The catalyst for the construction of the underground abode was a result of the hot summers typical of the Fresno area . The inspiration lends itself to ancient Roman catacombs that Baldasare was infatuated with in his youth . Countless hours were spent excavating the hardpan layer that cements much of Fresno 's soil to create his underground home . It had a summer bedroom , a winter bedroom , a bath , a functional kitchen , a fish pond , and a parlor with a fireplace . Interspersed amongst the beautiful stone walls and archways are grottoes and courtyards that allow for pockets of light . The intricate pathways were created section by section , over a span of 10 acres , without the aid of blueprints .",
