After a twelve-year hiatus caused by the outbreak of World War II ; these were the first Summer Olympics held since the 1936 Games in Berlin . The 1940 Olympic Games had been scheduled for Tokyo , and then for Helsinki ; the 1944 Olympic Games had been provisionally planned for London .

The Olympics would again return to London 64 years later in 2012 , making London the first city to have hosted the games three times , and the only such city until Paris and Los Angeles host their third games in 2024 and 2028 , respectively . The 1948 Olympic Games were the first of two summer Olympic Games held under the IOC presidency of Sigfrid Edstr\u00f6m . The event came to be known as the Austerity Games , because of the difficult economic climate and rationing imposed in the aftermath of World War II . No new venues were built for the games ( with events taking place mainly at Empire Stadium and the Empire Pool at Wembley Park ) , and athletes were housed in existing accommodation at the Wembley area instead of an Olympic Village , as were the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games and the subsequent 1952 Games in Helsinki . A record 59 nations were represented by 4,104 athletes , 3,714 men and 390 women , in 19 sport disciplines . Germany and Japan were not invited to participate in the games ; the Soviet Union was invited but chose not to send any athletes , sending observers instead to prepare for the 1952 Olympics . One of the star performers at the Games was Dutch sprinter Fanny Blankers-Koen . Dubbed The Flying Housewife , the thirty-year-old mother of two won four gold medals in athletics .",
