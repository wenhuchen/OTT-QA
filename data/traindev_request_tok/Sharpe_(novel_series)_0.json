  "/wiki/Battle_of_Assaye": "The Battle of Assaye was a major battle of the Second Anglo-Maratha War fought between the Maratha Empire and the British East India Company . It occurred on 23 September 1803 near Assaye in western India where an outnumbered Indian and British force under the command of Major General Arthur Wellesley ( who later became the Duke of Wellington ) defeated a combined Maratha army of Daulat Scindia and the Raja of Berar . The battle was the Duke of Wellington 's first major victory and the one he later described as his finest accomplishment on the battlefield , even more so than his more famous victories in the Peninsular War , and his defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Waterloo . From August 1803 , Wellesley 's army and a separate force under the command of his subordinate Colonel James Stevenson had been pursuing the Maratha cavalry-based army which threatened to raid south into Hyderabad . After several weeks of pursuit and countermarching , Scindia reinforced the combined Maratha army with his modernized infantry and artillery as the British forces closed in on his position . Wellesley received intelligence indicating the location of the Maratha encampment on 21 September and devised a plan whereby his two armies would converge on the Maratha position three days later . Wellesley 's force , however , encountered the Maratha army - which was under the command of Colonel Anthony Pohlmann , a German formerly in British service - 6 miles ( 9.7 km ) farther south than he anticipated . Although outnumbered , Wellesley resolved to attack at once , believing that the Maratha army would soon move off . Both sides suffered heavily in the ensuing battle ; Maratha artillery caused large numbers of casualties among Wellesley 's troops but the vast numbers of Maratha cavalry proved largely ineffective . A combination of bayonet and cavalry charges eventually forced the Maratha army to retreat with the loss of most of their guns , but Wellesley 's army was too battered and exhausted to pursue . Wellesley 's victory at Assaye , preceded by the capture of Ahmednagar and followed by victories at Argaon and Gawilghur , resulted in the defeat of Scindia and Berar 's armies in the Deccan . Wellesley 's progress in the Deccan was matched by Lieutenant General Gerard Lake 's successful campaigns in Northern India and led to the British becoming the dominant power in the heartlands of India .",

As part of an overall French plan to combine all French and allied fleets to take control of the English Channel and enable Napoleon 's Grande Arm\u00e9e to invade England , French and Spanish fleets under French Admiral Villeneuve sailed from the port of C\u00e1diz in the south of Spain on 18 October 1805 . They encountered the British fleet under Admiral Lord Nelson , recently assembled to meet this threat , in the Atlantic Ocean along the southwest coast of Spain , off Cape Trafalgar , near the town of Los Ca\u00f1os de Meca . Villeneuve was uncertain about engaging , and the Franco-Spanish fleet failed to fully organize . In contrast , Nelson was decisive , organizing the British fleet into two columns sailing straight into the enemy to pierce its wavering lines . In a fierce battle , 27 British ships of the line fought 33 French and Spanish ships of the line . Although the lead ships of the British columns were heavily battered , with Nelsons flagship HMS Victory nearly disabled , the greater experience and training of the Royal Navy overcame the greater numbers of the French and Spanish navies . The Franco-Spanish fleet lost 22 ships ; the British lost none . During the battle , Nelson was shot by a French musketeer , and he died shortly before the battle ended . Villeneuve was captured along with his flagship Bucentaure . He later attended Nelson 's funeral while a captive on parole in Britain .

Britain 's first response to Napoleon 's Continental system was to launch a major naval attack on the weakest link in Napoleon 's coalition , Denmark . Although ostensibly neutral , Denmark was under heavy French and Russian pressure to pledge its fleet to Napoleon . In September 1807 , the Royal Navy bombarded Copenhagen , seizing the Danish fleet , and assured use of the sea lanes in the North Sea and Baltic Sea for the British merchant fleet . A consequence of the attack was that Denmark did join the war on the side of France , but without a fleet it had little to offer . The attack gave rise to the term to Copenhagenize .",

During the battle , a single British division defeated two French divisions and captured a regimental eagle . C\u00e1diz had been invested by the French in early 1810 , leaving it accessible from the sea , but in March of the following year a reduction in the besieging army gave its garrison of British and Spanish troops an opportunity to lift the siege . A large Allied strike force was shipped south from C\u00e1diz to Tarifa , and moved to engage the siege lines from the rear . The French , under the command of Marshal Victor , were aware of the Allied movement and redeployed to prepare a trap . Victor placed one division on the road to C\u00e1diz , blocking the Allied line of march , while his two remaining divisions fell on the single Anglo-Portuguese rearguard division under the command of Sir Thomas Graham . Following a fierce battle on two fronts , the British succeeded in routing the attacking French forces . A lack of support from the larger Spanish contingent prevented an absolute victory , and the French were able to regroup and reoccupy their siege lines . Graham 's tactical victory proved to have little strategic effect on the continuing war , to the extent that Victor was able to claim the battle as a French victory since the siege remained in force until finally being lifted on 24 August 1812 .",

These attacks resulted in a rout of the French left wing . Marmont and his deputy commander , General Bonet , received shrapnel wounds in the first few minutes of firing .
