[ XIII ] The metropolitan area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea , and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean . It is bordered by Belgium , Luxembourg and Germany to the northeast , Switzerland and Italy to the east , and Andorra and Spain to the south . The overseas territories include French Guiana in South America and several islands in the Atlantic , Pacific and Indian oceans . The country 's 18 integral regions ( five of which are situated overseas ) span a combined area of 643,801 square kilometres ( 248,573 sq mi ) and a total population of 67.02 million ( as of July 2019 [ update ] ) .

During the Iron Age , what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls , a Celtic people . Rome annexed the area in 51 BC , holding it until the arrival of Germanic Franks in 476 , who formed the Kingdom of Francia . The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned Francia into East Francia , Middle Francia and West Francia .

As Minister of Finance under prime ministers Jacques Chaban-Delmas and Pierre Messmer , he won the presidential election of 1974 with 50.8% of the vote against Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand of the Socialist Party . His tenure was marked by a more liberal attitude on social issues - such as divorce , contraception and abortion - and attempts to modernise the country and the office of the presidency , notably launching such far-reaching infrastructure projects as the TGV and the turn towards reliance on nuclear power as France 's main energy source . However , his popularity suffered from the economic downturn that followed the 1973 energy crisis , marking the end of the thirty glorious years after World War II . Giscard d'Estaing faced political opposition from both sides of the spectrum : from the newly unified left of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and a rising Jacques Chirac , who resurrected Gaullism on a right-wing opposition line . In 1981 , despite a high approval rating , he missed out on reelection in a runoff against Mitterrand , with 48.2% of the vote . As a former President of France , Giscard d'Estaing is a member of the Constitutional Council . He also served as President of the Regional Council of Auvergne from 1986 to 2004 .

His tenure as prime minister was marked by the introduction of major economic reforms , such as the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and the Goods and Services Tax . Prior to his political career , he was a prominent lawyer and businessman in Montreal . He later ran for the Progressive Conservatives and won in a landslide in the 1984 Canadian federal election , defeating John Turner of the Liberals and Ed Broadbent of the NDP , not only winning every single province and territory but also capturing over 50% of the vote for the first time since 1958 and increasing his party 's seats by 111 , up to 211 seats , the highest amount of seats won by any party in Canadian history . The 6.3 million votes won by Mulroney also remained a record until the Liberals ' victory in 2015 . Throughout his political career , Mulroney 's fluency in English and French gave him a decisive advantage . He brought forth a constitutional reform , the Meech Lake Accord , in 1987 , meant to persuade the government of Quebec to endorse the 1982 constitutional amendments . It was not ratified by the provincial governments of Manitoba and Newfoundland before the June ratification deadline , and thus met its demise in 1990 . This loss led to another round of meetings in Charlottetown in 1991 and 1992 . These negotiations culminated in Mulroney introducing the Charlottetown Accord , which would create extensive changes to the constitution , including recognition of Quebec as a distinct society . However , the agreement was defeated by a large margin in a national referendum in October 1992 . Many blamed the GST battle and Mulroney 's rising unpopularity for the fall of the Accord .",

The city of Houston was founded by land investors on August 30 , 1836 , at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou ( a point now known as Allen 's Landing ) and incorporated as a city on June 5 , 1837 . The city is named after former General Sam Houston , who was president of the Republic of Texas and had won Texas ' independence from Mexico at the Battle of San Jacinto 25 miles ( 40 km ) east of Allen 's Landing . After briefly serving as the capital of the Texas Republic in the late 1830s , Houston grew steadily into a regional trading center for the remainder of the 19th century . The arrival of the 20th century saw a convergence of economic factors which fueled rapid growth in Houston , including a burgeoning port and railroad industry , the decline of Galveston as Texas ' primary port following a devastating 1900 hurricane , the subsequent construction of the Houston Ship Channel , and the Texas oil boom . In the mid-20th century , Houston 's economy diversified as it became home to the Texas Medical Center - the world 's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions - and NASA 's Johnson Space Center , where the Mission Control Center is located .

The Group of Seven ( G7 ) was an unofficial forum which brought together the heads of the richest industrialized countries : France , Germany , Italy , Japan , the United Kingdom , the United States , Canada ( since 1976 ) and the President of the European Commission ( starting officially in 1981 ) . The summits were not meant to be linked formally with wider international institutions ; and in fact , a mild rebellion against the stiff formality of other international meetings was a part of the genesis of cooperation between France 's President Giscard d'Estaing and West Germany 's Chancellor Helmut Schmidt as they conceived the first Group of Six ( G6 ) summit in 1975 .",
