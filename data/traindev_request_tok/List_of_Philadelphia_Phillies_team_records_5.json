  "/wiki/Home_run": "In baseball , a home run ( abbreviated HR ) is scored when the ball is hit in such a way that the batter is able to circle the bases and reach home safely in one play without any errors being committed by the defensive team in the process . In modern baseball , the feat is typically achieved by hitting the ball over the outfield fence between the foul poles ( or making contact with either foul pole ) without first touching the ground , resulting in an automatic home run . There is also the inside-the-park home run where the batter reaches home safely while the baseball is in play on the field . A home run with a high exit velocity and good launch angle is sometimes called a no-doubter , because it leaves no doubt that it is going to leave the park when it leaves the bat . When a home run is scored , the batter is also credited with a hit and a run scored , and an RBI for each runner that scores , including himself . Likewise , the pitcher is recorded as having given up a hit and a run , with additional runs charged for each runner that scores other than the batter . Home runs are among the most popular aspects of baseball and , as a result , prolific home run hitters are usually the most popular among fans and consequently the highest paid by teams - hence the old saying , Home run hitters drive Cadillacs , and singles hitters drive Fords ( coined , circa 1948 , by veteran pitcher Fritz Ostermueller , by way of mentoring his young teammate , Ralph Kiner ) .",
  "/wiki/2009_Major_League_Baseball_season": "The 2009 Major League Baseball season began on April 5 , 2009 , the regular season was extended two days for a one-game playoff between the Detroit Tigers and the Minnesota Twins to decide the American League Central Division champion . The postseason began the next day with the Division Series . The World Series began on October 28 , and ended on November 4 , with the New York Yankees defeating the Philadelphia Phillies in six games . This was the second time the season was completed in November . The only other occasion was the 2001 World Series , because of the delaying of the end of that season due to the September 11 attacks as November baseball would be guaranteed when Game 4 was played on Sunday , November 1 . Had the 2009 World Series gone the full seven games , Game 7 would 've been played on November 5 , the latest date ever scheduled for a World Series game . American League champion had home field advantage for the World Series by virtue of winning the All-Star Game on July 14 at Busch Stadium in St. Louis , Missouri , 4-3 . In addition , the annual Civil Rights Game became a regular season game , and was played June 20 at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati , Ohio , when the host Cincinnati Reds lost to the Chicago White Sox in an interleague game , 10-8 . Both teams wore replicas of their 1965 uniforms in the contest .",
  "/wiki/Run_(baseball)": "In baseball , a run is scored when a player advances around first , second and third base and returns safely to home plate , touching the bases in that order , before three outs are recorded and all obligations to reach base safely on batted balls are met or assured . A player may score by hitting a home run or by any combination of plays that puts him safely on base ( that is , on first , second , or third ) as a runner and subsequently brings him home . The object of the game is for a team to score more runs than its opponent . The Official Baseball Rules hold that if the third out of an inning is a force out of a runner advancing to any base then , even if another baserunner crosses home plate before that force out is made , his run does not count . However , if the third out is not a force out , but a tag out , then if that other baserunner crosses home plate before that tag out is made , his run will count . In baseball statistics , a player who advances around all the bases to score is credited with a run ( R ) , sometimes referred to as a run scored . While runs scored is considered an important individual batting statistic , it is regarded as less significant than runs batted in ( RBIs ) . Both individual runs scored and runs batted in are heavily context-dependent ; however , the sabermetric statistic runs created provides a more sophisticated assessment of a player 's contribution toward producing runs for his team . A pitcher is likewise assessed runs surrendered in his statistics , which differentiate between standard earned runs ( for which the pitcher is statistically assigned full responsibility ) and unearned runs scored due to fielding errors , which do not count in his personal statistics . Specifically , if a fielding error occurs which affects the number of runs scored in an inning , the Official Scorer - the official in-game statistician - in order to determine how many of the runs should be classified as earned , will reconstruct the inning as if the error had not occurred . For example , with two outs , suppose a runner reaches base because of a fielding error , and then the next batter hits a two-run home run , and then the following batter then makes the third out , ending the inning . If the inning is reconstructed without the error , and if that third batter , instead of reaching on an error , registered an out , the inning would have ended there without any runs scoring .",
  "/wiki/Hit_(baseball)": "In baseball statistics , a hit ( denoted by H ) , also called a base hit , is credited to a batter when the batter safely reaches first base after hitting the ball into fair territory , without the benefit of an error or a fielder 's choice .",
  "/wiki/Double_(baseball)": "In baseball , a double is the act of a batter striking the pitched ball and safely reaching second base without being called out by the umpire , without the benefit of a fielder 's misplay ( see error ) or another runner being put out on a fielder 's choice . A double is a type of hit ( the others being the single , triple and home run ) and is sometimes called a two-bagger or two-base hit . For statistical and scorekeeping purposes it is denoted by 2B .",
  "/wiki/Triple_(baseball)": "In baseball , a triple is the act of a batter safely reaching third base after hitting the ball , with neither the benefit of a fielder 's misplay ( see error ) nor another runner being put out on a fielder 's choice . A triple is sometimes called a three-bagger or three-base hit . For statistical and scorekeeping purposes it is denoted by 3B . Triples have become somewhat rare in Major League Baseball . It often requires a ball hit to a distant part of the field , or the ball taking an unusual bounce in the outfield . It also usually requires that the batter hit the ball solidly , and be a speedy runner . It also often requires that the batter 's team have a good strategic reason for wanting the batter on third base , as a double will already put the batter in scoring position and there will often be little strategic advantage to taking the risk of trying to stretch a double into a triple . ( The inside-the-park home run is much rarer than a triple ) . The trend for modern ballparks is to have smaller outfields ( often increasing the number of home runs ) ; it has ensured that the career and season triples leaders mostly consist of those who played early in Major League Baseball history , generally in the dead-ball era . A walk-off triple ( one that ends a game ) occurs very infrequently . For example , the 2016 MLB season saw only three walk-off triples , excluding one play that was actually a triple plus an error .",

  "/wiki/Total_bases": "In baseball statistics , total bases is the number of bases a player has gained with hits . It is a weighted sum for which the weight value is 1 for a single , 2 for a double , 3 for a triple and 4 for a home run . Only bases attained from hits count toward this total . Reaching base by other means ( such as a base on balls ) or advancing further after the hit ( such as when a subsequent batter gets a hit ) does not increase the player 's total bases . In box scores and other statistical summaries , total bases is often denoted by the abbreviation TB . The total bases divided by the number of at bats is the player 's slugging average .",
  "/wiki/1993_Major_League_Baseball_season": "The 1993 Major League Baseball season was the final season of two-division play in each league , before the Central Division was added the following season , giving both the NL and AL three divisions each . Sixteen years after the American League expanded from 12 to 14 teams , the National League finally followed suit , with the Colorado Rockies and the Florida Marlins ( now the Miami Marlins ) joining the NL . It was also the first season since 1976 that both leagues had the same number of teams . The Toronto Blue Jays capped off the season by winning their second consecutive World Series title , beating the Philadelphia Phillies in six games . The World Series was clinched when , in one of the most famous moments in baseball , Joe Carter hit a three-run walk off home run in the 9th to seal the victory at home .",
  "/wiki/Strikeout": "In baseball or softball , a strikeout ( or strike-out ) occurs when a batter racks up three strikes during a time at bat . It usually means the batter is out . A strikeout is a statistic recorded for both pitchers and batters , and is denoted by K. A strikeout looking - in which the batter does not swing and the third strike is called by the umpire - is usually denoted by a \ua4d8 . Although a strikeout suggests that the pitcher dominated the batter , the free-swinging style that generates home runs also leaves batters susceptible to striking out . Some of the greatest home run hitters of all time - such as Alex Rodriguez , Reggie Jackson , and Jim Thome - were notorious for striking out .",

The Detroit Tigers set the American League record for losses in a season , with 119 , and the Marlins became the first team to win the championship twice as a wild card .",
  "/wiki/Stolen_base": "In baseball , a stolen base occurs when a runner advances to a base to which he is not entitled and the official scorer rules that the advance should be credited to the action of the runner . The umpires determine whether the runner is safe or out at the next base , but the official scorer rules on the question of credit or blame for the advance under Rule 10 . A stolen base most often occurs when a base runner advances to the next base while the pitcher is pitching the ball to home plate . Successful base stealers are not only fast but have good baserunning instincts and timing .",
