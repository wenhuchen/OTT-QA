After it was established , the first half of the California Trail followed the same corridor of networked river valley trails as the Oregon Trail and the Mormon Trail , namely the valleys of the Platte , North Platte , and Sweetwater rivers to Wyoming . In the present states of Wyoming , Idaho , and Utah , the California and Oregon trails split into several different trails or cutoffs .",

  "/wiki/Iditarod_National_Historic_Trail": "The Iditarod Trail , also known historically as the Seward-to-Nome Trail , refers to a thousand-plus mile ( 1,600 km ) historic and contemporary trail system in the US state of Alaska . The trail began as a composite of trails established by Alaskan native peoples . Its route crossed several mountain ranges and valleys and passed through numerous historical settlements en route from Seward to Nome . The discovery of gold around Nome brought thousands of people over this route beginning in 1910 . Roadhouses for people and dog barns sprang up every 20 or so miles . By 1918 World War I and the lack of 'gold fever ' resulted in far less travel . The trail might have been forgotten except for the 1925 diphtheria outbreak in Nome . In one of the final great feats of dog sleds , twenty drivers and teams carried the life-saving serum 674 miles ( 1,085 km ) in 127 hours . Today , the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race serves to commemorate the part the trail and its dog sleds played in the development of Alaska .",

The goal of the 1775-1776 trip was to establish a mission and presidio on the San Francisco Bay . The trail was an attempt to ease the course of Spanish colonization of California by establishing a major land route north for many to follow . It was used for about five years before being closed by the Quechan ( Yuma ) Indians in 1781 and kept closed for the next 40 years .",

  "/wiki/Mormon_Pioneer_National_Historic_Trail": "The Mormon Trail is the 1,300-mile ( 2,092 km ) route from Illinois to Utah that members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints traveled from 1846 to 1868 . Today , the Mormon Trail is a part of the United States National Trails System , known as the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail . The Mormon Trail extends from Nauvoo , Illinois , which was the principal settlement of the Latter Day Saints from 1839 to 1846 , to Salt Lake City , Utah , which was settled by Brigham Young and his followers beginning in 1847 . From Council Bluffs , Iowa to Fort Bridger in Wyoming , the trail follows much the same route as the Oregon Trail and the California Trail ; these trails are collectively known as the Emigrant Trail . The Mormon pioneer run began in 1846 , when Young and his followers were driven from Nauvoo . After leaving , they aimed to establish a new home for the church in the Great Basin and crossed Iowa . Along their way , some were assigned to establish settlements and to plant and harvest crops for later emigrants . During the winter of 1846-47 , the emigrants wintered in Iowa , other nearby states , and the unorganized territory that later became Nebraska , with the largest group residing in Winter Quarters , Nebraska . In the spring of 1847 , Young led the vanguard company to the Salt Lake Valley , which was then outside the boundaries of the United States and later became Utah . During the first few years , the emigrants were mostly former occupants of Nauvoo who were following Young to Utah . Later , the emigrants increasingly comprised converts from the British Isles and Europe . The trail was used for more than 20 years , until the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 .",

  "/wiki/Old_Spanish_National_Historic_Trail": "The Old Spanish Trail ( Spanish : Viejo Sendero Espa\u00f1ol ) is a historical trade route that connected the northern New Mexico settlements of ( or near ) Santa Fe , New Mexico with those of Los Angeles , California and southern California . Approximately 700 mi ( 1,100 km ) long , the trail ran through areas of high mountains , arid deserts , and deep canyons . It is considered one of the most arduous of all trade routes ever established in the United States . Explored , in part , by Spanish explorers as early as the late 16th century , the trail saw extensive use by pack trains from about 1830 until the mid-1850s . The name of the trail comes from the publication of John C. Fr\u00e9monts Report of his 1844 journey for the U.S. Topographical Corps. , guided by Kit Carson , from California to New Mexico . The name acknowledges the fact that parts of the trail had been known to the Spanish since the 16th century . Fr\u00e9mont 's report named a trail that had already been in use for about 15 years . The trail is important to New Mexico history because it established an arduous but usable trade route with California .",
  "/wiki/Oregon_National_Historic_Trail": "The Oregon Trail is a 2,170-mile ( 3,490 km ) historic east-west , large-wheeled wagon route and emigrant trail in the United States that connected the Missouri River to valleys in Oregon . The eastern part of the Oregon Trail spanned part of the future state of Kansas , and nearly all of what are now the states of Nebraska and Wyoming . The western half of the trail spanned most of the future states of Idaho and Oregon . The Oregon Trail was laid by fur traders and trappers from about 1811 to 1840 , and was only passable on foot or by horseback . By 1836 , when the first migrant wagon train was organized in Independence , Missouri , a wagon trail had been cleared to Fort Hall , Idaho . Wagon trails were cleared increasingly farther west , and eventually reached all the way to the Willamette Valley in Oregon , at which point what came to be called the Oregon Trail was complete , even as almost annual improvements were made in the form of bridges , cutoffs , ferries , and roads , which made the trip faster and safer . From various starting points in Iowa , Missouri , or Nebraska Territory , the routes converged along the lower Platte River Valley near Fort Kearny , Nebraska Territory , and led to rich farmlands west of the Rocky Mountains . From the early to mid-1830s ( and particularly through the years 1846-1869 ) the Oregon Trail and its many offshoots were used by about 400,000 settlers , farmers , miners , ranchers , and business owners and their families . The eastern half of the trail was also used by travelers on the California Trail ( from 1843 ) , Mormon Trail ( from 1847 ) , and Bozeman Trail ( from 1863 ) , before turning off to their separate destinations . Use of the trail declined as the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869 , making the trip west substantially faster , cheaper , and safer . Today , modern highways , such as Interstate 80 and Interstate 84 , follow parts of the same course westward and pass through towns originally established to serve those using the Oregon Trail .",
