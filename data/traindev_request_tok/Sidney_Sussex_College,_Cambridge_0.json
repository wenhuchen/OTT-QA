  "/wiki/Lord_Mayor_of_London": "The Lord Mayor of London is the City 's mayor and the leader of the City of London Corporation . Within the City of London , the Lord Mayor is accorded precedence over all individuals except the sovereign and retains various traditional powers , rights and privileges , including the title and style The Right Honourable Lord Mayor of London . One of the world 's oldest continuously elected civic offices , it is entirely separate from the directly-elected Mayor of London , a political office controlling a budget which covers the much larger area of Greater London . The Corporation of London changed its name to the City of London Corporation in 2006 , and accordingly the title Lord Mayor of the City of London was introduced , so as to avoid confusion with the Mayor of London . However , the legal and commonly used title remains Lord Mayor of London .

The Lord Mayor 's Show is held on the day after taking office ; the Lord Mayor , preceded by a procession , travels to the Royal Courts of Justice at the Strand to swear allegiance to the sovereign before the Justices of the High Court . The Lord Mayor 's main role nowadays is to represent , support and promote the businesses and residents in the City of London .

They introduced exact and logical thinking into the brand new discipline of cybernetics and were highly influential .",
  "/wiki/Cybernetics": "Cybernetics is a transdisciplinary approach for exploring regulatory systems - their structures , constraints , and possibilities . Norbert Wiener defined cybernetics in 1948 as the scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine . In other words , it is the scientific study of how humans , animals and machines control and communicate with each other . Cybernetics is applicable when a system being analyzed incorporates a closed signaling loop - originally referred to as a circular causal relationship - that is , where action by the system generates some change in its environment and that change is reflected in the system in some manner ( feedback ) that triggers a system change . Cybernetics is relevant to , for example , mechanical , physical , biological , cognitive , and social systems . The essential goal of the broad field of cybernetics is to understand and define the functions and processes of systems that have goals and that participate in circular , causal chains that move from action to sensing to comparison with desired goal , and again to action . Its focus is how anything ( digital , mechanical or biological ) processes information , reacts to information , and changes or can be changed to better accomplish the first two tasks . Cybernetics includes the study of feedback , black boxes and derived concepts such as communication and control in living organisms , machines and organizations including self-organization . Concepts studied by cyberneticists include , but are not limited to : learning , cognition , adaptation , social control , emergence , convergence , communication , efficiency , efficacy , and connectivity . In cybernetics these concepts ( otherwise already objects of study in other disciplines such as biology and engineering ) are abstracted from the context of the specific organism or device . The word cybernetics comes from Greek \u03ba\u03c5\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae ( kybern\u0113tik\u1e17 ) , meaning governance , i.e. , all that are pertinent to \u03ba\u03c5\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c9 ( kybern\u00e1\u014d ) , the latter meaning to steer , navigate or govern , hence \u03ba\u03c5\u03b2\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 ( kyb\u00e9rn\u0113sis ) , meaning government , is the government while \u03ba\u03c5\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 ( kybern\u1e17t\u0113s ) is the governor or helmperson of the ship . Contemporary cybernetics began as an interdisciplinary study connecting the fields of control systems , electrical network theory , mechanical engineering , logic modeling , evolutionary biology , neuroscience , anthropology , and psychology in the 1940s , often attributed to the Macy Conferences .",
