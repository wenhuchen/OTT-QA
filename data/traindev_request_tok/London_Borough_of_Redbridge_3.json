Formed in 1862 after the amalgamation of the Eastern Counties Railway and several other smaller railway companies the GER served Cambridge , Chelmsford , Colchester , Great Yarmouth , Ipswich , King 's Lynn , Lowestoft , Norwich , Southend-on-Sea ( opened by the GER in 1889 ) , and East Anglian seaside resorts such as Hunstanton ( whose prosperity was largely a result of the GER 's line being built ) and Cromer . It also served a suburban area , including Enfield , Chingford , Loughton and Ilford . This suburban network was , in the early 20th century , the busiest steam-hauled commuter system in the world . The majority of the Great Eastern 's locomotives and rolling stock were built at Stratford Works , part of which was on the site of today 's Stratford International station and the rest was adjacent to Stratford Regional station . The GER owned 1,200 miles ( 1,931 km ) of line and had a near-monopoly in East Anglia until the opening of the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway in 1893 although there were a number of minor lines , such as the Mid-Suffolk Light Railway that stayed resolutely independent until after the grouping in 1923 .",
