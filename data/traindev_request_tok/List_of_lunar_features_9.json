  "/wiki/Diameter": "In geometry , a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle . It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle . Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere . In more modern usage , the length of a diameter is also called the diameter . In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter ( which refers to the line segment itself ) , because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length , this being twice the radius r .",

The sea is bounded in the northwest by Ukraine , in the southeast by Russia . The Don River and Kuban River are the major rivers that flow into it . There is a constant outflow of water from the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea . The Sea of Azov is the shallowest sea in the world , with the depth varying between 0.9 and 14 metres ( 2 ft 11 in and 45 ft 11 in ) . The sea is largely affected by the inflow of numerous rivers , which bring sand , silt , and shells , which in turn form numerous bays , limans , and narrow spits . Because of these deposits , the sea bottom is relatively smooth and flat with the depth gradually increasing toward the middle . Also , due to the river inflow , water in the sea has low salinity and a high amount of biomass ( such as green algae ) that affects the water colour . Abundant plankton result in unusually high fish productivity . The sea shores and spits are low ; they are rich in vegetation and bird colonies .",

The longest east-west extent is about 1,175 km ( 730 mi ) . Important cities along the coast include Odessa , Sevastopol , Samsun , and Istanbul . The Black Sea is bordered by Ukraine , Romania , Bulgaria , Turkey , Georgia , and Russia . It has a positive water balance ; that is , a net outflow of water 300 km3 ( 72 cu mi ) per year through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles into the Aegean Sea . There is a two-way hydrological exchange : the more saline and therefore denser , but warmer , Mediterranean water flows into the Black Sea under its less saline outflow . This creates a significant anoxic layer well below the surface waters . The Black Sea drains into the Mediterranean Sea , via the Aegean Sea and various straits , and is navigable to the Atlantic Ocean .",

He is perhaps better known for inventing the catadioptric ( reflective/refractive ) Fresnel lens and for pioneering the use of stepped lenses to extend the visibility of lighthouses , saving countless lives at sea . The simpler dioptric ( purely refractive ) stepped lens , first proposed by Count Buffon and independently reinvented by Fresnel , is used in screen magnifiers and in condenser lenses for overhead projectors . By expressing Huygens ' principle of secondary waves and Young 's principle of interference in quantitative terms , and supposing that simple colors consist of sinusoidal waves , Fresnel gave the first satisfactory explanation of diffraction by straight edges , including the first satisfactory wave-based explanation of rectilinear propagation . Part of his argument was a proof that the addition of sinusoidal functions of the same frequency but different phases is analogous to the addition of forces with different directions . By further supposing that light waves are purely transverse , Fresnel explained the nature of polarization , the mechanism of chromatic polarization , and the transmission and reflection coefficients at the interface between two transparent isotropic media . Then , by generalizing the direction-speed-polarization relation for calcite , he accounted for the directions and polarizations of the refracted rays in doubly-refractive crystals of the biaxial class ( those for which Huygens ' secondary wavefronts are not axisymmetric ) . The period between the first publication of his pure-transverse-wave hypothesis and the submission of his first correct solution to the biaxial problem was less than a year . Later , he coined the terms linear polarization , circular polarization , and elliptical polarization , explained how optical rotation could be understood as a difference in propagation speeds for the two directions of circular polarization , and ( by allowing the reflection coefficient to be complex ) accounted for the change in polarization due to total internal reflection , as exploited in the Fresnel rhomb . Defenders of the established corpuscular theory could not match his quantitative explanations of so many phenomena on so few assumptions . Fresnel had a lifelong battle with tuberculosis , to which he succumbed at the age of 39 . Although he did not become a public celebrity in his lifetime , he lived just long enough to receive due recognition from his peers , including ( on his deathbed ) the Rumford Medal of the Royal Society of London , and his name is ubiquitous in the modern terminology of optics and waves .",

At the University of Glasgow he did important work in the mathematical analysis of electricity and formulation of the first and second laws of thermodynamics , and did much to unify the emerging discipline of physics in its modern form . He worked closely with mathematics professor Hugh Blackburn in his work . He also had a career as an electric telegraph engineer and inventor , which propelled him into the public eye and ensured his wealth , fame and honour . For his work on the transatlantic telegraph project he was knighted in 1866 by Queen Victoria , becoming Sir William Thomson . He had extensive maritime interests and was most noted for his work on the mariner 's compass , which previously had limited reliability . Absolute temperatures are stated in units of kelvin in his honour . While the existence of a lower limit to temperature ( absolute zero ) was known prior to his work , Kelvin is known for determining its correct value as approximately \u2212273.15 degree Celsius or \u2212459.67 degree Fahrenheit .

He summarized and extended the work of his predecessors in his five-volume M\u00e9canique C\u00e9leste ( Celestial Mechanics ) ( 1799-1825 ) . This work translated the geometric study of classical mechanics to one based on calculus , opening up a broader range of problems . In statistics , the Bayesian interpretation of probability was developed mainly by Laplace . Laplace formulated Laplace 's equation , and pioneered the Laplace transform which appears in many branches of mathematical physics , a field that he took a leading role in forming . The Laplacian differential operator , widely used in mathematics , is also named after him . He restated and developed the nebular hypothesis of the origin of the Solar System and was one of the first scientists to postulate the existence of black holes and the notion of gravitational collapse . Laplace is remembered as one of the greatest scientists of all time . Sometimes referred to as the French Newton or Newton of France , he has been described as possessing a phenomenal natural mathematical faculty superior to that of any of his contemporaries .

Its population is approximately 10.7 million as of 2018 ; Athens , the nation 's capital , is its largest city , followed by Thessaloniki . Situated on the southern tip of the Balkan Peninsula , Greece is located at the crossroads of Europe , Asia , and Africa . It shares land borders with Albania to the northwest , North Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north , and Turkey to the northeast . The Aegean Sea lies to the east of the mainland , the Ionian Sea to the west , the Cretan Sea and the Mediterranean Sea to the south . Greece has the longest coastline on the Mediterranean Basin and the 11th longest coastline in the world at 13,676 km ( 8,498 mi ) in length , featuring many islands , of which 227 are inhabited . Eighty percent of Greece is mountainous , with Mount Olympus being the highest peak at 2,918 metres ( 9,573 ft ) . The country consists of nine traditional geographic regions : Macedonia , Central Greece , the Peloponnese , Thessaly , Epirus , the Aegean Islands ( including the Dodecanese and Cyclades ) , Thrace , Crete , and the Ionian Islands . Greece is considered the cradle of Western civilisation , being the birthplace of democracy , Western philosophy , Western literature , historiography , political science , major scientific and mathematical principles , Western drama and the Olympic Games . From the eighth century B.C. , the Greeks were organised into various independent city-states , known as poleis ( singular polis ) , which spanned the entire Mediterranean region and the Black Sea . Philip of Macedon united most of the Greek mainland in the fourth century BC , with his son Alexander the Great rapidly conquering much of the ancient world , from the eastern Mediterranean to India . Greece was annexed by Rome in the second century B.C. , becoming an integral part of the Roman Empire and its successor , the Byzantine Empire , which adopted the Greek language and culture ."
