The community is the location of the prehistoric Shawnee Reservation Mound , one of three remaining Adena-era earthwork mounds and enclosures found in an eight-mile stretch along the river . Also called Fairgrounds Mound and Poorhouse Mound , it is now located within Shawnee Regional Park . The mound is about 20 feet high and 80 feet in basal diameter , but was originally 25 feet high and greater than 80 feet in diameter . In the late 19th century , the Smithsonian Institution inventoried an Adena-era complex along the Kanawha River that had more than 50 earthwork mounds and ten enclosures . These works were likely built by indigenous peoples from approximately 300 BCE to 200 CE . During a 1902 archaeological exploration by Gerard Fowke , a total of 27 fully wrapped mummies were discovered in near perfect conditions due to the unique qualities of the local weather conditions .

It connected commerce as far inland as Farmville , Virginia at the foothills of the Blue Ridge and the Appalachian Mountains chain , to shipping further east into the Chesapeake Bay and North Atlantic Ocean . For similar reasons , 17th century era Fort Henry was built at the order of the Virginia House of Burgesses at Petersburg in 1645 to protect the river traffic .
