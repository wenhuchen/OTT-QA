The oldest part of the house was built sometime between 1638 and 1643 by Finnish settlers in the New Sweden colony , and Scandinavian ironware from the 1590s is still extant around the fireplace . The fireplace , probably built of bricks brought over to North America as ship 's ballast , is asymmetric and placed in a corner of the cabin . The original cabin measures 16 by 22 feet , which indicates that the builders were relatively well off ; an average sized dwelling of the period was 12 by 12 feet . It is built of oak logs , and two logs were removable to provide ventilation in the summer . The logs were double dovetailed to provide a close fit , and gravel was pounded between the chinks in the logs . No nails were used in the original construction ; hardwood pegs were used as fasteners . There is no ridgepole in the roof . People lived in this part of the house until 1918 . A large addition to the original cabin was constructed in the early 18th century . A wooden floor was built over the original dirt floor around 1730 .",

He was an early advocate of democracy and religious freedom , notable for his good relations and successful treaties with the Lenape Native Americans . Under his direction , the city of Philadelphia was planned and developed . In 1681 , King Charles II handed over a large piece of his North American land holdings along the North Atlantic Ocean coast to Penn to pay the debts the king had owed to Penn 's father . This land included the present-day states of Pennsylvania and Delaware . Penn immediately set sail and took his first step on American soil , sailing up the Delaware Bay and Delaware River , ( past earlier Swedish and Dutch riverfront colonies ) in New Castle ( now in Delaware ) in 1682 . On this occasion , the colonists pledged allegiance to Penn as their new proprietor , and the first Pennsylvania General Assembly was held . Afterward , Penn journeyed further north up the Delaware River and founded Philadelphia , on the west bank . However , Penn 's Quaker government was not viewed favorably by the previous Dutch , Swedish colonists , and also earlier English settlers in what is now Delaware , but claimed for half a century by the neighboring Province of Maryland 's proprietor family , the Calverts and Lord Baltimore . These earlier colonists had no historical allegiance to a Pennsylvania , so they almost immediately began petitioning for their own representative assembly . 23 years later in 1704 , they achieved their goal when the three southernmost counties of provincial Pennsylvania along the western coast of the Delaware , were permitted to split off and become the new semi-autonomous colony of Lower Delaware .",
