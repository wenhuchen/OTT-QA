The Bengals were founded in 1966 as a member of the American Football League ( AFL ) by former Cleveland Browns head coach Paul Brown , and began play in the 1968 season . Brown was the Bengals ' head coach from their inception to 1975 . After being dismissed as the Browns ' head coach by Art Modell ( who had purchased majority interest in the team in 1961 ) in January 1963 , Brown had shown interest in establishing another NFL franchise in Ohio and looked at both Cincinnati and Columbus . He ultimately chose the former when a deal between the city , Hamilton County , and Major League Baseball 's Cincinnati Reds ( who were seeking a replacement for the obsolete Crosley Field ) was struck that resulted in an agreement to build a multipurpose stadium which could host both baseball and football games . Due to the impending merger of the AFL and the NFL , which was scheduled to take full effect in the 1970 season , Brown agreed to join the AFL as its tenth and final franchise . The Bengals , like the other former AFL teams , were assigned to the AFC following the merger . Cincinnati was also selected because , like their neighbors the Reds , they could draw from several large neighboring cities ( Louisville and Lexington , Kentucky ; Columbus , Dayton , and Springfield , Ohio ) that are all no more than 110 miles ( 180 km ) away from downtown Cincinnati , along with Indianapolis , until the Baltimore Colts relocated there prior to the 1984 NFL season .

After the success of expanding the regular season to a period of 17 weeks in 1990 , the league hoped this new schedule would generate even more revenue . This was also done to avoid scheduling playoff games on January 1 and competing with college football bowl games . However , teams felt that having two weeks off during the regular season was too disruptive for their weekly routines , and thus it reverted to 17 weeks immediately after the season ended .
