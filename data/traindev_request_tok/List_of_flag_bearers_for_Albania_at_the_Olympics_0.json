  "/wiki/1972_Summer_Olympics": "The 1972 Summer Olympics ( German : Olympische Sommerspiele 1972 ) , officially known as the Games of the XX Olympiad , was an international multi-sport event held in Munich , West Germany , from 26 August to 11 September 1972 . The sporting nature of the event was largely overshadowed by the Munich massacre in the second week , in which eleven Israeli athletes and coaches and a West German police officer at Olympic village were killed by Black September terrorists . The 1972 Summer Olympics were the second Summer Olympics to be held in Germany , after the 1936 Games in Berlin , which had taken place under the Nazi regime . The West German Government had been eager to have the Munich Olympics present a democratic and optimistic Germany to the world , as shown by the Games ' official motto , Die Heiteren Spiele , or the cheerful Games . The logo of the Games was a blue solar logo ( the Bright Sun ) by Otl Aicher , the designer and director of the visual conception commission . The Olympic mascot , the dachshund Waldi , was the first officially named Olympic mascot . The Olympic Fanfare was composed by Herbert Rehbein . The Soviet Union won the most gold and overall medals . The Olympic Park ( Olympiapark ) is based on Frei Otto 's plans and after the Games became a Munich landmark . The competition sites , designed by architect G\u00fcnther Behnisch , included the Olympic swimming hall , the Olympics Hall ( Olympiahalle , a multipurpose facility ) and the Olympic Stadium ( Olympiastadion ) , and an Olympic village very close to the park . The design of the stadium was considered revolutionary , with sweeping canopies of acrylic glass stabilized by metal ropes , used on such a large scale for the first time .",

  "/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting": "Olympic weightlifting , or Olympic-style weightlifting , often simply referred to as weightlifting , is a sport in which the athlete attempts a maximum-weight single lift of a barbell loaded with weight plates . The two competition lifts in order are the snatch and the clean and jerk . The snatch is a wide-grip , one-move lift . The clean and jerk is a close-grip , two-move lift . Each weightlifter receives three attempts in each , and the combined total of the highest two successful lifts determines the overall result within a bodyweight category . Bodyweight categories are different for male and female competitors . A lifter who fails to complete at least one successful snatch and one successful clean and jerk also fails to total , and therefore receives an incomplete entry for the competition . The clean and press was once a competition lift , but was discontinued due to difficulties in judging proper form . In comparison with other strength sports , which test limit strength ( with or without lifting aids ) , weightlifting tests aspects of human ballistic limits ( explosive strength ) ; the lifts are therefore executed faster - and with more mobility and a greater range of motion during their execution - than other strength movements . The lifts performed in the sport of weightlifting , and in particular their component lifts ( e.g . squats , deadlifts , cleans ) , are commonly used by elite athletes in other sports to train for both explosive and functional strength .",

  "/wiki/Shooting_sport": "Shooting sports is a collective group of competitive and recreational sporting activities involving proficiency tests of accuracy , precision and speed in shooting - the art of using various types of ranged weapons , mainly referring to human-portable guns ( firearms and airguns , in forms such as handguns , rifles and shotguns ) and bows/crossbows . Different disciplines of shooting sports can be categorized by equipment , shooting distances , targets , time limits and degrees of athleticism involved . Shooting sports may involve both team and individual competition , and team performance is usually assessed by summing the scores of the individual team members . Due to the noise of shooting and the high ( and often lethal ) impact energy of the projectiles , shooting sports are typically conducted at either designated permanent shooting ranges or temporary shooting fields in the area away from settlements .",
  "/wiki/1996_Summer_Olympics": "The 1996 Summer Olympics , officially known as the Games of the XXVI Olympiad , commonly known as Atlanta 1996 , and also referred to as the Centennial Olympic Games , were an international multi-sport event that was held from July 19 to August 4 , 1996 , in Atlanta , Georgia , U.S . These Games , which were the fourth Summer Olympics to be hosted by the United States , marked the centennial of the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens - the inaugural edition of the modern Olympic Games . They were also the first since 1924 to be held in a different year from a Winter Olympics , under a new IOC practice implemented in 1994 to hold the Summer and Winter Games in alternating , even-numbered years . More than 10,000 athletes from 197 National Olympic Committees competed in 26 sports , including the Olympic debuts of beach volleyball , mountain biking , and softball , as well as the new disciplines of lightweight rowing and women 's football ( soccer ) . 24 countries made their Summer Olympic debut in Atlanta , including eleven former Soviet republics participating for the first time as independent nations . The hosting United States led the medal count with a total of 101 medals , and the most gold ( 44 ) and silver ( 32 ) medals out of all countries . The U.S. topped the medal count for the first time since 1984 , and for the first time since 1968 in a non-boycotted Summer Olympics . Notable performances during competition included those of Andre Agassi - who became the first men 's singles tennis player to combine a career Grand Slam with an Olympic gold medal , Donovan Bailey - who set a new world record of 9.84 for the men 's 100 meters , and Lilia Podkopayeva - who became the second gymnast to win an individual event gold after winning the all-round title in the same Olympics . The festivities were marred by violence on July 27 , when Eric Rudolph detonated pipe bombs at Centennial Olympic Park - a downtown park that was built to serve as a public focal point for the Games ' festivities , killing 1 and injuring 111 . In 2003 , Rudolph confessed to the bombing and a series of related attacks on abortion centers and a gay bar , and was sentenced to life in prison . He claimed that the bombing was meant to protest the U.S. government 's sanctioning of abortion on demand . The Games turned a profit , helped by record revenue from sponsorship deals and broadcast rights , and reliance on private funding ( as opposed to the extensive public funding used on later Olympics ) , among other factors .",

Events are almost exclusively divided by gender , although both the men 's and women 's competitions are usually held at the same venue . If a race has too many people to run all at once , preliminary heats will be run to narrow down the field of participants . Track and field is one of the oldest sports .",

Athens 2004 marked the first time since the 1996 Summer Olympics that all countries with a National Olympic Committee were in attendance . 2004 also marked the return of the Olympic Games to the city where they began . Having previously hosted the Olympics in 1896 , Athens became one of only four cities to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games on two separate occasions at the time ( together with Paris , London , and Los Angeles ) . A new medal obverse was introduced at these Games , replacing the design by Giuseppe Cassioli that had been used since the 1928 Games . This rectified the long lasting mistake of using a depiction of the Roman Colosseum rather than a Greek venue . The new design features the Panathenaic Stadium . The 2004 Summer Games were hailed as unforgettable , dream games by IOC President Jacques Rogge , and left Athens with a significantly improved infrastructure , including a new airport , ring road , and subway system . There have been arguments ( mostly in popular media ) regarding the cost of the 2004 Athens Summer Games and their possible contribution to the 2010-2018 Greek government-debt crisis , however , there is little or no evidence for such a correlation . The 2004 Olympics were generally deemed to be a success , with the rising standard of competition amongst nations across the world .",

Along with Greco-Roman , it is one of the two styles of wrestling contested in the Olympic games . American high school and college wrestling is conducted under different rules and is termed scholastic and collegiate wrestling .

In both styles the ultimate goal is to throw and pin the opponent to the mat , which results in an immediate win . Unlike Greco-Roman , freestyle and collegiate wrestling allow the use of the wrestler 's or the opponent 's legs in offense and defense . Freestyle wrestling brings together traditional wrestling , judo , and sambo techniques . According to wrestling 's world governing body , United World Wrestling ( UWW ) , freestyle wrestling is one of the six main forms of amateur competitive wrestling practiced internationally today . The other five forms are Greco-Roman wrestling , grappling/submission wrestling , beach wrestling , pankration athlima , alysh/belt wrestling and traditional/folk wrestling .
