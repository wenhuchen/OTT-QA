At first , the name was written with one different character ( \u5927\u502d ) , but due to its offensive connotation , for about ten years after 737 , this was revised to use more desirable characters ( \u5927\u990a\u5fb3 ) ( see Names of Japan ) . The final revision was made in the second year of the Tenpy\u014d-h\u014dji era ( c. 758 ) . It is classified as a great province in the Engishiki . The Yamato Period in the history of Japan refers to the late Kofun Period ( c. 250-538 ) and Asuka Period ( 538-710 ) . Japanese archaeologists and historians emphasize the fact that during the early Kofun Period the Yamato chieftainship was in close contention with other regional powers , such as Kibi Province near present-day Okayama Prefecture . Around the 6th century , the local chieftainship gained national control and established the Imperial court in Yamato Province . The battleship Yamato , the flagship of the Japanese Combined Fleet during World War II , was named after this ancient province .",

For most of its history , the area was never a single political entity , even during the Tokugawa period , when the port was controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate . Kobe did not exist in its current form until its founding in 1889 . Its name comes from Kanbe ( \u795e\u6238 , an archaic title for supporters of the city 's Ikuta Shrine ) . Kobe became one of Japan 's designated cities in 1956 . Kobe was one of the cities to open for trade with the West following the 1853 end of the policy of seclusion and has since been known as a cosmopolitan and nuclear-free zone port city . While the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake diminished much of Kobe 's prominence as a port city , it remains Japan 's fourth-busiest container port . Companies headquartered in Kobe include ASICS , Kawasaki Heavy Industries , and Kobe Steel , as well as over 100 international corporations with Asian or Japanese headquarters in the city , such as Eli Lilly and Company , Procter & Gamble , Boehringer Ingelheim , and Nestl\u00e9 .

It was preceded by the Sui dynasty and followed by the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period in Chinese history . Historians generally regard the Tang as a high point in Chinese civilization , and a golden age of cosmopolitan culture . Tang territory , acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers , rivaled that of the Han dynasty . The Tang capital at Chang'an ( present-day Xi'an ) was the most populous city in the world in its day . The L\u01d0 family ( \u674e ) founded the dynasty , seizing power during the decline and collapse of the Sui Empire . The dynasty was interrupted for 15 years when Empress Wu Zetian seized the throne , proclaiming the Wu Zhou dynasty and becoming the only legitimate Chinese empress regnant .

Yet , even when the central government was breaking down and unable to compile an accurate census of the population in the 9th century , it is estimated that the population had grown by then to about 80 million people .

It was extremely influential in East Asia , but most likely of considerably less importance in the Indian and Tibetan sub-traditions of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism . The word nirde\u015ba in the title means instruction , advice , and Vimalak\u012brti is the name of the main protagonist of the text , and means Taintless Fame . The sutra teaches , among other subjects , the meaning of nondualism , the doctrine of the true body of the Buddha , the characteristically Mah\u0101y\u0101na claim that the appearances of the world are mere illusions , and the superiority of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na over other paths . It places in the mouth of the up\u0101saka ( lay practitioner ) Vimalak\u012brti a teaching addressed to both arhats and bodhisattvas , regarding the doctrine of \u015b\u016bnyat\u0101 . In most versions , the discourse of the text culminates with a wordless teaching of silence . Translator Burton Watson argues that the Vimalak\u012brti Nirde\u015ba was likely composed in approximately 100 CE . Although it had been thought lost for centuries , a version in Sanskrit was recovered in 1999 among the manuscripts of the Potala Palace in Lhasa . The Sanskrit was published in parallel with the Tibetan and three Chinese versions by the Study Group on Buddhist Sanskrit Literature at the Institute for Comprehensive Studies of Buddhism at Taisho University in 2004 , and in 2006 , the same group published a critical edition that has become the standard version of the Sanskrit for scholarly purposes . In 2007 the Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods published a romanized Sanskrit version under the title \u0100ryavimalak\u012brtinirde\u015bo N\u0101ma Mah\u0101y\u0101nas\u016btram .

The Dipavamsa states that during the reign of Valagamba of Anuradhapura ( 29-17 BCE ) the monks who had previously remembered the Tripi\u1e6daka and its commentary orally now wrote them down in books , because of the threat posed by famine and war .

Later Goguryeo , also known as Taebong , was overthrown from within in 918 by Wang Geon , a prominent general of noble Goguryeo descent , who established Goryeo in its place . Goryeo peacefully annexed Later Silla in 935 and militarily conquered Later Baekje in 936 , successfully reunifying the Korean Peninsula . Beginning in 993 , Goryeo faced multiple invasions by the Khitan Liao dynasty , a powerful nomadic empire to the north , but a decisive military victory in 1019 brought about a century of peace and prosperity as Goryeo entered its golden age . During this period , a balance of power was maintained in East Asia between Goryeo , Liao , and Song . The Goryeo period was the golden age of Buddhism in Korea , and as the national religion , Buddhism achieved its highest level of influence in Korean history , with 70 temples in the capital alone in the 11th century . Commerce flourished in Goryeo , with merchants coming from as far as the Middle East , and the capital in modern-day Kaesong , North Korea was a center of trade and industry , with merchants employing a system of double-entry bookkeeping since the 11th or 12th century . In addition , Goryeo was a period of great achievements in Korean art and culture , such as Kory\u014f celadon , which was highly praised in the Song dynasty , and the Tripitaka Koreana , which was described by UNESCO as one of the most important and most complete corpus of Buddhist doctrinal texts in the world , with the original 81,258 engraved printing blocks still preserved at Haeinsa Temple . In the early 13th century , Goryeo developed movable type made of metal to print books , 200 years before Johannes Gutenberg in Europe .",
