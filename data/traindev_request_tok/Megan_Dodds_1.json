  "/wiki/Hamlet": "The Tragedy of Hamlet , Prince of Denmark , often shortened to Hamlet ( /\u02c8h\u00e6ml\u026at/ ) , is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare sometime between 1599 and 1601 . It is Shakespeare 's longest play with 30,557 words . Set in Denmark , the play depicts Prince Hamlet and his revenge against his uncle , Claudius , who has murdered Hamlet 's father in order to seize his throne and marry Hamlet 's mother . Hamlet is Shakespeare 's longest play and is considered among the most powerful and influential works of world literature , with a story capable of seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others . It was one of Shakespeare 's most popular works during his lifetime and still ranks among his most performed , topping the performance list of the Royal Shakespeare Company and its predecessors in Stratford-upon-Avon since 1879 . It has inspired many other writers - from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Charles Dickens to James Joyce and Iris Murdoch - and has been described as the world 's most filmed story after Cinderella . The story of Shakespeare 's Hamlet was derived from the legend of Amleth , preserved by 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum , as subsequently retold by the 16th-century scholar Fran\u00e7ois de Belleforest . Shakespeare may also have drawn on an earlier Elizabethan play known today as the Ur-Hamlet , though some scholars believe Shakespeare wrote the Ur-Hamlet , later revising it to create the version of Hamlet we now have . He almost certainly wrote his version of the title role for his fellow actor , Richard Burbage , the leading tragedian of Shakespeare 's time . In the 400 years since its inception , the role has been performed by numerous highly acclaimed actors in each successive century . Three different early versions of the play are extant : the First Quarto ( Q1 , 1603 ) ; the Second Quarto ( Q2 , 1604 ) ; and the First Folio ( F1 , 1623 ) . Each version includes lines and entire scenes missing from the others .",

The play 's first performance is uncertain , though a performance at Wilton House in 1603 has been suggested as a possibility . As You Like It follows its heroine Rosalind as she flees persecution in her uncle 's court , accompanied by her cousin Celia to find safety and , eventually , love , in the Forest of Arden . In the forest , they encounter a variety of memorable characters , notably the melancholy traveller Jaques who speaks many of Shakespeare 's most famous speeches ( such as All the world 's a stage , too much of a good thing and A fool ! A fool ! I met a fool in the forest ) . Jaques provides a sharp contrast to the other characters in the play , always observing and disputing the hardships of life in the country . Historically , critical response has varied , with some critics finding the play a work of great merit and some finding it to be of lesser quality than other Shakespearean works . The play remains a favourite among audiences and has been adapted for radio , film , and musical theatre .
