  "/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science": "A Bachelor of Science ( Latin Baccalaureus Scientiae , B.S. , BS , B.Sc . or BSc ; or , less commonly , S.B. , SB , or Sc.B. , from the equivalent Latin Scientiae Baccalaureus ) is an undergraduate academic degree awarded for programs that generally last three to five years . The first university to admit a student to the degree of Bachelor of Science was the University of London in 1860 . Whether a student of a particular subject is awarded a Bachelor of Science degree or a Bachelor of Arts degree can vary between universities . For example , an economics degree may be given as a Bachelor of Arts ( BA ) by one university but as a BS by another , and some universities offer the choice of either . Some liberal arts colleges in the United States offer only the BA , even in the natural sciences , while some universities offer only the BS , even in non-science fields . At universities that offer both BA and BS degrees in the same discipline , the BS degree is usually more extensive in that particular discipline and is targeted toward students who are pursuing graduate school or a profession in that field .",

  "/wiki/The_Seven_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People": "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People , first published in 1989 , is a business and self-help book written by Stephen Covey . Covey presents an approach to being effective in attaining goals by aligning oneself to what he calls true north principles based on a character ethic that he presents as universal and timeless . Covey defines effectiveness as the balance of obtaining desirable results with caring for that which produces those results . He illustrates this by referring to the fable of the goose that laid the golden eggs . He further claims that effectiveness can be expressed in terms of the P/PC ratio , where P refers to getting desired results and PC is caring for that which produces the results . Covey 's best-known book has sold more than 25 million copies worldwide since its first publication . The audio version became the first non-fiction audio-book in U.S. publishing history to sell more than one million copies . Covey argues against what he calls the personality ethic , that he sees as prevalent in many modern self-help books . He promotes what he labels the character ethic : aligning one 's values with so-called universal and timeless principles . In doing this , Covey is deliberately and mindfully separating principles and values . He sees principles as external natural laws , while values remain internal and subjective . Our values govern our behavior , while principles ultimately determine the consequences .",

  "/wiki/Valedictorian": "Valedictorian is an academic title of success used in the United States , Canada , Philippines , and Armenia , ( and elsewhere in limited number of schools ) for the student who delivers the closing or farewell statement at a graduation ceremony ( called a valediction ) . The chosen valedictorian is traditionally the student with the highest ranking ( highest Grade Point Average , or GPA ) among their graduating class . The term is an Anglicised derivation of the Latin vale dicere ( to say farewell ) , historically rooted in the valedictorian 's traditional role as the final speaker at the graduation ceremony before the students receive their diplomas . The valedictory address generally is considered a final farewell to classmates , before they disperse to pursue their individual paths after graduating . In Australia , New Zealand , South Africa , Ireland and India the title valedictorian is not used frequently . In Australia , the title is sometimes awarded to a member of a graduating university class on the basis of contribution to the school rather than academic success . The highest-ranking student in a graduating class is often referred to as dux ( Latin for leader ) , and may or may not give a speech . In France the term Major de promotion ( first in class ) is used , although the term is not related to any ceremonial role , as there are rarely graduation ceremonies in schools or universities .",
