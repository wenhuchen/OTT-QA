  "/wiki/Starting_price": "In horse racing , the starting price ( SP ) is the odds prevailing on a particular horse in the on-course fixed-odds betting market at the time a race begins . The method by which SPs are set for each runner varies in different countries but is generally by consensus of an appointed panel on the basis of their observations of the fluctuation in prices at the racetrack . This is done as follows : For each horse the odds offered by the bookmakers are ordered into a list from longest to shortest . This list is then divided into two equal halves and the SP is the shortest odds available in the half containing the longest odds . Thus the SP or a longer price will have been offered by at least half the bookmakers in the sample . Note : This method is slightly different from the method of calculating the median . The principal function of a starting price is to determine returns on those winning bets where fixed odds have not been taken at the time the bet was struck . Typically , on the day of the race , UK bookmakers offer a choice between placing a bet at SP , or taking a fixed price . When viewing future races , SP may be the only option available . Some bookmakers offer best odds guaranteed , meaning that if a punter takes fixed odds on a race when the bet is struck and the SP turns out to be better ( that is , higher ) , then if the punter wins , the payout is calculated using the SP . This is aimed at removing hesitancy among punters prompted by fears of taking what might prove to be a poor ( that is , low ) price before the race . In the United Kingdom , the stake on an SP bet is returned if the horse is withdrawn before the race starts .",
  "/wiki/Canal_Turn": "The Canal Turn is a fence on Aintree Racecourse 's National Course and thus is jumped during the Grand National steeplechase which is held annually at the racecourse , located near Liverpool , England . Named for the Leeds & Liverpool Canal which passes alongside the racecourse at this point , it is jumped twice during the race , as the eighth and 24th fences . The fence is notable for the sharp left turn that the runners have to take as soon as they have negotiated the fence . The turn is almost 90 degrees and it is not uncommon for jockeys to become unbalanced as they change course ; unseatings and falls are common . Seven equine fatalities have been recorded at the Canal Turn in Grand Nationals since the race was first run officially in 1839 ; the most recent death was that of The Last Fling in 2002 . The Canal Turn has been the scene of a number of incidents that have had a major impact upon the outcome of the Grand National . In 1928 , the favourite and top-weight Easter Hero refused at the ditch which at the time preceded the fence ( this was filled in following the race ) . This refusal took out 20 horses . By the end of the first circuit only six horses remained in the field . By the final fence just two remained . Billy Barton fell at the last , leaving the 100/1 outsider Tipperary Tim to finish alone . Billy Barton was , however , remounted to pick up the second-place prize money .",

It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel , the Irish Sea , and St George 's Channel . Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles , the third-largest in Europe , and the twentieth-largest on Earth . Geopolitically , Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland ( officially named Ireland ) , which covers five-sixths of the island , and Northern Ireland , which is part of the United Kingdom . In 2011 , the population of Ireland was about 6.6 million , ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain . As of 2016 , 4.8 million live in the Republic of Ireland , and 1.8 million live in Northern Ireland . The geography of Ireland comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain , with several navigable rivers extending inland . Its lush vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature . Much of Ireland was woodland until the end of the Middle Ages . Today , woodland makes up about 10% of the island , compared with a European average of over 33% , and most of it is non-native conifer plantations . There are twenty-six extant land mammal species native to Ireland . The Irish climate is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and thus very moderate , and winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area , although summers are cooler than those in continental Europe .",

  "/wiki/France": "France ( French : [ f\u0281\u0251\u0303s ] ( listen ) ) , officially the French Republic ( French : R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise , pronounced [ \u0281epyblik f\u0281\u0251\u0303s\u025b\u02d0z ] ( listen ) ) , is a country whose territory consists of metropolitan France in Western Europe and several overseas regions and territories . [ XIII ] The metropolitan area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea , and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean . It is bordered by Belgium , Luxembourg and Germany to the northeast , Switzerland and Italy to the east , and Andorra and Spain to the south . The overseas territories include French Guiana in South America and several islands in the Atlantic , Pacific and Indian oceans . The country 's 18 integral regions ( five of which are situated overseas ) span a combined area of 643,801 square kilometres ( 248,573 sq mi ) and a total population of 67.02 million ( as of July 2019 [ update ] ) . France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris , the country 's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre . Other major urban areas include Lyon , Marseille , Toulouse , Bordeaux , Lille and Nice . France , including its overseas territories , has the most number of time zones of any country , with a total of 12 . During the Iron Age , what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls , a Celtic people . Rome annexed the area in 51 BC , holding it until the arrival of Germanic Franks in 476 , who formed the Kingdom of Francia . The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned Francia into East Francia , Middle Francia and West Francia . West Francia , which became the Kingdom of France in 987 , emerged as a major European power in the Late Middle Ages , following its victory in the Hundred Years ' War ( 1337-1453 ) .",

  "/wiki/The_Chair_(Aintree_Racecourse)": "The Chair is a fence on Aintree Racecourse 's National Course and thus is one of 30 that are jumped during the Grand National steeplechase which is held annually at the racecourse near Liverpool , England . It is the 15th fence that the runners jump and is one of only two ( the other being the 16th , the Water Jump ) in the race to be negotiated only once . Positioned in front of the grandstand , it is the tallest fence on the course , at 5 feet 3 inches ( 1.60 m ) , preceded by a 6 feet 0 inches ( 1.83 m ) open ditch on the takeoff side . The Chair is also comfortably the narrowest fence on the Grand National course , bar the Water Jump . The landing side of The Chair fence is actually 6 inches ( 15 cm ) above the ground on the takeoff side , creating the reverse effect to that at the Becher 's Brook fence , meaning the ground comes up to meet horse and rider sooner than anticipated . Generally it is jumped fairly safely by most horses in the Grand National field , probably due to the lengthy run they have before reaching the fence , and because , by the time the fence is approached , most of the runners have settled into a smooth running rhythm . However , it regularly claims fallers , not just in the Grand National but other races held over the course . Perhaps The Chair 's most notorious pile up occurred during the 1979 Grand National , won by Rubstic . Two loose horses veered across the main body of the field and contributed to the falls or refusals of nine horses , including Kintai who had to be euthanised as a result of injuries sustained when he was brought down . For the following year 's race , in which Ben Nevis returned and won having been one of the victims in the prior year 's pile-up , channels were installed around the fence so that loose horses reluctant to negotiate the obstacle were able to bypass it rather than jump over it . There has been no equine fatality in the Grand National at The Chair since 1979 , and only three at the fence since the race was founded in 1839 . The Chair has also claimed the life of the only human fatality in a Grand National when Joseph Wynne , the son of former winning jockey Denny Wynne , was badly injured in a fall at the fence during the 1862 running .",

  "/wiki/New_Zealand": "New Zealand ( M\u0101ori : Aotearoa [ a\u0254\u02c8t\u025ba\u027e\u0254a ] ) is a sovereign island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean . The country has two main landmasses - the North Island ( Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui ) , and the South Island ( Te Waipounamu ) - and around 600 smaller islands . It has a total land area of 268,000 square kilometres ( 103,500 sq mi ) . New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 mi ) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres ( 600 mi ) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal , fungal , and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , and its most populous city is Auckland . Sometime between 1250 and 1300 , Polynesians settled in the islands and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture . In 1642 , Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight New Zealand . In 1840 , representatives of the United Kingdom and M\u0101ori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi , which declared British sovereignty over the islands . In 1841 , New Zealand became a colony within the British Empire and in 1907 it became a dominion ; it gained full statutory independence in 1947 and the British monarch remained the head of state .",

It is jumped twice during the race , as the sixth and 22nd fence , as well as on four other occasions during the year . It has always been a notorious and controversial obstacle , because of the size and angle of the 6 ft 9in drop on the landing side . Some jockeys have compared it to jumping off the edge of the world . After the deaths of Dark Ivy in the 1987 Grand National and Seeandem and Brown Trix in the 1989 Grand National , all at Becher 's Brook , Aintree bowed to pressure from animal rights groups and undertook extensive modifications to the fence . Further changes were made after two horses , Ornais and Dooneys Gate , died during the 2011 Grand National , the latter at Becher 's . The incident involving Dooneys Gate resulted in the fence being jumped only once for the first time in the race 's history ; it was bypassed on the outside on the second circuit while veterinary staff attended to him .",
