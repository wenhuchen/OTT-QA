Animation from a crew composed mostly of people from the company 's past shows , but also with the involvement of two of the comic 's creators , Dwayne McDuffie and Denys Cowan . Static Shock had some alterations from the original comic book because it was oriented to a pre-teen audience . Nevertheless , the show approached several social issues , which was positively received by most television critics . Static Shock was nominated for numerous awards , including the Daytime Emmy . Some criticism was directed towards its jokes - which were said to be stale and too similar to the Spider-Man style - and animation , which was said to be unnatural and outdated . The series also produced some related merchandise , which sold poorly ; McDuffie cited the low sales as one of the main factors behind the series ' cancellation . In spite of this , its popularity revived interest in the original Milestone comic and introduced McDuffie to the animation industry .",
