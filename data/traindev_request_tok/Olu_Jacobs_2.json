  "/wiki/Till_Death_Us_Do_Part_(British_TV_series)": "Till Death Us Do Part is a British television sitcom that aired on BBC1 from 1965 to 1975 . The show was first broadcast as a Comedy Playhouse pilot , then in seven series until 1975 . Six years later in 1981 , ITV continued the sitcom for six episodes , calling it Till Death . The BBC produced a sequel from 1985 until 1992 , In Sickness and in Health . Created by Johnny Speight , Till Death Us Do Part centred on the East End Garnett family , led by patriarch Alf Garnett ( Warren Mitchell ) , a reactionary white working-class man who holds racist , prejudiced and anti-socialist views . His long-suffering wife Else was played by Dandy Nichols , and his daughter Rita by Una Stubbs . Rita 's husband Mike Rawlins ( Anthony Booth ) is a socialist layabout from Liverpool who frequently locks horns with Garnett . Alf Garnett became a well-known character in British culture , and Mitchell played him on stage and television until Speight 's death in 1998 . In addition to the spin-off In Sickness and in Health , Till Death Us Do Part was remade in several countries including Brazil ( A Grande Fam\u00edlia ) , Germany ( Ein Herz und eine Seele ) , and the Netherlands ( In voor- en tegenspoed [ nl ] ) , and it is the show that inspired All in the Family in the United States . Many episodes from the first three series are thought to no longer exist , having been wiped in the late 1960s and early 1970s as was the policy at the time . Although Speight said he wrote the series to challenge racism , it was felt by some critics that many people watched it because they agreed with Alf Garnett 's views . The linguist Alan Crosby has argued that the constant use of the phrase Scouse git with reference to Anthony Booth 's character spread both the word Scouse and negative stereotypes of Liverpudlians .",

In this series , Barlow was supported by Norman Comer as Detective Sergeant Rees , who had been helpful to him during the first series . He also had to deal with the political machinations of the senior civil servant Fenton ( Neil Stacy ) .
