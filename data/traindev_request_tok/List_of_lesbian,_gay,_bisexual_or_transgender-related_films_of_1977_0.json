  "/wiki/Harry_Hay": "Henry Harry Hay Jr. ( April 7 , 1912 - October 24 , 2002 ) was a prominent American gay rights activist , communist , and labor advocate . He was a founder of the Mattachine Society , the first sustained gay rights group in the United States , as well as the Radical Faeries , a loosely affiliated gay spiritual movement . Born to an upper middle class family in England , Hay was raised in Chile and California . From an early age he acknowledged his same-sex sexual attraction , and came under the influence of Marxism . Briefly studying at Stanford University , he subsequently became a professional actor in Los Angeles , where he joined the Communist Party USA , becoming a committed activist in left-wing labor and anti-racist campaigns . As a result of societal pressure , he attempted to become heterosexual by marrying a female Party activist in 1938 , with whom he adopted two children . Recognizing that he remained homosexual , his marriage ended and in 1950 he founded the Mattachine Society . Although involved in campaigns for gay rights , he resigned from the Society in 1953 . Hay 's developing belief in the cultural minority status of homosexuals led him to take a stand against the assimilationism advocated by the majority of gay rights campaigners . He subsequently became a co-founder of the Los Angeles chapter of the Gay Liberation Front in 1969 , although in 1970 he moved to New Mexico with his longtime partner John Burnside . Hay 's ongoing interest in American Indian religion led the couple to co-found the Radical Faeries in 1979 with Don Kilhefner and Mitchell L. Walker . Returning to Los Angeles , Hay remained involved in an array of activist causes throughout his life , and became a well-known , albeit controversial , elder statesman within the country 's gay community .",
