Between 2004 and March 2013 , TNA taped their broadcasts from Soundstage 21 . As part of the agreement with Universal , TNA was not allowed to charge general admission to events held at the Impact Zone , with the exception of VIP packages . This meant the company sometimes looked for alternative venues to host their large pay-per-view events . After March 2013 , TNA left Universal Studios and began to tour nationally . TNA returned to Universal Studios on November 21 , 2013 , using Soundstage 19 , which is smaller and holds fewer people than Soundstage 21 .
