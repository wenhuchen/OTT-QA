  "/wiki/Confide": "Confide is an encrypted instant messaging application for most major operating systems . It was first released in 2013 on iOS , and is known for its self-destructing messaging system that deletes messages immediately after reading . The platform offers both free and paid features for individuals and businesses . In 2017 , the news outlet Axios reported that it had gained popularity among , numerous senior GOP operatives and several members of the Trump administration . After receiving more media attention , there were concerns about the security of the app , as it is closed source and an independent review by Kudelski Security indicated it may use an older , less secure version of OpenSSL . The app 's first full security audit found multiple critical vulnerabilities including impersonating another user by hijacking an account session or by guessing a password , learning the contact details of Confide users , becoming an intermediary in a conversation and decrypting messages , and potentially altering the contents of a message or attachment in transit without first decrypting it . WIRED reported that the encryption in Confide was based on the PGP standard , and used Transport Layer Security . In January 2018 , Confide , Inc. developers announced their newly developed ScreenShieldKit SDK ( Software Development Kit ) which was originally intended only for the Confide application . The API allows developers to incorporate the same screenshot-proof functionality of Confide into their own applications by simply importing the SDK replacing UITextView and UIImageView - two commonly used iOS development components used to display data to end users . The SDK prevents screenshots by blanking out the data and supports protection from a variety of capture methods including screenshots , screen recordings , screen mirrorings , and even screenshots from Apple 's Xcode ( the main development platform for iOS ) .",

Degrees in other relevant areas , such as those in music , or any working experiences gained outside academia can also help ; for example , mixing engineers specialized in classical music may benefit from experience in performing in an orchestra to create better recordings . Two primary categories comprise the population of sound mixers : the live sound mixer , who practice live sound mixing , and the studio mixer , whose work is done inside a tuned studio instead . Gear and equipment may slightly differ between the two industries but , universally , a well-trained ear , practice on complex audio equipment , and a thorough grasp of the techniques used to create good sound distinguish the superior mixing engineer .
