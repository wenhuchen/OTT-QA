He reshaped Bengali literature and music , as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Author of the profoundly sensitive , fresh and beautiful verse of Gitanjali , he became in 1913 the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature . Tagore 's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial ; however , his elegant prose and magical poetry remain largely unknown outside Bengal . He is sometimes referred to as the Bard of Bengal . A Brahmo Hindu from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan District and Jessore , Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old . At the age of sixteen , he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bh\u0101nusi\u1e43ha ( Sun Lion ) , which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics . By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas , published under his real name . As a humanist , universalist , internationalist , and ardent anti-nationalist , he denounced the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain . As an exponent of the Bengal Renaissance , he advanced a vast canon that comprised paintings , sketches and doodles , hundreds of texts , and some two thousand songs ; his legacy also endures in the institution he founded , Visva-Bharati University . Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and resisting linguistic strictures . His novels , stories , songs , dance-dramas , and essays spoke to topics political and personal .",

A futurist , he wrote a number of utopian works and foresaw the advent of aircraft , tanks , space travel , nuclear weapons , satellite television and something resembling the World Wide Web . His science fiction imagined time travel , alien invasion , invisibility , and biological engineering . Brian Aldiss referred to Wells as the Shakespeare of science fiction . Wells rendered his works convincing by instilling commonplace detail alongside a single extraordinary assumption - dubbed Wellss law - leading Joseph Conrad to hail him in 1898 as O Realist of the Fantastic ! . His most notable science fiction works include The Time Machine ( 1895 ) , The Island of Doctor Moreau ( 1896 ) , The Invisible Man ( 1897 ) , The War of the Worlds ( 1898 ) and the military science fiction The War in the Air ( 1907 ) . Wells was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times . Wells 's earliest specialised training was in biology , and his thinking on ethical matters took place in a specifically and fundamentally Darwinian context . He was also from an early date an outspoken socialist , often ( but not always , as at the beginning of the First World War ) sympathising with pacifist views .",
