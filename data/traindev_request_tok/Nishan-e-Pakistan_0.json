It is the world 's sixth-most populous country with a population exceeding 207.8 million . In area , it is the 33rd-largest country , spanning 881,913 square kilometres ( 340,509 square miles ) . Pakistan has a 1,046-kilometre ( 650-mile ) coastline along the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east , Afghanistan to the west , Iran to the southwest , and China in the northeast . It is separated narrowly from Tajikistan by Afghanistan 's Wakhan Corridor in the northwest , and also shares a maritime border with Oman . The territory that now constitutes Pakistan was the site of several ancient cultures and intertwined with the history of the broader Indian subcontinent . The ancient history involves the Neolithic site of Mehrgarh and the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilisation , and was later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures , including Hindus , Indo-Greeks , Muslims , Turco-Mongols , Afghans and Sikhs . The area has been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties , including the Persian Achaemenid Empire , Alexander III of Macedon , the Seleucid Empire , the Indian Maurya Empire , the Gupta Empire , the Arab Umayyad Caliphate , the Delhi Sultanate , the Mongol Empire , the Mughal Empire , the Afghan Durrani Empire , the Sikh Empire ( partially ) and , most recently , the British Indian Empire . Pakistan is the only country to have been created in the name of Islam . It is an ethnically and linguistically diverse country , with similarly diverse geography and wildlife . Initially a dominion , Pakistan adopted a constitution in 1956 , becoming an Islamic republic . An ethnic civil war and Indian military intervention in 1971 resulted in the secession of East Pakistan as the new country of Bangladesh .",

  "/wiki/Microfinance": "Microfinance is a category of financial services targeting individuals and small businesses who lack access to conventional banking and related services . Microfinance includes microcredit , the provision of small loans to poor clients ; savings and checking accounts ; microinsurance ; and payment systems . Microfinance services are designed to reach excluded customers , usually poorer population segments , possibly socially marginalized , or geographically more isolated , and to help them become self-sufficient . Microfinance initially had a limited definition - the provision of microloans to poor entrepreneurs and small businesses lacking access to credit . The two main mechanisms for the delivery of financial services to such clients were : ( 1 ) relationship-based banking for individual entrepreneurs and small businesses ; and ( 2 ) group-based models , where several entrepreneurs come together to apply for loans and other services as a group . Over time , microfinance has emerged as a larger movement whose object is a world in which as everyone , especially the poor and socially marginalized people and households have access to a wide range of affordable , high quality financial products and services , including not just credit but also savings , insurance , payment services , and fund transfers . Proponents of microfinance often claim that such access will help poor people out of poverty , including participants in the Microcredit Summit Campaign . For many , microfinance is a way to promote economic development , employment and growth through the support of micro-entrepreneurs and small businesses ; for others it is a way for the poor to manage their finances more effectively and take advantage of economic opportunities while managing the risks . Critics often point to some of the ills of micro-credit that can create indebtedness . Due to diverse contexts in which microfinance operates , and the broad range of microfinance services , it is neither possible nor wise to have a generalized view of impacts microfinance may create . Many studies have tried to assess its impacts .",
  "/wiki/Rural_development": "Rural development is the process of improving the quality of life and economic well-being of people living in rural areas , often relatively isolated and sparsely populated areas . Rural development has traditionally centered on the exploitation of land-intensive natural resources such as agriculture and forestry . However , changes in global production networks and increased urbanization have changed the character of rural areas . Increasingly tourism , niche manufacturers , and recreation have replaced resource extraction and agriculture as dominant economic drivers . The need for rural communities to approach development from a wider perspective has created more focus on a broad range of development goals rather than merely creating incentive for agricultural or resource based businesses . Education , entrepreneurship , physical infrastructure , and social infrastructure all play an important role in developing rural regions . Rural development is also characterized by its emphasis on locally produced economic development strategies . In contrast to urban regions , which have many similarities , rural areas are highly distinctive from one another . For this reason there are a large variety of rural development approaches used globally . Rural development is a comprehensive term . It essentially focuses on action for the development of areas outside the mainstream urban economic system . we should think of what type of rural development is needed because modernization of village leads to urbanization and village environment disappears .",

Drafted by the government of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto , with additional assistance from the country 's opposition parties , it was approved by the Parliament on 10 April and ratified on 14 August 1973 . The Constitution is intended to guide Pakistan 's law , its political culture , and system . It identifies the state ( its physical existence and its borders ) , people and their fundamental rights , state 's constitutional law and orders , and also the constitutional structure and establishment of the institutions and the country 's armed forces . The first three chapters establish the rules , mandate , and separate powers of the three branches of the government : a bicameral legislature ; an executive branch governed by the Prime Minister as chief executive ; and an apex federal judiciary headed by Supreme Court . The Constitution designates the President of Pakistan as a ceremonial Head of State who is to represent the unity of the state . The first six articles of the constitution outline the political system as federal parliamentary republic system ; as well as Islam as its state religion . The Constitution also encapsulates provisions stipulating the legal system 's compliance with Islamic injunctions contained in the Quran and Sunnah . The Parliament can not make any laws which may be repugnant or contrary to the Constitution , however the Constitution itself may be amended by a two-thirds majority in both the houses of the bicameral Parliament , unlike the previous legal documents of 1956 and 1962 . It has been amended over time , and most recent impulses for political upgrades and reforms has been amended . Although enforced in 1973 , Pakistan , however , celebrates the adoption of the constitution on 23 March - when the first set was promulgated in 1956 - each and every year as Republic Day .",

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories .

  "/wiki/Rowan_Douglas_Williams": "Rowan Douglas Williams , Baron Williams of Oystermouth , PC , FBA , FRSL , FLSW ( born 14 June 1950 ) , is a Welsh Anglican bishop , theologian and poet . He was the 104th Archbishop of Canterbury , a position he held from December 2002 to December 2012 . Previously the Bishop of Monmouth and Archbishop of Wales , Williams was the first Archbishop of Canterbury in modern times not to be appointed from within the Church of England . Williams ' primacy was marked by speculation that the Anglican Communion ( in which the Archbishop of Canterbury is the leading figure ) was on the verge of fragmentation over disagreements on contemporary issues such as homosexuality and the ordination of women . Williams worked to keep all sides talking to one another . Notable events during his time as Archbishop of Canterbury include the rejection by a majority of dioceses of his proposed Anglican Covenant and , in the final General Synod of his tenure , his unsuccessful attempt to secure a sufficient majority for a measure to allow the appointment of women as bishops in the Church of England . Having spent much of his earlier career as an academic at the universities of Cambridge and Oxford successively , Williams speaks three languages and reads at least nine . After standing down as Archbishop , Williams took up the positions of Master of Magdalene College , Cambridge , in 2013 , and Chancellor of the University of South Wales in 2014 . He also delivered the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh in 2013 . Justin Welby succeeded Williams as Archbishop of Canterbury on 9 November 2012 , being enthroned in March 2013 . On 26 December 2012 , 10 Downing St announced Williams ' elevation to the peerage as a life baron , so that he could continue to speak in the Upper House of Parliament . Following the creation of his title on 8 January and its gazetting on 11 January 2013 , he was introduced to the temporal benches of the House of Lords as Baron Williams of Oystermouth on 15 January 2013 , sitting as a crossbencher .",
  "/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury": "The Archbishop of Canterbury is the senior bishop and principal leader of the Church of England , the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion and the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Canterbury . The current archbishop is Justin Welby , who was enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral on 21 March 2013 . Welby is the 105th in a line which goes back more than 1400 years to Augustine of Canterbury , the Apostle to the English , sent from Rome in the year 597 . Welby succeeded Rowan Williams . From the time of Augustine until the 16th century , the archbishops of Canterbury were in full communion with the See of Rome and usually received the pallium from the Pope . During the English Reformation , the Church of England broke away from the authority of the Pope . Thomas Cranmer became the first holder of the office following the English Reformation in 1533 , while Reginald Pole was the last Roman Catholic in the position , serving from 1556 to 1558 during the Counter-Reformation . In the Middle Ages there was considerable variation in the methods of nomination of the Archbishop of Canterbury and other bishops . At various times the choice was made by the canons of Canterbury Cathedral , the Pope , or the King of England . Since the English Reformation , the Church of England has been more explicitly a state church and the choice is legally that of the Crown ; today it is made by the reigning monarch on the advice of the British prime minister , who in turn receives a shortlist of two names from an ad hoc committee called the Crown Nominations Commission ."
