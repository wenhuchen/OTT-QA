Although always much less popular than the VFL/AFL , the VFA enjoyed peaks of popularity in the 1940s with a faster-paced rival code of rules , and in the 1970s bolstered by playing on Sundays at a time when the VFL was played solely on Saturdays . Since 1995 , the league has been administered by AFL Victoria ( and its predecessors ) , and serves as one of the second-tier regional Australian semi-professional competitions which sits underneath the fully professional Australian Football League .

It has a total of 1.7 million people , and its population is the second most highly centralised in Australia , after Western Australia , with more than 77 percent of South Australians living in the capital , Adelaide , or its environs . Other population centres in the state are relatively small ; Mount Gambier , the second largest centre , has a population of 28,684 . South Australia shares borders with all of the other mainland states , and with the Northern Territory ; it is bordered to the west by Western Australia , to the north by the Northern Territory , to the north-east by Queensland , to the east by New South Wales , to the south-east by Victoria , and to the south by the Great Australian Bight . The state comprises less than 8 percent of the Australian population and ranks fifth in population among the six states and two territories . The majority of its people reside in greater Metropolitan Adelaide . Most of the remainder are settled in fertile areas along the south-eastern coast and River Murray . The state 's colonial origins are unique in Australia as a freely settled , planned British province , rather than as a convict settlement . Colonial government commenced on 28 December 1836 , when the members of the council were sworn in near the Old Gum Tree . [ citation needed ] As with the rest of the continent , the region has a long history of human occupation by numerous tribes and languages .",
  "/wiki/SANFL": "The South Australian National Football League , or SANFL ( /\u02c8s\u00e6nf\u0259l/ or S-A-N-F-L ) , is an Australian rules football league based in the Australian state of South Australia . It is also the governing body for the sport of Australian rules football in South Australia . Originally formed as the South Australian Football Association on 30 April 1877 , the SANFL is the oldest surviving football league of any code in Australia and one of the oldest football competitions in the world , forming just a few years after the United Hospitals Challenge Cup ( 1874 ) , the oldest rugby football competition , and over a decade before The Football League , although later than the FA Cup ( soccer ) . Consisting of a single division competition , since 2014 the season has been an 18-round home-and-away ( regular ) season from April to September . The top five teams play-off in a final series culminating in the grand final for the Thomas Seymour Hill Premiership Trophy . The grand final had traditionally been held at Football Park in October , generally the week after the AFL Grand Final , though this was altered ahead of the 2014 season resulting in Adelaide Oval hosting the grand final in the penultimate weekend of September . The league owned the sub-licences for South Australia 's two AFL clubs - Adelaide Football Club and Port Adelaide Football Club until March 2014 , when South Australian Football Commission reached an agreement with the Adelaide and Port Adelaide football clubs - endorsed by the AFL - which will see the two AFL licences transferred to the clubs in return for payments totalling more than $ 18 million . The league is also responsible for the management of all levels of football in the state . This includes junior football , country football , amateur football and specific programs rolled out across schools , indigenous communities ( including the APY Lands in the state 's north ) and newly arrived migrant communities . The SANFL owns Football Park , formerly the largest stadium in South Australia . The stadium , which opened in 1974 , was primarily used for Australian Football League matches up until 2013 and had a capacity of over 51,000 prior to being demolished . The stadium was the headquarters for the league from 1974-2013 .",

  "/wiki/Ballarat": "Ballarat /\u02c8b\u00e6l\u0259\u02ccr\u00e6t/ is a city located on the Yarrowee River in the Central Highlands of Victoria , Australia . The city has a population of 105,471 . In terms of population Ballarat is the third largest inland city in Australia . Just months after Victoria was granted separation from the state of New South Wales , the Victorian gold rush transformed Ballarat from a small sheep station to a major settlement . Gold was discovered on 18 August 1851 , and news quickly spread of rich alluvial fields where gold could easily be extracted . Unlike many other gold boom towns , the Ballarat fields experienced sustained high gold yields for many decades , which can be evidenced to this day in the city 's rich architecture . The city is famous for the 1854 tax-revolt known as the Eureka Rebellion . In response to this event the first male suffrage in Australia was instituted and as such Eureka is interpreted by some as the origin of democracy in Australia . The rebellion 's symbol , the Eureka Flag , has become a national symbol and is held at the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka in Ballarat . Proclaimed a city in 1871 , its prosperity continued until late in the 19th century , after which its importance relative to both Melbourne and Geelong rapidly faded with the slowing of gold extraction . It has endured as a major regional centre hosting the rowing and kayaking events from the 1956 Summer Olympics . It is the commercial capital of the Central Highlands and its largest city , as well as a significant tourist destination .",
  "/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)": "Victoria ( abbreviated as Vic ) is a state in south-eastern Australia . Victoria is Australia 's smallest mainland state and its second-most populous state ( after New South Wales ) , making it the most densely populated state . Most of its population lives concentrated in the area surrounding Port Phillip Bay , which includes the metropolitan area of its state capital and largest city , Melbourne , Australia 's second-largest city . Victoria is bordered by Bass Strait and Tasmania to the south , [ note 1 ] New South Wales to the north , the Tasman Sea ( a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean ) to the east , and South Australia to the west . The area that is now known as Victoria is the home of many Aboriginal people groups , including the Boon wurrung , the Bratauolung , the Djadjawurrung , the Gunai/Kurnai , the Gunditjmara , the Taungurong , the Wathaurong , the Wurundjeri , and the Yorta Yorta . There were more than 30 Aboriginal languages spoken in the area prior to the European settlement of Australia . The Kulin nation is an alliance of five Aboriginal nations which makes up much of the central part of the state . With Great Britain having claimed the half of the Australian continent that is east of the 135th meridian east in 1788 , Victoria formed part of the wider colony of New South Wales . The first European settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay , and much of what is now Victoria was included in 1836 in the Port Phillip District , an administrative division of New South Wales . Named in honour of Queen Victoria , who signed the division 's separation from New South Wales , the colony was officially established in 1851 and achieved self government in 1855 . The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony , and by the time of the Federation of Australia in 1901 , Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in Australasia . Melbourne served as federal capital of Australia until the construction of Canberra in 1927 , with the Federal Parliament meeting in Melbourne 's Parliament House and all principal offices of the federal government being based in Melbourne .",

The archaeological history of the Northern Territory begins over 40,000 years ago when Indigenous Australians settled the region . Makassan traders began trading with the indigenous people of the Northern Territory for trepang from at least the 18th century onwards . The coast of the territory was first seen by Europeans in the 17th century . The British were the first Europeans to attempt to settle the coastal regions . After three failed attempts to establish a settlement ( 1824-28 , 1838-49 , and 1864-66 ) , success was achieved in 1869 with the establishment of a settlement at Port Darwin . Today the economy is based on tourism , especially Kakadu National Park in the Top End and the Ulu\u1e5fu-Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park ( Ayers Rock ) in central Australia , and mining .
