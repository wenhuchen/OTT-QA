Its name refers to an urban agglomeration of 9,993 km2 ( 3,858 sq mi ) , comprising a metropolitan area with 31 municipalities , and is also the common name for its city centre . The city occupies much of the coastline of Port Phillip bay and spreads into the hinterlands towards the Dandenong and Macedon ranges , Mornington Peninsula and Yarra Valley . It has a population of 5 million ( 19% of the population of Australia ) , and its inhabitants are referred to as Melburnians . [ note 2 ] The city was founded on 30 August 1835 , in the then-British colony of New South Wales , by free settlers from the colony of Van Diemens Land ( modern-day Tasmania ) . It was incorporated as a Crown settlement in 1837 , and named Melbourne by Governor General Richard Bourke on 10 April 1837 in honour of the British Prime Minister , William Lamb , 2nd Viscount Melbourne . In 1851 , four years after Queen Victoria declared it a city , Melbourne became the capital of the new colony of Victoria . In the wake of the 1850s Victorian gold rush , the city entered a lengthy boom period that , by the late 1880s , had transformed it into one of the world 's largest and wealthiest metropolises . After the federation of Australia in 1901 , it served as interim seat of government of the new nation until Canberra became the permanent capital in 1927 . Today , it is a leading financial centre in the Asia-Pacific region and ranks 15th in the Global Financial Centres Index . Melbourne is home to many of Australia 's best-known landmarks , such as the Melbourne Cricket Ground , the National Gallery of Victoria and the World Heritage-listed Royal Exhibition Building . It is also the birthplace of Australian impressionism , Australian rules football , and the Australian film and television industries .",
  "/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)": "Victoria ( abbreviated as Vic ) is a state in south-eastern Australia . Victoria is Australia 's smallest mainland state and its second-most populous state ( after New South Wales ) , making it the most densely populated state . Most of its population lives concentrated in the area surrounding Port Phillip Bay , which includes the metropolitan area of its state capital and largest city , Melbourne , Australia 's second-largest city . Victoria is bordered by Bass Strait and Tasmania to the south , [ note 1 ] New South Wales to the north , the Tasman Sea ( a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean ) to the east , and South Australia to the west . The area that is now known as Victoria is the home of many Aboriginal people groups , including the Boon wurrung , the Bratauolung , the Djadjawurrung , the Gunai/Kurnai , the Gunditjmara , the Taungurong , the Wathaurong , the Wurundjeri , and the Yorta Yorta . There were more than 30 Aboriginal languages spoken in the area prior to the European settlement of Australia . The Kulin nation is an alliance of five Aboriginal nations which makes up much of the central part of the state . With Great Britain having claimed the half of the Australian continent that is east of the 135th meridian east in 1788 , Victoria formed part of the wider colony of New South Wales . The first European settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay , and much of what is now Victoria was included in 1836 in the Port Phillip District , an administrative division of New South Wales . Named in honour of Queen Victoria , who signed the division 's separation from New South Wales , the colony was officially established in 1851 and achieved self government in 1855 . The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony , and by the time of the Federation of Australia in 1901 , Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in Australasia . Melbourne served as federal capital of Australia until the construction of Canberra in 1927 , with the Federal Parliament meeting in Melbourne 's Parliament House and all principal offices of the federal government being based in Melbourne .",
  "/wiki/Adelaide": "Adelaide ( /\u02c8\u00e6d\u0259le\u026ad/ ( listen ) AD-\u0259-layd ) is the capital city of the state of South Australia , and the fifth-most populous city of Australia . The demonym Adelaidean is used to denote the city and the residents of Adelaide . Adelaide is situated on the Adelaide Plains north of the Fleurieu Peninsula , between the Gulf St Vincent in the west and the Mount Lofty Ranges in the east . Its metropolitan area extends 20 km ( 12 mi ) from the coast to the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges , and stretches 96 km ( 60 mi ) from Gawler in the north to Sellicks Beach in the south . Named in honour of Queen Adelaide , consort to King William IV , the city was founded in 1836 as the planned capital for the only freely-settled British province in Australia . Colonel William Light , one of Adelaide 's founding fathers , designed the city centre and chose its location close to the River Torrens , in the area originally inhabited by the Kaurna people and known as Tarndanyangga ( place of the red kangaroo ) . Light 's design , now listed as national heritage , set out the city centre in a grid layout , interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares , and entirely surrounded by parklands . Early colonial Adelaide was shaped by the diversity and wealth of its free settlers , in contrast to the convict history of other Australian cities . Until the post-war era , it was Australia 's third-largest city . It has been noted for its leading examples of religious freedom and progressive political reforms , and became known as the City of Churches due to its diversity of faiths . Today , Adelaide is noted for its many festivals and sporting events , its food and wine , its coastline and hills , and its large defence and manufacturing sectors . Adelaide 's quality of life has ranked consistently highly in various measures through the 21st century .",

Indigenous Australians have inhabited the Sydney area for at least 30,000 years , and thousands of engravings remain throughout the region , making it one of the richest in Australia in terms of Aboriginal archaeological sites . During his first Pacific voyage in 1770 , Lieutenant James Cook and his crew became the first Europeans to chart the eastern coast of Australia , making landfall at Botany Bay and inspiring British interest in the area . In 1788 , the First Fleet of convicts , led by Arthur Phillip , founded Sydney as a British penal colony , the first European settlement in Australia . Phillip named the city Sydney in recognition of Thomas Townshend , 1st Viscount Sydney . Penal transportation to New South Wales ended soon after Sydney was incorporated as a city in 1842 . A gold rush occurred in the colony in 1851 , and over the next century , Sydney transformed from a colonial outpost into a major global cultural and economic centre . After World War II , it experienced mass migration and became one of the most multicultural cities in the world .",

The city is located in the state 's south-east on the estuary of the River Derwent , making it the most southern of Australia 's capital cities . Its skyline is dominated by the 1,271-metre ( 4,170 ft ) Mount Wellington , and its harbour forms the second-deepest natural port in the world , with much of the city 's waterfront consisting of reclaimed land . The metropolitan area is often referred to as Greater Hobart , to differentiate it from the City of Hobart , one of the five local government areas that cover the city . Founded in 1804 as a British penal colony , Hobart is Australia 's second oldest capital city after Sydney , New South Wales . Prior to British settlement , the Hobart area had been occupied for possibly as long as 35,000 years , by the semi-nomadic Mouheneener tribe , a sub-group of the Nuennone , or South-East tribe .

Penal transportation ended in the 1850s , after which the city experienced periods of growth and decline . The early 20th century saw an economic boom on the back of mining , agriculture and other primary industries , and the loss of men who served in the world wars was counteracted by an influx of immigration .

Perth is part of the South West Land Division of Western Australia , with most of the metropolitan area on the Swan Coastal Plain , a narrow strip between the Indian Ocean and the Darling Scarp . The first areas settled were on the Swan River at Guildford , with the city 's central business district and port ( Fremantle ) both later founded downriver . Captain James Stirling founded Perth in 1829 as the administrative centre of the Swan River Colony . It gained city status ( currently vested in the smaller City of Perth ) in 1856 and was promoted to the status of a Lord Mayorality in 1929 . The city inherited its name due to the influence of Sir George Murray , then Member of Parliament for Perthshire and Secretary of State for War and the Colonies . The city 's population increased substantially as a result of the Western Australian gold rushes in the late 19th century . During Australia 's involvement in World War II , Fremantle served as a base for submarines operating in the Pacific Theatre , and a US Navy Catalina flying boat fleet was based at Matilda Bay . An influx of immigrants after the war , predominantly from Britain , Italy , Greece , and Yugoslavia , led to rapid population growth . This was followed by a surge in economic activity flowing from several mining booms in the late 20th and early 21st centuries that saw Perth become the regional headquarters for several large mining operations . As part of Perth 's role as the capital of Western Australia , the state 's Parliament and Supreme Court are in the city , as is Government House , the residence of the Governor of Western Australia .",

The first European visitor to Western Australia was the Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog , who visited the Western Australian coast in 1616 . The first European settlement of Western Australia occurred following the landing by Major Edmund Lockyer on 26 December 1826 of an expedition on behalf of the New South Wales colonial government . He established a convict-supported military garrison at King George III Sound , at present-day Albany , and on 21 January 1827 formally took possession of the western third of the continent for the British Crown . This was followed by the establishment of the Swan River Colony in 1829 , including the site of the present-day capital , Perth . York was the first inland settlement in Western Australia . Situated 97 kilometres ( 60 miles ) east of Perth , it was settled on 16 September 1831 . Western Australia achieved responsible government in 1890 and federated with the other British colonies in Australia in 1901 .
