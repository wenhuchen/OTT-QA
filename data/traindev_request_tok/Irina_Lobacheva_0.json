  "/wiki/Original_dance": "The original dance ( OD ) was one of the programs performed by figure skaters in ice dance competitions , in which the ice dancers skated a dance of their own creation to dance music they have selected for the designated rhythm ( s ) . It was normally the second of three programs in the competition , sandwiched between the compulsory dance ( CD ) and the free dance ( FD ) . The rhythm ( s ) and type of music required for the OD changed every season , and were selected by the International Skating Union ( ISU ) before the start of the season . The ice dancers were free to choose their own music and choreography ( within the specified constraints ) and to create their own routines . They were judged on a set of required criteria , including skating skills and how well they interpreted the music and the rhythm . The ISU voted in 2010 to discontinue the OD , along with the CD , and to introduce the short dance ( SD ) as a replacement . Accordingly , after the 2009-2010 season , the ice dance competition structure was changed and the original dance was removed from all ISU junior and senior level competitions .",

  "/wiki/The_Blue_Danube": "The Blue Danube is the common English title of , Op . 314 ( German for On the Beautiful Blue Danube ) , a waltz by the Austrian composer Johann Strauss II , composed in 1866 . Originally performed on 15 February 1867 at a concert of the ( Vienna Men 's Choral Association ) , it has been one of the most consistently popular pieces of music in the classical repertoire . Its initial performance was considered only a mild success , however , and Strauss is reputed to have said , The devil take the waltz , my only regret is for the coda - I wish that had been a success ! After the original music was written , the words were added by the Choral Association 's poet , Joseph Weyl . Strauss later added more music , and Weyl needed to change some of the words . Strauss adapted it into a purely orchestral version for the 1867 Paris World 's Fair , and it became a great success in this form . The instrumental version is by far the most commonly performed today . An alternate text was written by Franz von Gernerth , ( Danube so blue ) . The Blue Danube premiered in the United States in its instrumental version on 1 July 1867 in New York , and in Great Britain in its choral version on 21 September 1867 in London at the promenade concerts at Covent Garden .

Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century , he is often referred to as the King of Rock and Roll or simply The King . Presley was born in Tupelo , Mississippi , and relocated to Memphis , Tennessee , with his family when he was 13 years old . His music career began there in 1954 , recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips , who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience . Presley , on rhythm acoustic guitar , and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black , was a pioneer of rockabilly , an uptempo , backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues . In 1955 , drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley 's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker , who would manage him for more than two decades . Presley 's first RCA single , Heartbreak Hotel , was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States . With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records , he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll . His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style , combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations , made him enormously popular - and controversial . In November 1956 , Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender . Drafted into military service in 1958 , Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work . He held few concerts however , and guided by Parker , proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums , most of them critically derided .",

  "/wiki/Toccata_and_Fugue_in_D_minor,_BWV_565": "The Toccata and Fugue in D minor , BWV 565 , is a piece of organ music written , according to its oldest extant sources , by Johann Sebastian Bach . The piece opens with a toccata section , followed by a fugue that ends in a coda . It is one of the most famous works in the organ repertoire . Scholars differ as to when it was composed . It could have been as early as 1704 ( when the presumed composer was still in his teens ) , which would be one explanation for the unusual features ; alternatively a date as late as the 1750s has been suggested ( Bach died in 1750 ) . To a large extent the piece conforms to the characteristics deemed typical for the north German organ school of the baroque era with divergent stylistic influences , such as south German characteristics . Despite a profusion of educated guesswork , there is not much that can be said with certainty about the first century of the composition 's existence other than that it survived that period in a manuscript written by Johannes Ringk . The first publication of the piece , in the Bach Revival era , was in 1833 , through the efforts of Felix Mendelssohn , who also performed the piece in an acclaimed concert in 1840 . Familiarity with the piece was enhanced in the second half of the 19th century by a fairly successful piano version by Carl Tausig , but it was not until the 20th century that its popularity rose above that of other organ compositions by Bach . That popularity further increased , due for example to its inclusion in Walt Disney 's Fantasia ( in Stokowski 's orchestral transcription ) , until this composition came to be considered the most famous work in the organ repertoire . A wide , and often conflicting , variety of analyses has been published about the piece : for instance , in literature on organ music , it is often described as some sort of program music depicting a storm , while in the context of Disney 's Fantasia , it was promoted as absolute music , nothing like program music depicting a storm . In the last quarter of the 20th century , scholars such as Peter Williams and Rolf-Dietrich Claus published their studies on the piece , and argued against its authenticity .",
  "/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach": "Johann Sebastian Bach [ a ] ( 31 March [ O.S . 21 March ] 1685 - 28 July 1750 ) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period . He is known for instrumental compositions such as the Brandenburg Concertos and the Goldberg Variations , and for vocal music such as the St Matthew Passion and the Mass in B minor . Since the 19th-century Bach Revival he has generally been regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time . The Bach family already counted several composers when Johann Sebastian was born as the last child of a city musician in Eisenach . After being orphaned at age 10 , he lived for five years with his eldest brother Johann Christoph , after which he continued his musical formation in L\u00fcneburg . From 1703 he was back in Thuringia , working as a musician for Protestant churches in Arnstadt and M\u00fchlhausen and , for longer stretches of time , at courts in Weimar , where he expanded his organ repertory , and K\u00f6then , where he was mostly engaged with chamber music . From 1723 he was employed as Thomaskantor ( cantor at St. Thomas ) in Leipzig . He composed music for the principal Lutheran churches of the city , and for its university 's student ensemble Collegium Musicum . From 1726 he published some of his keyboard and organ music . In Leipzig , as had happened during some of his earlier positions , he had difficult relations with his employer , a situation that was little remedied when he was granted the title of court composer by his sovereign , Augustus , Elector of Saxony and King of Poland , in 1736 . In the last decades of his life he reworked and extended many of his earlier compositions .",
  "/wiki/Jesus_Christ_Superstar": "Jesus Christ Superstar is a 1970 rock opera with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice . The musical started as a rock opera concept album before its Broadway debut in 1971 . The musical is mostly sung-through , with little spoken dialogue . The story is loosely based on the Gospels ' accounts of the last week of Jesus ' life , beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his disciples in Jerusalem and ending with the crucifixion . It depicts political and interpersonal struggles between Judas Iscariot and Jesus that are not present in the Bible . The work 's depiction offers a free interpretation of the psychology of Jesus and other characters . Much of the plot centers on Judas , who is dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples . Contemporary attitudes , sensibilities , and slang pervade the rock-opera 's lyrics , and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events . Stage and film productions accordingly contain many intentional anachronisms .",

During the composer 's lifetime , the operetta enjoyed great success , second only to the popularity of Die Fledermaus . The scoring and the nature of Strauss 's music have also led many music critics to consider this work a comic opera or a lyric opera . Its genesis was rather swift and smooth , as Strauss was no stranger to the Hungarian influences apparent in the music score . Many of his earlier works also bore many similar themes , such as the polka \u00c9ljen a Magyar ! ( Long live the Hungarians ! ) , Op . 332 . Originally , Strauss and Schnitzer intended the operetta as an opera but further revisions were made and the idea of a comic opera was conceived . Strauss 's work on the operetta was interrupted in autumn 1883 due to nicotine poisoning and fainting fits and he was to recuperate in Franzensbad . Strauss work on the act 3 of the work was also interrupted when his third wife , Adele Strauss , was taken ill and the couple left for Ostend .",

Born in Hamburg into a Lutheran family , Brahms spent much of his professional life in Vienna . His reputation and status as a composer are such that he is sometimes grouped with Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven as one of the Three Bs of music , a comment originally made by the nineteenth-century conductor Hans von B\u00fclow . Brahms composed for symphony orchestra , chamber ensembles , piano , organ , and voice and chorus . A virtuoso pianist , he premiered many of his own works . He worked with some of the leading performers of his time , including the pianist Clara Schumann and the violinist Joseph Joachim ( the three were close friends ) . Many of his works have become staples of the modern concert repertoire . An uncompromising perfectionist , Brahms destroyed some of his works and left others unpublished . Brahms has been considered , by his contemporaries and by later writers , as both a traditionalist and an innovator . His music is firmly rooted in the structures and compositional techniques of the Classical masters . While many contemporaries found his music too academic , his contribution and craftsmanship have been admired by subsequent figures as diverse as Arnold Schoenberg and Edward Elgar . The diligent , highly constructed nature of Brahms 's works was a starting point and an inspiration for a generation of composers ."
