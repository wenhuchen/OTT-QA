  "/wiki/Tomorrowland": "Tomorrowland is one of the many themed lands featured at all of the Magic Kingdom styled Disney theme parks around the world owned or licensed by The Walt Disney Company . Each version of the land is different and features numerous attractions that depict views of the future . Disneyland Park in Paris includes a similar area called Discoveryland , which shares some elements with other Tomorrowlands but emphasizes visions of the future inspired by Jules Verne . Walt Disney was known for his futurist views and , through his television programs , showed the American public how the world was moving into the future . Tomorrowland was the realized culmination of his views . In his own words : Tomorrow can be a wonderful age . Our scientists today are opening the doors of the Space Age to achievements that will benefit our children and generations to come . The Tomorrowland attractions have been designed to give you an opportunity to participate in adventures that are a living blueprint of our future . It is this movement into the future that has , on occasion , left Tomorrowland mired in the past . Disneyland 's Tomorrowland is now in its third generation , and the Magic Kingdom 's Tomorrowland is in its second . The Walt Disney Company has mentioned that it wanted to keep Tomorrowland from becoming Yesterdayland . As a self-referential joke along this line , the 2007 Walt Disney Animation Studios film Meet the Robinsons ( which is set mainly in the year 2037 ) features an amusement park called Todayland , which has rides that look similar to Space Mountain and Disneyland 's original Rocket Jets .",
  "/wiki/Disneyland": "Disneyland Park , originally Disneyland , is the first of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim , California , opened on July 17 , 1955 . It is the only theme park designed and built to completion under the direct supervision of Walt Disney . It was originally the only attraction on the property ; its official name was changed to Disneyland Park to distinguish it from the expanding complex in the 1990s . It is the oldest Disney Park in the world . Walt Disney came up with the concept of Disneyland after visiting various amusement parks with his daughters in the 1930s and 1940s . He initially envisioned building a tourist attraction adjacent to his studios in Burbank to entertain fans who wished to visit ; however , he soon realized that the proposed site was too small . After hiring a consultant to help him determine an appropriate site for his project , Disney bought a 160-acre ( 65 ha ) site near Anaheim in 1953 . Construction began in 1954 and the park was unveiled during a special televised press event on the ABC Television Network on July 17 , 1955 . Since its opening , Disneyland has undergone expansions and major renovations , including the addition of New Orleans Square in 1966 , Bear Country ( now Critter Country ) in 1972 , Mickey 's Toontown in 1993 , and Star Wars : Galaxy 's Edge in 2019 . Opened in 2001 , Disney California Adventure Park was built on the site of Disneyland 's original parking lot . Disneyland has a larger cumulative attendance than any other theme park in the world , with 726 million visits since it opened ( as of December 2018 ) . In 2018 , the park had approximately 18.6 million visits , making it the second most visited amusement park in the world that year , behind only Magic Kingdom , the very park it inspired .",
