A Rite is a progressive series of degrees conferred by various Masonic organizations or bodies , each of which operates under the control of its own central authority . In the Scottish Rite the central authority is called a Supreme Council . The Scottish Rite is one of the appendant bodies of Freemasonry that a Master Mason may join for further exposure to the principles of Freemasonry . It is also concordant , in that some of its degrees relate to the degrees of Symbolic ( Craft ) Freemasonry . In England and some other countries , while the Scottish Rite is not accorded official recognition by the Grand Lodge , only a recognised Freemason may join and there is no prohibition against his doing so . In the United States , however , the Scottish Rite is officially recognized by Grand Lodges as an extension of the degrees of Freemasonry . The Scottish Rite builds upon the ethical teachings and philosophy offered in the Craft ( or Blue ) Lodge , through dramatic presentation of the individual degrees ."
