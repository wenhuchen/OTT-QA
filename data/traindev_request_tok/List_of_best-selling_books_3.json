Covey presents an approach to being effective in attaining goals by aligning oneself to what he calls true north principles based on a character ethic that he presents as universal and timeless . Covey defines effectiveness as the balance of obtaining desirable results with caring for that which produces those results . He illustrates this by referring to the fable of the goose that laid the golden eggs . He further claims that effectiveness can be expressed in terms of the P/PC ratio , where P refers to getting desired results and PC is caring for that which produces the results .

He promotes what he labels the character ethic : aligning one 's values with so-called universal and timeless principles . In doing this , Covey is deliberately and mindfully separating principles and values . He sees principles as external natural laws , while values remain internal and subjective .
