  "/wiki/Entrepreneur": "Entrepreneurship is the process of designing , launching and running a new business , which is often initially a small business . The people who create these businesses are called entrepreneurs . Entrepreneurship has been described as the capacity and willingness to develop , organize and manage a business venture along with any of its risks to make a profit . While definitions of entrepreneurship typically focus on the launching and running of businesses , due to the high risks involved in launching a start-up , a significant proportion of start-up businesses have to close due to lack of funding , bad business decisions , an economic crisis , lack of market demand , or a combination of all of these . A broader definition of the term is sometimes used , especially in the field of economics . In this usage , an Entrepreneur is an entity which has the ability to find and act upon opportunities to translate inventions or technologies into products and services : The entrepreneur is able to recognize the commercial potential of the invention and organize the capital , talent , and other resources that turn an invention into a commercially viable innovation . In this sense , the term Entrepreneurship also captures innovative activities on the part of established firms , in addition to similar activities on the part of new businesses . Coming up with an idea for a product or service is not the hardest thing for startups and entrepreneurs . Building a product isnt even the hardest . Truly , the hardest part is making it work , or in other words , getting people to like and want to buy your product , and beating the competition at the same time",

  "/wiki/Money_laundering": "Money laundering is the illegal process of concealing the origins of money obtained illegally by passing it through a complex sequence of banking transfers or commercial transactions . The overall scheme of this process returns the money to the launderer in an obscure and indirect way . One problem of criminal activities is accounting for the proceeds without raising the suspicion of law enforcement agencies . Considerable time and effort may be put into strategies which enable the safe use of those proceeds without raising unwanted suspicion . Implementing such strategies is generally called money laundering . After money has been laundered , it can be used for legitimate purposes . Law enforcement agencies of many jurisdictions have set up sophisticated systems in an effort to detect suspicious transactions or activities , and many have set up international cooperative arrangements to assist each other in these endeavors . The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) estimates that The estimated amount of money laundered globally in one year is 2-5% of global GDP , or $ 800 billion - $ 2 trillion in current US dollars . In a number of legal and regulatory systems , the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial and business crime , and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system ( involving things such as securities , digital currencies , credit cards , and traditional currency ) , including terrorism financing and evasion of international sanctions . Most anti-money laundering laws openly conflate money laundering ( which is concerned with source of funds ) with terrorism financing ( which is concerned with destination of funds ) when regulating the financial system . Some countries treat obfuscation of sources of money as also constituting money laundering , whether it is intentional or by merely using financial systems or services that do not identify or track sources or destinations . Other countries define money laundering in such a way as to include money from activity that would have been a crime in that country , even if the activity was legal where the actual conduct occurred .",
  "/wiki/Tax_evasion": "Tax evasion is the illegal evasion of taxes by individuals , corporations , and trusts . Tax evasion often entails taxpayers deliberately misrepresenting the true state of their affairs to the tax authorities to reduce their tax liability and includes dishonest tax reporting , such as declaring less income , profits or gains than the amounts actually earned , or overstating deductions . Tax evasion is an activity commonly associated with the informal economy . One measure of the extent of tax evasion ( the tax gap ) is the amount of unreported income , which is the difference between the amount of income that should be reported to the tax authorities and the actual amount reported . In contrast , tax avoidance is the legal use of tax laws to reduce one 's tax burden . Both tax evasion and avoidance can be viewed as forms of tax noncompliance , as they describe a range of activities that intend to subvert a state 's tax system , although such classification of tax avoidance is not indisputable , given that avoidance is lawful , within self-creating systems .",

  "/wiki/Ecoterrorist": "Eco-terrorism is an act of violence committed in support of ecological or environmental causes , against people or property . The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation defines eco-terrorism as .the use or threatened use of violence of a criminal nature against innocent victims or property by an environmentally-oriented , subnational group for environmental-political reasons , or aimed at an audience beyond the target , often of a symbolic nature . The FBI credited eco-terrorists with US $ 200 million in property damage between 2003 and 2008 . A majority of states in the US have introduced laws aimed at penalizing eco-terrorism . Eco-terrorism is a form of radical environmentalism that arose out of the same school of thought that brought about deep ecology , ecofeminism , social ecology , and bioregionalism . Eco-terrorism is a controversial term . Some eco-terrorists are people fighting to preserve their environment with the belief that they are preserving their existence . Examples of such ecoterrorists include tribal ethnic minorities such as the Waorani .",
  "/wiki/Earth_Liberation_Front": "The Earth Liberation Front ( ELF ) , also known as Elves or The Elves , is the collective name for autonomous individuals or covert cells who , according to the ELF Press Office , use economic sabotage and guerrilla warfare to stop the exploitation and destruction of the environment . The ELF was founded in Brighton in the United Kingdom in 1992 , and spread to the rest of Europe by 1994 . It is now an international organization with actions reported in 17 countries and is widely regarded as descending from Animal Liberation Front because of the relationship and cooperation between the two movements . Using the same leaderless resistance model , as well as similar guidelines to the ALF , sympathizers say that it is an eco-defense group dedicated to taking the profit motive out of environmental destruction by causing economic damage to businesses through the use of property damage . The ELF was classified as the top domestic terror threat in the United States by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in March 2001 , and its members classified as eco-terrorists . On the lack of deaths from ELF attacks , the FBI 's deputy assistant director for counterterrorism has said , I think we 're lucky . Once you set one of these fires they can go way out of control . The name came to public prominence when they were featured on the television show 60 Minutes in 2005 .

Originally a car salesman in San Diego , Elgindy became a stock trader in 1988 , working for penny stock brokerage Blinder Robinson . He later moved to another brokerage house , Armstrong McKinley . Soon afterward , when the firm came under investigation for taking bribes to recommend stock , he turned informer and helped get the firm shut down . He struck out on his own in 1995 , becoming a short seller . He soon became known for exposing companies that he believed were engaging in unethical and illegal activity that inflated their stock . Elgindy became famous for posting his commentaries on short-selling message boards , and his reputation became such that he could send a stock into a tailspin with just one post . He launched Pacific Equity Investigations in 1999 , using his earlier experience working in boiler rooms to expose fraud . After the turn of the century , Elgindy began working with FBI agent Jeff Broyer . Elgindy gave Broyer the names of companies that he believed were engaging in illegal activity , and Broyer used FBI databases to search for any investigations into those companies by the FBI or the SEC . Broyer then funneled information on any pending investigations to Elgindy , who used that information to short the stock . He was not above extorting executives into giving him stock in order to make him back off his attacks on them .",

  "/wiki/Racketeering": "A racket , according to the current common and most general definition , is an organized criminal act in which the criminal act is some form of substantial business , or a way to earn illegal money either regularly , or briefly but repeatedly . A racket is therefore generally a repeated or continuous organized criminal operation . However , according to the more specific definition , racketeering constitutes extortion or criminal coercion . Originally and often still specifically , a racket referred to a criminal act in which the perpetrator or perpetrators fraudulently offer a service that will not be put into effect , a service to solve a nonexistent problem , or to solve a problem that would not exist without the racket . Conducting a racket is racketeering . Particularly , the potential problem may be caused by the same party that offers to solve it , but that fact may be concealed , with the specific intent to engender continual patronage for this party . The most common example of a racket is the protection racket , which promises to protect the target business or person from dangerous individuals in the neighborhood and then either collects the money or causes damage to the business until the owner pays . The racket exists as both the problem and its solution , and it is used as a method of extortion . However , the term racket has expanded in definition and may now be used less strictly to refer to any continuous or repeated illegal organized crime operation , including those that do not necessarily involve fraudulent practices . For example , racket may be used to refer to the numbers racket or the drug racket , neither of which generally involve fraud or deception with regard to the intended clientele . Racketeering is most often associated with organized crime , and the term was coined by the Employers ' Association of Chicago in June 1927 in a statement about the influence of organized crime in the Teamsters union .",
  "/wiki/Securities_fraud": "Securities fraud , also known as stock fraud and investment fraud , is a deceptive practice in the stock or commodities markets that induces investors to make purchase or sale decisions on the basis of false information , frequently resulting in losses , in violation of securities laws . [ failed verification ] Securities fraud can also include outright theft from investors ( embezzlement by stockbrokers ) , stock manipulation , misstatements on a public company 's financial reports , and lying to corporate auditors . The term encompasses a wide range of other actions , including insider trading , front running and other illegal acts on the trading floor of a stock or commodity exchange .",
  "/wiki/Extortion": "Extortion ( also called shakedown , and , in a legal sense incorrectly , exaction ) is obtaining benefit through coercion . In most jurisdictions it is likely to constitute a criminal offense ; the bulk of this article deals with such cases . Extortion is sometimes called the protection racket since the racketeers often phrase their demands as payment for protection from ( real or hypothetical ) threats from unspecified other parties ; though often , and almost always , such protection is simply abstinence of harm from the same party , and such is implied in the protection offer . Extortion is commonly practiced by organized crime . In some jurisdictions , actually obtaining the benefit is not required to commit the offense , and making a threat of violence which refers to a requirement of a payment of money or property to halt future violence is sufficient to commit the offense . Exaction refers not only to extortion or the demanding and obtaining of something through force , but additionally , in its formal definition , means the infliction of something such as pain and suffering or making somebody endure something unpleasant . The term extortion is often used metaphorically to refer to usury or to price-gouging , though neither is legally considered extortion . It is also often used loosely to refer to everyday situations where one person feels indebted against their will , to another , in order to receive an essential service or avoid legal consequences . Neither extortion nor blackmail requires a threat of a criminal act , such as violence , merely a threat used to elicit actions , money , or property from the object of the extortion . Such threats include the filing of reports ( true or not ) of criminal behavior to the police , revelation of damaging facts ( such as pictures of the object of the extortion in a compromising position ) , etc . In law extortion can refer to political corruption , such as selling one 's office or influence peddling , [ citation needed ] but in general vocabulary the word usually first brings to mind blackmail or protection rackets . The logical connection between the corruption sense of the word and the other senses is that to demand bribes in one 's official capacity is blackmail or racketeering in essence ( that is , you need access to this resource , the government restricts access to it through my office , and I will charge you unfairly and unlawfully for such access ) .",
  "/wiki/FBI": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) is the domestic intelligence and security service of the United States and its principal federal law enforcement agency . Operating under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Justice , the FBI is also a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community and reports to both the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence . A leading U.S. counter-terrorism , counterintelligence , and criminal investigative organization , the FBI has jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes . Although many of the FBI 's functions are unique , its activities in support of national security are comparable to those of the British MI5 and the Russian FSB . Unlike the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , which has no law enforcement authority and is focused on intelligence collection abroad , the FBI is primarily a domestic agency , maintaining 56 field offices in major cities throughout the United States , and more than 400 resident agencies in smaller cities and areas across the nation . At an FBI field office , a senior-level FBI officer concurrently serves as the representative of the Director of National Intelligence . Despite its domestic focus , the FBI also maintains a significant international footprint , operating 60 Legal Attache ( LEGAT ) offices and 15 sub-offices in U.S. embassies and consulates across the globe . These foreign offices exist primarily for the purpose of coordination with foreign security services and do not usually conduct unilateral operations in the host countries . The FBI can and does at times carry out secret activities overseas , just as the CIA has a limited domestic function ; these activities generally require coordination across government agencies . The FBI was established in 1908 as the Bureau of Investigation , the BOI or BI for short . Its name was changed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) in 1935 . The FBI headquarters is the J.

Bekhor . He established a reputation for dealing with the big players of the fringe banking world . Because of his success his colleagues nicknamed him The Animal . Parnes built up the strategic shareholding in Debenhams for Ronson and Sir Philip Harris during Burton 's fiercely contested bid for the department store group . That stake helped win the bid for Sir Ralph Halpern , Burton 's chairman , in a cliffhanging finish .

It is one of the most successful beer brands worldwide , brewed in almost 50 countries , and available in over 120 . Sales in 2011 amounted to 850 million litres ( 220,000,000 US gal ) . It is popular with the Irish , both in Ireland and abroad . In spite of declining consumption since 2001 , it is still the best-selling alcoholic drink in Ireland where Guinness & Co. Brewery makes almost \u20ac2 billion worth of beer annually . The Guinness Storehouse is a tourist attraction at St. James 's Gate Brewery in Dublin , Ireland . Since opening in 2000 , it has received over 20 million visitors . Guinness 's flavour derives from malted barley and roasted unmalted barley , a relatively modern development , not becoming part of the grist until the mid-20th century . For many years , a portion of aged brew was blended with freshly brewed beer to give a sharp lactic acid flavour . Although Guinness 's palate still features a characteristic tang , the company has refused to confirm whether this type of blending still occurs . The draught beer 's thick , creamy head comes from mixing the beer with nitrogen and carbon dioxide .

  "/wiki/Conspiracy_(crime)": "In criminal law , a conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime at some time in the future . Criminal law in some countries or for some conspiracies may require that at least one overt act be undertaken in furtherance of that agreement , to constitute an offense . There is no limit on the number participating in the conspiracy and , in most countries , no requirement that any steps have been taken to put the plan into effect ( compare attempts which require proximity to the full offense ) . For the purposes of concurrence , the actus reus is a continuing one and parties may join the plot later and incur joint liability and conspiracy can be charged where the co-conspirators have been acquitted or can not be traced . Finally , repentance by one or more parties does not affect liability ( unless , in some cases , it occurs before the parties have committed overt acts ) but may reduce their sentence . An unindicted co-conspirator , or unindicted conspirator , is a person or entity that is alleged in an indictment to have engaged in conspiracy , but who is not charged in the same indictment . Prosecutors choose to name persons as unindicted co-conspirators for a variety of reasons including grants of immunity , pragmatic considerations , and evidentiary concerns .",
  "/wiki/Methamphetamine": "Methamphetamine [ note 1 ] ( contracted from N-methylamphetamine ) is a potent central nervous system ( CNS ) stimulant that is mainly used as a recreational drug and less commonly as a second-line treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obesity . Methamphetamine was discovered in 1893 and exists as two enantiomers : levo-methamphetamine and dextro-methamphetamine . [ note 2 ] Methamphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical , the racemic free base , which is an equal mixture of levomethamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine in their pure amine forms . It is rarely prescribed over concerns involving human neurotoxicity and potential for recreational use as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant , among other concerns , as well as the availability of safer substitute drugs with comparable treatment efficacy . Dextromethamphetamine is a much stronger CNS stimulant than levomethamphetamine . Both methamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine are illicitly trafficked and sold owing to their potential for recreational use . The highest prevalence of illegal methamphetamine use occurs in parts of Asia , Oceania , and in the United States , where racemic methamphetamine , levomethamphetamine , and dextromethamphetamine are classified as schedule II controlled substances . Levomethamphetamine is available as an over-the-counter ( OTC ) drug for use as an inhaled nasal decongestant in the United States . [ note 3 ] Internationally , the production , distribution , sale , and possession of methamphetamine is restricted or banned in many countries , due to its placement in schedule II of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances treaty . While dextromethamphetamine is a more potent drug , racemic methamphetamine is sometimes illicitly produced due to the relative ease of synthesis and limited availability of chemical precursors . In low to moderate doses , methamphetamine can elevate mood , increase alertness , concentration and energy in fatigued individuals , reduce appetite , and promote weight loss . At very high doses , it can induce psychosis , breakdown of skeletal muscle , seizures and bleeding in the brain .",
  "/wiki/Fat_Leonard_scandal": "The Fat Leonard scandal is a corruption scandal and ongoing investigation within the United States Navy involving ship support contractor Glenn Defense Marine Asia ( GDMA ) , a subsidiary of the Glenn Marine Group . The Washington Post called the scandal perhaps the worst national-security breach of its kind to hit the Navy since the end of the Cold War . At the heart of the scandal was Glenn Defense Marine Asia , a firm run by Leonard Glenn Francis , a Malaysian national known as Fat Leonard for his then over 350 pound weight . Francis provided at least a half million dollars in cash , plus travel expenses , luxury items , and prostitutes to a large number of U.S. uniformed officers of the United States Seventh Fleet , who in turn gave him classified material about the movements of U.S. ships and submarines , confidential contracting information , and information about active law enforcement investigations into Glenn Defense Marine Asia . Francis then exploited the intelligence for illicit profit , brazenly ordering his moles to redirect aircraft carriers to ports he controlled in Southeast Asia so he could more easily bilk the Navy for fuel , tugboats , barges , food , water and sewage removal . The Navy , through GDMA , even employed divers to search harbors for explosives . He also directed them to author Bravo Zulu memos , which is an informal term for a letter of commendation from the Navy given to civilians who have performed outstanding services for the Navy , in order to bolster GDMA 's credibility for jobs well done . The first activities of the conspiracy were confirmed to have existed in 2006 when Francis recruited numerous Navy personnel to engage in corruption , including directing contracts toward his firm , disfavoring competitors , and inhibiting legitimate fiscal and operational oversight . The initial co-conspirators labelled themselves the cool kids and the wolf pack . U.S. federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against 33 people in connection with the Fat Leonard scandal . Of those , 22 pleaded guilty : Francis himself , four of his top aides , and 17 Navy officials ( specifically , at least ten commissioned officers , two petty officers , one former NCIS special agent , and two civilian Navy contracting officials ) .
