  "/wiki/Caffeine": "Caffeine is a central nervous system ( CNS ) stimulant of the methylxanthine class . It is the world 's most widely consumed psychoactive drug . Unlike many other psychoactive substances , it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world . There are several known mechanisms of action to explain the effects of caffeine . The most prominent is that it reversibly blocks the action of adenosine on its receptor and consequently prevents the onset of drowsiness induced by adenosine . Caffeine also stimulates certain portions of the autonomic nervous system . Caffeine is a bitter , white crystalline purine , a methylxanthine alkaloid , and is chemically related to the adenine and guanine bases of deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) and ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) . It is found in the seeds , nuts , or leaves of a number of plants native to Africa , East Asia and South America , and helps to protect them against predator insects and to prevent germination of nearby seeds . The most well-known source of caffeine is the coffee bean , a misnomer for the seed of Coffea plants . People may drink beverages containing caffeine to relieve or prevent drowsiness and to improve cognitive performance . To make these drinks , caffeine is extracted by steeping the plant product in water , a process called infusion . Caffeine-containing drinks , such as coffee , tea , and cola , are very popular ; as of 2014 , 85% of American adults consumed some form of caffeine daily , consuming 164 mg on average ."
