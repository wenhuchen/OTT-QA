  "/wiki/U.S._Route_81": "U.S. Route 81 or U.S. Highway 81 ( US 81 ) is a major north-south U.S. highway that extends for 1,220 miles ( 1,960 km ) in the central United States and is one of the original United States Numbered Highways established in 1926 by the American Association of State Highway Officials . The route of US 81 follows that of the old Meridian Highway ( so called because it roughly followed the Sixth Principal Meridian of the US Public Land Survey System ) which dates back as early as 1911 . The highway has alternately ( and unofficially ) been known as part of the Pan-American Highway . In the segment in the state of Oklahoma , the highway closely corresponds to the old Chisholm Trail for cattle drives from Texas to railheads in Kansas in the 1860s and 1870s . As of 2004 , the highway 's northern terminus is just north of Pembina , North Dakota , at the Canadian border . At this point , it is routed along Interstate 29 ( I-29 ) and continues northward into Manitoba on Highway 75 , which leads to Winnipeg . Its southern terminus is in Fort Worth , Texas , at an intersection with I-35W and US 287 . Between the inception of the numbered highway system in 1926 through 1991 , US 81 's southern terminus was at the Mexican border in Laredo , Texas . In 1991 , the terminus was moved to San Antonio . The route was shortened to its present length of 1,234 miles ( 1,986 km ) in 1993 , when the terminus was moved to Fort Worth . In both cases , the dropped portions of US 81 were replaced by I-35 . [ citation needed ] Portions of former US 81 south of Fort Worth continue to exist as business loops of I-35 ; a section from Hillsboro to Fort Worth exists as State Highway 81 .",
