  "/wiki/GER_Class_T26": "The GER Class T26 was a class of 2-4-0 steam tender locomotives designed by James Holden for the Great Eastern Railway . At the 1923 grouping they passed to the London and North Eastern Railway , who classified them E4 . Eighteen survived into British Railways ownership in 1948 , and the last was withdrawn in 1959 , making them the last 2-4-0s at work in Britain . Their BR numbers were 62780-62797 .",
  "/wiki/GER_Class_C32": "The GER Class C32 was a class of fifty 2-4-2T steam locomotives designed by James Holden and built by the company 's Stratford Works between 1892 and 1902 . They all passed to the London and North Eastern Railway at the 1923 grouping and received the classification F3 .",
  "/wiki/GER_Class_Y14": "The Great Eastern Railway ( GER ) Class Y14 is a class of 0-6-0 steam locomotive . The LNER classified them J15 . The Class Y14 was designed by T.W . Worsdell for both freight and passenger duties - a veritable 'maid of all work ' . Introduced in July 1883 , they were so successful that all the succeeding chief superintendents continued to build new batches down to 1913 with little design change , the final total being 289 . During World War I , 43 of the engines served in France and Belgium .",
  "/wiki/LNER_Class_J39": "The London and North Eastern Railway ( LNER ) Class J39 was a class of medium powered 0-6-0 steam locomotive designed for mixed traffic work throughout the former LNER system between London and the north of Scotland .",
  "/wiki/GER_Class_T18": "The GER Class T18 was a class of fifty 0-6-0 tank steam locomotives designed by James Holden for the Great Eastern Railway . They passed to the London and North Eastern Railway at the grouping in 1923 and received the LNER classification J66 .",

  "/wiki/GNR_Class_C2": "The Great Northern Railway class C2 locomotives were a class of 4-4-2 tank locomotives built by the Great Northern Railway ( GNR ) between 1898 and 1907 . They were used on local and commuter passenger trains in Yorkshire and North London . They were withdrawn between 1937 and 1958 .",
  "/wiki/GCR_Class_9L": "The Great Central Railway 9K and 9L classes were two related classes of 4-4-2T Atlantic steam locomotives . They were both intended for suburban passenger services . After the 1923 Grouping , they served the LNER as classes C13 and C14 . Their designer was John G. Robinson . The design was based on the earlier Pollitt Class 9G 2-4-2T locomotives , but with a lengthened boiler and a leading bogie to carry it . This extension of running gear also resembled an early Robinson design for the Irish Waterford , Limerick and Western Railway . All passed into British Railways service and the first was not withdrawn until 1952 . Most were withdrawn between 1955 and 1959 . The last examples of each class , 9K 67417 and 9L 67450 , were scrapped in 1960 . None were preserved .",
  "/wiki/GNR_Class_H4": "The Great Northern Railway Class H4 ( classified K3 by the LNER ) was a class of 2-6-0 steam locomotive designed for mixed-traffic work . The type was a more powerful development of the earlier H3 ( LNER K2 ) class and was notable at the time , as the 6-foot-diameter ( 1.8 m ) boilers were the largest fitted to any British locomotive to that date . After formation of the London and North Eastern Railway , the type became known as class K3 and was adopted as an LNER standard design . They got the nickname Jazzers after the rhythm of their exhaust beat and the unbalanced gyratory movement .",
  "/wiki/GCR_Class_1B": "The GCR Class 1B was a class of 2-6-4T ( tank ) locomotives on the Great Central Railway . They were notable as the first locomotives of the 2-6-4T ( or Adriatic ) wheel arrangement to be used by a British standard-gauge railway ; there had been two narrow-gauge examples on the Leek & Manifold Valley Light Railway since 1904 .",
  "/wiki/GER_Class_L77": "The GER Class L77 , LNER Class N7 , is a class of 0-6-2T steam locomotives . They were designed by Alfred John Hill of the Great Eastern Railway and introduced in 1915 . The design was perpetuated by Nigel Gresley of the LNER after the 1923 grouping . 134 were built ; only one of them is preserved .",
  "/wiki/BR_Standard_Class_7": "The BR Standard Class 7 , otherwise known as the Britannia Class , is a class of 4-6-2 Pacific steam locomotive designed under Robert Riddles for use by British Railways for mixed traffic duties . 55 were constructed between 1951 and 1954 . The design employed results from the 1948 locomotive exchanges undertaken in advance of further locomotive classes being constructed . Three batches were constructed at Crewe Works , before the publication of the 1955 Modernisation Plan . The Britannia Class design was based on best practice from the pre-nationalisation railway companies in terms of operating efficiency and lower maintenance costs ; various weight-saving measures also increased the route availability of a Pacific-type locomotive on the British Railways network . The Britannias received a positive reception from their crews , with those regularly operating the locomotives giving them favourable reports as regards performance . However , operation in some areas of the British Railway network returned negative feedback , primarily due to indifferent operation of the locomotive , with its effects on adhering to timetables . The Britannias took their names from great Britons , former Star class locomotives , and Scottish firths . The class remained in service until the last was withdrawn in 1968 . Two survived into preservation , the first-of-class , number 70000 Britannia , and 70013 Oliver Cromwell . Number 70000 has hauled mainline excursions and 70013 , after a period of display following limited steaming , returned to mainline steam in 2008 for the first time since leaving British Railways ownership . 70000 was returned to the main line in 2011 ."
