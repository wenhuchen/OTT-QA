  "/wiki/Christchurch": "Christchurch ( /\u02c8kra\u026ast\u0283\u025c\u02d0rt\u0283/ ; M\u0101ori : \u014ctautahi ) is the largest city in the South Island of New Zealand and the seat of the Canterbury Region . The Christchurch urban area lies on the South Island 's east coast , just north of Banks Peninsula . The urban area is home to 377,200 residents , and the territorial authority has 385,500 people , which makes it the second-most populous city in New Zealand after Auckland and before Wellington . The Avon River flows through the centre of the city , with an urban park located along its banks . Archaeological evidence has indicated that people first settled in the Christchurch area in about 1250 . Christchurch became a city by Royal Charter on 31 July 1856 , making it officially the oldest established city in New Zealand . The Canterbury Association , which settled the Canterbury Plains , named the city after Christ Church , Oxford . The new settlement was laid out in a grid pattern centred on Cathedral Square ; during the 19th century there were few barriers to the rapid growth of the urban area , except for the Pacific to the east and the Port Hills to the south . Agriculture is the historic mainstay of Christchurch 's economy . The early presence of the University of Canterbury and the heritage of the city 's academic institutions in association with local businesses has fostered a number of technology-based industries . Christchurch is one of five 'gateway cities ' for Antarctic exploration , hosting Antarctic support bases for several nations . The city suffered a series of earthquakes between September 2010 and January 2012 , with the most destructive of them occurring at 12.51 p.m. on Tuesday , 22 February 2011 , in which 185 people were killed and thousands of buildings across the city collapsed or suffered severe damage .",

  "/wiki/Waimakariri_River": "The Waimakariri River , formerly briefly known as the Courtenay River , is one of the largest of the North Canterbury rivers , in the South Island of New Zealand . It flows for 151 kilometres ( 94 mi ) in a generally southeastward direction from the Southern Alps across the Canterbury Plains to the Pacific Ocean . In M\u0101ori , Waimakariri has several meanings , one of which is river of cold rushing water . The river is known colloquially in Canterbury as The Waimak . The river rises on the eastern flanks of the Southern Alps , eight kilometres southwest of Arthur 's Pass . For much of its upper reaches , the river is braided , with wide shingle beds . As the river approaches the Canterbury Plains , it passes through a belt of mountains , and is forced into a narrow canyon ( the Waimakariri Gorge ) , before reverting to its braided form for its passage across the plains . It enters the Pacific north of Christchurch , near the town of Kaiapoi . In 1849 , the chief surveyor of the Canterbury Association , Joseph Thomas , gave the river the name Courtenay River after Lord Courtenay , but it lapsed into disuse . Geological evidence indicates that the river mouth has been very mobile , at times flowing through the current location of Christchurch and even flowing into Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora south of Banks Peninsula for a time . Instead of being unoccupied crown land as are most New Zealand river beds , the bed of the Waimakariri River is vested in the Canterbury Regional Council ( Environment Canterbury ) . Chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ) were introduced from California in the 1900s and persist today .",

The Lake Sumner region is a popular area for hunting , tramping , trout fishing , whitewater kayaking , and mountainbiking . Several Department of Conservation tramping huts in the region make it a common destination for overnight trips ; however , the area 's comparatively remote location and difficult vehicle access mean it is seldom crowded ."
