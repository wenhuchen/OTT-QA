  "/wiki/American_football": "American football , referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron , [ nb 1 ] is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end . The offense , the team with possession of the oval-shaped football , attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it , while the defense , the team without possession of the ball , aims to stop the offense 's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves . The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays ; if they fail , they turn over the football to the defense , but if they succeed , they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive . Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins . American football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of soccer and rugby . The first American football match was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the Father of American Football , established the snap , the line of scrimmage , eleven-player teams , and the concept of downs . Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game ( although their rules were developed independently from that of Camp 's ) . Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football . The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football .",

The 2014 season would mark the ten-year anniversary of the Patriots third and most recent Super Bowl win , when they defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl XXXIX . Despite their championship drought , Belichick 's Patriots remained historically dominant throughout much of the 2000s/2010s . They qualified for the playoffs nine times ( missing the 2000 , 2002 and 2008 postseasons ) , reached the AFC Championship five times , appeared in two Super Bowls and , in the eyes of many , solidified Tom Brady 's status as one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time . In 2007 , the Patriots completed just the second undefeated regular season in the history of the modern NFL ( the first being their division rival Miami Dolphins in 1972 ) , as well as the first since the league expanded its seasons to sixteen games ( though only the '72 Dolphins were able to win the Super Bowl ) . It was achievements such as these that made the Patriots a particularly intriguing media target . A miserable loss in week four against the Kansas City Chiefs , where New England dropped to 2-2 , frequent off-field antics of tight-end Rob Gronkowski and highly publicized Deflategate scandal were all important chronicles of the 2014 Patriots wild season , the latter of which would ultimately result in the four-game suspension of Brady for the beginning of the 2016 NFL season . Despite all this , the Patriots managed to emerge victorious in the end . The Patriots finished 12-4 for the third straight year , winning their sixth straight AFC East title , as well as the top-overall seed and home field advantage for the AFC playoffs . With their seeding , New England was awarded a first-round bye in the playoffs for the fifth season in a row , the first such occurrence for any team since the league switched to a 12-team playoff format in 1990 ( surpassing the 1992-95 Dallas Cowboys ) . They finished fourth in the NFL in scoring ( 468 points ) and eighth in points allowed ( 313 ) , and first in point differential ( with an average margin of victory of 9.7 points ) .

Using a cue stick and 21 coloured balls , players must strike the white ball ( or cue ball ) to pot or pocket the remaining balls in the correct sequence , accumulating points for each pot . An individual game ( or frame ) , is won by the player scoring the most points . A match is won when a player wins a predetermined number of frames . Snooker gained its identity in 1875 when army officer Sir Neville Chamberlain ( 1856-1944 ) , stationed in Ooty , Tamil Nadu , devised a set of rules that combined pyramid and black pool . The word snooker was a long-used military term for inexperienced or first-year personnel . The game grew in popularity in the United Kingdom , and the Billiards Association and Control Club was formed in 1919 . It is now governed by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association ( WPBSA ) . The World Snooker Championship has taken place since 1927 . Joe Davis , a key figure in the early growth of the sport , won the championship 15 straight times between 1927 and 1946 . The modern era began in 1969 after the broadcaster BBC commissioned the snooker television show Pot Black and later began to air the World Championship in 1978 .",

However the origins of the name Hayastan trace back to much earlier dates and were first attested in circa 5th century in the works of Agathangelos , Faustus of Byzantium , Ghazar Parpetsi , Koryun , and Sebeos . The name has traditionally been derived from Hayk ( \u0540\u0561\u0575\u056f ) , the legendary patriarch of the Armenians and a great-great-grandson of Noah , who , according to the 5th-century AD author Moses of Chorene ( Movsis Khorenatsi ) , defeated the Babylonian king Bel in 2492 BC and established his nation in the Ararat region . The further origin of the name is uncertain . It is also further postulated that the name Hay comes from one of the two confederated , Hittite vassal states - the \u1e2aaya\u0161a-Azzi ( 1600-1200 BC ) .

The capital and largest city is Sofia ; other major cities are Plovdiv , Varna and Burgas . With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres ( 42,855 sq mi ) , Bulgaria is Europe 's 16th-largest country . One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture , which dates back to 6,500 BC . In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for Thracians , Persians , Celts and ancient Macedonians ; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45 . The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries . The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State ."
