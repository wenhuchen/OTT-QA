  "/wiki/Concentration_camps": "Internment is the imprisonment of people , commonly in large groups , without charges or intent to file charges , and thus no trial . The term is especially used for the confinement of enemy citizens in wartime or of terrorism suspects . Thus , while it can simply mean imprisonment , it tends to refer to preventive confinement rather than confinement after having been convicted of some crime . Use of these terms is subject to debate and political sensitivities . Interned persons may be held in prisons or in facilities known as internment camps , also known as concentration camps . This involves internment generally , as distinct from the subset , the Nazi extermination camps , commonly referred to as death camps . Internment also refers to a neutral country 's practice of detaining belligerent armed forces and equipment on its territory during times of war under the Hague Convention of 1907 . The Universal Declaration of Human Rights restricts the use of internment . Article 9 states that No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest , detention or exile .",

  "/wiki/Lang_ist_der_Weg": "Long Is the Road ( German : Lang ist der Weg ) is a 1948 German drama film directed by Herbert B. Fredersdorf and Marek Goldstein and starring Israel Becker , Bettina Moissi and Berta Litwina . The story examines the Holocaust from the perspective of a Polish Jewish family and a young man who is able to escape while being transported to a Concentration Camp . It was made during the summer of 1947 . It was the first German-made film to directly portray the Holocaust ( Morituri was released earlier but made later ) . It was made with the support of the United States Army Information Control Division . A major aim of the film was to lobby for Jewish survivors still living in Displaced Persons ( DP ) camps to be allowed to emigrate to the British Mandate of Palestine . It drew a comparison between the plight of the Jewish population and the sufferings of other Europeans who had ended up in DP camps . This was partly done through the principal character 's romantic relationship with Dora , a jewish holocaust survivor . The film employs a semi-documentary technique to tell its story . Many of its themes were similar to other German rubble films of the era , but it was notably different partly because of its advocacy of an optimistic , idealistic new world in Palestine . The film only ever went on a limited release , and by the time it received its German premi\u00e8re , many inhabitants of the DP camps had been re-settled , with large numbers emigrating to the newly founded state of Israel .",
