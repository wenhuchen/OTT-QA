Beginning in 1912 , there were regular visits from English teams , including the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) on two occasions . On four of those tours , matches between the Argentine national side and the visiting team were accorded first-class status , making for thirteen first-class matches in total between 1912 and 1938 . Argentina , Brazil , and Chile , the mainstays of South American cricket , commenced regular international matches in the 1920s , which have continued into the present-day ( outside the period surrounding World War II ) . The South American Championship was created in 1995 by those three teams and Peru , and is now held annually . Argentina has been the dominant team at the championship , winning seven out of the eleven tournaments held , and consequently has sent only development sides since 2000 . Argentina made its ICC tournament debut at the 1979 ICC Trophy in England , which was the first event staged only for associate members . The team failed to appear at the subsequent 1982 edition , but from 1986 to 2001 appeared in five consecutive tournaments .
