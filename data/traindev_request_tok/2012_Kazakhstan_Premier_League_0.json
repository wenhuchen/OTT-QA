[ citation needed ] Most of the ethnic Germans were Soviet Volga Germans who were collectively deported to Siberia and Kazakhstan on Stalin 's order when Hitler invaded Soviet-annexed eastern Poland and the Soviet Union proper in 1941 . Until the 1950s , many of these deportees were interned in labor camps , often simply because they were of German descent . The population of Karaganda fell by 14% from 1989-1999 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union ; it was once Kazakhstan 's second-largest city after Almaty . Over 100,000 people have since emigrated to Germany . There is also a concentration of ethnic Poles in the city .",

It had a population of 330,100 ( 1999 Census ) , up 9% from 1989 , making it one of the fastest-growing cities in the country , after Nur-Sultan and Turkistan . One of the oldest cities in Kazakhstan and in Transoxania , built and populated by the ancient Sogdians , Taraz celebrated its official 2000th anniversary ( recognized by UNESCO ) in 2001 , dating from a fortress built in the area by a Xiongnu Chanyu named Zhizhi and was a site of the Battle of Zhizhi in 36 BCE . The city was first recorded under the name Talas in 568 CE by Menander Protector . The medieval city of Talas was a major trade centre along the Silk Road . Talas was later described by Xuanzang , who passed Talas in 629 and later wrote : Traveling westward from the Thousand Springs 140 or 150 li , we come to the city of Daluosi . The city is 8 or 9 li in diameter ; and was settled by Hu ( foreign , non-Oriental ) merchants from various nations . The products and the climate are about the same as Suyab . The Talas alphabet , a variant of the Turkic runiform Orkhon script , is named for the town . Talas secured a place in history by virtue of the Battle of Talas ( 751 CE ) , which was fought between forces of the Chinese Tang Dynasty and those of the Arab Abbasid Caliphate . The battle took place somewhere along the Talas River in the Talas valley . One of its indirect outcomes was the introduction of paper to the west , via the Arab capture of Chinese paper makers .",
