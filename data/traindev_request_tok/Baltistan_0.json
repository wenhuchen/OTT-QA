  "/wiki/K2": "K2 , at 8,611 metres ( 28,251 ft ) above sea level , is the second highest mountain in the world , after Mount Everest at 8,848 metres ( 29,029 ft ) . It is located on the China-Pakistan border between Baltistan in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of northern Pakistan , and the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County of Xinjiang , China . K2 is the highest point of the Karakoram range and the highest point in both Pakistan and Xinjiang . K2 is known as the Savage Mountain after George Bell , a climber on the 1953 American Expedition , told reporters It 's a savage mountain that tries to kill you . Of the five highest mountains in the world , K2 is the deadliest where approximately one person dies on the mountain for every four who reach the summit . Also occasionally known as Chhogori , or Mount Godwin-Austen , other nicknames for K2 are The King of Mountains and The Mountaineers ' Mountain , as well as The Mountain of Mountains after climber Reinhold Messner titled his book about K2 the same . K2 is the only eight-thousand metre peak that has never been climbed during winter or from its East Face . Ascents have almost always been made in July and August , the warmest times of year ; K2 's more northern location makes it more susceptible to inclement and colder weather . The peak has now been climbed by almost all of its ridges . Although the summit of Everest is at a higher altitude , K2 is a more difficult and dangerous climb , due in part to its more inclement weather and comparatively greater height from base to peak . As of June 2018 [ update ] , only 367 people have completed the ascent . 86 people have died attempting the climb according to the list maintained on the List of deaths on eight-thousanders .",

It lies near the Baltoro Glacier in the Concordia region which is home to some of the highest peaks of the world . Chogolisa has several peaks , the highest on the SW face ( Chogolisa I ) rises to 7,668 metres ( 25,157 ft ) . The second highest at 7,654 metres on the NE side ( Chogolisa II ) is the one named Bride Peak by Martin Conway in 1892 . In 1909 , a party led by Duke of the Abruzzi reached 7,498 m ( 24,600 ft ) from a base camp located on the northern side and a high camp on the Chogolisa saddle at 6,335m . Bad weather stopped the party from ascending further , but their climb established a world altitude record . Hermann Buhl and Kurt Diemberger attempted Chogolisa in 1957 after they had successfully summitted Broad Peak behind Marcus Schmuck and Fritz Wintersteller a few weeks earlier . On June 25 they left camp I and camped in a saddle at 6,706m on the SE ridge . On June 27 a sudden snow storm forced them to retreat and on the descent , Buhl broke off a big cornice and fell into the mountain 's near vertical north face . His body has never been found . In 1958 , a Japanese expedition from Kyoto University led by Takeo Kuwabara ( \u6851\u539f\u6b66\u592b ) made the first ascent of Chogolisa II , placing M. Fujihira and K. Hirai on top . The first ascent of Chogolisa I was made on August 2 , 1975 by Fred Pressl and Gustav Ammerer of an Austrian expedition led by Eduard Koblmueller ."
