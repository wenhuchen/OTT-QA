  "/wiki/Media_market": "A media market , broadcast market , media region , designated market area ( DMA ) , television market area , or simply market is a region where the population can receive the same ( or similar ) television and radio station offerings , and may also include other types of media including newspapers and Internet content . They can coincide or overlap with one or more metropolitan areas , though rural regions with few significant population centers can also be designated as markets . Conversely , very large metropolitan areas can sometimes be subdivided into multiple segments . Market regions may overlap , meaning that people residing on the edge of one media market may be able to receive content from other nearby markets . They are widely used in audience measurements , which are compiled in the United States by Nielsen Media Research . Nielsen measures both television and radio audiences since its acquisition of Arbitron , which was completed in September 2013 . Markets are identified by the largest city , which is usually located in the center of the market region . However , geography and the fact that some metropolitan areas have large cities separated by some distance can make markets have unusual shapes and result in two , three , or more names being used to identify a single region ( such as Wichita-Hutchinson , Kansas ; Chico-Redding , California ; Albany-Schenectady-Troy , New York ; and Harrisburg-Lebanon-Lancaster-York , Pennsylvania ) . In the United States , radio markets are generally a bit smaller than their television counterparts , as broadcast power restrictions are stricter for radio than TV , and TV reaches further via cable . AM band and FM band radio ratings are sometimes separated , as are broadcast and cable television . Market researchers also subdivide ratings demographically between different age groups , genders , and ethnic backgrounds ; as well as psychographically between income levels and other non-physical factors . This information is used by advertisers to determine how to reach a specific audience .",
  "/wiki/Call_sign": "In broadcasting and radio communications , a call sign ( also known as a call name or call letters - and historically as a call signal - or abbreviated as a call ) is a unique designation for a transmitter station . In the United States of America , they are used for all FCC-licensed transmitters . A call sign can be formally assigned by a government agency , informally adopted by individuals or organizations , or even cryptographically encoded to disguise a station 's identity . The use of call signs as unique identifiers dates to the landline railroad telegraph system . Because there was only one telegraph line linking all railroad stations , there needed to be a way to address each one when sending a telegram . In order to save time , two-letter identifiers were adopted for this purpose . This pattern continued in radiotelegraph operation ; radio companies initially assigned two-letter identifiers to coastal stations and stations aboard ships at sea . These were not globally unique , so a one-letter company identifier ( for instance , 'M ' and two letters as a Marconi station ) was later added . By 1912 , the need to quickly identify stations operated by multiple companies in multiple nations required an international standard ; an ITU prefix would be used to identify a country , and the rest of the call sign an individual station in that country .",
  "/wiki/Network_affiliate": "In the broadcasting industry ( particularly in North America ) , a network affiliate or affiliated station is a local broadcaster , owned by a company other than the owner of the network , which carries some or all of the lineup of television programs or radio programs of a television or radio network . This distinguishes such a television or radio station from an owned-and-operated station ( O & O ) , which is owned by the parent network . Notwithstanding this distinction , it is common in informal speech ( even for networks or O & Os themselves ) to refer to any station , O & O or otherwise , that carries a particular network 's programming as an affiliate , or to refer to the status of carrying such programming in a given market as an affiliation .",

  "/wiki/DTV_transition_in_the_United_States": "The digital transition in the United States was the switchover from analog to exclusively digital broadcasting of terrestrial television television programming . According to David Rehr , then president and CEO of the National Association of Broadcasters , this transition represented the most significant advancement of television technology since color TV was introduced . For full-power TV stations , the transition went into effect on June 12 , 2009 , with stations ending regular programming on their analog signals no later than 11:59 p.m. local time that day . Under the Digital Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005 , full-power broadcasting of analog television in the United States was initially planned to have ceased after February 17 , 2009 . To help U.S. consumers through the conversion , the Act also established a federally sponsored DTV Converter Box Coupon Program . The DTV Delay Act changed the mandatory analog cutoff date to June 12 , although stations were permitted to cease analog transmissions before the new mandatory cutoff date . The legislation was enacted on February 4 , 2009 , and on February 11 , 2009 , President Barack Obama signed it into law . The purpose of the extension was to help the millions of households who had not been able to get their coupons for converters because demand for coupons exceeded the funding provided for in the initial bill , leaving millions on a waiting list to receive coupons . Funding for extra coupons was provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 . By midnight on the original cut-off date of February 17 , 2009 , 641 stations representing 36 percent of U.S. full-power broadcasters were transmitting exclusively in digital . Analog broadcasting did not cease entirely following the June 12 deadline : under the provisions of the Short-term Analog Flash and Emergency Readiness Act , approximately 120 full-power stations briefly maintained analog nightlight service , ending no later than July 12 .
