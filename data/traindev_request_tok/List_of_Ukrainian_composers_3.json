Sergej Sergejevi\u010d Prokofjev ; [ n 1 ] 27 April [ O.S . 15 April ] 1891 - 5 March 1953 ) [ n 2 ] was a Russian Soviet composer , pianist and conductor . As the creator of acknowledged masterpieces across numerous music genres , he is regarded as one of the major composers of the 20th century . His works include such widely heard pieces as the March from The Love for Three Oranges , the suite Lieutenant Kij\u00e9 , the ballet Romeo and Juliet - from which Dance of the Knights is taken - and Peter and the Wolf . Of the established forms and genres in which he worked , he created - excluding juvenilia - seven completed operas , seven symphonies , eight ballets , five piano concertos , two violin concertos , a cello concerto , a symphony-concerto for cello and orchestra , and nine completed piano sonatas . A graduate of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory , Prokofiev initially made his name as an iconoclastic composer-pianist , achieving notoriety with a series of ferociously dissonant and virtuosic works for his instrument , including his first two piano concertos . In 1915 , Prokofiev made a decisive break from the standard composer-pianist category with his orchestral Scythian Suite , compiled from music originally composed for a ballet commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev of the Ballets Russes . Diaghilev commissioned three further ballets from Prokofiev - Chout , Le pas d'acier and The Prodigal Son - which at the time of their original production all caused a sensation among both critics and colleagues . Prokofiev 's greatest interest , however , was opera , and he composed several works in that genre , including The Gambler and The Fiery Angel . Prokofiev 's one operatic success during his lifetime was The Love for Three Oranges , composed for the Chicago Opera and subsequently performed over the following decade in Europe and Russia . After the Revolution of 1917 , Prokofiev left Russia with the official blessing of the Soviet minister Anatoly Lunacharsky , and resided in the United States , then Germany , then Paris , making his living as a composer , pianist and conductor .",
