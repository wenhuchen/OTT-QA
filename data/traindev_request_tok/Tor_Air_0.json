Located along the Tigris River , the city was founded in the 8th century and became the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate . Within a short time of its inception , Baghdad evolved into a significant cultural , commercial , and intellectual center of the Muslim world . This , in addition to housing several key academic institutions , including the House of Wisdom , as well as hosting a multiethnic and multireligious environment , garnered the city a worldwide reputation as the Centre of Learning . Baghdad was the largest city in the world for much of the Abbasid era during the Islamic Golden Age , peaking at a population of more than a million . The city was largely destroyed at the hands of the Mongol Empire in 1258 , resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues and multiple successive empires . With the recognition of Iraq as an independent state ( formerly the British Mandate of Mesopotamia ) in 1932 , Baghdad gradually regained some of its former prominence as a significant center of Arabic culture , with a population variously estimated at 6 or over 7 million . [ note 1 ] In contemporary times , the city has often faced severe infrastructural damage , most recently due to the United States-led 2003 invasion of Iraq , and the subsequent Iraq War that lasted until December 2011 . In recent years , the city has been frequently subjected to insurgency attacks . The war had resulted in a substantial loss of cultural heritage and historical artifacts as well . As of 2018 [ update ] , Baghdad was listed as one of the least hospitable places in the world to live , ranked by Mercer as the worst major city for quality of life in the world .",

The capital and largest city is Sofia ; other major cities are Plovdiv , Varna and Burgas . With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres ( 42,855 sq mi ) , Bulgaria is Europe 's 16th-largest country . One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture , which dates back to 6,500 BC . In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for Thracians , Persians , Celts and ancient Macedonians ; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45 . The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries . The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State .",

Subsequent rule by Ptolemaic Egypt , the Classical and Eastern Roman Empire , Arab caliphates for a short period , the French Lusignan dynasty and the Venetians , was followed by over three centuries of Ottoman rule between 1571 and 1878 ( de jure until 1914 ) .

Turkish leaders for a period advocated the annexation of Cyprus to Turkey as Cyprus was considered an extension of Anatolia by them ; while , since the 19th century , the majority Greek Cypriot population and its Orthodox church had been pursuing union with Greece , which became a Greek national policy in the 1950s .

It lies within the United Kingdom 's second-most populous urban area , with a population of 2.9 million , and second-most populous metropolitan area , with a population of 3.3 million . It is fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south , the Pennines to the north and east , and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation . The local authority for the city is Manchester City Council . The recorded history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort of Mamucium or Mancunium , which was established in about AD 79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell . It is historically a part of Lancashire , although areas of Cheshire south of the River Mersey were incorporated in the 20th century . The first to be included , Wythenshawe , was added to the city in 1931 . Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township , but began to expand at an astonishing rate around the turn of the 19th century . Manchester 's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution , and resulted in it becoming the world 's first industrialised city . Manchester achieved city status in 1853 . The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894 , creating the Port of Manchester and directly linking the city to the Irish Sea , 36 miles ( 58 km ) to the west . Its fortune declined after the Second World War , owing to deindustrialisation , but the IRA bombing in 1996 led to extensive investment and regeneration .",
