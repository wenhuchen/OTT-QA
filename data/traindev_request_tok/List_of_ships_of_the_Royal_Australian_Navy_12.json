  "/wiki/Bathurst-class_corvette": "The Bathurst-class corvettes were a class of general purpose vessels produced in Australia during World War II . Originally classified as minesweepers , but widely referred to as corvettes , the Bathurst-class vessels fulfilled a broad anti-submarine , anti-mine , and convoy escort role . Sixty Bathurst-class corvettes were built in eight Australian shipyards to an Australian design . 36 were constructed for the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , 20 were built on British Admiralty orders but manned and commissioned by the RAN , and 4 served in the Royal Indian Navy . Three more were ordered for construction in India , but were cancelled . Although designed for the anti-submarine and anti-mine role , the Bathursts operated as maids-of-all-work during the war ; serving as troop and supply transports , supporting amphibious landings , providing air defence for convoys and disabled ships , participating in shore bombardments , and undertaking hydrographic surveys . Three ships were lost during the war - one to Japanese air attack and two to collisions with friendly merchant ships - while a fourth struck a friendly mine while sweeping the Great Barrier Reef in 1947 and sank . After the war , the Admiralty ships were sold to the Turkish Navy , Royal Netherlands Navy , and civilian operators , while several RAN-owned vessels were transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy , temporarily reactivated to facilitate National Service Training , or sold to civilians . Four of the Netherlands Bathursts were sold onward to the Indonesian Navy , one of which was destroyed in 1956 by rebels opposing the 'Guided Democracy ' political system . The rest of the RAN and Admiralty ships were sold for scrap to help fund other projects . Two vessels are preserved as museum ships .",

Two ships ( originally built as Newport-class tank landing ships for the United States Navy ) were purchased by Australia in 1994 and modified . Problems during the handover process and the need to repair previously unidentified defects meant the ships did not enter operational service until the end of the decade . Between them , the two ships have deployed to the Solomon Islands in 2000-01 , Vanuatu in 2001 , and participated in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars , the Australian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami , the Australian deployment to East Timor following the 2006 political crisis , and Operation Quickstep off Fiji . After a large number of defects were found in both ships during late 2010 , the vessels were docked . It was decided that Manoora was beyond economic repair , and she was decommissioned in May 2011 . Kanimbla was to be repaired and returned to service , but the estimated cost and time to do this , plus the successful acquisition of the British landing ship dock RFA Largs Bay as an interim capability replacement , prompted the government to decommission Kanimbla in November 2011 .
