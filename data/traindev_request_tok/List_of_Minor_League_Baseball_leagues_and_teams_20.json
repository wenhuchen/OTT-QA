The state 's largest city is Baltimore , and its capital is Annapolis . Among its occasional nicknames are Old Line State , the Free State , and the Chesapeake Bay State . It is named after the English queen Henrietta Maria , known in England as Queen Mary , who was the wife of King Charles I. Sixteen of Maryland 's twenty-three counties , as well as the city of Baltimore , border the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay estuary and its many tributaries , which combined total more than 4,000 miles of shoreline . Although one of the smallest states in the U.S. , it features a variety of climates and topographical features that have earned it the moniker of America in Miniature . In a similar vein , Maryland 's geography , culture , and history combine elements of the Mid-Atlantic , Northeastern , and South Atlantic regions of the country . Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century , Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans , mostly by the Algonquin , and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux . As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain , Maryland was founded by George Calvert , a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England . In 1632 , Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter , naming the colony after his wife , Queen Mary ( Henrietta Maria of France ) . Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans , who rejected Catholicism in their settlements , Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration . Accordingly , in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion , which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation . Nevertheless , religious strife was common in the early years , and Catholics remained a minority , albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony .",

Located on Codorus Creek , the facility had been in the planning stages since 2003 , but local politics and funding temporarily halted the plans . The city of York demolished 20 buildings in the Arch Street neighborhood in June 2006 , with construction beginning in September 2006 . Due to inclement weather , PeoplesBank Park opened one month later than originally planned . The naming rights were purchased by Sovereign Bank , a banking institution based in nearby Reading , for $ 2.7 million over ten years . The name was changed to Santander Stadium in October 2013 following the 2009 takeover of Sovereign Bank by Santander Bank . In December 2015 , it was announced the park would be known as PeoplesBank Park under a new naming rights deal with locally owned PeoplesBank . PeoplesBank Park was honored as the Ballpark of the Year by the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball following the end of its 2008 regular season .
