Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison . Kansas was first settled by Americans in 1827 with the establishment of Fort Leavenworth . The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s , in the midst of political wars over the slavery debate . When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the Kansas-Nebraska Act , abolitionist Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a free state or a slave state . Thus , the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided , and was known as Bleeding Kansas .",
  "/wiki/Cairn_Terrier": "The Cairn Terrier is one of the oldest terrier breeds , originating in the Scottish Highlands and recognized as one of Scotland 's earliest working dogs . The breed was given the name Cairn because the breed 's function was to hunt and chase quarry between the cairns in the Scottish highlands . Although the breed had existed long before , the name Cairn Terrier was a compromise suggestion after the breed originally was brought to official shows in the United Kingdom in 1909 under the name Short-haired Skye terriers . This name was not acceptable to The Kennel Club due to opposition from Skye Terrier breeders , and the name Cairn Terrier was suggested as an alternative . They are usually left-pawed , which has been shown in dogs to correlate to superior performance in tasks related to scent . Cairn terriers are ratters .",
