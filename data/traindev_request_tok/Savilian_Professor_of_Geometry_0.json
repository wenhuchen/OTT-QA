  "/wiki/University_of_Cambridge": "The University of Cambridge ( legally The Chancellor , Masters , and Scholars of the University of Cambridge ) is a collegiate public research university in Cambridge , United Kingdom . Founded in 1209 and granted a royal charter by King Henry III in 1231 , Cambridge is the second-oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world 's fourth-oldest surviving university . The university grew out of an association of scholars who left the University of Oxford after a dispute with the townspeople . The two 'ancient universities ' share many common features and are often referred to jointly as 'Oxbridge ' . The academic standards , history , influence and wealth of the University of Cambridge has made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world . Cambridge is formed from a variety of institutions which include 31 semi-autonomous constituent Colleges and over 100 academic departments organised into six schools . Cambridge University Press , a department of the university , is the world 's oldest publishing house and the second-largest university press in the world . Cambridge Assessment , also a department of the university , is one of the world 's leading examining bodies and provides assessment to over eight million learners globally every year . The university also operates eight cultural and scientific museums , including the Fitzwilliam Museum , as well as a botanic garden . Cambridge 's libraries , of which there are over 100 , hold a total of around 16 million books , around nine million of which are in Cambridge University Library , a legal deposit library . The university is home to , but independent of , the Cambridge Union - the world 's oldest debating society .

In constitutional terms , the college is a charitable corporation established by a charter dated 9 April 1511 . The aims of the college , as specified by its statutes , are the promotion of education , religion , learning and research . It is one of the larger Oxbridge colleges in terms of student numbers . For 2018 , St. John 's was ranked 9th of 29 colleges in the Tompkins Table ( the annual league table of Cambridge colleges ) with over 30% of its students earning First-class honours . The college 's alumni comprise the winners of 11 Nobel Prizes ( including physicists Paul Dirac and Max Born , the latter having been affiliated with the college in the 1930s ) , seven prime ministers and 12 archbishops of various countries , at least two princes and three Saints . The Romantic poet William Wordsworth studied at St John 's , as did William Wilberforce and Thomas Clarkson , the two abolitionists who led the movement that brought slavery to an end in the British Empire . Prince William was affiliated with the college while undertaking a university-run course in estate management in 2014 . St John 's is well known for its choir , its members ' success in a wide variety of inter-collegiate sporting competitions and its annual May Ball . The Cambridge Apostles and the Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club were both founded by members of the college . The Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race tradition furthermore began with a St John 's student , and the college boat club , Lady Margaret Boat Club , is the oldest in the university .

  "/wiki/Merton_College,_Oxford": "Merton College ( in full : The House or College of Scholars of Merton in the University of Oxford ) is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in England . Its foundation can be traced back to the 1260s when Walter de Merton , chancellor to Henry III and later to Edward I , first drew up statutes for an independent academic community and established endowments to support it . An important feature of Walter 's foundation was that this college was to be self-governing and the endowments were directly vested in the Warden and Fellows . By 1274 , when Walter retired from royal service and made his final revisions to the college statutes , the community was consolidated at its present site in the south east corner of the city of Oxford , and a rapid programme of building commenced . The hall and the chapel and the rest of the front quad were complete before the end of the 13th century . Mob Quad , one of Merton 's quadrangles , was constructed between 1288 and 1378 , and is claimed to be the oldest quadrangle in Oxford , while Merton College Library , located in Mob Quad and dating from 1373 , is the oldest continuously functioning library for university academics and students in the world . Like many of Oxford 's colleges , Merton admitted its first mixed-sex cohort in 1979 , after over seven centuries as an institution for men only . Notable alumni and academics past and present include four Nobel laureates and writer J. R. R. Tolkien who was Merton Professor of English Language and Literature from 1945 to 1959 . Merton is one of the wealthiest colleges in Oxford and held funds totalling \u00a3272 million as of July 2017 .

Arrested in 1640 , he was executed in 1645 . In matters of church polity , Laud was autocratic . Laudianism refers to a collection of rules on matters of ritual , in particular , that were enforced by Laud in order to maintain uniform worship in England and Wales , in line with the king 's preferences . They were precursors to later High Church views . In theology , Laud was accused of being an Arminian and opponent of Calvinism , as well as covertly favouring Roman Catholic doctrines ( see Arminianism in the Church of England ) . On all three grounds , he was regarded by Puritan clerics and laymen as a formidable and dangerous opponent . Laud favoured scholars , and was a major collector of manuscripts .

Welby is the 105th in a line which goes back more than 1400 years to Augustine of Canterbury , the Apostle to the English , sent from Rome in the year 597 . Welby succeeded Rowan Williams . From the time of Augustine until the 16th century , the archbishops of Canterbury were in full communion with the See of Rome and usually received the pallium from the Pope . During the English Reformation , the Church of England broke away from the authority of the Pope . Thomas Cranmer became the first holder of the office following the English Reformation in 1533 , while Reginald Pole was the last Roman Catholic in the position , serving from 1556 to 1558 during the Counter-Reformation . In the Middle Ages there was considerable variation in the methods of nomination of the Archbishop of Canterbury and other bishops . At various times the choice was made by the canons of Canterbury Cathedral , the Pope , or the King of England . Since the English Reformation , the Church of England has been more explicitly a state church and the choice is legally that of the Crown ; today it is made by the reigning monarch on the advice of the British prime minister , who in turn receives a shortlist of two names from an ad hoc committee called the Crown Nominations Commission .",

The first ( 1642-1646 ) and second ( 1648-1649 ) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament , while the third ( 1649-1651 ) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament . The war ended with Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651 . The outcome of the war was threefold : the trial and execution of Charles I ( 1649 ) ; the exile of his son , Charles II ( 1651 ) ; and the replacement of English monarchy with , at first , the Commonwealth of England ( 1649-1653 ) and then the Protectorate under the personal rule of Oliver Cromwell ( 1653-1658 ) and briefly his son Richard ( 1658-1659 ) . A king had never been executed before . In England , the monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship was ended , while in Ireland the victors consolidated the established Protestant Ascendancy .

Centred 1 1\u20442 miles ( 2.4 km ) east of Charing Cross , it fronts the River Thames and the City of London to the north . It was at the lowest bridging point of the Thames in Roman Britain , providing a crossing from Londinium , and for centuries had the only Thames bridge in the area , until a bridge was built upstream more than 10 miles ( 16 km ) to the west . [ n 1 ] It was a 1295-enfranchised ( nationally represented ) borough in the county of Surrey , apparently created a burh in 886 , containing various parishes by the high medieval period , lightly succumbing to City attempts to constrain its free trade and entertainment . Its entertainment district , in its heyday at the time of Shakespare 's Globe Theatre ( which stood 1599-1642 ) has revived in the form of the Southbank which overspills imperceptibly into the ancient boundaries of Lambeth and commences at the post-1997 reinvention of the original theatre , Shakespeare 's Globe , incorporating other smaller theatre spaces , an exhibition about Shakespeare 's life and work and which neighbours Vinopolis and the London Dungeon . After the 18th-century decline of Southwark 's small wharves , the borough rapidly grew in population and saw the growth of great docks , printing/paper , railways , goods yards , small artisan and other often low-wage industries and Southwark was among many such inner districts to see slum clearance and replacement largely with social housing during the late 19th and early 20th centuries . It is now at an advanced stage of regeneration and has the City Hall offices of the Greater London Authority . At its heart is the area known as Borough , which has an eclectic covered and semi-covered market and numerous food and drink venues as well as the skyscraper The Shard . Another landmark is Southwark Cathedral , a priory then parish church , created a cathedral in 1905 , noted for its Merbecke Choir .

More generally , cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages ; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality , data integrity , authentication , and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography . Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics , computer science , electrical engineering , communication science , and physics . Applications of cryptography include electronic commerce , chip-based payment cards , digital currencies , computer passwords , and military communications . Cryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption , the conversion of information from a readable state to apparent nonsense . The originator of an encrypted message shares the decoding technique only with intended recipients to preclude access from adversaries . The cryptography literature often uses the names Alice ( A ) for the sender , Bob ( B ) for the intended recipient , and Eve ( eavesdropper ) for the adversary . Since the development of rotor cipher machines in World War I and the advent of computers in World War II , the methods used to carry out cryptology have become increasingly complex and its application more widespread . Modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice ; cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions , making such algorithms hard to break in practice by any adversary . It is theoretically possible to break such a system , but it is infeasible to do so by any known practical means . These schemes are therefore termed computationally secure ; theoretical advances , e.g. , improvements in integer factorization algorithms , and faster computing technology require these solutions to be continually adapted . There exist information-theoretically secure schemes that provably can not be broken even with unlimited computing power - an example is the one-time pad - but these schemes are more difficult to use in practice than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure mechanisms .",

  "/wiki/Infinity": "Infinity ( often denoted by the symbol \u221e { \\displaystyle \\infty } or Unicode \u221e ) represents something that is boundless or endless or else something that is larger than any real or natural number . Since the time of the ancient Greeks , the nature of infinity was the subject of many discussions among philosophers ( see Infinity ( philosophy ) ) . In the 17th century , with the introduction of the infinity symbol and the infinitesimal calculus , mathematicians began to work with infinite series and what some mathematicians ( including l'H\u00f4pital and Bernoulli ) regarded as infinitely small quantities , but infinity continued to be associated with endless processes . As mathematicians struggled with the foundation of the calculus , it remained unclear whether infinity could be considered as a number or magnitude and , if so , how this could be done . At the end of the 19th century , Georg Cantor enlarged the mathematical study of infinity by studying infinite sets and infinite numbers , showing that they can be of various sizes . For example , in modern mathematics , a line is commonly viewed as the set of all of its points , and their infinite number ( i.e . the cardinality of the line ) is larger than the number of integers . In this usage , infinity is a mathematical concept , and infinite mathematical objects can be studied , manipulated , and used just like any other mathematical object . Thus the mathematical concept of infinity refines and extends the old philosophical concept , in particular by introducing infinitely many different sizes of infinite sets . Among the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory , on which most of modern mathematics can be developed , is the axiom of infinity , which guarantees the existence of infinite sets . The mathematical concept of infinity and the manipulation of infinite sets are used everywhere in mathematics , even in areas such as combinatorics that may seem to have nothing to do with them . For example , Wiles 's proof of Fermat 's Last Theorem implicitly relies on the existence of very large infinite sets for solving a long-standing problem that is stated in terms of elementary arithmetic .",

His book Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica ( Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy ) , first published in 1687 , laid the foundations of classical mechanics . Newton also made seminal contributions to optics , and shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus . In Principia , Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint until it was superseded by the theory of relativity . Newton used his mathematical description of gravity to prove Kepler 's laws of planetary motion , account for tides , the trajectories of comets , the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena , eradicating doubt about the Solar System 's heliocentricity . He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles . Newton 's inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis , La Condamine , and others , convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems . Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum . His work on light was collected in his highly influential book Opticks , published in 1704 . He also formulated an empirical law of cooling , made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound , and introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid . In addition to his work on calculus , as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series , generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents , developed a method for approximating the roots of a function , and classified most of the cubic plane curves . Newton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge .",

He was a child prodigy who was educated by his father , a tax collector in Rouen . Pascal 's earliest work was in the natural and applied sciences , where he made important contributions to the study of fluids , and clarified the concepts of pressure and vacuum by generalising the work of Evangelista Torricelli . Pascal also wrote in defence of the scientific method . In 1642 , while still a teenager , he started some pioneering work on calculating machines . After three years of effort and 50 prototypes , he built 20 finished machines ( called Pascal 's calculators and later Pascalines ) over the following 10 years , establishing him as one of the first two inventors of the mechanical calculator . Pascal was an important mathematician , helping create two major new areas of research : he wrote a significant treatise on the subject of projective geometry at the age of 16 , and later corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on probability theory , strongly influencing the development of modern economics and social science . Following Galileo Galilei and Torricelli , in 1647 , he rebutted Aristotle 's followers who insisted that nature abhors a vacuum . Pascal 's results caused many disputes before being accepted . In 1646 , he and his sister Jacqueline identified with the religious movement within Catholicism known by its detractors as Jansenism . Following a religious experience in late 1654 , he began writing influential works on philosophy and theology . His two most famous works date from this period : the Lettres provinciales and the Pens\u00e9es , the former set in the conflict between Jansenists and Jesuits .",

Most of the material dates from the 19th and 20th centuries , with few photographs and no sound or video recordings . In total , 21 people have held the position . Of Philip Bliss , who was Keeper of the Archives for 31 years in the 19th century , it was said that his penchant for accumulation seems to have impeded administrative efficiency . Reginald Lane Poole , who was in office from 1909 to 1927 , took a much narrower view on what should be kept , and criticised his predecessors for their fatal inability . to destroy things when they are done with . The third to hold the position , John Wallis ( who was also Savilian Professor of Geometry ) , prepared an index of the collection that was still used into the 20th century . The present holder , Simon Bailey , is the first full-time Keeper of the Archives : he was previously the Archivist under his predecessor , David Vaisey , but a decision was taken to combine the two posts in 2000 . The archives became part of the Bodleian Library in August 2010 , and the Keeper of the Archives now reports to the library 's Keeper of Special Collections and Associate Director .",
  "/wiki/The_Restoration": "The Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in the kingdoms of England , Scotland and Ireland took place in 1660 when King Charles II returned from exile in Europe . The preceding period of the Protectorate and the civil wars , came to be known as the Interregnum ( 1649-1660 ) . The term Restoration is also used to describe the period of several years after , in which a new political settlement was established . It is very often used to cover the whole reign of Charles II ( 1660-1685 ) and often the brief reign of his younger brother James II ( 1685-1688 ) . In certain contexts it may be used to cover the whole period of the later Stuart monarchs as far as the death of Queen Anne and the accession of the Hanoverian George I in 1714 ; for example Restoration comedy typically encompasses works written as late as 1710 .",
  "/wiki/Charles_II_of_England": "Charles II ( 29 May 1630 - 6 February 1685 ) [ c ] was king of England , Scotland , and Ireland . He was king of Scotland from 1649 until his deposition in 1651 , and king of England , Scotland and Ireland from the 1660 Restoration of the monarchy until his death in 1685 . Charles II was the eldest surviving child of Charles I of England , Scotland and Ireland and Henrietta Maria of France . After Charles I 's execution at Whitehall on 30 January 1649 , at the climax of the English Civil War , the Parliament of Scotland proclaimed Charles II king on 5 February 1649 . However , England entered the period known as the English Interregnum or the English Commonwealth , and the country was a de facto republic led by Oliver Cromwell . Cromwell defeated Charles II at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651 , and Charles fled to mainland Europe . Cromwell became virtual dictator of England , Scotland and Ireland . Charles spent the next nine years in exile in France , the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Netherlands . A political crisis that followed the death of Cromwell in 1658 resulted in the restoration of the monarchy , and Charles was invited to return to Britain . On 29 May 1660 , his 30th birthday , he was received in London to public acclaim . After 1660 , all legal documents stating a regnal year did so as if he had succeeded his father as king in 1649 . Charles 's English parliament enacted laws known as the Clarendon Code , designed to shore up the position of the re-established Church of England .",

He was the second Astronomer Royal in Britain , succeeding John Flamsteed in 1720 . From an observatory he constructed on Saint Helena , Halley recorded a transit of Mercury across the Sun . He realised a similar transit of Venus could be used to determine the size of the Solar System . He also used his observations to expand contemporary star maps . He aided in observationally proving Isaac Newton 's laws of motion , and funded the publication of Newton 's influential Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica . From his September 1682 observations , he used the laws of motion to compute the periodicity of Halley 's Comet in his 1705 Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets . It was named after him upon its predicted return in 1758 , which he did not live to see . Beginning in 1698 , he made sailing expeditions and made observations on the conditions of terrestrial magnetism . In 1718 , he discovered the proper motion of the fixed stars .",

  "/wiki/Halley's_comet": "Halley 's Comet or Comet Halley , officially designated 1P/Halley , is a short-period comet visible from Earth every 75-76 years . Halley is the only known short-period comet that is regularly visible to the naked eye from Earth , and the only naked-eye comet that might appear twice in a human lifetime . Halley last appeared in the inner parts of the Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061 . Halley 's returns to the inner Solar System have been observed and recorded by astronomers since at least 240 BC . Clear records of the comet 's appearances were made by Chinese , Babylonian , and medieval European chroniclers , but , at those times , were not recognized as reappearances of the same object . The comet 's periodicity was first determined in 1705 by English astronomer Edmond Halley , after whom it is now named . During its 1986 apparition , Halley 's Comet became the first comet to be observed in detail by spacecraft , providing the first observational data on the structure of a comet nucleus and the mechanism of coma and tail formation . These observations supported a number of longstanding hypotheses about comet construction , particularly Fred Whipple 's dirty snowball model , which correctly predicted that Halley would be composed of a mixture of volatile ices - such as water , carbon dioxide , and ammonia - and dust . The missions also provided data that substantially reformed and reconfigured these ideas ; for instance , it is now understood that the surface of Halley is largely composed of dusty , non-volatile materials , and that only a small portion of it is icy .",

  "/wiki/Transit_of_Mercury": "A transit of Mercury across the Sun takes place when the planet Mercury passes directly ( transits ) between the Sun and a superior planet , becoming visible against ( and hence obscuring a small portion of ) the solar disk . During a transit , Mercury appears as a tiny black dot moving across the disk of the Sun . Transits of Mercury with respect to Earth are much more frequent than transits of Venus , with about 13 or 14 per century , in part because Mercury is closer to the Sun and orbits it more rapidly . Transits of Mercury occur in May or November . The last four transits occurred on May 7 , 2003 ; November 8 , 2006 ; May 9 , 2016 ; and November 11 , 2019 . The next will occur on November 13 , 2032 . A typical transit lasts several hours . On June 3 , 2014 , the Mars rover Curiosity observed the planet Mercury transiting the Sun , marking the first time a planetary transit has been observed from a celestial body besides Earth . More generally , transits can also occur for Venus and were investigated in the context of searching for the hypothetical inner planet Vulcan .",
  "/wiki/Principia_Mathematica_(Newton)": "Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica ( Latin for Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy ) , often referred to as simply the Principia ( /pr\u026an\u02c8s\u026api\u0259 , pr\u026an\u02c8k\u026api\u0259/ ) , is a work in three books by Isaac Newton , in Latin , first published 5 July 1687 . After annotating and correcting his personal copy of the first edition , Newton published two further editions , in 1713 and 1726 . The Principia states Newton 's laws of motion , forming the foundation of classical mechanics ; Newton 's law of universal gravitation ; and a derivation of Kepler 's laws of planetary motion ( which Kepler first obtained empirically ) . The Principia is considered one of the most important works in the history of science . The French mathematical physicist Alexis Clairaut assessed it in 1747 : The famous book of Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy marked the epoch of a great revolution in physics . The method followed by its illustrious author Sir Newton . spread the light of mathematics on a science which up to then had remained in the darkness of conjectures and hypotheses . A more recent assessment has been that while acceptance of Newton 's theories was not immediate , by the end of the century after publication in 1687 , no one could deny that ( out of the Principia ) a science had emerged that , at least in certain respects , so far exceeded anything that had ever gone before that it stood alone as the ultimate exemplar of science generally . In formulating his physical theories , Newton developed and used mathematical methods now included in the field of calculus . But the language of calculus as we know it was largely absent from the Principia ; Newton gave many of his proofs in a geometric form of infinitesimal calculus , based on limits of ratios of vanishing small geometric quantities . In a revised conclusion to the Principia ( see General Scholium ) , Newton used his expression that became famous , Hypotheses non fingo ( I feign no hypotheses ) .",

He appointed John Bainbridge as the first professor , who took up his duties in 1620 or 1621 . There have been 21 astronomy professors in all ; Steven Balbus , the professor as of 2015 [ update ] , was appointed in 2012 .

As well as minting circulating coins for use domestically and internationally , the mint also produces planchets , commemorative coins , various types of medals and precious metal bullion . The mint exports to an average of 60 countries a year , making up 70% of its total sales . Formed over 1,100 years ago , the mint was historically part of a series of mints that became centralised to produce coins for the Kingdom of England , all of Great Britain and eventually most of the British Empire . The original London mint from which the Royal Mint is the successor was established in 886 AD and operated within the Tower of London for approximately 800 years before moving to what is now called Royal Mint Court where it remained until the 1960s . As Britain followed the rest of the world in decimalising its currency , the Mint moved from London to a new 38 acres ( 15 ha ) plant in Llantrisant , Glamorgan , Wales , where it has remained since . In 2009 , after recommendations for the mint to be privatised , The Royal Mint ceased being an executive government agency and became a state-owned company wholly owned by HM Treasury .

  "/wiki/Royal_Navy": "The Royal Navy ( RN ) is the United Kingdom 's naval warfare force . Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels .",

Styled Viscount Parker from 1721 to 1732 , he was Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Wallingford from 1722 to 1727 , but his interests were not in politics . In 1722 he became a fellow of the Royal Society , and he spent most of his time in astronomical observations at his Oxfordshire seat , Shirburn Castle , which had been bought by his father in 1716 ; here he built an observatory and a chemical laboratory . He was very prominent in effecting the changeover to the Gregorian calendar , which came into effect in 1752 . His action in this matter , however , was somewhat unpopular , as the opinion was fairly general that he had robbed the people of eleven days . When his son ran for parliament as a Whig in 1754 , resentment over his role in the calendar reform was one of many issues raised by the son 's Tory opponents ; a famous 1755 Hogarth painting influenced by the events of these elections is the main historical source for the Give us our eleven days slogan . From 1752 until his death , Macclesfield was president of the Royal Society , and he made some observations on the great 1755 Lisbon earthquake . In 1750 Macclesfield was offered the honorary position of vice president of the Foundling Hospital , which he accepted and kept until his death in 1764 .

  "/wiki/Annular_solar_eclipse": "A solar eclipse occurs when a portion of the Earth is engulfed in a shadow cast by the Moon which fully or partially blocks sunlight . This occurs when the Sun , Moon and Earth are aligned . Such alignment coincides with a new moon ( syzygy ) indicating the Moon is closest to the ecliptic plane . In a total eclipse , the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon . In partial and annular eclipses , only part of the Sun is obscured . If the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit , a little closer to the Earth , and in the same orbital plane , there would be total solar eclipses every new moon . However , since the Moon 's orbit is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the Earth 's orbit around the Sun , its shadow usually misses Earth . A solar eclipse can only occur when the Moon is close enough to the ecliptic plane during a new moon . Special conditions must occur for the two events to coincide because the Moon 's orbit crosses the ecliptic at its orbital nodes twice every draconic month ( 27.212220 days ) while a new moon occurs one every synodic month ( 29.530587981 days ) . Solar ( and lunar ) eclipses therefore happen only during eclipse seasons resulting in at least two , and up to five , solar eclipses each year ; no more than two of which can be total eclipses . Total eclipses are rare because the timing of the new moon within the eclipse season needs to be more exact for an alignment between the observer ( on Earth ) and the centers of the Sun and Moon . In addition , the elliptical orbit of the Moon often takes it far enough away from Earth that its apparent size is not large enough to block the Sun entirely .",

As such , it is an academic rank , and not a postgraduate qualification . No further examination or study is required for this promotion . This practice differs from most other universities worldwide , at which the degree reflects further postgraduate study or achievement . These degrees are therefore sometimes referred to as the Oxford and Cambridge MA and the Dublin or Trinity MA , to draw attention to the difference . However , as with gaining a postgraduate degree from another university , once incepted and promoted to a Master , the graduate no longer wears the academic dress or uses the post-nominal letters pertaining to a Bachelor of Arts , being no longer of that rank : i.e . the Master of Arts degree is not awarded separately ( for instance , in addition to that of Bachelor of Arts ) , but rather the new rank is treated as a conversion of one degree to another .

  "/wiki/Conic_section": "In mathematics , a conic section ( or simply conic ) is a curve obtained as the intersection of the surface of a cone with a plane . The three types of conic section are the hyperbola , the parabola , and the ellipse ; the circle is a special case of the ellipse , though historically it was sometimes called a fourth type . The ancient Greek mathematicians studied conic sections , culminating around 200 BC with Apollonius of Perga 's systematic work on their properties . The conic sections in the Euclidean plane have various distinguishing properties , many of which can be used as alternative definitions . One such property defines a non-circular conic to be the set of those points whose distances to some particular point , called a focus , and some particular line , called a directrix , are in a fixed ratio , called the eccentricity . The type of conic is determined by the value of the eccentricity . In analytic geometry , a conic may be defined as a plane algebraic curve of degree 2 ; that is , as the set of points whose coordinates satisfy a quadratic equation in two variables . This equation may be written in matrix form , and some geometric properties can be studied as algebraic conditions . In the Euclidean plane , the three types of conic sections appear quite different , but share many properties . By extending the Euclidean plane to include a line at infinity , obtaining a projective plane , the apparent difference vanishes : the branches of a hyperbola meet in two points at infinity , making it a single closed curve ; and the two ends of a parabola meet to make it a closed curve tangent to the line at infinity . Further extension , by expanding the real coordinates to admit complex coordinates , provides the means to see this unification algebraically .",

Although few details of his life are known , he is regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity . Generally considered the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time , Archimedes anticipated modern calculus and analysis by applying concepts of infinitesimals and the method of exhaustion to derive and rigorously prove a range of geometrical theorems , including the area of a circle , the surface area and volume of a sphere , and the area under a parabola . Other mathematical achievements include deriving an accurate approximation of pi , defining and investigating the spiral bearing his name , and creating a system using exponentiation for expressing very large numbers . He was also one of the first to apply mathematics to physical phenomena , founding hydrostatics and statics , including an explanation of the principle of the lever . He is credited with designing innovative machines , such as his screw pump , compound pulleys , and defensive war machines to protect his native Syracuse from invasion . Archimedes died during the Siege of Syracuse when he was killed by a Roman soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed . Cicero describes visiting the tomb of Archimedes , which was surmounted by a sphere and a cylinder , which Archimedes had requested be placed on his tomb to represent his mathematical discoveries . Unlike his inventions , the mathematical writings of Archimedes were little known in antiquity . Mathematicians from Alexandria read and quoted him , but the first comprehensive compilation was not made until c. 530 AD by Isidore of Miletus in Byzantine Constantinople , while commentaries on the works of Archimedes written by Eutocius in the sixth century AD opened them to wider readership for the first time . The relatively few copies of Archimedes ' written work that survived through the Middle Ages were an influential source of ideas for scientists during the Renaissance , while the discovery in 1906 of previously unknown works by Archimedes in the Archimedes Palimpsest has provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical results .",

[ I ] His proposition that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors is now widely accepted , and considered a foundational concept in science . In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace , he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection , in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding . Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history , and he was honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey . Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species . By the 1870s , the scientific community and a majority of the educated public had accepted evolution as a fact . However , many favoured competing explanations which gave only a minor role to natural selection , and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution . Darwin 's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences , explaining the diversity of life . Darwin 's early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at the University of Edinburgh ; instead , he helped to investigate marine invertebrates . Studies at the University of Cambridge ( Christ 's College ) encouraged his passion for natural science . His five-year voyage on HMS Beagle established him as an eminent geologist whose observations and theories supported Charles Lyell 's conception of gradual geological change , and publication of his journal of the voyage made him famous as a popular author . Puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on the voyage , Darwin began detailed investigations , and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection .",

  "/wiki/Elliptic_function": "In complex analysis , an elliptic function is a meromorphic function that is periodic in two directions . Just as a periodic function of a real variable is defined by its values on an interval , an elliptic function is determined by its values on a fundamental parallelogram , which then repeat in a lattice . Such a doubly periodic function can not be holomorphic , as it would then be a bounded entire function , and by Liouville 's theorem every such function must be constant . In fact , an elliptic function must have at least two poles ( counting multiplicity ) in a fundamental parallelogram , as it is easy to show using the periodicity that a contour integral around its boundary must vanish , implying that the residues of all simple poles must cancel . Historically , elliptic functions were first discovered by Niels Henrik Abel as inverse functions of elliptic integrals , and their theory was improved by Carl Gustav Jacobi ; these in turn were studied in connection with the problem of the arc length of an ellipse , whence the name derives . Jacobi 's elliptic functions have found numerous applications in physics , and were used by Jacobi to prove some results in elementary number theory . A more complete study of elliptic functions was later undertaken by Karl Weierstrass , who found a simple elliptic function in terms of which all the others could be expressed . Besides their practical use in the evaluation of integrals and the explicit solution of certain differential equations , they have deep connections with elliptic curves and modular forms .",
  "/wiki/Number_theory": "Number theory ( or arithmetic or higher arithmetic in older usage ) is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers and integer-valued functions . German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss ( 1777-1855 ) said , Mathematics is the queen of the sciences - and number theory is the queen of mathematics . Number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of objects made out of integers ( for example , rational numbers ) or defined as generalizations of the integers ( for example , algebraic integers ) . Number theory seeks to understand the properties of integer systems in spite of their apparent complexity . Integers can be considered either in themselves or as solutions to equations ( Diophantine geometry ) . Questions in number theory are often best understood through the study of analytical objects ( for example , the Riemann zeta function ) that encode properties of the integers , primes or other number-theoretic objects in some fashion ( analytic number theory ) . One may also study real numbers in relation to rational numbers , for example , as approximated by the latter ( Diophantine approximation ) . The older term for number theory is arithmetic . By the early twentieth century , it had been superseded by number theory . [ note 1 ] ( The word arithmetic is used by the general public to mean elementary calculations ; it has also acquired other meanings in mathematical logic , as in Peano arithmetic , and computer science , as in floating point arithmetic . ) The use of the term arithmetic for number theory regained some ground in the second half of the 20th century , arguably in part due to French influence .

The university has over 52,000 distance learning external students and 161,270 campus-based internal students , making it the largest university by number of students in the United Kingdom . The university was established by royal charter in 1836 , as a degree-awarding examination board for students holding certificates from University College London and King 's College London and other such other Institutions , corporate or unincorporated , as shall be established for the purpose of Education , whether within the Metropolis or elsewhere within our United Kingdom , allowing it to be one of three institutions to claim the title of the third-oldest university in England , [ b ] and moved to a federal structure in 1900 . It is now incorporated by its fourth ( 1863 ) royal charter and governed by the University of London Act 2018 . It was the first university in the United Kingdom to introduce examinations for women in 1869 and , a decade later , the first to admit women to degrees . In 1948 it became the first British university to appoint a woman as its vice chancellor ( chief executive ) . [ c ] The university 's member institutions house the oldest teaching hospitals in England . For most practical purposes , ranging from admissions to funding , the member institutions operate on an independent basis , with many awarding their own degrees whilst remaining in the federal university . The largest colleges by enrolment as of 2016/17 are UCL , King 's College London , City , Queen Mary , Birkbeck , the London School of Economics , Royal Holloway , and Goldsmiths , each of which has over 9,000 students . Smaller , more specialist , colleges are the School of Oriental and African Studies ( SOAS ) , St George 's ( medicine ) , the Royal Veterinary College , London Business School , the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama , the Royal Academy of Music , the Courtauld Institute of Art , and the Institute of Cancer Research .

Founded in 1379 by William of Wykeham , the full name of the college is St Mary 's College of Winchester in Oxford . The name New College , however , soon came to be used following its completion in 1386 to distinguish it from the older existing college of St Mary , now known as Oriel College . In 2017 , the college ranked first in the Norrington Table , a table assessing the relative performance of Oxford 's undergraduates in final examinations . Historically , it has been ranked highly . It has the 3rd highest average Norrington Table ranking over the previous decade . The college is between Holywell Street and New College Lane ( known for Oxford 's Bridge of Sighs ) , next to All Souls College , Harris Manchester College , Hertford College , The Queen 's College and St Edmund Hall . The college 's sister college is King 's College , Cambridge . The college is one of the main choral foundations of the University of Oxford . The college choir is regarded as one of the leading choirs of the world , and has recorded over one hundred albums ; it has been awarded two Gramophone Awards . Like many of Oxford 's colleges , New College admitted its first mixed-sex cohort in 1979 , after six centuries as an institution for men only .",
  "/wiki/Second_Wrangler": "At the University of Cambridge in England , a Wrangler is a student who gains first-class honours in the third year of the University 's undergraduate degree in mathematics . The highest-scoring student is the Senior Wrangler , the second highest is the Second Wrangler , and so on . At the other end of the scale , the person who achieves the lowest exam marks while still earning a third-class honours degree ( that is , while still earning an honours degree at all ) is known as the wooden spoon . Until 1909 , the University made the rankings public . Since 1910 it has publicly revealed only the class of degree gained by each student . An examiner reveals the identity of the Senior Wrangler unofficially by tipping his hat when reading out the person 's name , but other rankings are communicated to each student privately . Therefore , the names of only some 20th-century Senior Wranglers ( such as Crispin Nash-Williams , Christopher Budd , Frank P. Ramsey , Donald Coxeter , Kevin Buzzard , Jayant Narlikar , George Reid and Ben J . Green ) have become publicly known . Another notable was Philippa Fawcett . She was educated at Newnham College , Cambridge which had been co-founded by her mother . In 1890 , Fawcett became the first woman to obtain the top score in the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos exams . Her score was 13 per cent higher than the second highest score .",

  "/wiki/Actuary": "An actuary is a business professional who deals with the measurement and management of risk and uncertainty ( BeAnActuary 2011a ) . The name of the corresponding field is actuarial science . These risks can affect both sides of the balance sheet and require asset management , liability management , and valuation skills ( BeAnActuary 2011b ) . Actuaries provide assessments of financial security systems , with a focus on their complexity , their mathematics , and their mechanisms ( Trowbridge 1989 , p. 7 ) . While the concept of insurance dates to antiquity ( Johnston 1903 , \u00a7475-\u00a7476 , Loan 1992 , Lewin 2007 , pp . 3-4 ) , the concepts needed to scientifically measure and mitigate risks have their origins in the 17th century studies of probability and annuities ( Heywood 1985 ) . Actuaries of the 21st century require analytical skills , business knowledge , and an understanding of human behavior and information systems to design and manage programs that control risk ( BeAnActuary 2011c ) . The actual steps needed to become an actuary are usually country-specific ; however , almost all processes share a rigorous schooling or examination structure and take many years to complete ( Feldblum 2001 , p. 6 , Institute and Faculty of Actuaries 2014 ) . The profession has consistently been ranked as one of the most desirable ( Riley 2013 ) . In various studies , being an actuary was ranked number one or two multiple times since 2010 ( Thomas 2012 , Weber 2013 , CareerCast 2015 ) .",

  "/wiki/Prime_number": "A prime number ( or a prime ) is a natural number greater than 1 that can not be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers . A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number . For example , 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product , 1 \u00d7 5 or 5 \u00d7 1 , involve 5 itself . However , 6 is composite because it is the product of two numbers ( 2 \u00d7 3 ) that are both smaller than 6 . Primes are central in number theory because of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic : every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorized as a product of primes that is unique up to their order . The property of being prime is called primality . A simple but slow method of checking the primality of a given number n { \\displaystyle n } , called trial division , tests whether n { \\displaystyle n } is a multiple of any integer between 2 and n { \\displaystyle { \\sqrt { n } } } . Faster algorithms include the Miller-Rabin primality test , which is fast but has a small chance of error , and the AKS primality test , which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical . Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms , such as Mersenne numbers . As of December 2018 [ update ] the largest known prime number has 24,862,048 decimal digits . There are infinitely many primes , as demonstrated by Euclid around 300 BC . No known simple formula separates prime numbers from composite numbers .",

Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics , he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis , number theory , infinite series , and continued fractions , including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable . Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation : He tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians in his work , but failed for the most part . What he had to show them was too novel , too unfamiliar , and additionally presented in unusual ways ; they could not be bothered . Seeking mathematicians who could better understand his work , in 1913 he began a postal partnership with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge , England . Recognizing Ramanujan 's work as extraordinary , Hardy arranged for him to travel to Cambridge . In his notes , Ramanujan had produced groundbreaking new theorems , including some that Hardy said had defeated him and his colleagues completely , [ This quote needs a citation ] in addition to rediscovering recently proven but highly advanced results . During his short life , Ramanujan independently compiled nearly 3,900 results ( mostly identities and equations ) . Many were completely novel ; his original and highly unconventional results , such as the Ramanujan prime , the Ramanujan theta function , partition formulae and mock theta functions , have opened entire new areas of work and inspired a vast amount of further research . Nearly all his claims have now been proven correct . The Ramanujan Journal , a scientific journal , was established to publish work in all areas of mathematics influenced by Ramanujan , and his notebooks - containing summaries of his published and unpublished results - have been analyzed and studied for decades since his death as a source of new mathematical ideas . As late as 2011 and again in 2012 , researchers continued to discover that mere comments in his writings about simple properties and similar outputs for certain findings were themselves profound and subtle number theory results that remained unsuspected until nearly a century after his death .",

  "/wiki/Population_genetics": "Population genetics is a subfield of genetics that deals with genetic differences within and between populations , and is a part of evolutionary biology . Studies in this branch of biology examine such phenomena as adaptation , speciation , and population structure . Population genetics was a vital ingredient in the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis . Its primary founders were Sewall Wright , J . B. S. Haldane and Ronald Fisher , who also laid the foundations for the related discipline of quantitative genetics . Traditionally a highly mathematical discipline , modern population genetics encompasses theoretical , lab , and field work . Population genetic models are used both for statistical inference from DNA sequence data and for proof/disproof of concept . What sets population genetics apart today from newer , more phenotypic approaches to modelling evolution , such as evolutionary game theory and adaptive dynamics , is its emphasis on genetic phenomena as dominance , epistasis , and the degree to which genetic recombination breaks up linkage disequilibrium . This makes it appropriate for comparison to population genomics data .",
  "/wiki/Hardy\u2013Weinberg_principle": "The Hardy-Weinberg principle , also known as the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium , model , theorem , or law , states that allele and genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences . These influences include genetic drift , mate choice , assortative mating , natural selection , sexual selection , mutation , gene flow , meiotic drive , genetic hitchhiking , population bottleneck , founder effect and inbreeding . In the simplest case of a single locus with two alleles denoted A and a with frequencies f ( A ) = p and f ( a ) = q , respectively , the expected genotype frequencies under random mating are f ( AA ) = p2 for the AA homozygotes , f ( aa ) = q2 for the aa homozygotes , and f ( Aa ) = 2pq for the heterozygotes . In the absence of selection , mutation , genetic drift , or other forces , allele frequencies p and q are constant between generations , so equilibrium is reached . The principle is named after G. H. Hardy and Wilhelm Weinberg , who first demonstrated it mathematically . Hardy 's paper was focused on debunking the then-commonly held view that a dominant allele would automatically tend to increase in frequency ; today , confusion between dominance and selection is less common . Today , tests for Hardy-Weinberg genotype frequencies are used primarily to test for population stratification and other forms of non-random mating .",

It is bordered on the north and east by the state of New York ; on the east , southeast , and south by the Atlantic Ocean ; on the west by the Delaware River and Pennsylvania ; and on the southwest by the Delaware Bay and the State of Delaware . New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state by area but the 11th-most populous , with 9 million residents as of 2017 and an area of 8,722.58 square miles , making it the most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states , with its biggest city being Newark . New Jersey lies completely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia . New Jersey was the second-wealthiest U.S. state by median household income as of 2017 . New Jersey was inhabited by Native Americans for more than 2,800 years , with historical tribes such as the Lenape along the coast . In the early 17th century , the Dutch and the Swedes founded the first European settlements in the state . The English later seized control of the region , naming it the Province of New Jersey after the largest of the Channel Islands , Jersey , and granting it as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley , 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton . New Jersey was the site of several important battles during the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century . In the 19th century , factories in the cities Camden , Paterson , Newark , Trenton , Jersey City , and Elizabeth ( known as the Big Six ) , helped drive the Industrial Revolution . New Jersey 's geographic location at the center of the Northeast megalopolis , between Boston and New York City to the northeast , and Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Washington , D.C. , to the southwest , fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century . At the turn of the 21st century , this suburbanization began reverting with the consolidation of New Jersey 's culturally diverse populace toward more urban settings within the state , with towns home to commuter rail stations outpacing the population growth of more automobile-oriented suburbs since 2008 .",

  "/wiki/K-theory": "In mathematics , K-theory is , roughly speaking , the study of a ring generated by vector bundles over a topological space or scheme . In algebraic topology , it is a cohomology theory known as topological K-theory . In algebra and algebraic geometry , it is referred to as algebraic K-theory . It is also a fundamental tool in the field of operator algebras . It can be seen as the study of certain kinds of invariants of large matrices . K-theory involves the construction of families of K-functors that map from topological spaces or schemes to associated rings ; these rings reflect some aspects of the structure of the original spaces or schemes . As with functors to groups in algebraic topology , the reason for this functorial mapping is that it is easier to compute some topological properties from the mapped rings than from the original spaces or schemes . Examples of results gleaned from the K-theory approach include the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem , Bott periodicity , the Atiyah-Singer index theorem , and the Adams operations . In high energy physics , K-theory and in particular twisted K-theory have appeared in Type II string theory where it has been conjectured that they classify D-branes , Ramond-Ramond field strengths and also certain spinors on generalized complex manifolds . In condensed matter physics K-theory has been used to classify topological insulators , superconductors and stable Fermi surfaces . For more details , see K-theory ( physics ) .",

A topological space is a set endowed with a structure , called a topology , which allows defining continuous deformation of subspaces , and , more generally , all kinds of continuity . Euclidean spaces , and , more generally , metric spaces are examples of a topological space , as any distance or metric defines a topology . The deformations that are considered in topology are homeomorphisms and homotopies . A property that is invariant under such deformations is a topological property . Basic examples of topological properties are : the dimension , which allows distinguishing between a line and a surface ; compactness , which allows distinguishing between a line and a circle ; connectedness , which allows distinguishing a circle from two non-intersecting circles . The ideas underlying topology go back to Gottfried Leibniz , who in the 17th century envisioned the geometria situs and analysis situs . Leonhard Euler 's Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg problem and polyhedron formula are arguably the field 's first theorems . The term topology was introduced by Johann Benedict Listing in the 19th century , although it was not until the first decades of the 20th century that the idea of a topological space was developed .",

The proposition was first conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 in the margin of a copy of Arithmetica ; Fermat added that he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin . However , there were doubts that he had a correct proof because his claim was published by his son without his consent and after his death .

The oldest buildings , in the first quadrangle , date from the 16th and early 17th centuries ; a second quadrangle was added between about 1640 and about 1713 , and a third quadrangle was built in about 1906 . Further accommodation was built on the main site to mark the 400th anniversary of the college , in 1971 , and student flats have been constructed at sites in north and east Oxford . The life of the college was disrupted by the English Civil War . Leoline Jenkins , who became principal after the war in 1661 , put the college on a more stable financial footing . Little happened at the college during the 18th century , and the 19th century saw a decline in numbers and academic standards .

  "/wiki/Rouse_Ball_Professor_of_Mathematics": "The Rouse Ball Professorship of Mathematics is one of the senior chairs in the Mathematics Departments at the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford . The two positions were founded in 1927 by a bequest from the mathematician W. W. Rouse Ball . At Cambridge , this bequest was made with the hope ( but not making it in any way a condition ) that it might be found practicable for such Professor or Reader to include in his or her lectures and treatment historical and philosophical aspects of the subject .",
  "/wiki/Differential_geometry": "Differential geometry is a mathematical discipline that uses the techniques of differential calculus , integral calculus , linear algebra and multilinear algebra to study problems in geometry . The theory of plane and space curves and surfaces in the three-dimensional Euclidean space formed the basis for development of differential geometry during the 18th century and the 19th century . Since the late 19th century , differential geometry has grown into a field concerned more generally with the geometric structures on differentiable manifolds . Differential geometry is closely related to differential topology and the geometric aspects of the theory of differential equations . The differential geometry of surfaces captures many of the key ideas and techniques endemic to this field .",
  "/wiki/Algebraic_geometry": "Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics , classically studying zeros of multivariate polynomials . Modern algebraic geometry is based on the use of abstract algebraic techniques , mainly from commutative algebra , for solving geometrical problems about these sets of zeros . The fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry are algebraic varieties , which are geometric manifestations of solutions of systems of polynomial equations . Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are : plane algebraic curves , which include lines , circles , parabolas , ellipses , hyperbolas , cubic curves like elliptic curves , and quartic curves like lemniscates and Cassini ovals . A point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation . Basic questions involve the study of the points of special interest like the singular points , the inflection points and the points at infinity . More advanced questions involve the topology of the curve and relations between the curves given by different equations . Algebraic geometry occupies a central place in modern mathematics and has multiple conceptual connections with such diverse fields as complex analysis , topology and number theory . Initially a study of systems of polynomial equations in several variables , the subject of algebraic geometry starts where equation solving leaves off , and it becomes even more important to understand the intrinsic properties of the totality of solutions of a system of equations , than to find a specific solution ; this leads into some of the deepest areas in all of mathematics , both conceptually and in terms of technique . In the 20th century , algebraic geometry split into several subareas .",
  "/wiki/Hyperk\u00e4hler_manifold": "In differential geometry , a hyperk\u00e4hler manifold is a Riemannian manifold of dimension 4 k { \\displaystyle 4k } and holonomy group contained in Sp ( k ) ( here Sp ( k ) denotes a compact form of a symplectic group , identified with the group of quaternionic-linear unitary endomorphisms of a k { \\displaystyle k } -dimensional quaternionic Hermitian space ) . Hyperk\u00e4hler manifolds are special classes of K\u00e4hler manifolds . They can be thought of as quaternionic analogues of K\u00e4hler manifolds . All hyperk\u00e4hler manifolds are Ricci-flat and are thus Calabi-Yau manifolds ( this can be easily seen by noting that Sp ( k ) is a subgroup of the special unitary group SU ( 2k ) ) . Hyperk\u00e4hler manifolds were defined by Eugenio Calabi in 1978 .",
  "/wiki/Symplectic_manifold": "In differential geometry , a subject of mathematics , a symplectic manifold is a smooth manifold , M { \\displaystyle M } , equipped with a closed nondegenerate differential 2-form \u03c9 { \\displaystyle \\omega } , called the symplectic form . The study of symplectic manifolds is called symplectic geometry or symplectic topology . Symplectic manifolds arise naturally in abstract formulations of classical mechanics and analytical mechanics as the cotangent bundles of manifolds . For example , in the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics , which provides one of the major motivations for the field , the set of all possible configurations of a system is modeled as a manifold , and this manifold 's cotangent bundle describes the phase space of the system .",

  "/wiki/Harvard": "Harvard University is a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge , Massachusetts , with about 6,800 undergraduate students and about 14,000 postgraduate students . Established in 1636 and named for its first benefactor , clergyman John Harvard , Harvard is the United States ' oldest institution of higher learning . Its history , influence , wealth , and academic reputation have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world . The Harvard Corporation , chartered in 1650 , is the governing body of Harvard . In its early years , Harvard College primarily trained Congregational and Unitarian clergy , although it has never been formally affiliated with any denomination . Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century , and by the 19th century , Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites . Following the American Civil War , President Charles W. Eliot 's long tenure ( 1869-1909 ) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university ; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900 . A. Lawrence Lowell , who succeeded Eliot , further reformed the undergraduate curriculum and undertook aggressive expansion of Harvard 's land holdings and physical campus . James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II ; he began to liberalize admissions after the war . The university is organized into eleven principal academic units - ten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study - with campuses throughout Greater Boston : its 209-acre ( 85 ha ) original undergraduate campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge , approximately 3 miles ( 5 km ) northwest of Boston ; the business school and many athletics facilities , including Harvard Stadium , are across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston ; and the medical , dental , and public health schools are in the Longwood Medical Area . Harvard 's endowment is worth $ 40.9 billion , making it the largest of any academic institution . Harvard is a large , highly residential research university ."
