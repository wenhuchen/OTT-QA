Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",

It is one of the fastest growing cities in the world and one of the most populous urban areas . Lagos is a major financial centre in Africa ; the megacity has the fourth-highest GDP in Africa and houses one of the largest and busiest seaports on the continent . Lagos initially emerged as a port city that originated on a collection of islands , which are contained in the present day Local Government Areas ( LGAs ) of Lagos Island , Eti-Osa , Amuwo-Odofin and Apapa . The islands are separated by creeks , fringing the southwest mouth of Lagos Lagoon , while being protected from the Atlantic Ocean by barrier islands and long sand spits such as Bar Beach , which stretch up to 100 km ( 62 mi ) east and west of the mouth . Due to rapid urbanization , the city expanded to the west of the lagoon to include areas in the present day Lagos Mainland , Ajeromi-Ifelodun and Surulere . This led to the classification of Lagos into two main areas : the Island , which was the initial city of Lagos , before it expanded into the area known as the Mainland . This city area was governed directly by the Federal Government through the Lagos City Council , until the creation of Lagos State in 1967 , which led to the splitting of Lagos city into the present day seven Local Government Areas ( LGAs ) , and an addition of other towns ( which now make up 13 LGAs ) from the then Western Region to form the state . Lagos , the capital of Nigeria since its amalgamation in 1914 , went on to become the capital of Lagos State after its creation . However , the state capital was later moved to Ikeja in 1976 , and the federal capital moved to Abuja in 1991 .
