[ m\u0259l\u0259ja\u02d0\u026d\u0259m ] ) is a Dravidian language spoken in the Indian state of Kerala and the union territories of Lakshadweep and Puducherry ( Mah\u00e9 district ) by the Malayali people . It is one of 22 scheduled languages of India spoken by nearly 2.88% of Indians . Malayalam has official language status in the state of Kerala and in the union territories of Lakshadweep and Puducherry ( Mah\u00e9 ) and is spoken by 37 million people worldwide . Malayalam is also spoken by linguistic minorities in the neighbouring states ; with significant number of speakers in the Nilgiris , Kanyakumari , and Coimbatore districts of Tamil Nadu , and Kodagu and Dakshina Kannada districts of Karnataka . Due to Malayali expatriates in the Persian Gulf , the language is also widely spoken in Gulf countries . The origin of Malayalam remains a matter of dispute among scholars . One view holds that Malayalam and modern Tamil are offshoots of Middle Tamil and separated from it sometime after the c. 7th century AD . A second view argues for the development of the two languages out of Proto-Dravidian or Proto-Tamil-Malayalam in the prehistoric era . Designated a Classical Language in India in 2013 , it developed into the current form mainly by the influence of the poet Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan in the 16th century . The oldest documents written purely in Malayalam and still surviving are the Vazhappalli Copper plates from 832 AD and Tharisapalli Copper plates from 849 AD . The earliest script used to write Malayalam was the Vatteluttu alphabet , and later the Kolezhuttu , which derived from it .",

The title of the work refers to the matrilineal system that prevailed in the Nair community in the erstwhile southern Travancore . A prominent feature of the matrilineal system was that properties were enjoyed by successors of the women in the family . The women were educated and bold , with mothers often being stronger than fathers . They enjoyed freedom in all respects [ citation needed ] . However , when the system was marginalized in the 1940s , women lost all their powers and soon became 'slaves ' in the hands of a feudal male-dominated society [ citation needed ] . The movie exposes the complexities of a period of transition from a matrilineal to patrilineal society.Ozhimuri means 'divorce record ' in both Tamil and Malayalam . In the matrilineal system , women were free to divorce their husbands if they were not having a sound relationship ."
