  "/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering_formats": "Magic : The Gathering formats are various ways in which the Magic : The Gathering collectible card game can be played . Each format provides rules for deck construction and gameplay , with many confining the pool of permitted cards to those released in a specified group of Magic card sets . The DCI , the governing body that oversees official Magic competitive play , categorizes its tournament formats into Constructed and Limited . Constructed formats require decks to be made prior to participation , with players allowed to use any tournament-legal cards they possess . Sanctioned Constructed formats include Standard , Modern , Legacy , and Vintage . Limited formats , in contrast , utilize a restricted and unknown pool of cards , usually formed by opening Magic products . Limited competition require players to select cards and build decks on the fly within the tournament itself . The primary two sanctioned Limited formats are Sealed Deck and Booster Draft . A number of other formats have been designed by Wizards of the Coast or by players for custom gameplay or reduced investment cost ; these are known as casual formats . Some casual formats utilize rules or sets of cards that differ from those used in sanctioned tournament play .",
  "/wiki/Calendar_date": "A calendar date is a reference to a particular day represented within a calendar system . The calendar date allows the specific day to be identified . The number of days between two dates may be calculated . For example , 24 February 2020 is ten days after 14 February 2020 in the Gregorian calendar . The date of a particular event depends on the observed time zone . For example , the air attack on Pearl Harbor that began at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian time on 7 December 1941 took place at 3:18 a.m. Japan Standard Time , 8 December in Japan . A particular day may be represented by a different date in another calendar as in the Gregorian calendar and the Julian calendar , which have been used simultaneously in different places . In most calendar systems , the date consists of three parts : the day of the month , the month , and the year . There may also be additional parts , such as the day of the week . Years are usually counted from a particular starting point , usually called the epoch , with era referring to the particular period of time ( note the different use of the terms in geology ) . The most widely used epoch is a conventional birthdate of Jesus ( which was established by Dionysius Exiguus in the sixth century ) . A date without the year may also be referred to as a date or calendar date ( such as 20 February rather than 20 February 2020 ) .",
