  "/wiki/Irish_people": "The Irish ( Irish : Muintir na h\u00c9ireann or Na h\u00c9ireannaigh ) are a nation and ethnic group native to the island of Ireland , who share a common Irish ancestry , identity and culture . Ireland has been inhabited for about 12,500 years according to archaeological studies ( see Prehistoric Ireland ) . For most of Ireland 's recorded history , the Irish have been primarily a Gaelic people ( see Gaelic Ireland ) . From the 9th century , small numbers of Vikings settled in Ireland , becoming the Norse-Gaels . Anglo-Normans conquered parts of Ireland in the 12th century , while England 's 16th/17th-century ( re ) conquest and colonisation of Ireland brought many English and Lowland Scots people to parts of the island , especially the north . Today , Ireland is made up of the Republic of Ireland ( an independent state ) and the smaller Northern Ireland ( a part of the United Kingdom ) . The people of Northern Ireland hold various national identities including British , Irish , Northern Irish or some combination thereof . The Irish have their own customs , language , music , dance , sports , cuisine and mythology . Although Irish ( Gaeilge ) was their main language in the past , today most Irish people speak English as their first language . Historically , the Irish nation was made up of kin groups or clans , and the Irish also had their own religion , law code , alphabet and style of dress . There have been many notable Irish people throughout history . After Ireland 's conversion to Christianity , Irish missionaries and scholars exerted great influence on Western Europe , and the Irish came to be seen as a nation of saints and scholars .",

  "/wiki/U.S._Route_12_in_Michigan": "US Highway 12 ( US 12 ) is an east-west US Highway that runs from Aberdeen , Washington , to Detroit , Michigan . In Michigan it runs for 210 miles ( 338 km ) between New Buffalo and Detroit as a state trunkline highway and Pure Michigan Byway . On its western end , the highway is mostly a two-lane road that runs through the southern tier of counties roughly parallel to the Indiana state line . It forms part of the Niles Bypass , a four-lane expressway south of Niles in the southwestern part of the state , and it runs concurrently with the Interstate 94 ( I-94 ) freeway around the south side of Ypsilanti in the southeastern . In between Coldwater and the Ann Arbor area , the highway angles northeasterly and passes the Michigan International Speedway . East of Ypsilanti , US 12 follows a divided highway routing on Michigan Avenue into Detroit , where it terminates at an intersection with Cass Avenue . When US 12 was designated in Michigan on November 11 , 1926 , along with the other original US Highways , it ran along a more northerly course . It originally replaced sections of the original M-11 and M-17 along Michigan Avenue in the state , the route of the much older St. Joseph Trail , a footpath used by Native Americans before European settlement in the area . It entered from Indiana as it does now , but it followed the Lake Michigan shoreline farther north to Benton Harbor-St. Joseph before turning eastward to run through Kalamazoo , Battle Creek and Jackson . In the Ann Arbor area , it followed a more northerly path into Detroit before terminating downtown . In the 1940s and 1950s , sections of the highway were converted into expressways and freeways . Starting in 1959 , these freeway segments were renumbered as part of I-94 , and in January 1962 , US 12 was shifted to replace US Highway 112 ( US 112 ) .",

When Detroit underwent rapid industrialization at the turn of the 20th century , the Detroit River became notoriously polluted and toxic . Since the late 20th century , however , a vast restoration effort has been undertaken because of the river 's ecological importance . In the early 21st century , the river today has a wide variety of economic and recreational uses .

  "/wiki/Mexican_cuisine": "Mexican cuisine began about 9000 years ago , when agricultural communities such as the Maya formed , domesticating maize , creating the standard process of maize nixtamalization , and establishing their foodways .

These included the Olmec , Teotihuacanos , Toltec , Huastec , Zapotec , Mixtec , Otomi , Pur\u00e9pecha , Totonac , Mazatec , and Mazahua . The Mexica establishment of the Aztec Empire created a multi-ethnic society where many different foodways became infused . The staples are native foods , such as corn ( maize ) , beans , squash , amaranth , chia , avocados , tomatoes , tomatillos , cacao , vanilla , agave , turkey , spirulina , sweet potato , cactus , and chili pepper . After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire in the 16th century and the subsequent conquest of the Maya area , Europeans introduced a number of other foods , the most important of which were meats from domesticated animals ( beef , pork , chicken , goat , and sheep ) , dairy products ( especially cheese and milk ) , and rice . While the Spanish initially tried to impose their own diet on the country , this was not possible . Asian and African influences were also introduced into the indigenous cuisine during this era as a result of African slavery in New Spain and the Manila-Acapulco Galleons . Over the centuries , this resulted in regional cuisines based on local conditions , such as those in Oaxaca , Veracruz and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula . Mexican cuisine is an important aspect of the culture , social structure and popular traditions of Mexico . The most important example of this connection is the use of mole for special occasions and holidays , particularly in the South and Central regions of the country . For this reason and others , traditional Mexican cuisine was inscribed in 2010 on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO .",
