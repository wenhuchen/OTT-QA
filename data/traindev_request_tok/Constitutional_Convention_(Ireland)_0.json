Fine Gael is currently the governing and largest party in Ireland in terms of members of the Oireachtas and Irish members of the European Parliament . The party has a membership of 21,000 and is the senior partner governing in a minority coalition with several independent politicians , with party leader Leo Varadkar serving as Taoiseach . Varadkar succeeded Enda Kenny as party leader on 2 June 2017 and as Taoiseach on 14 June ; Kenny had been leader since 2002 , and Taoiseach since 2011 . Fine Gael was founded on 8 September 1933 following the merger of its parent party Cumann na nGaedheal , the National Centre Party and the National Guard . Its origins lie in the struggle for Irish independence and the pro-Treaty side in the Irish Civil War and Michael Collins , in particular , is often identified as the founder of the movement . Fine Gael is generally considered to be more of a proponent of market liberalism than its traditional rival , Fianna F\u00e1il . Apart from brief minority governments ( as in 1987 ) , Fine Gael has rarely governed Ireland without a coalition that also included the Labour Party , a social-democratic , centre-left party . Fine Gael describes itself as a party of the progressive centre which it defines as acting in a way that is right for Ireland , regardless of dogma or ideology . It lists its core values as equality of opportunity , free enterprise and reward , security , integrity and hope . It is strongly in favour of the European Union and opposed to physical force Irish republicanism . The party 's youth wing , Young Fine Gael , was formed in 1977 , and has approximately four thousand members .",
