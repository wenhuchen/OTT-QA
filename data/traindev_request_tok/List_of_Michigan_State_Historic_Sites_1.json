US 131 runs as a freeway from south of Portage through to Manton in the north . Part of this freeway runs concurrently with Interstate 296 ( I-296 ) as an unsigned designation through Grand Rapids . US 131 forms an important corridor along the western side of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan , running through rural farm and forest lands as well as urban cityscapes . Various names have been applied to the roadway over the years . The oldest , the Mackinaw Trail , originated from an Indian trail in the area while other names honored politicians .

When the US Highway System was formed on November 11 , 1926 , US 131 was created along the route of M-13 in Michigan .
