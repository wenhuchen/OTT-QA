First flown on 10 January 1935 , the Lat\u00e9 521 achieved several world records relating to payload and endurance . It was introduced to passenger service by national operator Air France , who was able to launch several previously-unattainable long distance passenger routes . As a civilian aircraft , the Lat\u00e9 521 was outfitted as a luxurious airliner , providing a high level of comfort for up to 72 passengers . Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War , the Lat\u00e9 521 were taken over by the French Navy , who typically operated the type as a long distance maritime patrol aircraft . None survived the conflict due to intentional sabotage by the retreating German forces . The Lat\u00e9 521 was the basis of the single Lat\u00e9 522 Ville de Saint Pierre civil airliner , and the three Lat\u00e9 523 navalized variants ."
