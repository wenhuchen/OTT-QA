Born in Colchester , Connecticut , Trumbull established a law practice in Greenville , Georgia , before moving to Alton , Illinois , in 1837 . He served as the Illinois Secretary of State from 1841 to 1843 and as a justice of the Illinois Supreme Court from 1848 to 1853 . He was elected to the Senate in 1855 and became a member of the Republican Party . As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1861 to 1873 , he co-wrote the Thirteenth Amendment , which abolished slavery in the United States . In the 1868 impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson , Trumbull voted to acquit Johnson despite heavy pressure from other Republican senators . He was a candidate for the presidential nomination at the 1872 Liberal Republican convention but the fledgling party nominated Horace Greeley instead . Trumbull left the Senate in 1873 to establish a legal practice in Chicago . Before his death in 1896 , he became a member of the Populist Party and represented Eugene V. Debs before the Supreme Court .",
  "/wiki/US_Senate": "The United States Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress , which , along with the United States House of Representatives - the lower chamber - constitutes the legislature of the United States . The Senate chamber is located in the north wing of the Capitol Building , in Washington , D.C . The composition and powers of the Senate are established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The Senate is composed of senators , each of whom represents a single state in its entirety . Each state , regardless of its population size , is equally represented by two senators who serve staggered terms of six years . There being at present 50 states in the Union , there are currently 100 senators . From 1789 to 1913 , senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented ; they are now elected by popular vote , following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913 . As the upper chamber of Congress , the Senate has several powers of advice and consent which are unique to it . These include the approval of treaties , and the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries , Supreme Court justices , federal judges , flag officers , regulatory officials , ambassadors , other federal executive officials and other federal uniformed officers . In addition to these , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for vice president , the duty falls to the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office . Furthermore , the Senate has the responsibility of conducting the trials of those impeached by the House . The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms , smaller size , and statewide constituencies , which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere .",

  "/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)": "The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States , along with its main rival , the Republican Party . Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison 's Democratic-Republican Party , the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson , making it the world 's oldest active political party . In its early years , the Party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s , the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform . Well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings ; following the New Deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South . The New Deal Coalition of 1932-1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction - many of whom were Catholics based in the cities . After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the core bases of the two parties shifted , with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic . The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s . White evangelicals and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local levels since the 1990s . People living in urban areas , women , college graduates , sexual and gender minorities , millennials , and black , Latino , Jewish , Muslim and Asian Americans tend to support the Democratic Party . The Democratic Party 's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality , along with the welfare state . It seeks to provide government regulation in the economy .",

  "/wiki/Opposition_Party_(Northern_U.S.)": "The Opposition Party was a party identification under which Northern , anti-slavery politicians , formerly members of the Democratic and Whig parties , briefly ran in the 1850s . This was in response to the expansion of slavery into the new territories . It was one of the movements which arose from the political chaos in the decade before the American Civil War in the wake of the Compromise of 1850 . The movement arose before and was quickly subsumed by the coalescence of the Republican Party in 1856 . During the fragmenting of the Second Party System of Jackson Democrats and Clay Whigs , the Democratic efforts to expand slavery into western territories , particularly Kansas , led to organized political opposition , which coalesced in Congress as the Opposition Party . As the Whig Party disintegrated , many local and regional parties grew up , some ideological , some geographic . When they realized their numbers in Congress , they began to caucus in the same way US political parties had arisen before the Jacksonian national party conventions . Scholars such as Kenneth C. Martis have adopted a convention to explain the Congressional coordination of anti-Pierce and anti-Buchanan factions as the Opposition Party .",

He subsequently moved to Utah Territory because of ill health , and eventually returned to Lexington , Missouri , where he died in 1877 .",
  "/wiki/Know_Nothing": "The Know Nothing , formally known as the Native American Party and the American Party from 1855 onwards , was a far-right nativist political party and movement in the United States which operated nationwide in the mid-1850s . It was primarily an anti-Catholic , anti-immigration , and xenophobic movement , originally starting as a secret society . The Know Nothing movement also briefly emerged as a major political party in the form of the American Party . Adherents to the movement were to simply reply I know nothing when asked about its specifics by outsiders , providing the group with its common name . Supporters of the Know Nothing movement believed that an alleged Romanist conspiracy was being planned to subvert civil and religious liberty in the United States , and sought to politically organize native-born Protestants in what they described as a defense of their traditional religious and political values . The Know Nothing movement is remembered for this theme because of fears by Protestants that Catholic priests and bishops would control a large bloc of voters . In most places , the ideology and influence of the Know Nothing movement lasted only a year or two before disintegrating due to weak and inexperienced local leaders , a lack of publicly declared national leaders , and a deep split over the issue of slavery . In the South , the party did not emphasize anti-Catholicism as frequently as it did in the North , but it became the main alternative to the dominant Democratic Party . The collapse of the Whig Party after the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act left an opening for the emergence of a new major political party in opposition to the Democratic Party . The Know Nothing movement managed to elect congressman Nathaniel P. Banks of Massachusetts and several other individuals in the 1854 elections into the U.S. Congress ( with Banks becoming Speaker of the House of Representatives ) , and subsequently coalesced into a new political party known as the American Party . Particularly in the South , the American Party served as a vehicle for politicians opposed to the Democrats . Many also hoped that it would stake out a middle ground between the pro-slavery positions of Democratic politicians and the radical anti-slavery positions of the rapidly emerging Republican Party .",

During his tenure in the United States House of Representatives , he was included in several lists of Fire-Eaters - men who adamantly urged the secession of southern states from the United States , and who resisted measures of compromise and reconciliation , leading to the American Civil War . Keitt is notable for being involved in two separate acts of legislative violence in the Congressional chambers . In the first , Keitt assisted Representative Preston Brooks ( D-SC ) in his 1856 attack on Senator Charles Sumner ( R-MA ) in the Senate chamber by brandishing a pistol and cane to prevent other Senators from coming to Sumner 's aid . The second was in 1858 , when he attacked and attempted to choke Representative Galusha Grow ( R-PA ) during an argument on the floor of the U.S. House .

  "/wiki/Charles_Sumner": "Charles Sumner ( January 6 , 1811 - March 11 , 1874 ) was an American politician and United States Senator from Massachusetts . As an academic lawyer and a powerful orator , Sumner was the leader of the anti-slavery forces in Massachusetts and a leader of the Radical Republicans in the U.S. Senate during the American Civil War . During Reconstruction , he fought to minimize the power of the ex-Confederates and guarantee equal rights to the freedmen . He fell into a dispute with fellow Republican President Ulysses Grant on the question of taking control of Santo Domingo . Grant 's allies stripped Sumner of his power in the Senate in 1871 , and he joined the Liberal Republican movement in an effort to defeat Grant 's reelection in 1872 . Sumner changed his political party several times as anti-slavery coalitions rose and fell in the 1830s and 1840s before coalescing in the 1850s as the Republican Party , the affiliation with which he became best known . He devoted his enormous energies to the destruction of what Republicans called the Slave Power , the influence over the federal government of Southern slave owners who sought the continuation and expansion of slavery . In 1856 , a South Carolina Congressman , Democrat Preston Brooks , nearly killed Sumner with a cane on the Senate floor two days after Sumner delivered an intensely anti-slavery speech titled The Crime Against Kansas . In the speech , Sumner characterized the attacker 's cousin , South Carolina Senator Andrew Butler , a Democrat , as a pimp for slavery . The widely reported episode left Sumner severely injured and famous . ( In the South , Brooks was a hero , remembered in Brooksville , Florida and Brooks County , Georgia . ) It was several years before he could return to the Senate ; Massachusetts not only did not replace him , it reelected him , leaving his empty desk in the Senate as a reminder of the incident .",

Like in most of the state , the old-line Southern Democrats began splitting their tickets as early as the 1940s . However , this area 's white conservatives became increasingly willing to support Republicans at the state and local level as early as the 1970s , well before the rest of the state swung Republican .

Brooks , a Democrat , was a strong advocate of slavery and states ' rights . He is most remembered for his May 22 , 1856 , attack upon abolitionist and Republican Senator Charles Sumner , whom he beat nearly to death ; Brooks beat Sumner with a cane on the floor of the United States Senate in retaliation for an anti-slavery speech in which Sumner verbally attacked Brooks 's second cousin , South Carolina Senator Andrew Butler . Brooks 's action received widespread adoration in South Carolina and other Southern states - the city of Brooksville , Florida named itself for him immediately afterwards , as did Brooks County , Georgia - and abhorrence in the North . An attempt to oust him from the House of Representatives failed , and he received only token punishment in his criminal trial . He resigned his seat in July 1856 ; his constituents reelected him in a special election , held in August to fill the vacancy created by his resignation . He was re-elected to a full term in November 1856 , but died in January 1857 , five weeks before the new term began in March . Sumner was seriously injured by Brooks 's beating , and was unable to resume his seat in the Senate for three years , though eventually he recovered and resumed his Senate career . [ full citation needed ] The Massachusetts Legislature reelected Sumner in 1856 , and let his seat sit vacant during his absence as a reminder of Southern brutality .
