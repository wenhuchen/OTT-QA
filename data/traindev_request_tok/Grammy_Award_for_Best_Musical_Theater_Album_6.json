The original production , the second-most costly performed on Broadway to that date , ran for over 500 performances but ultimately lost its entire investment .

It was adapted from Dorothy Heyward and DuBose Heyward 's play Porgy , itself an adaptation of DuBose Heyward 's 1925 novel of the same name . Porgy and Bess was first performed in Boston on September 30 , 1935 , before it moved to Broadway in New York City . It featured a cast of classically trained African-American singers - a daring artistic choice at the time . After an initially unpopular public reception , a 1976 Houston Grand Opera production gained it new popularity , and it is now one of the best-known and most frequently performed operas . The libretto of Porgy and Bess tells the story of Porgy , a disabled black street-beggar living in the slums of Charleston . It deals with his attempts to rescue Bess from the clutches of Crown , her violent and possessive lover , and Sportin ' Life , her drug dealer . The opera plot generally follows the stage play . In the years following Gershwin 's death , Porgy and Bess was adapted for smaller scale performances . It was adapted as a film in 1959 . Some of the songs in the opera , such as Summertime , became popular and are frequently recorded . In the late 20th and early 21st centuries , the trend has been toward productions with greater fidelity to Gershwin 's original intentions .",

The story revolves around carousel barker Billy Bigelow , whose romance with millworker Julie Jordan comes at the price of both their jobs .
