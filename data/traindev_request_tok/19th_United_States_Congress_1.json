He received electoral votes for president in the 1824 , 1832 , and 1844 presidential elections and helped found both the National Republican Party and the Whig Party . For his role in defusing sectional crises , he earned the appellation of the Great Compromiser . Clay was born in Hanover County , Virginia in 1777 and launched a legal career in Lexington , Kentucky , in 1797 . As a member of the Democratic-Republican Party , Clay won election to the Kentucky state legislature in 1803 and to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1810 . He was chosen as speaker of the House in early 1811 and , along with President James Madison , led the United States into the War of 1812 against Britain . In 1814 , he helped negotiate the Treaty of Ghent , which brought an end to the War of 1812 . After the war , Clay returned to his position as speaker of the House and developed the American System , which called for federal infrastructure investments , support for the national bank , and protective tariff rates . In 1820 , he helped bring an end to a sectional crisis over slavery by leading the passage of the Missouri Compromise . Clay finished with the fourth-most electoral votes in the multi-candidate 1824 presidential election , and he helped John Quincy Adams win the contingent election held to select the president . President Adams appointed Clay to the prestigious position of secretary of state ; critics alleged that the two had agreed to a corrupt bargain . Despite receiving support from Clay and other National Republicans , Adams was defeated by Democrat Andrew Jackson in the 1828 presidential election .",

It was in this capacity that the most defining event of his career occurred . In 1822 , he struck down a debt relief law in the case of Williams v. Blair on the basis that it impeded the obligation of contracts . His decision was unpopular with the legislature , who condemned the ruling and summoned Clark to appear before them and defend it . An attempt by the legislature to remove him from office fell short of the needed two-thirds majority . The following year , the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld Clark 's ruling . In retaliation , the legislature attempted to abolish the court and create a new one more sympathetic to their views . This event and its aftermath became known as the Old Court-New Court controversy .",

He was also Minister to Russia under Andrew Jackson in 1830 . After serving as President Thomas Jefferson 's spokesman in the House , he broke with the president in 1805 as a result of what he saw as the dilution of traditional Jeffersonian principles as well as perceived mistreatment during the impeachment of Samuel Chase , in which Randolph served as chief prosecutor . Following this split , Randolph proclaimed himself the leader of the Old Republicans or Tertium Quids , a wing of the Democratic-Republican Party who wanted to restrict the role of the federal government . Specifically , Randolph promoted the Principles of '98 , which said that individual states could judge the constitutionality of central government laws and decrees , and could refuse to enforce laws deemed unconstitutional . A quick-thinking orator with a remarkable wit , he was committed to republicanism and advocated a commercial agrarian society throughout his three decades in Congress . Randolph 's conservative stance , displayed in his arguments against debt and for the rights of the landed gentry , have been attributed to his ties to his family estate and the elitist values of his native Southside Virginia [ citation needed ] . His belief in the importance of a landed gentry led him to oppose the abolition of entail and primogeniture : The old families of Virginia will form connections with low people , and sink into the mass of overseers ' sons and daughters . Randolph vehemently opposed the War of 1812 and the Missouri Compromise of 1820 ; he was active in debates about tariffs , manufacturing , and currency . With mixed feelings about slavery , he was one of the founders of the American Colonization Society in 1816 , to send free blacks to a colony in Africa . At the same time , he believed that slavery was a necessity in Virginia , saying , The question of slavery , as it is called , is to us a question of life and death .
