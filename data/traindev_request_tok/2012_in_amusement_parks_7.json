  "/wiki/Amusement_Park": "An amusement park is a park that features various attractions , such as rides and games , as well as other events for entertainment purposes . A theme park is a type of amusement park that bases its structures and attractions around a central theme , often featuring multiple areas with different themes . Unlike temporary and mobile funfairs and carnivals , amusement parks are stationary and built for long-lasting operation . They are more elaborate than city parks and playgrounds , usually providing attractions that cater to a variety of age groups . While amusement parks often contain themed areas , theme parks place a heavier focus with more intricately-designed themes that revolve around a particular subject or group of subjects . Amusement parks evolved from European fairs , pleasure gardens and large picnic areas , which were created for people 's recreation . World 's fairs and other types of international expositions also influenced the emergence of the amusement park industry .

It belongs to the family Bovidae , which includes antelopes , cattle , goats , sheep , and other even-toed horned ungulates . Connochaetes includes two species , both native to Africa : the black wildebeest or white-tailed gnu ( C. gnou ) , and the blue wildebeest or brindled gnu ( C. taurinus ) . Fossil records suggest these two species diverged about one million years ago , resulting in a northern and a southern species . The blue wildebeest remained in its original range and changed very little from the ancestral species , while the black wildebeest changed more as adaptation to its open grassland habitat in the south . The most obvious way of telling the two species apart are the differences in their colouring and in the way their horns are oriented . In East Africa , the blue wildebeest is the most abundant big-game species ; some populations perform an annual migration to new grazing grounds , but the black wildebeest is merely nomadic . Breeding in both takes place over a short period of time at the end of the rainy season and the calves are soon active and are able to move with the herd , a fact necessary for their survival . Nevertheless , some fall prey to large carnivores , especially the spotted hyena . Wildebeest often graze in mixed herds with zebra , which gives heightened awareness of potential predators . They are also alert to the warning signals emitted by other animals such as baboons . Wildebeest are a tourist attraction but compete with domesticated livestock for pasture and are sometimes blamed by farmers for transferring diseases and parasites to their cattle .",

  "/wiki/Halloween": "Halloween or Hallowe'en ( a contraction of Hallows ' Even or Hallows ' Evening ) , also known as Allhalloween , All Hallows ' Eve , or All Saints ' Eve , is a celebration observed in several countries on 31 October , the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows ' Day . It begins the three-day observance of Allhallowtide , the time in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead , including saints ( hallows ) , martyrs , and all the faithful departed . It is widely believed that many Halloween traditions originated from ancient Celtic harvest festivals , particularly the Gaelic festival Samhain ; that such festivals may have had pagan roots ; and that Samhain itself was Christianized as Halloween by the early Church . Some believe , however , that Halloween began solely as a Christian holiday , separate from ancient festivals like Samhain . Halloween activities include trick-or-treating ( or the related guising and souling ) , attending Halloween costume parties , carving pumpkins into jack-o'-lanterns , lighting bonfires , apple bobbing , divination games , playing pranks , visiting haunted attractions , telling scary stories , as well as watching horror films . In many parts of the world , the Christian religious observances of All Hallows ' Eve , including attending church services and lighting candles on the graves of the dead , remain popular , although elsewhere it is a more commercial and secular celebration . Some Christians historically abstained from meat on All Hallows ' Eve , a tradition reflected in the eating of certain vegetarian foods on this vigil day , including apples , potato pancakes , and soul cakes .",

  "/wiki/Christmas": "Christmas ( or Feast of the Nativity ) is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ , observed primarily on December 25 [ a ] as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world . A feast central to the Christian liturgical year , it is preceded by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide , which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night ; in some traditions , Christmastide includes an octave . Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world 's nations , is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians , as well as culturally by many non-Christians , and forms an integral part of the holiday season centered around it . The traditional Christmas narrative , the Nativity of Jesus , delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem , in accordance with messianic prophecies . When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city , the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born , with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then further disseminated the information . Although the month and date of Jesus ' birth are unknown , the church in the early fourth century fixed the date as December 25 . This corresponds to the date of the winter solstice on the Roman calendar . Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar , which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world . However , part of the Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar , which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar . For Christians , believing that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of humanity , rather than knowing Jesus ' exact birth date , is considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating Christmas . The celebratory customs associated in various countries with Christmas have a mix of pre-Christian , Christian , and secular themes and origins . Popular modern customs of the holiday include gift giving ; completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath ; Christmas music and caroling ; viewing a Nativity play ; an exchange of Christmas cards ; church services ; a special meal ; and the display of various Christmas decorations , including Christmas trees , Christmas lights , nativity scenes , garlands , wreaths , mistletoe , and holly ."
