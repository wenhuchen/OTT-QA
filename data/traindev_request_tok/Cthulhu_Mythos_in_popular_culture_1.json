  "/wiki/Board_game": "A board game is a tabletop game that involves counters or pieces moved or placed on a pre-marked surface or board , according to a set of rules . Some games are based on pure strategy , but many contain an element of chance ; and some are purely chance , with no element of skill . Games usually have a goal that a player aims to achieve . Early board games represented a battle between two armies , and most modern board games are still based on defeating opponents in terms of counters , winning position , or accrual of points . There are many varieties of board games . Their representation of real-life situations can range from having no inherent theme , like checkers , to having a specific theme and narrative , like Cluedo . Rules can range from the very simple , like Tic-tac-toe , to those describing a game universe in great detail , like Dungeons & Dragons - although most of the latter are role-playing games where the board is secondary to the game , serving to help visualize the game scenario . The time required to learn to play or master a game varies greatly from game to game , but is not necessarily correlated with the number or complexity of rules ; games like chess or Go possess relatively simple rulesets , but have great strategic depth .",

Generally , a CCG is initially played using a starter deck . This deck may be modified by adding cards from booster packs , which contain around 8 to 15 random cards .

D & D 's publication is commonly recognized as the beginning of modern role-playing games and the role-playing game industry . D & D departs from traditional wargaming by allowing each player to create their own character to play instead of a military formation . These characters embark upon imaginary adventures within a fantasy setting . A Dungeon Master ( DM ) serves as the game 's referee and storyteller , while maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur , and playing the role of the inhabitants of the game world . The characters form a party and they interact with the setting 's inhabitants and each other . Together they solve dilemmas , engage in battles , and gather treasure and knowledge .

However , needing immediate financing to bring their new game to market before several similar competing products were released , Gygax and Kaye brought in Brian Blume in December as an equal partner . When Kaye died suddenly in 1975 , the Tactical Studies Rules partnership restructured into TSR Hobbies , Inc. and accepted investment from Blume 's father Melvin . With the now popular D & D as its main product , TSR Hobbies became a major force in the games industry by the late 1970s . Melvin Blume eventually transferred his shares to his other son Kevin , making the two Blume brothers the largest shareholders in TSR Hobbies . TSR Hobbies ran into financial difficulties in the spring of 1983 , prompting the company to split into four independent businesses , with game publishing and development continuing as TSR , Inc. ( TSR ) After losing their executive positions due to the company 's underperformance , the Blume brothers subsequently sold their shares to TSR Vice President Lorraine Williams , who in turn engineered Gygax 's ouster from the company in October 1985 . TSR saw prosperity under Williams , but by 1995 , had fallen behind their competitors in overall sales . TSR was left unable to cover its publishing costs due to a variety of factors , so facing insolvency , TSR was purchased in 1997 by Wizards of the Coast ( WotC ) .
