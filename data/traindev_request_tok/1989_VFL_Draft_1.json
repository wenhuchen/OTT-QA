  "/wiki/Brisbane_Bears": "The Brisbane Football Club , nicknamed the Bears , was the first professional Australian rules football club established in Queensland . The club , along with the West Coast Eagles , joined the Victorian Football League ( VFL ) in 1987 and played its first ever VFL game against North Melbourne at the MCG on Friday 27 March 1987 which it won 19.23.137 to 15.14.104 . Unlike the AFLs more recent expansion clubs , the Gold Coast Suns and Greater Western Sydney Giants ( GWS ) , Brisbane received absolutely no assistance from the VFL/AFL when it was first established and was given only 5 months to recruit an entire team . Despite this however , the club went on to secure 6 wins in its first season and remains the only expansion club from the northern states to avoid finishing in last place on the ladder at the end of their first season . In contrast , the Gold Coast Suns only won 3 games in their first season and GWS only won 4 . Both the Gold Coast Suns and GWS Giants , unlike Brisbane , also finished on the bottom of the ladder at the end of their first season . Brisbane made the finals for the first time in 1995 and only narrowly missed out on a position in the grand final the following year when they were defeated by North Melbourne in the preliminary finals . Many of the Brisbane players who played in this match would go to be stars of Brisbanes 2001 , 2002 and 2003 triple premiership winning teams . The club merged with the Fitzroy Football Club at the completion of the 1996 season to form the Brisbane Lions without giving their members a vote on the matter . Many Brisbane supporters are still unhappy with the way the club handled the merger and this is exasperated by the clubs reluctance to acknowledge the Bears history despite its clear willingness to regularly acknowledge that of Fitzroys . This has created significant unrest , particularly in Melbourne , between longstanding Brisbane supporters and the small number of former Fitzroy supporters who chose to support the club after Fitzroy went into administration .",

  "/wiki/Fitzroy_Football_Club": "The Fitzroy Football Club , nicknamed the Lions or the Roys , is an Australian rules football club formed in 1883 to represent the inner-Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy , Victoria and was a foundation member club of the Victorian Football League ( now the Australian Football League ) on its inception in 1897 . Despite being the first club to win a VFL Grand Final they were not the first team to win a premiership . That honour belongs to the Essendon Football Club who were crowned premiers in 1897 without a Grand Final being played . Although Fitzroy won a total of eight VFL premierships they never won a premiership as the Lions . They won seven premierships ( 1898 , 1899 , 1904 , 1905 , 1913 , 1916 and 1922 ) as the Maroons and one ( 1944 ) as the Gorillas . The decision of the club to change its name to the Lions in 1957 coincided with what history now records as the beginning of decades of poor on-field performance and financial mismanagement that eventually resulted in the club being placed into administration and forced out of the AFL in 1996 . Although the club managed to survive and came out of administration in 1998 it never played in the AFL again . Fitzroy largely resumed its original VFL-AFL identity through its continued use of their 1975-1996 VFL-AFL jumper , their theme song and their 1884-1966 home ground at the Brunswick Street Oval . For a brief time it experimented in partnerships with other semi professional and amateur clubs before incorporating the Fitzroy Reds ( formerly University Reds ) to play in the Victorian Amateur Football Association . They began in the D1 section of the VAFA in 2009 and now , after having been promoted three times ( 2009 , 2012 , 2018 ) play in the Premier B Division . It is also notable for being one of only three clubs ( along with University and Hawthorn ) to have played in the VFA , VFL/AFL and VAFA competitions of Australian rules football .",

On his debut with Melbourne he had received two Brownlow Medal votes for three goals and 20 disposals against North Melbourne .
