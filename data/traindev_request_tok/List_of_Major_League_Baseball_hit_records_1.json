He led the team to six National League pennants in the 1880s . Anson was one of baseball 's first great hitters , and probably the first to tally over 3,000 career hits . His contemporary influence and prestige are regarded by historians as playing a major role in establishing the racial segregation in professional baseball that persisted until the late 1940s . On several occasions , Anson refused to take the field when the opposing roster included black players . Anson may have influenced the most noted vote in 19th-century professional baseball in favor of segregation : a July 14 , 1887 one by the high-minor International League to ban the signing of new contracts with black players . After retiring as a player and leaving the Colts , Anson briefly managed the New York Giants .
