The show focused on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert , played by his real-life namesake . The character , described by Colbert as a well-intentioned , poorly informed , high-status idiot , is a caricature of televised political pundits . Furthermore , the show satirized conservative personality-driven political talk programs , particularly Fox News 's The O'Reilly Factor . The Colbert Report is a spin-off of Comedy Central 's The Daily Show , where Colbert acted as a correspondent for the program for several years while developing the character . The program was created by Colbert , Jon Stewart , and Ben Karlin . The show 's writing was grounded in improvisation , and often lampooned current events stories . The show 's structure also included a guest interview , in which the Colbert character attempts to deconstruct his opponent 's argument . The show was taped in New York City 's Hell 's Kitchen neighborhood , and the program 's set is hyper-American , epitomizing the character 's ego . The show was taped and broadcast Monday through Thursday , with weeks taken off at multiple points in a given year for breaks . The Colbert Report saw immediate critical and ratings successes , leading to various awards , including two Peabody Awards . The show 's cultural influence - which occasionally would require a fair degree of participation from the show 's audience , dubbed the Colbert Nation - extended beyond the program a number of times .",
