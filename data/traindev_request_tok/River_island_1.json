Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south , the Arabian Sea on the southwest , and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast , it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west ; [ e ] China , Nepal , and Bhutan to the north ; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east . In the Indian Ocean , India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives ; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia . Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",

The seven islands that constitute Mumbai were originally home to communities of Marathi language speaking Koli people , who originated in Gujarat in prehistoric times . For centuries , the islands were under the control of successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire and subsequently to the East India Company when in 1661 Charles II of England married Catherine of Braganza and as part of her dowry Charles received the ports of Tangier and Seven Islands of Bombay . During the mid-18th century , Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project , which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea .

Tidal waters influence the Hudson 's flow from as far north as the city of Troy . The river is named after Henry Hudson , an Englishman sailing for the Dutch East India Company , who explored it in 1609 , and after whom Hudson Bay in Canada is also named . It had previously been observed by Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano sailing for King Francis I of France in 1524 , as he became the first European known to have entered the Upper New York Bay , but he considered the river to be an estuary . The Dutch called the river the North River - with the Delaware River called the South River - and it formed the spine of the Dutch colony of New Netherland . Settlements of the colony clustered around the Hudson , and its strategic importance as the gateway to the American interior led to years of competition between the English and the Dutch over control of the river and colony .

  "/wiki/Satra_(Ekasarana_Dharma)": "Satras ( Assamese : \u09b8\u09a4\u09cd\u09f0 ) are institutional centers associated with the Ekasarana tradition of Vaishnavism , largely found in the Indian state of Assam and neighboring regions . Numbering in the hundreds , these centers are generally independent of each other and under the control of individual adhikaras ( or satradhikars ) , though they can be grouped into four different Sanghatis ( orders ) . These centers , in the minimum , maintain a prayer house ( Namghar , or Kirtan-ghar ) , initiate lay people into the Ekasarana tradition and include them as disciples of the Satra from whom taxes and other religious duties are extracted . Although the culture of setting up religious institutions like Satras started in Sadiya , the Neo-Vaishnavite satra culture started in the 16th century . They grew rapidly in the 17th century and patronage extended to them by first the Koch kingdom and later the Ahom kingdom was crucial in the spread the Ekasarana religion . Many of the larger Satras house hundreds of celibate and non-celibate bhakats ( monks ) , hold vast lands and are repositories of religious and cultural relics and artifacts . The Satras extend control over their lay disciples via village Namghars . Satras in which the principal preceptors lived , or which preserve some of their relics are also called thaans . The first Satra in Assam was established by a Brahmin priest named Sankarisan in Sadiya under the patronage of the Chutia king Ratnadhwajpal at the start of the 13th century . It was named Ghaimora and later came to be known as Gharmora Satra . The neo-Vaishnavite satras were established by Assamese Vaishnavite monasteries for religious practices at the initiative of the Ahom Kings of Assam in the middle of the 17th century to propagate neo Vaishnavism .

  "/wiki/Han_River_(Korea)": "The Han River or Hangang ( Korean pronunciation : [ ha ( \u02d0 ) n.\u0261a\u014b ] ) [ e ] is a major river in South Korea and the fourth longest river on the Korean peninsula after the Amnok ( Yalu ) , Tuman ( Tumen ) , and Nakdong rivers . The river begins as two smaller rivers in the eastern mountains of the Korean peninsula , which then converge near Seoul , the capital of the country . The Han River and its surrounding area have played an important role in Korean history . The Three Kingdoms of Korea strove to take control of this land , where the river was used as a trade route to China ( via the Yellow Sea ) . However , the river is no longer actively used for navigation , because its estuary is located at the borders of the two Koreas , barred for entrance by any civilian . The river serves as a water source for over 12 million Koreans . In July 2000 , the United States military admitted to having dumped toxic chemicals in the river , causing protests . Currently , the lower stretches of the Han River are lined with pedestrian walkways , bicycle paths , public parks and restaurants , particularly in Seoul . In a 2011 survey conducted by Seoul Development Institute of 800 residents and 103 urban planning and architectural experts , 51.3 percent of residents and 68.9 percent of experts voted the river the second most scenic location in the city , following Mount Namsan in the top spot .",

[ n 2 ] The headwaters of the Apur\u00edmac River on Nevado Mismi had been considered for nearly a century as the Amazon 's most distant source , until a 2014 study found it to be the headwaters of the Mantaro River on the Cordillera Rumi Cruz in Peru . The Mantaro and Apur\u00edmac join , and with other tributaries form the Ucayali River , which in turn meets the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River upstream of Iquitos , Peru , to form what countries other than Brazil consider to be the main stem of the Amazon .
