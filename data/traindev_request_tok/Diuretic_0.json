  "/wiki/Water": "Water is an inorganic , transparent , tasteless , odorless , and nearly colorless chemical substance , which is the main constituent of Earth 's hydrosphere and the fluids of most living organisms . It is vital for all known forms of life , even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients . Its chemical formula is H2O , meaning that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms , connected by covalent bonds . Water is the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard ambient temperature and pressure . It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog . Clouds are formed from suspended droplets of water and ice , its solid state . When finely divided , crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of snow . The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor . Water moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation , transpiration ( evapotranspiration ) , condensation , precipitation , and runoff , usually reaching the sea . Water covers 71% of the Earth 's surface , mostly in seas and oceans . Small portions of water occur as groundwater ( 1.7% ) , in the glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland ( 1.7% ) , and in the air as vapor , clouds ( formed of ice and liquid water suspended in air ) , and precipitation ( 0.001% ) . Water plays an important role in the world economy .",
  "/wiki/Vasopressin": "Vasopressin , also called antidiuretic hormone ( ADH ) , arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) or argipressin , is a hormone synthesized as a peptide prohormone in neurons in the hypothalamus , and is converted to AVP . It then travels down the axon of that cell , which terminates in the posterior pituitary , and is released from vesicles into the circulation in response to extracellular fluid hypertonicity ( hyperosmolality ) . AVP has two primary functions . First , it increases the amount of solute-free water reabsorbed back into the circulation from the filtrate in the kidney tubules of the nephrons . Second , AVP constricts arterioles , which increases peripheral vascular resistance and raises arterial blood pressure . A third function is possible . Some AVP may be released directly into the brain from the hypothalamus , and may play an important role in social behavior , sexual motivation and pair bonding , and maternal responses to stress . Vasopressin induces differentiation of stem cells into cardiomyocytes and promotes heart muscle homeostasis . It has a very short half-life , between 16-24 minutes .",

  "/wiki/Arginine_vasopressin_receptor_2": "Vasopressin receptor 2 ( V2R ) , or arginine vasopressin receptor 2 ( officially called AVPR2 ) , is a protein that acts as receptor for vasopressin . AVPR2 belongs to the subfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors . Its activity is mediated by the Gs type of G proteins , which stimulate adenylate cyclase . AVPR2 is expressed in the kidney tubule , predominantly in the membrane of cells of the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts , in fetal lung tissue and lung cancer , the last two being associated with alternative splicing . AVPR2 is also expressed outside the kidney in vascular endothelium . Stimulation causes the release of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII from the endothelial cells . Because von Willebrand factor helps stabilize circulating levels of factor VIII , the vasopressin analog desmopressin can be used to stimulate the AVPR2 receptor and increase levels of circulating factor VIII . This is useful in the treatment of hemophilia A as well as Von Willebrand disease . In the kidney , AVPR2 's primary property is to respond to arginine vasopressin by stimulating mechanisms that concentrate the urine and maintain water homeostasis in the organism . When the function of AVPR2 is lost , the disease nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ( NDI ) results .",

  "/wiki/Dopamine": "Dopamine ( DA , a contraction of 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine ) is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families . It functions both as a hormone and a neurotransmitter , and plays several important roles in the brain and body . It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical L-DOPA , which is synthesized in the brain and kidneys . Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals . In the brain , dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter - a chemical released by neurons ( nerve cells ) to send signals to other nerve cells . The brain includes several distinct dopamine pathways , one of which plays a major role in the motivational component of reward-motivated behavior . The anticipation of most types of rewards increases the level of dopamine in the brain , [ failed verification ] and many addictive drugs increase dopamine release or block its reuptake into neurons following release . Other brain dopamine pathways are involved in motor control and in controlling the release of various hormones . These pathways and cell groups form a dopamine system which is neuromodulatory . In popular culture and media , dopamine is usually seen as the main chemical of pleasure , but the current opinion in pharmacology is that dopamine instead confers motivational salience ; in other words , dopamine signals the perceived motivational prominence ( i.e. , the desirability or aversiveness ) of an outcome , which in turn propels the organism 's behavior toward or away from achieving that outcome . Outside the central nervous system , dopamine functions primarily as a local paracrine messenger . In blood vessels , it inhibits norepinephrine release and acts as a vasodilator ( at normal concentrations ) ; in the kidneys , it increases sodium excretion and urine output ; in the pancreas , it reduces insulin production ; in the digestive system , it reduces gastrointestinal motility and protects intestinal mucosa ; and in the immune system , it reduces the activity of lymphocytes .",

They are pharmacologically inert substances that are given intravenously . They increase the osmolarity of blood and renal filtrate . Two examples are mannitol and isosorbide . In the nephron , osmotic diuretics act at the portions of the nephron that are water-permeable . Osmotic diuretics work by expanding extracellular fluid and plasma volume , therefore increasing blood flow to the kidney . This washes out the cortical medullary gradient in the kidney . This stops the loop of Henle from concentrating urine , which usually uses the high osmotic and solute gradient to transport solutes and water . These agents can also act at other parts of the body . For example , they can be used to reduce intracranial and intra-ocular pressure . Osmotic diuretics increase plasma volume , but because they do not cross the blood-brain barrier , this does not affect the nervous system .

The naturally occurring form of glucose is d-glucose , while l-glucose is produced synthetically in comparatively small amounts and is of lesser importance . Glucose is a monosaccharide containing six carbon atoms and an aldehyde group and is therefore referred to as an aldohexose . The glucose molecule can exist in an open-chain ( acyclic ) and ring ( cyclic ) form , the latter being the result of an intramolecular reaction between the aldehyde C atom and the C-5 hydroxyl group to form an intramolecular hemiacetal .

It performs several functions in cell physiology . The Na+/K+-ATPase enzyme is active ( i.e . it uses energy from ATP ) . For every ATP molecule that the pump uses , three sodium ions are exported and two potassium ions are imported ; there is hence a net export of a single positive charge per pump cycle . The sodium-potassium pump was discovered in 1957 by the Danish scientist Jens Christian Skou , who was awarded a Nobel Prize for his work in 1997 . Its discovery marked an important step forward in the understanding of how ions get into and out of cells , and it has particular significance for excitable cells such as nerve cells , which depend on this pump to respond to stimuli and transmit impulses .

  "/wiki/Aldosterone": "Aldosterone , the main mineralocorticoid hormone , is a steroid hormone produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland . It is essential for sodium conservation in the kidney , salivary glands , sweat glands and colon . It plays a central role in the homeostatic regulation of blood pressure , plasma sodium ( Na+ ) , and potassium ( K+ ) levels . It does so primarily by acting on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron . It influences the reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium ( from and into the tubular fluids , respectively ) of the kidney , thereby indirectly influencing water retention or loss , blood pressure and blood volume . When dysregulated , aldosterone is pathogenic and contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular and kidney disease . Aldosterone has exactly the opposite function of the atrial natriuretic hormone secreted by the heart . Aldosterone is part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system . It has a plasma half-life of under 20 minutes . Drugs that interfere with the secretion or action of aldosterone are in use as antihypertensives , like lisinopril , which lowers blood pressure by blocking the angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) , leading to lower aldosterone secretion . The net effect of these drugs is to reduce sodium and water retention but increase retention of potassium . In other words , these drugs stimulate the excretion of sodium and water in urine , while they block the excretion of potassium .",

It is involved primarily in the reabsorption of sodium ions at the collecting ducts of the kidney 's nephrons . The apical membranes of many tight epithelia contain sodium channels that are characterized primarily by their high affinity for the diuretic blocker amiloride . These channels mediate the first step of active sodium reabsorption essential for the maintenance of body salt and water homeostasis . In vertebrates , the channels control reabsorption of sodium in kidney , colon , lung and sweat glands ; they also play a role in taste perception . The epithelial sodium channels are structurally and probably evolutionary related to P2X purinoreceptors , pain receptors that activate when they detect ATP .",

  "/wiki/Thiazide": "Thiazide ( /\u02c8\u03b8a\u026a\u0259za\u026ad/ ) refers to both a class of sulfur-containing organic molecules and a class of diuretics based on the chemical structure of benzothiadiazine . The thiazide drug class was discovered and developed at Merck and Co. in the 1950s . The first approved drug of this class , chlorothiazide , was marketed under the trade name Diuril beginning in 1958 . In most countries , thiazides are the least expensive antihypertensive drugs available . Thiazide organic molecules are bi-cyclic structures that contain adjacent sulfur and nitrogen atoms on one ring . Confusion sometimes occurs because thiazide-like diuretics such as indapamide are referred to as thiazides . These molecules do not have the thiazide chemical structure . When used this way , thiazide refers to a drug which acts at the thiazide receptor . The thiazide receptor is a sodium-chloride transporter that pulls NaCl from the lumen in the distal convoluted tubule . Thiazide diuretics cause the body to release NaCl and water lumen , and increase the amount of urine made each day . An example of a molecule that is chemically a thiazide but is not used as a diuretic is methylchloroisothiazolinone . Methylchloroisothiazolinone is used as an antimicrobial in cosmetics .",
  "/wiki/Bendroflumethiazide": "Bendroflumethiazide , formerly bendrofluazide , trade name Aprinox , is a thiazide diuretic used to treat hypertension . Bendroflumethiazide is a thiazide diuretic which works by inhibiting sodium reabsorption at the beginning of the distal convoluted tubule ( DCT ) . Water is lost as a result of more sodium reaching the collecting ducts . Bendroflumethiazide has a role in the treatment of mild heart failure although loop diuretics are better for reducing overload . The main use of bendroflumethiazide currently is in hypertension ( part of the effect is due to vasodilation ) . It was patented in 1958 and approved for medical use in 1960 .",
  "/wiki/Hydrochlorothiazide": "Hydrochlorothiazide ( HCTZ or HCT ) is a diuretic medication often used to treat high blood pressure and swelling due to fluid build up . Other uses include diabetes insipidus , renal tubular acidosis , and to decrease the risk of kidney stones in those with a high calcium level in the urine . For high blood pressure it is sometimes considered as a first-line treatment . HCTZ is taken by mouth and may be combined with other blood pressure medications as a single pill to increase effectiveness . Potential side effects include poor kidney function , electrolyte imbalances including low blood potassium and less commonly low blood sodium , gout , high blood sugar , and feeling lightheaded with standing . While allergies to HCTZ are reported to occur more often in those with allergies to sulfa drugs , this association is not well supported . It may be used during pregnancy , but it is not a first-line medication in this group . It is in the thiazide medication class and acts by decreasing the kidneys ' ability to retain water . This initially reduces blood volume , decreasing blood return to the heart and thus cardiac output . It is believed to lower peripheral vascular resistance in the long run . Two companies , Merck and Ciba , state they discovered the medication which became commercially available in 1959 . It is on the World Health Organization 's List of Essential Medicines , the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system .",
  "/wiki/Sodium-chloride_symporter": "The sodium-chloride symporter ( also known as Na+-Cl\u2212 cotransporter , NCC or NCCT , or as the thiazide-sensitive Na+-Cl\u2212 cotransporter or TSC ) is a cotransporter in the kidney which has the function of reabsorbing sodium and chloride ions from the tubular fluid into the cells of the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron . It is a member of the SLC12 cotransporter family of electroneutral cation-coupled chloride cotransporters . In humans , it is encoded by the gene SLC12A3 ( solute carrier family 12 member 3 ) located in 16q13 . A loss of NCC function causes Gitelman syndrome , an autosomic recessive disease characterized by salt wasting and low blood pressure , hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis , hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria . Over a hundred different mutations in the NCC gene have been identified .",

  "/wiki/Xanthine": "Xanthine ( /\u02c8z\u00e6n\u03b8i\u02d0n/ or /\u02c8z\u00e6n\u03b8a\u026an/ ; archaically xanthic acid ; systematic name 3,7-dihydropurine-2,6-dione ) is a purine base found in most human body tissues and fluids and in other organisms . Several stimulants are derived from xanthine , including caffeine and theobromine . Xanthine is a product on the pathway of purine degradation .",
  "/wiki/Caffeine": "Caffeine is a central nervous system ( CNS ) stimulant of the methylxanthine class . It is the world 's most widely consumed psychoactive drug . Unlike many other psychoactive substances , it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world . There are several known mechanisms of action to explain the effects of caffeine . The most prominent is that it reversibly blocks the action of adenosine on its receptor and consequently prevents the onset of drowsiness induced by adenosine . Caffeine also stimulates certain portions of the autonomic nervous system . Caffeine is a bitter , white crystalline purine , a methylxanthine alkaloid , and is chemically related to the adenine and guanine bases of deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) and ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) . It is found in the seeds , nuts , or leaves of a number of plants native to Africa , East Asia and South America , and helps to protect them against predator insects and to prevent germination of nearby seeds . The most well-known source of caffeine is the coffee bean , a misnomer for the seed of Coffea plants . People may drink beverages containing caffeine to relieve or prevent drowsiness and to improve cognitive performance . To make these drinks , caffeine is extracted by steeping the plant product in water , a process called infusion . Caffeine-containing drinks , such as coffee , tea , and cola , are very popular ; as of 2014 , 85% of American adults consumed some form of caffeine daily , consuming 164 mg on average .",
  "/wiki/Theophylline": "Theophylline , also known as 1,3-dimethylxanthine , is a methylxanthine drug used in therapy for respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) and asthma under a variety of brand names . As a member of the xanthine family , it bears structural and pharmacological similarity to theobromine and caffeine , and is readily found in nature , being present in tea ( Camellia sinensis ) and cocoa ( Theobroma cacao ) . A small amount of theophylline is one of the products of caffeine metabolic processing in the liver .",
  "/wiki/Theobromine": "Theobromine , formerly known as xantheose , is a bitter alkaloid of the cacao plant , with the chemical formula C7H8N4O2 . It is found in chocolate , as well as in a number of other foods , including the leaves of the tea plant , and the kola nut . It is classified as a xanthine alkaloid , others of which include theophylline and caffeine . Caffeine differs from the compounds in that it has an extra methyl group ( see under Pharmacology section ) . Despite its name , the compound contains no bromine - theobromine is derived from Theobroma , the name of the genus of the cacao tree ( which itself is made up of the Greek roots theo ( god ) and broma ( food ) , meaning food of the gods ) with the suffix -ine given to alkaloids and other basic nitrogen-containing compounds . Theobromine is a slightly water-soluble ( 330 mg/L ) , crystalline , bitter powder . Theobromine is white or colourless , but commercial samples can be yellowish . It has an effect similar to , but lesser than , that of caffeine in the human nervous system , making it a lesser homologue . Theobromine is an isomer of theophylline , as well as paraxanthine . Theobromine is categorized as a dimethyl xanthine . Theobromine was first discovered in 1841 in cacao beans by Russian chemist Aleksandr Voskresensky . Synthesis of theobromine from xanthine was first reported in 1882 by Hermann Emil Fischer .",
  "/wiki/Glomerular_filtration_rate": "Renal function is an indication of the kidney 's condition and its role in renal physiology . Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) describes the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney . Creatinine clearance rate ( CCr or CrCl ) is the volume of blood plasma that is cleared of creatinine per unit time and is a useful measure for approximating the GFR . Creatinine clearance exceeds GFR due to creatinine secretion , which can be blocked by cimetidine . Both GFR and CCr may be accurately calculated by comparative measurements of substances in the blood and urine , or estimated by formulas using just a blood test result ( eGFR and eCCr ) The results of these tests are used to assess the excretory function of the kidneys . Staging of chronic kidney disease is based on categories of GFR as well as albuminuria and cause of kidney disease . Dosage of drugs that are excreted primarily via urine may need to be modified based on either GFR or creatinine clearance ."
