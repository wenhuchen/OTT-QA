It is situated on the sandy isthmus which unites the Rock of Gibraltar with the coast in the eastern flank of the Bay of Gibraltar , between Sierra Carbonera and the Rock of Gibraltar . The town derives its name firstly from the l\u00ednea or boundary line separating Spain from Gibraltar , and secondly from the Immaculate Conception of Mary , the Mother of Jesus . Its people are called in Spanish linenses . The first dwellings , which date back to the 18th century , were behind the Spanish lines , being part of the Spanish municipality of San Roque until 1870 , when La L\u00ednea became separate . The people of La L\u00ednea have traditionally found work in Gibraltar , from the days in the 18th century when Gibraltar was an important naval port . This stopped with the total closure of the border by the Spanish government between June 9 , 1969 and December 15 , 1982 as a result of the dispute between Spain and Britain regarding the sovereignty of Gibraltar . The border was fully reopened on February 5 , 1985 .

It is situated on the lower reaches of the River Guadalquivir , in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula . Seville has a municipal population of about 690,000 as of 2016 [ update ] , and a metropolitan population of about 1.5 million , making it the largest city in Andalusia , the fourth-largest city in Spain and the 30th most populous municipality in the European Union . Its old town , with an area of 4 square kilometres ( 2 sq mi ) , contains three UNESCO World Heritage Sites : the Alc\u00e1zar palace complex , the Cathedral and the General Archive of the Indies . The Seville harbour , located about 80 kilometres ( 50 miles ) from the Atlantic Ocean , is the only river port in Spain [ citation needed ] . Seville experiences high temperatures in the Summer , with daily maximums routinely above 35 \u00b0C ( 95 \u00b0F ) in July and August . Seville was founded as the Roman city of Hispalis . It became known as Ishbiliyya after the Muslim conquest in 712 . During the Muslim rule in Spain , Seville came under the jurisdiction of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba before becoming the independent Taifa of Seville ; later it was ruled by the Muslim Almoravids and the Almohads until finally being incorporated into the Christian Kingdom of Castile under Ferdinand III in 1248 . After the discovery of the Americas , Seville became one of the economic centres of the Spanish Empire as its port monopolised the trans-oceanic trade and the Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n ( House of Trade ) wielded its power , opening a Golden Age of arts and literature . In 1519 , Ferdinand Magellan departed from Seville for the first circumnavigation of the Earth . Coinciding with the Baroque period of European history , the 17th century in Seville represented the most brilliant flowering of the city 's culture ; then began a gradual economic and demographic decline as silting in the Guadalquivir forced the trade monopoly to relocate to the nearby port of C\u00e1diz .",
