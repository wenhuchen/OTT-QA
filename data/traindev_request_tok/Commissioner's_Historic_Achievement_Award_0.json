Bonds was regarded as an exceptional hitter : he led MLB in on-base plus slugging six times , and placed within the top five hitters in 12 of his 17 qualifying seasons . He holds many MLB hitting records , including most career home runs ( 762 ) , most home runs in a single season ( 73 , set in 2001 ) and most career walks . Bonds was also known as a talented all-around baseball player . He won eight Gold Glove awards for his defensive play in the outfield . He stole 514 bases with his baserunning speed , becoming the first and only MLB player to date with at least 500 home runs and 500 stolen bases ( no other player has even 400 of each ) . He is ranked second in career Wins Above Replacement among all major league position players by both Fangraphs and Baseball-Reference.com , behind only Babe Ruth . However , Bonds led a controversial career , notably as a central figure in baseball 's steroids scandal . In 2007 , he was indicted on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice for allegedly lying to the grand jury during the federal government 's investigation of BALCO . The perjury charges against Bonds were dropped and an initial obstruction of justice conviction was overturned in 2015 .",

  "/wiki/Runs_batted_in": "A run batted in ( RBI ) , plural runs batted in ( RBI or RBIs ) , is a statistic in baseball and softball that credits a batter for making a play that allows a run to be scored ( except in certain situations such as when an error is made on the play ) . For example , if the batter bats a base hit , then another player on a higher base can head home to score a run , and the batter gets credited with batting in that run . Before the 1920 Major League Baseball season , runs batted in were not an official baseball statistic . Nevertheless , the RBI statistic was tabulated - unofficially - from 1907 through 1919 by baseball writer Ernie Lanigan , according to the Society for American Baseball Research . Common nicknames for an RBI include ribby ( or ribbie ) , rib , and ribeye . The plural of RBI is generally RBIs , although some commentators use RBI as both singular and plural , as it can also stand for runs batted in .",
  "/wiki/Base_on_balls": "A base on balls ( BB ) , also known as a walk , occurs in baseball when a batter receives four pitches that the umpire calls balls , and is in turn awarded first base without the possibility of being called out . The base on balls is defined in Section 2.00 of baseball 's Official Rules , and further detail is given in 6.08 ( a ) . It is , however , considered a faux pas for a professional player to actually walk to first base ; the batter-runner and any advancing runners normally jog on such a play . The term base on balls distinguishes a walk from the other manners in which a batter can be awarded first base without liability to be put out ( e.g. , hit by pitch ( HBP ) , catcher 's interference ) . Though a base on balls , catcher 's interference , or a batter hit by a pitched ball all result in the batter ( and possibly runners on base ) being awarded a base , the term walk usually refers only to a base on balls , and not the other methods of reaching base without the bat touching the ball . An important difference is that for a hit batter or catcher 's interference , the ball is dead and no one may advance unless forced ; the ball is live after a walk ( see below for details ) . A batter who draws a base on balls is commonly said to have been walked by the pitcher . When the batter is walked , runners advance one base without liability to be put out only if forced to vacate their base to allow the batter to take first base . If a batter draws a walk with the bases loaded , all preceding runners are forced to advance , including the runner on third base who is forced to home plate to score a run ; when a run is forced on a walk , the batter is credited with an RBI per rule 10.04 . Receiving a base on balls does not count as a hit or an at bat for a batter but does count as a time on base and a plate appearance . Therefore , a base on balls does not affect a player 's batting average , but it can increase his on-base percentage . A hit by pitch is not counted statistically as a walk , though the effect is mostly the same , with the batter receiving a free pass to first base .",
  "/wiki/Slugging_percentage": "In baseball statistics , slugging percentage ( SLG ) is a measure of the batting productivity of a hitter . It is calculated as total bases divided by at bats , through the following formula , where AB is the number of at bats for a given player , and 1B , 2B , 3B , and HR are the number of singles , doubles , triples , and home runs , respectively :",
  "/wiki/Babe_Ruth": "George Herman Babe Ruth Jr. ( February 6 , 1895 - August 16 , 1948 ) was an American professional baseball player whose career in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) spanned 22 seasons , from 1914 through 1935 . Nicknamed The Bambino and The Sultan of Swat , he began his MLB career as a star left-handed pitcher for the Boston Red Sox , but achieved his greatest fame as a slugging outfielder for the New York Yankees . Ruth established many MLB batting ( and some pitching ) records , including career home runs ( 714 ) , runs batted in ( RBIs ) ( 2,213 ) , bases on balls ( 2,062 ) , slugging percentage ( .690 ) , and on-base plus slugging ( OPS ) ( 1.164 ) ; the last two still stand as of 2019 [ update ] . Ruth is regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in American culture and is considered by many to be the greatest baseball player of all time . In 1936 , Ruth was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame as one of its first five inaugural members . At age seven , Ruth was sent to St. Mary 's Industrial School for Boys , a reformatory where he was mentored by Brother Matthias Boutlier of the Xaverian Brothers , the school 's disciplinarian and a capable baseball player . In 1914 , Ruth was signed to play minor-league baseball for the Baltimore Orioles but was soon sold to the Red Sox . By 1916 , he had built a reputation as an outstanding pitcher who sometimes hit long home runs , a feat unusual for any player in the pre-1920 dead-ball era . Although Ruth twice won 23 games in a season as a pitcher and was a member of three World Series championship teams with the Red Sox , he wanted to play every day and was allowed to convert to an outfielder . With regular playing time , he broke the MLB single-season home run record in 1919 . After that season , Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold Ruth to the Yankees amid controversy . The trade fueled Boston 's subsequent 86-year championship drought and popularized the Curse of the Bambino superstition .",

Clemens was one of the most dominant pitchers in major league history , tallying 354 wins , a 3.12 earned run average ( ERA ) , and 4,672 strikeouts , the third-most all time . An 11-time All-Star and two-time World Series champion , he won seven Cy Young Awards during his career , more than any other pitcher in history . Clemens was known for his fierce competitive nature and hard-throwing pitching style , which he used to intimidate batters . Clemens debuted in the major leagues in 1984 with the Red Sox , whose pitching staff he anchored for 12 years . In 1986 , he won the American League ( AL ) Cy Young Award , the AL Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) Award , and the All-Star Game MVP Award , and he struck out an MLB-record 20 batters in a single game ( Clemens repeated the 20-strikeout feat 10 years later ) . After the 1996 season , Clemens left Boston via free agency and joined the Toronto Blue Jays . In each of his two seasons with Toronto , Clemens won a Cy Young Award , as well as the pitching triple crown by leading the league in wins , ERA , and strikeouts . Prior to the 1999 season , Clemens was traded to the Yankees where he won his two World Series titles . In 2001 , Clemens became the first pitcher in major league history to start a season with a win-loss record of 20-1 . In 2003 , he reached his 300th win and 4,000th strikeout in the same game . Clemens left for the Houston Astros in 2004 , where he spent three seasons and won his seventh Cy Young Award .",
  "/wiki/Cy_Young_Award": "The Cy Young Award is given annually to the best pitchers in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) , one each for the American League ( AL ) and National League ( NL ) . The award was first introduced in 1956 by Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick in honor of Hall of Fame pitcher Cy Young , who died in 1955 . The award was originally given to the single best pitcher in the major leagues , but in 1967 , after the retirement of Frick , the award was given to one pitcher in each league . Each league 's award is voted on by members of the Baseball Writers ' Association of America , with one representative from each team . As of the 2010 season , each voter places a vote for first , second , third , fourth and fifth place among the pitchers of each league . The formula used to calculate the final scores is a weighted sum of the votes . [ A ] The pitcher with the highest score in each league wins the award . If two pitchers receive the same number of votes , the award is shared . The current formula started in the 2010 season . Before that , dating back to 1970 , writers voted for three pitchers , with the formula of 5 points for a first place vote , 3 for a second place vote and 1 for a third place vote . Prior to 1970 , writers only voted for the best pitcher and used a formula of one point per vote .",
  "/wiki/Win_(baseball)": "In baseball and softball , a pitcher 's win-loss record ( also referred to simply as their record ) indicates the number of wins ( denoted W ) and losses ( denoted L ) they have been credited with . For example , a 20-10 win-loss record would represent 20 wins and 10 losses . In each game , one pitcher on the winning team is awarded a win ( the winning pitcher ) and one pitcher on the losing team is given a loss ( the losing pitcher ) in their respective statistics . These pitchers are collectively known as the pitchers of record . The designation of win or loss for a pitcher is known as a decision , and only one pitcher for each team receives a decision . A starting pitcher who does not receive credit for a win or loss is said to have no decision . In certain situations , another pitcher on the winning team who pitched in relief of the winning pitcher can be credited with a save , and holds can be awarded to relief pitchers on both sides , but these are never awarded to the same pitcher who is awarded the win . The decisions are awarded by the official scorer of the game in accordance with the league 's rules . The official scorer does not assign a winning or losing pitcher in some games which are forfeited , such as those that are tied at the time of forfeiture . If the game is tied ( a rare event ) , no pitcher is awarded any decision . A pitcher 's winning percentage is calculated by dividing the number of wins by the number of decisions ( wins plus losses ) , and it is commonly expressed with three decimal places .",
  "/wiki/Strikeout": "In baseball or softball , a strikeout ( or strike-out ) occurs when a batter racks up three strikes during a time at bat . It usually means the batter is out . A strikeout is a statistic recorded for both pitchers and batters , and is denoted by K. A strikeout looking - in which the batter does not swing and the third strike is called by the umpire - is usually denoted by a \ua4d8 . Although a strikeout suggests that the pitcher dominated the batter , the free-swinging style that generates home runs also leaves batters susceptible to striking out . Some of the greatest home run hitters of all time - such as Alex Rodriguez , Reggie Jackson , and Jim Thome - were notorious for striking out .",

The Hall 's motto is Preserving History , Honoring Excellence , Connecting Generations . The word Cooperstown is often used as shorthand ( or a metonym ) for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum , similar to Canton for the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton , Ohio . The Hall of Fame was established in 1939 by Stephen Carlton Clark , an heir to the Singer Sewing Machine fortune . Clark sought to bring tourists to a city hurt by the Great Depression , which reduced the local tourist trade , and Prohibition , which devastated the local hops industry . Clark constructed the Hall of Fame 's building , and it was dedicated on June 12 , 1939 .

  "/wiki/Gold_Glove_Award": "The Rawlings Gold Glove Award , usually referred to as simply the Gold Glove , is the award given annually to the Major League Baseball ( MLB ) players judged to have exhibited superior individual fielding performances at each fielding position in both the National League ( NL ) and the American League ( AL ) . Winners are determined from voting by the managers and coaches in each league , who are not permitted to vote for their own players . Additionally , a sabermetric component provided by the Society for American Baseball Research ( SABR ) accounts for approximately 25 percent of the vote . In 1957 , the baseball glove manufacturer Rawlings created the Gold Glove Award to commemorate the best fielding performance at each position . Winners receive a glove made from gold lam\u00e9-tanned leather and affixed to a walnut base . In the inaugural year , one Gold Glove was awarded to the top fielder at each position in MLB ; since 1958 , separate awards have been given to the top fielders in each league . Thus , 18 Gold Gloves are normally awarded annually , one at each of the nine fielding positions for each league .

Nicknamed the Man of Steal , he is widely regarded as baseball 's greatest leadoff hitter and baserunner . He holds the major league records for career stolen bases , runs , unintentional walks and leadoff home runs . At the time of his last major league game in 2003 , the ten-time American League ( AL ) All-Star ranked among the sport 's top 100 all-time home run hitters and was its all-time leader in base on balls . In 2009 , he was inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame on his first ballot appearance . Henderson holds the single-season record for stolen bases ( 130 in 1982 ) and is the only player in AL history to steal 100 bases in a season , having done so three times . His 1,406 career steals is 50% higher than the previous record of 938 by Lou Brock . Henderson is the all-time stolen base leader for the Oakland Athletics and previously held the New York Yankees ' franchise record from 1988 to 2011 . He was among the league 's top ten base stealers in 21 different seasons . Henderson was named the AL 's Most Valuable Player in 1990 , and he was the leadoff hitter for two World Series champions : the 1989 Oakland A 's and the 1993 Toronto Blue Jays . A 12-time stolen base champion , Henderson led the league in runs five times . His 25-year career elevated Henderson to the top ten in several other categories , including career at-bats , games , and outfield putouts and total chances .",
  "/wiki/Run_(baseball)": "In baseball , a run is scored when a player advances around first , second and third base and returns safely to home plate , touching the bases in that order , before three outs are recorded and all obligations to reach base safely on batted balls are met or assured . A player may score by hitting a home run or by any combination of plays that puts him safely on base ( that is , on first , second , or third ) as a runner and subsequently brings him home . The object of the game is for a team to score more runs than its opponent . The Official Baseball Rules hold that if the third out of an inning is a force out of a runner advancing to any base then , even if another baserunner crosses home plate before that force out is made , his run does not count . However , if the third out is not a force out , but a tag out , then if that other baserunner crosses home plate before that tag out is made , his run will count . In baseball statistics , a player who advances around all the bases to score is credited with a run ( R ) , sometimes referred to as a run scored . While runs scored is considered an important individual batting statistic , it is regarded as less significant than runs batted in ( RBIs ) . Both individual runs scored and runs batted in are heavily context-dependent ; however , the sabermetric statistic runs created provides a more sophisticated assessment of a player 's contribution toward producing runs for his team . A pitcher is likewise assessed runs surrendered in his statistics , which differentiate between standard earned runs ( for which the pitcher is statistically assigned full responsibility ) and unearned runs scored due to fielding errors , which do not count in his personal statistics . Specifically , if a fielding error occurs which affects the number of runs scored in an inning , the Official Scorer - the official in-game statistician - in order to determine how many of the runs should be classified as earned , will reconstruct the inning as if the error had not occurred . For example , with two outs , suppose a runner reaches base because of a fielding error , and then the next batter hits a two-run home run , and then the following batter then makes the third out , ending the inning . If the inning is reconstructed without the error , and if that third batter , instead of reaching on an error , registered an out , the inning would have ended there without any runs scoring .",
  "/wiki/Stolen_base": "In baseball , a stolen base occurs when a runner advances to a base to which he is not entitled and the official scorer rules that the advance should be credited to the action of the runner . The umpires determine whether the runner is safe or out at the next base , but the official scorer rules on the question of credit or blame for the advance under Rule 10 . A stolen base most often occurs when a base runner advances to the next base while the pitcher is pitching the ball to home plate . Successful base stealers are not only fast but have good baserunning instincts and timing .",
  "/wiki/Home_run": "In baseball , a home run ( abbreviated HR ) is scored when the ball is hit in such a way that the batter is able to circle the bases and reach home safely in one play without any errors being committed by the defensive team in the process . In modern baseball , the feat is typically achieved by hitting the ball over the outfield fence between the foul poles ( or making contact with either foul pole ) without first touching the ground , resulting in an automatic home run . There is also the inside-the-park home run where the batter reaches home safely while the baseball is in play on the field . A home run with a high exit velocity and good launch angle is sometimes called a no-doubter , because it leaves no doubt that it is going to leave the park when it leaves the bat . When a home run is scored , the batter is also credited with a hit and a run scored , and an RBI for each runner that scores , including himself . Likewise , the pitcher is recorded as having given up a hit and a run , with additional runs charged for each runner that scores other than the batter . Home runs are among the most popular aspects of baseball and , as a result , prolific home run hitters are usually the most popular among fans and consequently the highest paid by teams - hence the old saying , Home run hitters drive Cadillacs , and singles hitters drive Fords ( coined , circa 1948 , by veteran pitcher Fritz Ostermueller , by way of mentoring his young teammate , Ralph Kiner ) .",

  "/wiki/Independent_league_baseball": "An independent baseball league is a professional baseball organization located in the United States and Canada that is not operated in conjunction with either a Major League Baseball team or an affiliated Minor League Baseball team . Being independent allows teams to be located close to major league teams without their consent . Such leagues have been around for many years and were once known as outlaw leagues due to their position outside the rules of affiliated minor league baseball . The Northern League and Frontier League both started play in 1993 , and the Northern League 's success paved the way for other independent leagues like the Texas-Louisiana League and Northeast League . The Atlantic League has had more marquee players than any other independent league , including Jose Canseco , Rickey Henderson , Ozzie Canseco , Rub\u00e9n Sierra , Carlos Baerga , and John Rocker . The Northern League alumni include Leon Bull Durham , J. D. Drew , and Darryl Strawberry . Independent leagues have flourished in northeastern states , where dense populations can often support multiple franchises . Because they are not subject to the territorial limitations imposed on affiliated minor-league teams , independent clubs can relocate as close to affiliated teams ( and one another ) as they choose to . For example , the city of Lancaster , Pennsylvania can not have an affiliated team because of its proximity to the Harrisburg Senators and Reading Fightin Phils , leaving the Atlantic League to place a team - the Lancaster Barnstormers - to fill the void . Another example is the greater New York City metropolitan area , where there are many independent teams : the Long Island Ducks , New Jersey Jackals , Rockland Boulders , Somerset Patriots , and Sussex County Miners . The Kansas City area is home not only to the American League 's Kansas City Royals , but also the independent Kansas City T-Bones . The St. Paul Saints share a market with the American League 's Minnesota Twins ; both teams have frequently worked together to promote baseball in the Upper Midwest .",

Nicknames for the team include the O 's and the Birds . The Orioles experienced their greatest success from 1966 to 1983 , when they made six World Series appearances , winning three of them ( 1966 , 1970 , 1983 ) . This era of the club featured several future Hall of Famers who would later be inducted representing the Orioles , such as third baseman Brooks Robinson , outfielder Frank Robinson , starting pitcher Jim Palmer , first baseman Eddie Murray , shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. , and manager Earl Weaver . The Orioles have won a total of nine division championships ( 1969-1971 , 1973-1974 , 1979 , 1983 , 1997 , 2014 ) , six pennants ( 1966 , 1969-1971 , 1979 , 1983 ) , and three wild card berths ( 1996 , 2012 , 2016 ) . Since moving to Baltimore in 1954 , the franchise has a win-loss record of 5306-5174 ( with a winning percentage of .506 ) as of the end of the 2019 season .

  "/wiki/Shortstop": "Shortstop , abbreviated SS , is the baseball or softball fielding position between second and third base , which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions . Historically the position was assigned to defensive specialists who were typically poor at batting and were often placed at the bottom of the batting order . Today shortstops are often able to hit well and many are placed at the top of the lineup . In the numbering system used by scorers to record defensive plays , the shortstop is assigned the number 6 . More hit balls go to the shortstop than to any other position , as there are more right-handed hitters in baseball than left-handed hitters , and most hitters have a tendency to pull the ball slightly . Like a second baseman , a shortstop must be agile , for example when performing a 4-6-3 double play . Also , like a third baseman , the shortstop fields balls hit to the left side of the infield , where a strong arm is needed to throw out a batter-runner before they reach the safety of first base .",

Raised in the modest Panamanian fishing village of Puerto Caimito , Rivera was an amateur player until he was signed by the Yankees organization in 1990 . He debuted in the major leagues in 1995 as a starting pitcher , before permanently converting to a relief pitcher late in his rookie year . After a breakthrough season in 1996 as a setup man , he became the Yankees ' closer in 1997 . In the following seasons , he established himself as one of baseball 's top relievers , leading the major leagues in saves in 1999 , 2001 , and 2004 . Rivera primarily threw a sharp-moving , mid-90s mile-per-hour cut fastball that frequently broke hitters ' bats and earned a reputation as one of the league 's toughest pitches to hit . With his presence at the end of games , signaled by his foreboding entrance song Enter Sandman , Rivera was a key contributor to the Yankees ' success in the late 1990s and early 2000s .

  "/wiki/Save_(baseball)": "In baseball , a save ( abbreviated SV or S ) is credited to a pitcher who finishes a game for the winning team under certain prescribed circumstances . Most commonly a pitcher earns a save by entering in the ninth inning of a game in which his team is winning by three or fewer runs and finishing the game by pitching one inning without losing the lead . The number of saves or percentage of save opportunities successfully converted are oft-cited statistics of relief pitchers , particularly those in the closer role . The save statistic was created by journalist Jerome Holtzman in 1959 to measure the effectiveness of relief pitchers and was adopted as an official MLB statistic in 1969 . The save has been retroactively measured for pitchers before that date . Mariano Rivera is MLB 's all-time leader in regular-season saves with 652 .",

The award was created in 1978 , and named in tribute to Frick following his death that year . Though they are sometimes erroneously referred to as Hall of Famers , honorees are not inducted into the Hall of Fame . Honorees ( if living ) give a speech at the Hall of Fame during induction weekend , and their names are added to a plaque in the Hall 's library . For several years in the early 2000s , Frick Award honorees also became life members of the Veterans Committee , which considers candidates for Hall of Fame induction who are not eligible for the regular voting by the Baseball Writers ' Association of America - specifically , players no longer on the BBWAA ballot and all non-players . However , starting with the 2008 elections , voting for players on the main Veterans Committee ballot was restricted to Hall of Fame members . After further changes announced for the 2011 elections , Frick Award winners are eligible to serve on the voting bodies that replaced the Veterans Committee ( currently four ) that consider candidates from different eras of baseball . From 2004 to 2016 , fans were allowed to vote for three of the award 's ten annual nominees ; in the final years of fan voting , it was conducted on the Hall 's Facebook page . Through 2013 , seven candidates were selected by a committee consisting of previous Frick Award winners and broadcast historians and columnists , which also determined the final recipient .

Under Rule 5.04 ( c ) of the Official Baseball Rules , a player completes a turn batting when he is put out or becomes a runner . This happens when he strikes out or is declared out before reaching first base ; or when he reaches first base safely or is awarded first base ( by a base on balls , hit by pitch , catcher 's interference , or obstruction ) ; or when he hits a fair ball which causes a preceding runner to be put out for the third out before he himself is put out or reaches first base safely ( see also left on base , fielder 's choice , force play ) . A very similar statistic , at bats , counts a subset of plate appearances that end under certain circumstances .",
  "/wiki/Intentional_walk": "In baseball , an intentional base on balls , usually referred to as an intentional walk and denoted in baseball scorekeeping by IBB , is a walk issued to a batter by a pitcher with the intent of removing the batter 's opportunity to swing at the pitched ball . A pitch that is intentionally thrown far outside the strike zone for this purpose is referred to as an intentional ball . Beginning with the 2017 season , Major League Baseball has removed the requirement to throw four intentional balls . In MLB and in amateur baseball , such as high school and college games , and in most levels of Little League Baseball , the manager of the team on the field now simply asks the plate umpire to let the batter go to first base ."
