With the professionals essentially in control of the cup by 1910 , the newly inaugurated Mann Cup became the replacement for the senior men 's national amateur championship . The Minto Cup professional competition was dominated by the New Westminster Salmonbellies , who held the trophy for 21 of the 29 years in which it was contested ( the competition was suspended during World War I ) . 1924 was the last year professionals played for the Minto Cup - after the Coast professional league folded in June 1924 , it was then placed into storage and for a time lost and forgotten when the last trustee died . The trophy was located just prior to the 1938 junior competition , underneath a desk in his office . During the trophy 's period of inactivity , there were suggestions to make the Minto Cup an international championship trophy .
