  "/wiki/Athletics_(sport)": "Athletics is a group of sporting events that involves competitive running , jumping , throwing , and walking . The most common types of athletics competitions are track and field , road running , cross country running , and race walking . The results of racing events are decided by finishing position ( or time , where measured ) , while the jumps and throws are won by the athlete that achieves the highest or furthest measurement from a series of attempts . The simplicity of the competitions , and the lack of a need for expensive equipment , makes athletics one of the most common types of sports in the world . Athletics is mostly an individual sport , with the exception of relay races and competitions which combine athletes ' performances for a team score , such as cross country . Organized athletics are traced back to the Ancient Olympic Games from 776 BC . The rules and format of the modern events in athletics were defined in Western Europe and North America in the 19th and early 20th century , and were then spread to other parts of the world .

  "/wiki/Team_handball": "Handball ( also known as team handball , European handball or Olympic handball ) is a team sport in which two teams of seven players each ( six outcourt players and a goalkeeper ) pass a ball using their hands with the aim of throwing it into the goal of the other team . A standard match consists of two periods of 30 minutes , and the team that scores more goals wins . Modern handball is played on a court of 40 by 20 metres ( 131 by 66 ft ) , with a goal in the middle of each end . The goals are surrounded by a 6-meter ( 20 ft ) zone where only the defending goalkeeper is allowed ; goals must be scored by throwing the ball from outside the zone or while diving into it . The sport is usually played indoors , but outdoor variants exist in the forms of field handball , Czech handball ( which were more common in the past ) and beach handball . The game is fast and high-scoring : professional teams now typically score between 20 and 35 goals each , though lower scores were not uncommon until a few decades ago . Some players may score hat tricks . Body contact is permitted : the defenders trying to stop the attackers from approaching the goal . No protective equipment is mandated , but players may wear soft protective bands , pads and mouth guards . The game was codified at the end of the 19th century in Denmark . The modern set of rules was published in 1917 in Germany , and had several revisions since . The first international games were played under these rules for men in 1925 and for women in 1930 .",

The sport was originally created in 1882 by Jigoro Kano ( \u5609\u7d0d\u6cbb\u4e94\u90ce ) as a physical , mental , and moral pedagogy in Japan . Judo 's most prominent feature is its competitive element , where the objective is to either throw or take down an opponent to the ground , immobilize or otherwise subdue an opponent with a pin , or force an opponent to submit with a joint lock or a choke . Strikes and thrusts by hands and feet as well as weapons defences are a part of judo , but only in pre-arranged forms ( kata , \u5f62 ) and are not allowed in judo competition or free practice ( randori , \u4e71\u53d6\u308a ) . A judo practitioner is called a judoka . The philosophy and subsequent pedagogy developed for judo became the model for other modern Japanese martial arts that developed from kory\u016b ( \u53e4\u6d41 , traditional schools ) . Judo also spawned a number of derivative martial arts across the world , such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu , Krav Maga and Sambo ."
