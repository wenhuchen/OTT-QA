  "/wiki/Frederick_North,_Lord_North": "Frederick North , 2nd Earl of Guilford , KG , PC ( 13 April 1732 - 5 August 1792 ) , better known by his courtesy title Lord North , which he used from 1752 to 1790 , was Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1770 to 1782 . He led Great Britain through most of the American War of Independence . He also held a number of other cabinet posts , including Home Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer . North 's reputation among historians has swung back and forth . It reached its lowest point in the late nineteenth century , when he was depicted as a creature of the king and an incompetent who lost the American colonies . In the early twentieth century , a revisionism emphasised his strengths in administering the Treasury , handling the House of Commons , and in defending the Church of England . Whig historian Herbert Butterfield , however , argued that his indolence was a barrier to efficient crisis management ; he neglected his role in supervising the entire war effort .",
  "/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom": "George III ( George William Frederick ; 4 June 1738 [ c ] - 29 January 1820 ) was King of Great Britain and King of Ireland from 25 October 1760 until the union of the two countries on 1 January 1801 , after which he was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland until his death in 1820 . He was concurrently Duke and Prince-elector of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg ( Hanover ) in the Holy Roman Empire before becoming King of Hanover on 12 October 1814 . He was a monarch of the House of Hanover , but unlike his two predecessors , he was born in Great Britain , spoke English as his first language , and never visited Hanover . George 's life and reign , which were longer than those of any of his predecessors , were marked by a series of military conflicts involving his kingdoms , much of the rest of Europe , and places farther afield in Africa , the Americas , and Asia . Early in his reign , Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years ' War , becoming the dominant European power in North America and India . However , many of Britain 's American colonies were soon lost in the American War of Independence . Further wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France from 1793 concluded in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 . In the later part of his life , George had recurrent , and eventually permanent , mental illness . Although it has since been suggested that he had bipolar disorder or the blood disease porphyria , the cause of his illness remains unknown . After a final relapse in 1810 , a regency was established . His eldest son , George , Prince of Wales , ruled as Prince Regent until his father 's death , when he succeeded as George IV . Historical analysis of George III 's life has gone through a kaleidoscope of changing views that have depended heavily on the prejudices of his biographers and the sources available to them .",
  "/wiki/Province_of_Massachusetts_Bay": "The Province of Massachusetts Bay was a crown colony in British America which became one of the thirteen original states of the United States from 1776 onward . It was chartered on October 7 , 1691 by William III and Mary II , the joint monarchs of the kingdoms of England , Scotland , and Ireland . The charter took effect on May 14 , 1692 and included the Massachusetts Bay Colony , the Plymouth Colony , the Province of Maine , Martha 's Vineyard , Nantucket , Nova Scotia , and New Brunswick ; the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is the direct successor . Maine has been a separate state since 1820 , and Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are now Canadian provinces , having been part of the colony only until 1697 . The name Massachusetts comes from the Massachusett Indians , an Algonquian tribe . It has been translated as at the great hill , at the place of large hills , or at the range of hills , with reference to the Blue Hills and to Great Blue Hill in particular .",
  "/wiki/Massachusetts_Government_Act": "The Massachusetts Government Act ( 14 Geo . 3 c. 45 ) was passed by the Parliament of Great Britain , receiving royal assent on 20 May 1774 . The act effectively abrogated the Massachusetts Charter of 1691 of the Province of Massachusetts Bay , and gave its royally-appointed governor wide-ranging powers . The colonists said it altered by parliamentary fiat the basic structure of colonial government . They vehemently opposed it and would not let it operate . It was a major step on the way to the start of the American Revolution in 1775 .",
  "/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom": "The Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , commonly known as the UK Parliament , British Parliament or Westminster Parliament , as well as domestically simply as Parliament or Westminster , is the supreme legislative body of the United Kingdom , the Crown dependencies and the British Overseas Territories . It alone possesses legislative supremacy and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the UK and the overseas territories . Parliament is bicameral but has three parts , consisting of the Sovereign ( Queen-in-Parliament ) , the House of Lords , and the House of Commons ( the primary chamber ) . The two houses meet in the Palace of Westminster in the City of Westminster , one of the inner boroughs of the capital city , London . The House of Lords includes two different types of members : the Lords Spiritual , consisting of the most senior bishops of the Church of England , and the Lords Temporal , consisting mainly of life peers , appointed by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister , and of 92 hereditary peers , sitting either by virtue of holding a royal office , or by being elected by their fellow hereditary peers . Prior to the opening of the Supreme Court in October 2009 , the House of Lords also performed a judicial role through the Law Lords . The House of Commons is an elected chamber with elections to 650 single member constituencies held at least every five years under the first-past-the-post system . The two Houses meet in separate chambers in the Palace of Westminster ( commonly known as the Houses of Parliament ) in London . By constitutional convention , all government ministers , including the Prime Minister , are members of the House of Commons or , less commonly , the House of Lords and are thereby accountable to the respective branches of the legislature . Most cabinet ministers are from the Commons , whilst junior ministers can be from either House . However , the Leader of the House of Lords must be a peer . The Parliament of Great Britain was formed in 1707 following the ratification of the Treaty of Union by Acts of Union passed by the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland , both Acts of Union stating , That the United Kingdom of Great Britain be represented by one and the same Parliament to be styled The Parliament of Great Britain .",
  "/wiki/Martial_law": "Martial law is the imposition of direct military control of normal civilian functions by a government , especially in response to a temporary emergency such as invasion or major disaster , or in an occupied territory . Martial law can be used by governments to enforce their rule over the public , as seen in multiple countries listed below . Such incidents may occur after a coup d'\u00e9tat ( Thailand in 2006 and 2014 , and Egypt in 2013 ) ; when threatened by popular protest ( China , Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 , 2009 's Iranian Green Movement that led to the takeover by Revolutionary Guards ) ; to suppress political opposition ( Poland in 1981 ) ; or to stabilize insurrections or perceived insurrections ( Canada , the October Crisis of 1970 ) . Martial law may be declared in cases of major natural disasters ; however , most countries use a different legal construct , such as a state of emergency . Martial law has also been imposed during conflicts , and in cases of occupations , where the absence of any other civil government provides for an unstable population . Examples of this form of military rule include post World War II reconstruction in Germany and Japan , the recovery and reconstruction of the former Confederate States of America during Reconstruction Era in the United States of America following the American Civil War , and German occupation of northern France between 1871 and 1873 after the Treaty of Frankfurt ended the Franco-Prussian War . Typically , the imposition of martial law accompanies curfews ; the suspension of civil law , civil rights , and habeas corpus ; and the application or extension of military law or military justice to civilians . Civilians defying martial law may be subjected to military tribunal ( court-martial ) .",
  "/wiki/Thomas_Gage": "General Thomas Gage ( 10 March 1718/19 - 2 April 1787 ) was a British Army general officer and colonial official best known for his many years of service in North America , including his role as British commander-in-chief in the early days of the American Revolution . Being born to an aristocratic family in England , he entered military service , seeing action in the French and Indian War , where he served alongside his future opponent George Washington in the 1755 Battle of the Monongahela . After the fall of Montreal in 1760 , he was named its military governor . During this time he did not distinguish himself militarily , but proved himself to be a competent administrator . From 1763 to 1775 he served as commander-in-chief of the British forces in North America , overseeing the British response to the 1763 Pontiac 's Rebellion . In 1774 he was also appointed the military governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay , with instructions to implement the Intolerable Acts , punishing Massachusetts for the Boston Tea Party . His attempts to seize military stores of Patriot militias in April 1775 sparked the Battles of Lexington and Concord , beginning the American Revolutionary War . After the Pyrrhic victory in the June Battle of Bunker Hill , he was replaced by General William Howe in October , 1775 , and returned to Great Britain .",
  "/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party": "The Boston Tea Party was a political and mercantile protest by the Sons of Liberty in Boston , Massachusetts , on December 16 , 1773 . The target was the Tea Act of May 10 , 1773 , which allowed the British East India company to sell tea from China in American colonies without paying taxes apart from those imposed by the Townshend Acts . American Patriots strongly opposed the taxes in the Townshend Act as a violation of their rights . Demonstrators , some disguised as Native Americans , destroyed an entire shipment of tea sent by the East India Company . They boarded the ships and threw the chests of tea into the Boston Harbor . The British government responded harshly and the episode escalated into the American Revolution . The Tea Party became an iconic event of American history , and since then other political protests such as the Tea Party movement have referred to themselves as historical successors to the Boston protest of 1773 . The Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act , which had been passed by the British Parliament in 1773 . Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to no taxation without representation , that is , to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented . In addition , the well-connected East India Company had been granted competitive advantages over colonial tea importers , who resented the move and feared additional infringement on their business . Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of tea in three other colonies , but in Boston , embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain . The Boston Tea Party was a significant event in the growth of the American Revolution .",
  "/wiki/Battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord": "The Battles of Lexington and Concord were the first military engagements of the American Revolutionary War . The battles were fought on April 19 , 1775 in Middlesex County , Province of Massachusetts Bay , within the towns of Lexington , Concord , Lincoln , Menotomy ( present-day Arlington ) , and Cambridge . They marked the outbreak of armed conflict between the Kingdom of Great Britain and its thirteen colonies in America . In late 1774 , Colonial leaders adopted the Suffolk Resolves in resistance to the alterations made to the Massachusetts colonial government by the British parliament following the Boston Tea Party . The colonial assembly responded by forming a Patriot provisional government known as the Massachusetts Provincial Congress and calling for local militias to train for possible hostilities . The Colonial government exercised effective control of the colony outside of British-controlled Boston . In response , the British government in February 1775 declared Massachusetts to be in a state of rebellion . About 700 British Army regulars in Boston , under Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith , were given secret orders to capture and destroy Colonial military supplies reportedly stored by the Massachusetts militia at Concord . Through effective intelligence gathering , Patriot leaders had received word weeks before the expedition that their supplies might be at risk and had moved most of them to other locations . On the night before the battle , warning of the British expedition had been rapidly sent from Boston to militias in the area by several riders , including Paul Revere and Samuel Prescott , with information about British plans . The initial mode of the Army 's arrival by water was signaled from the Old North Church in Boston to Charlestown using lanterns to communicate one if by land , two if by sea . The first shots were fired just as the sun was rising at Lexington .",
  "/wiki/American_Revolution": "The American Revolution was a colonial revolt which occurred between 1765 and 1783 . The American Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) with the assistance of France , winning independence from Great Britain and establishing the United States of America . The American colonials proclaimed no taxation without representation starting with the Stamp Act Congress in 1765 . They rejected the authority of the British Parliament to tax them because they had no representatives in that governing body . Protests steadily escalated to the Boston Massacre in 1770 and the burning of the Gaspee in Rhode Island in 1772 , followed by the Boston Tea Party in December 1773 . The British responded by closing Boston Harbor and enacting a series of punitive laws which effectively rescinded Massachusetts Bay Colony 's rights of self-government . The other colonies rallied behind Massachusetts , and a group of American Patriot leaders set up their own government in late 1774 at the Continental Congress to coordinate their resistance of Britain ; other colonists retained their allegiance to the Crown and were known as Loyalists or Tories . Tensions erupted into battle between Patriot militia and British regulars when King George 's forces attempted to destroy Colonial military supplies at Lexington and Concord on April 19 , 1775 . The conflict then developed into war , during which the Patriots ( and later their French allies ) fought the British and Loyalists in the Revolutionary War . Each of the thirteen colonies formed a Provincial Congress which assumed power from the former colonial governments , suppressed Loyalism , and recruited a Continental Army led by General George Washington . The Continental Congress declared King George a tyrant who trampled the colonists ' rights as Englishmen , and they declared the colonies free and independent states on July 2 , 1776 . The Patriot leadership professed the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism to reject monarchy and aristocracy , and they proclaimed that all men are created equal .",

  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain": "The Kingdom of Great Britain , officially called Great Britain , was a sovereign state in Western Europe from 1 May 1707 to 1 January 1801 . The state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706 , ratified by the Acts of Union 1707 , which united the kingdoms of England ( which included Wales ) and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands , with the exception of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands . The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster . The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI of Scotland became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Elizabeth I , bringing about the Union of the Crowns . Since its inception , the kingdom was in legislative and personal union with the Kingdom of Ireland . Following the accession of George I to the throne of Great Britain in 1714 , the kingdom was in a personal union with the Electorate of Hanover . The early years of the newly-united kingdom were marked by Jacobite risings , which ended in defeat for the Stuart cause at the Battle of Culloden in 1746 . In 1763 , victory in the Seven Years ' War led to the dominance of the British Empire , which was to become the foremost global power for over a century , slowly growing to become the largest empire in history . From the mid-1750s , the Kingdom came to dominate the Indian subcontinent through the aggressive expansion of the East India Trading Company , and until suffering defeat in the American War of Independence , it claimed vast swaths of the North American continent through its burgeoning American colonies . The Kingdom of Great Britain was replaced by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on 1 January 1801 with the Acts of Union 1800 .",

He greatly influenced early Mexican politics and government , and he was an adept soldier and cunning politician who dominated Mexican history in the first half of the nineteenth century to such an extent that historians often refer to it as the Age of Santa Anna . He was called the Man of Destiny who loomed over his time like a melodramatic colossus , the uncrowned monarch . Santa Anna first opposed the movement for Mexican independence from Spain , but then fought in support of it . He was the earliest of the caudillos ( military leaders ) of modern Mexico , and he represents the stereotypical caudillo in Mexican history .

In 1521 , the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the territory from its politically powerful base in Mexico-Tenochtitlan ( part of Mexico City ) , which was administered as the viceroyalty of New Spain . The Roman Catholic Church played a powerful role in governing the country as millions were converted to the faith , although King Charles III expelled the Jesuits in the 1770s .

It followed in the wake of the 1845 U.S. annexation of Texas , which was not formally recognized by the Mexican government , who disputed the Treaties of Velasco signed by Mexican caudillo President/General Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna after the Texas Revolution a decade earlier . In 1845 , newly elected U.S. President James K. Polk , who saw the annexation of Texas as the first step towards a further expansion of the United States , sent troops to the disputed area and a diplomatic mission to Mexico . After Mexican forces attacked U.S. forces , the United States Congress declared war . U.S. forces quickly occupied the regional capital of Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico along the upper Rio Grande and the Pacific coast province of Alta California , and then moved south . Meanwhile , the Pacific Squadron of the U.S. Navy blockaded the Pacific coast farther south in the lower Baja California Territory . The U.S. Army , under Major General Winfield Scott , eventually captured Mexico City through stiff resistance , having marched west from the port of Veracruz on the Gulf Coast , where the U.S. staged its first ever major amphibious landing . The 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , forced onto the remnant Mexican government , ended the war and enforced the Mexican Cession of the northern territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico to the United States . The U.S. agreed to pay $ 15 million in compensation for the physical damage of the war and assumed $ 3.25 million of debt already owed earlier by the Mexican government to U.S. citizens . Mexico acknowledged the loss of what became the State of Texas and accepted the Rio Grande as its northern border with the United States . The victory and territorial expansion Polk envisioned inspired great patriotism in the United States , but the war and treaty drew some criticism in the U.S. for their casualties , monetary cost , and heavy-handedness , particularly early on .

France , including its overseas territories , has the most number of time zones of any country , with a total of 12 . During the Iron Age , what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls , a Celtic people . Rome annexed the area in 51 BC , holding it until the arrival of Germanic Franks in 476 , who formed the Kingdom of Francia . The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned Francia into East Francia , Middle Francia and West Francia . West Francia , which became the Kingdom of France in 987 , emerged as a major European power in the Late Middle Ages , following its victory in the Hundred Years ' War ( 1337-1453 ) .",

He oversaw a period of decline , with rebellions particularly in the Balkans , and he had an unsuccessful war with the Russian Empire followed by a successful war against the Kingdom of Greece in 1897 . Hamid II ruled from August 31 , 1876 until he was deposed shortly after the 1908 Young Turk Revolution , on April 27 , 1909 . In accordance with an agreement made with the Republican Young Ottomans , he promulgated the first Ottoman Constitution of 1876 on December 23 , 1876 , which was a sign of progressive thinking that marked his early rule . Later , however , he noticed Western influence on Ottoman affairs and citing disagreements with the Parliament , suspended both the short-lived constitution and Parliament in 1878 and accomplished highly effective power and control . Modernization of the Ottoman Empire occurred during his reign , including the reform of the bureaucracy , the extension of the Rumelia Railway and Anatolia Railway , the construction of the Baghdad Railway , and the Hejaz Railway . In addition to this modernization , a system for population registration and control over the press was established along with the first local modern law school in 1898 . The most far-reaching of these reforms were in education : many professional schools were established for fields including the law , arts , trades , civil engineering , veterinary medicine , customs , farming , and linguistics . Although AbdulHamid II closed the University of Istanbul in 1881 , it was reopened in 1900 , and a network of secondary , primary , and military schools was extended throughout the empire . Railway and telegraph systems were developed by primarily German firms . During his reign , the Ottoman Empire became bankrupt leading to the establishment of Ottoman Public Debt Administration in 1881 . Abroad , Sultan Abdul Hamid II was nicknamed the Red Sultan or Abdul the Damned due to the alleged massacres of Armenians and Assyrians during his rule and use of the secret police to silence dissent and republicanism .",

It was founded at the end of the 13th century in northwestern Anatolia in the town of S\u00f6\u011f\u00fct ( modern-day Bilecik Province ) by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman I . Although initially the dynasty was of Turkic origin , it was Persianised in terms of language , culture , literature and habits . After 1354 , the Ottomans crossed into Europe , and with the conquest of the Balkans , the Ottoman beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire . The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror . During the 16th and 17th centuries , at the height of its power under the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent , the Ottoman Empire was a multinational , multilingual empire controlling most of Southeast Europe , parts of Central Europe , Western Asia , parts of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus , North Africa and the Horn of Africa . At the beginning of the 17th century , the empire contained 32 provinces and numerous vassal states . Some of these were later absorbed into the Ottoman Empire , while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries . [ note 7 ] With Constantinople as its capital and control of lands around the Mediterranean Basin , the Ottoman Empire was at the centre of interactions between the Eastern and Western worlds for six centuries . While the empire was once thought to have entered a period of decline following the death of Suleiman the Magnificent , this view is no longer supported by the majority of academic historians . The empire continued to maintain a flexible and strong economy , society and military throughout the 17th and much of the 18th century . However , during a long period of peace from 1740 to 1768 , the Ottoman military system fell behind that of their European rivals , the Habsburg and Russian empires .",

Fought in the Balkans and in the Caucasus , it originated in emerging 19th-century Balkan nationalism . Additional factors included Russian goals of recovering territorial losses endured during the Crimean War of 1853-56 , re-establishing itself in the Black Sea and supporting the political movement attempting to free Balkan nations from the Ottoman Empire . The Russian-led coalition won the war , pushing the Turks back all the way to the gates of Constantinople but for the timely intervention of the western European great powers . As a result , Russia succeeded in claiming provinces in the Caucasus , namely Kars and Batum , and also annexed the Budjak region . The principalities of Romania , Serbia , and Montenegro , each of which had had de facto sovereignty for some time , formally proclaimed independence from the Ottoman Empire . After almost five centuries of Ottoman domination ( 1396-1878 ) , a Bulgarian state re-emerged : the Principality of Bulgaria , covering the land between the Danube River and the Balkan Mountains ( except Northern Dobrudja which was given to Romania ) , as well as the region of Sofia , which became the new state 's capital . The Congress of Berlin in 1878 also allowed Austria-Hungary to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland to take over Cyprus . The initial Treaty of San Stefano , signed on 3 March 1878 , is today celebrated on Liberation Day in Bulgaria , although the occasion somewhat fell out of favour during years of Socialist rule .",

The General Assembly was first constituted on 23 December 1876 and initially lasted until 14 February 1878 , when it was dissolved by Sultan Abdul Hamid II . As a result of the Young Turk Revolution which brought substantial reforms and larger participation by political parties , the General Assembly was revived 30 years later , on 23 July 1908 , with the Second Constitutional Era . The Second Constitutional Era ended on 11 April 1920 , when the General Assembly was dissolved by the Allies during the occupation of Constantinople in the aftermath of World War I .

Later it was put back into effect and amended to transfer more power from the sultan and the appointed Senate to the generally elected Chamber of Deputies after the 1908 Young Turk Revolution , initiating a period known as the Second Constitutional Era . In the course of their studies in Europe , some members of the new Ottoman elite concluded that the secret of Europe 's success rested not just with its technical achievements but also with its political organizations . Moreover , the process of reform itself had imbued a small segment of this elite with the belief that constitutional government would be a desirable check on autocracy and provide them with a better opportunity to influence policy . Sultan Abd\u00fclaziz 's chaotic rule led to his deposition in 1876 and , after a few troubled months , to the proclamation of an Ottoman constitution that the new sultan , Abdul Hamid II , pledged to uphold .",

He was part of a governing elite which recognized the crisis the Empire was in and considered reform to be a dire need . Midhat Pasha is described as a person with a liberal attitude and is often considered as one of the founders of the Ottoman Parliament . He was described by Caroline Finkel as a true representative of Tanzimat optimism , who believed that separatist tendencies could be best countered by demonstrating the benefits of good government . For the British , his reforming zeal was an aberration , based on individual strength of personality .

Its capital is Bras\u00edlia , and its most populous city is S\u00e3o Paulo . The federation is composed of the union of the 26 states , the Federal District , and the 5,570 municipalities . It is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas ; it is also one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations , due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world . Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east , Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers ( 4,655 mi ) .

Its government was a representative parliamentary constitutional monarchy under the rule of Emperors Dom Pedro I and his son Dom Pedro II . A colony of the Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil became the seat of the Portuguese colonial Empire in 1808 , when the Portuguese Prince regent , later King Dom Jo\u00e3o VI , fled from Napoleon 's invasion of Portugal and established himself and his government in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro . Jo\u00e3o VI later returned to Portugal , leaving his eldest son and heir , Pedro , to rule the Kingdom of Brazil as regent . On 7 September 1822 , Pedro declared the independence of Brazil and , after waging a successful war against his father 's kingdom , was acclaimed on 12 October as Pedro I , the first Emperor of Brazil . The new country was huge , sparsely populated and ethnically diverse . Unlike most of the neighboring Hispanic American republics , Brazil had political stability , vibrant economic growth , constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech , and respect for civil rights of its subjects , albeit with legal restrictions on women and slaves , the latter regarded as property and not citizens . The empire 's bicameral parliament was elected under comparatively democratic methods for the era , as were the provincial and local legislatures . This led to a long ideological conflict between Pedro I and a sizable parliamentary faction over the role of the monarch in the government . He faced other obstacles . The unsuccessful Cisplatine War against the neighboring United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata in 1828 led to the secession of the province of Cisplatina ( later to become Uruguay ) .

His father 's abrupt abdication and departure to Europe in 1831 left the five year-old as Emperor and led to a grim and lonely childhood and adolescence , obliged to spend his time studying in preparation for rule . He knew only brief moments of happiness and encountered few friends of his age . His experiences with court intrigues and political disputes during this period greatly affected his later character ; he grew into a man with a strong sense of duty and devotion toward his country and his people , yet increasingly resentful of his role as monarch . Pedro II inherited an empire on the verge of disintegration , but he turned Brazil into an emerging power in the international arena . The nation grew to be distinguished from its Hispanic neighbors on account of its political stability , zealously guarded freedom of speech , respect for civil rights , vibrant economic growth , and form of government - a functional representative parliamentary monarchy . Brazil was also victorious in the Platine War , the Uruguayan War , and the Paraguayan War , as well as prevailing in several other international disputes and domestic tensions . Pedro II steadfastly pushed through the abolition of slavery despite opposition from powerful political and economic interests . A savant in his own right , the Emperor established a reputation as a vigorous sponsor of learning , culture , and the sciences , and he won the respect and admiration of people such as Charles Darwin , Victor Hugo , and Friedrich Nietzsche , and was a friend to Richard Wagner , Louis Pasteur , and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow , among others . There was no desire for a change in the form of government among most Brazilians , but the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'\u00e9tat that had almost no support outside a clique of military leaders who desired a form of republic headed by a dictator .

Carol was the eldest son of Ferdinand I and became crown prince upon the death of his grand-uncle , King Carol I in 1914 . He was the first of the Hohenzollern kings of Romania to be born in the country ( both of his predecessors were born and grew up in Germany and only came to Romania as adults ) . Carol , by contrast , spoke Romanian as his first language and was the first member of the Romanian royal family to be raised in the Orthodox faith . He possessed a hedonistic personality that contributed to the controversies marring his reign , and his life was marked by numerous scandals , among them marriages to Zizi Lambrino and Princess Helen of Greece and Denmark , daughter of King Constantine I of Greece . His continued affairs with Magda Lupescu obliged him to renounce his succession rights in 1925 and leave the country . Princess Helen eventually divorced him in 1928 . King Ferdinand died in 1927 and Carol 's five-year-old son ascended the throne as Michael I. Carol then returned to Romania in 1930 and replaced his son and the regency that had been in place . His reign was marked by re-alignment with Nazi Germany , adoption of anti-semitic laws and ultimately evolved into a personal dictatorship beginning in 1938 . On 6 September 1940 , he was forced by his Prime Minister Ion Antonescu to leave the country and withdraw abroad into exile . He was succeeded by his son Michael .",

From 1859 to 1877 , Romania evolved from a personal union of two vassal principalities ( Moldavia and Wallachia ) under a single prince to an autonomous principality with a Hohenzollern monarchy . The country gained its independence from the Ottoman Empire during the 1877-1878 Russo-Turkish War ( known locally as the Romanian War of Independence ) , when it also received Northern Dobruja in exchange for the southern part of Bessarabia .

With the exception of the southern halves of Bukovina and Transylvania , these territories were ceded to neighboring countries in 1940 , under the pressure of Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union . Following a disastrous World War II campaign on the side of the Axis powers and name change ( Legionary Romania ) , Romania joined the Allies in 1944 , recovering Northern Transylvania . The influence of the neighboring Soviet Union and the policies followed by Communist-dominated coalition governments ultimately led to the abolition of the monarchy , with Romania becoming a People 's Republic on the last day of 1947 .",

Four draft constitutions existed : one belonging to the National Liberal Party , written with contributions from Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu ; one composed by R. Boil\u0103 at Cluj , under the influence of the Romanian National Party ; one by Constantin Stere , representing the views of the Peasants ' Party ; and a fourth by C. Berariu . Except for Stere 's proposal , which involved a unicameral legislature , proportional representation and popular consultation through the plebiscite , the other three were inspired ( when it came to political organisation ) by the 1866 Constitution . The Liberals came to power in 1922 and managed to push through their own draft , which was approved 247-8 ( with two abstentions ) in the Chamber of Deputies on March 26 , 1923 , and the next day in the Senate , 137-2 ( with two abstentions ) . It was published in Monitorul Oficial and came into force on March 29 . The constitution had eight titles and 138 articles , of which 76 came in their entirety from its predecessor . It enshrined the principles of popular sovereignty ( exercised through representatives ) , separation of powers in the state , rule of law and decentralisation . Rights and freedoms for all citizens were recognised , regardless of ethnicity , language , religion or social class ; the right to own property was guaranteed and , for the first time , the nationalisation of mineral deposits was provided for . The Kingdom of Romania was defined as a unitary and indivisible national state , with an inalienable territory . The state guaranteed freedom of expression and assembly , of conscience and of religion , and declared that as the Romanian Orthodox Church is the religion of the great majority of Romanians it is the dominant church in the Romanian State , while the Greek-Catholic Church has primacy before other faiths . Regarding state organisation , legislative power was entrusted to Parliament ( Senate and Assembly of Deputies ) and the King ; executive power to the King , who delegated it to the Council of Ministers ; and judicial power to the central and local judicial organs . The right to vote was expanded beyond the 1866 regulations : it was universal for all males , equal , direct , compulsory and secret , based on majority representation .",

A specialist in mining and veteran of both the Second Balkan War and World War I , he made a fortune in interwar Greater Romania . Gigurtu began his career in politics with the People 's Party ( PP ) and the National Agrarian Party , moving closer to the far right during the 1930s , and serving as Minister of Industry and Commerce in the cabinet of Octavian Goga . Shortly after the start of World War II , Gigurtu was affiliated with King Carol 's National Renaissance Front , serving as Public Works and Communications Minister and Foreign Minister under Premier Gheorghe T\u0103t\u0103rescu , before the territorial losses incurred by Romania in front of the Soviet Union propelled him as T\u0103t\u0103rescu 's replacement . Gigurtu 's executive was primarily noted for realizing the inability of France and the United Kingdom to guarantee Romania 's borders and , accordingly , for the alignment with Nazi Germany . As part of this program , Gigurtu most notably enforced official antisemitism and racial discrimination , implementing locally a version of the Nuremberg Laws . Despite such measures , the government fell after being compelled by Germany to accept the cession of Northern Transylvania to Hungary , and was consequently forced to resign amidst nationwide protests . Gigurtu retreated from public life for the rest of the war , and , following the pro-Allied King Michael Coup , was arrested , investigated and released several times .

During his rule Franco assumed the title Caudillo . This period in Spanish history , from the Nationalist victory in the Spanish Civil War to Franco 's death , is commonly known as Francoist Spain or the Francoist dictatorship . Franco was born in Ferrol , Spain as the son of an upper-class family with strong traditional ties and several generations of high-ranking officers in the Spanish Navy . But due to the navy being crippled by the Spanish-American War Franco instead joined the Spanish Army as a cadet in the Toledo Infantry Academy in 1907 , graduating in 1910 . He would then go on to serve in Morocco , rapidly advancing through the ranks for bravery in combat and an assiduous attention to detail in logistics . In 1926 he became Brigadier General at age 33 , the youngest General in all Europe , and two years later he became director of the General Military Academy in Zaragoza . As a conservative and a monarchist , Franco regretted the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of the Second Republic in 1931 . He was devastated by the closing of his beloved Academy , but nevertheless continued his service in the Republican Army . For a time he was even left without posting , but his career improved after the right wing CEDA and PRR won the 1933 election . In 1934 Franco led the brutal suppression of the uprising in Asturias , sharpening the antagonism between Left and Right in the country .

The nature of the regime evolved and changed during its existence . Months after the start of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 , Franco emerged as the dominant rebel military leader and was proclaimed Head of State on 1 October 1936 , ruling a dictatorship over the territory controlled by the Nationalist faction . The 1937 Unification Decree , which merged all parties supporting the rebel side , led to Nationalist Spain becoming a single-party regime under the FET y de las JONS . The end of the war in 1939 brought the extension of the Franco rule to the whole country and the exile of Republican institutions . The Francoist dictatorship originally took a form described as fascistized dictatorship , or semi-fascist regime , showing clear influence of fascism in fields such as labor relations , the autarkic economic policy , aesthetics , or the single-party system . As time went on , the regime opened up and became closer to developmental dictatorships , although it always preserved residual fascist trappings . During the Second World War , Spain did not join the Axis powers ( its supporters from the civil war , Italy and Germany ) . Nevertheless , Spain would support them in various ways throughout most of the war while maintaining its neutrality . Because of this , Spain was isolated by many other countries for nearly a decade after World War II all the while its autarkic economy , still trying to recover from the civil war , suffered from chronic depression . The 1947 Law of Succession made Spain a de jure Kingdom again , but defined Franco as the Head of State for life with the power to choose the person to become King of Spain and his successor . Reforms were implemented in the 1950s and Spain abandoned autarky , delegating authority from the Falangist movement , which had been prone to isolationism , to a new breed of economists , the technocrats of Opus Dei .",

It was the constitution of the Second Spanish Republic ( founded 14 April 1931 ) and was in force until 1 April 1939 . This was the second period of Spanish history in which both head of state and head of government were democratically elected . A constitutional draft prepared by a commission under a reformist Catholic lawyer \u00c1ngel Ossorio y Gallardo having been rejected , an amended draft was approved by the Constituent Assembly on 9 December 1931 . It created a secular democratic system based on equal rights for all citizens , with provision for regional autonomy . It introduced female suffrage , civil marriage and divorce . It permitted the state to expropriate private property , with compensation , for reasons of broader social utility . It also established free , obligatory , secular education for all and dissolved the Jesuits . The Republic was the culmination of a process of mass mobilisation and opposition to the old politics of notables . According to the historian Mary Vincent the Constitution envisaged a reforming regime with an explicit and self-conscious view of what modernising Spain should entail . A secular state operating according to the rule of law with an admittedly ill-defined sense of social justice would open the way for an educated body of citizens to enjoy 'European ' prosperity and freedom . According to Frances Lannon however , the articles on property and religion , with their exaltation of state power and disregard for civil rights , virtually destroyed any prospect there had been for the development of a Catholic , conservative , Republicanism .",

It was composed of a variety of right-wing political groups that supported the Spanish coup of July 1936 against the Second Spanish Republic , including the Falange , the CEDA , and two rival monarchist claimants : the Alfonsist Renovaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola and the Carlist Traditionalist Communion . In 1937 , all the groups were merged into the FET y de las JONS . One of the members of the 1936 coup , General Francisco Franco , would after the death of the factions earlier leaders head the Nationalists throughout most of the war and emerge as the dictator of Spain until 1975 . The term Nationalists or Nationals ( nacionales ) was coined by Joseph Goebbels following the visit of the clandestine Spanish delegation led by Captain Francisco Arranz requesting war material on 24 July 1936 , in order to give a cloak of legitimacy to Nazi Germany 's help to the Spanish rebel military . The leaders of the rebel faction , who had already been denominated as 'Crusaders ' by Bishop of Salamanca Enrique Pla y Deniel - and also used the term Cruzada for their campaign - immediately took a liking to it . The term Bando nacional - much as the term rojos ( Reds ) to refer to the loyalists - is considered by some authors as a term linked with the propaganda of that faction . Throughout the civil war the term 'Nationalist ' was mainly used by the members and supporters of the rebel faction , while its opponents used the terms fascistas ( fascists ) or facciosos ( sectarians ) to refer to this faction .",

Republicans loyal to the left-leaning Second Spanish Republic , in alliance with anarchists and communists , fought against a revolt by the Nationalists , an alliance of Falangists , monarchists , conservatives and Catholics , led by a military group among whom General Francisco Franco soon achieved a preponderant role . Due to the international political climate at the time , the war had many facets and was variously viewed as class struggle , a war of religion , a struggle between dictatorship and republican democracy , between revolution and counterrevolution , and between fascism and communism . It has been frequently called the dress rehearsal for World War II . The Nationalists won the war , which ended in early 1939 , and ruled Spain until Franco 's death in November 1975 . The war began after a pronunciamiento ( a declaration of military opposition ) against the Republican government by a group of generals of the Spanish Republican Armed Forces , originally under the leadership of Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo . The government at the time was a coalition of Republicans , supported in the Cortes by communist and socialist parties , under the leadership of centre-left President Manuel Aza\u00f1a . The Nationalist group was supported by a number of conservative groups , including CEDA , monarchists , including both the opposing Alfonsists and the religious conservative Carlists , and the FE de las JONS , a fascist political party . After the deaths of Sanjurjo , Emilio Mola and Manuel Goded Llopis , Franco emerged as the remaining leader of the Nationalist side . The coup was supported by military units in the Spanish protectorate in Morocco , Pamplona , Burgos , Zaragoza , Valladolid , C\u00e1diz , C\u00f3rdoba , and Seville .

After the war , he was convicted of war crimes and executed . A Romanian Army career officer who made his name during the 1907 peasants ' revolt and the World War I Romanian Campaign , the antisemitic Antonescu sympathized with the far right and fascist National Christian and Iron Guard groups for much of the interwar period . He was a military attach\u00e9 to France and later Chief of the General Staff , briefly serving as Defense Minister in the National Christian cabinet of Octavian Goga as well as the subsequent First Cristea cabinet , in which he also served as Air and Marine Minister . During the late 1930s , his political stance brought him into conflict with King Carol II and led to his detainment . Antonescu nevertheless rose to political prominence during the political crisis of 1940 , and established the National Legionary State , an uneasy partnership with the Iron Guard 's leader Horia Sima . After entering Romania into an alliance with Nazi Germany and the Axis and ensuring Adolf Hitler 's confidence , he eliminated the Guard during the Legionary Rebellion of 1941 . In addition to being Prime Minister , he served as his own Foreign Minister and Defense Minister . Soon after Romania joined the Axis in Operation Barbarossa , recovering Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina , Antonescu also became Marshal of Romania . An atypical figure among Holocaust perpetrators , Antonescu enforced policies independently responsible for the deaths of as many as 400,000 people , most of them Bessarabian , Ukrainian and Romanian Jews , as well as Romanian Romani .

Born in Chekiang ( Zhejiang ) Province , Chiang was a member of the Kuomintang and a lieutenant of Sun Yat-sen in the revolution to overthrow the Beiyang government and reunify China . With Soviet and communist ( CPC ) help , Chiang organized the military for Sun 's Canton Nationalist Government and headed the Whampoa Military Academy . Commander in chief of the National Revolutionary Army ( from which he came to be known as Generalissimo ) , he led the Northern Expedition from 1926 to 1928 , before defeating a coalition of warlords and nominally reunifying China under a new Nationalist government . Midway through the campaign , the KMT-CPC alliance broke down and Chiang purged the communists inside the party , triggering a civil war with the CCP , which he eventually lost in 1949 . As leader of the Republic of China in the Nanjing decade , Chiang sought to strike a difficult balance between the modernizing China while also devoting resources to defending the nation against the impending Japanese threat . Trying to avoid a war with Japan while hostilities with CCP continued , he was kidnapped in the Xi'an Incident and obliged to form an Anti-Japanese United Front with the CCP . Following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937 , he mobilized China for the Second Sino-Japanese War . For eight years he led the war of resistance against a vastly superior enemy , mostly from the wartime capital Chongqing . As the leader of a major Allied power , Chiang met with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D.

Taipei is the capital and largest metropolitan area . Other major cities include Kaohsiung , Taichung , Tainan and Taoyuan . With 23.7 million inhabitants , Taiwan is among the most densely populated states , and is the most populous state and largest economy that is not a member of the United Nations ( UN ) . Taiwanese indigenous peoples settled the island of Taiwan around 6,000 years ago . In the 17th century , Dutch rule opened the island to mass Han immigration .

Following the surrender of Japan in 1945 , the Republic of China , which had overthrown and succeeded the Qing in 1911 , took control of Taiwan on behalf of the World War II Allies . The resumption of the Chinese Civil War led to the loss of the mainland to the Communist Party of China and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949 .

The war is generally divided into two phases with an interlude : from August 1927 to 1937 , the KMT-CPC Alliance collapsed during the Northern Expedition , and the Nationalists controlled most of China . From 1937 to 1945 , hostilities were put on hold , and the Second United Front fought the Japanese invasion of China with eventual help from the World War II Allies . The civil war resumed with the Japanese defeat , and the CPC gained the upper hand in the final phase of the war from 1945-1949 , generally referred to as the Chinese Communist Revolution . The Communists gained control of mainland China and established the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) in 1949 , forcing the Republic of China to retreat to the island of Taiwan . A lasting political and military standoff between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait ensued , with the ROC in Taiwan and the PRC in mainland China both officially claiming to be the legitimate government of all China .

The predecessor of the Kuomintang , the Revolutionary Alliance ( Tongmenghui ) , was one of the major advocates of the overthrow of the Qing dynasty and the subsequent revolt in 1911 and proclamation of the Republic of China . The KMT was founded by Song Jiaoren and Sun Yat-sen shortly after the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 . Sun was the provisional President , but he later ceded the presidency to Yuan Shikai . Later led by Chiang Kai-shek , the KMT formed the National Revolutionary Army and succeeded in its Northern Expedition to unify much of mainland China in 1928 , ending the chaos of the Warlord Era . It was the ruling party in mainland China until 1949 , when it lost the Chinese Civil War to the rival Communist Party of China . The KMT fled to Taiwan where it continued to govern as an authoritarian one-party state . This government retained China 's United Nations seat ( with considerable Western support ) until 1971 . Taiwan ceased to be a single-party state in 1986 and political reforms beginning in the 1990s loosened the KMT 's grip on power .

Batista initially rose to power as part of the 1933 Revolt of the Sergeants , which overthrew the provisional government of Carlos Manuel de C\u00e9spedes y Quesada . He then appointed himself chief of the armed forces , with the rank of colonel , and effectively controlled the five-member pentarchy that functioned as the collective head of state . He maintained this control through a string of puppet presidents until 1940 , when he was himself elected President of Cuba on a populist platform . He then instated the 1940 Constitution of Cuba and served until 1944 . After finishing his term he lived in Florida , returning to Cuba to run for president in 1952 . Facing certain electoral defeat , he led a military coup against President Carlos Pr\u00edo Socarr\u00e1s that preempted the election . Back in power , and receiving financial , military , and logistical support from the United States government , Batista suspended the 1940 Constitution and revoked most political liberties , including the right to strike . He then aligned with the wealthiest landowners who owned the largest sugar plantations , and presided over a stagnating economy that widened the gap between rich and poor Cubans . Eventually it reached the point where most of the sugar industry was in U.S. hands , and foreigners owned 70% of the arable land . As such , Batista 's repressive government then began to systematically profit from the exploitation of Cuba 's commercial interests , by negotiating lucrative relationships with both the American Mafia , who controlled the drug , gambling , and prostitution businesses in Havana , and with large U.S.-based multinational companies who were awarded lucrative contracts . To quell the growing discontent amongst the populace - which was subsequently displayed through frequent student riots and demonstrations - Batista established tighter censorship of the media , while also utilizing his Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities secret police to carry out wide-scale violence , torture and public executions .",

  "/wiki/Monarchy": "A monarchy is a form of government in which a person , the monarch , is head of state until death or abdication . The legitimation and governing power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic ( crowned republic ) , to restricted ( constitutional monarchy ) , to fully autocratic ( absolute monarchy ) , combining executive , legislative and judicial power . In most cases , the succession of monarchies is hereditary , but there are also elective and self-proclaimed monarchies , often building dynastic periods . Aristocrats , though not inherent to monarchies , often serve as the pool of persons to draw the monarch from and fill the constituting institutions ( e.g . diet and court ) , giving many monarchies oligarchic elements . A monarchy can be a polity through unity , personal union , vassalage or federation . Its authorities are proclaimed and recognized through the different seats , insignia and titles that a monarch can occupy and be invested with . For example , monarchs can carry titles such as king , queen , emperor , khan , caliph , tsar , or sultan , and can be bound to territories ( e.g. , the Emperor of Japan ) and peoples ( e.g. , the King of the Belgians ) .

Before his presidency , he was the chairman of the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction from 1961 to 1963 after a career as a military leader in the South Korean army . Park 's coup brought an end to the interim government of the Second Republic and his election and inauguration in 1963 ushered in the Third Republic . Seeking to bring South Korea into the developed world , Park began a series of economic policies that brought rapid economic growth and industrialization to the nation that eventually became known as the Miracle on the Han River . South Korea became one of the fastest growing nations during the 60s and 70s as a result . Although popular during the 60s , by the 1970s , as growth began to slow , Park 's popularity started to wane , resulting in a close victory during the 1971 South Korean presidential election . Following this , in 1972 , Park declared martial law and amended the constitution into a highly authoritarian document called the Yushin Constitution . Formally , the pretense was that the Yushin Constitution was the seventh Constitutional amendment . In actuality , its effect was tantamount to abolition of the former Constitution - effectively creating a new one in an effort to legitimize the new Fourth Republic [ citation needed ] . During this time , political opposition and dissent was constantly repressed and Park had complete control of the media and military . Park survived several previous attempts to kill him , including two operations associated with North Korea [ citation needed ] . Following the student uprising later known as the Bu-Ma Democratic Protests , Park was assassinated on 26 October 1979 by his close friend Kim Jae-gyu , the director of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency , at a safe house in Seoul .",

The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo , which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time , ruling most of the Korean Peninsula , Manchuria , parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia under Gwanggaeto the Great . Its capital , Seoul , is a major global city and half of South Korea 's over 51 million people live in the Seoul Capital Area , the fourth largest metropolitan economy in the world . The Korean Peninsula was inhabited as early as the Lower Paleolithic period . Its first kingdom was noted in Chinese records in the early 7th century BC . Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea into Silla and Balhae in the late 7th century , Korea was ruled by the Goryeo dynasty ( 918-1392 ) and the Joseon dynasty ( 1392-1897 ) . The succeeding Korean Empire was annexed into the Empire of Japan in 1910 . After World War II , Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S.-administered zones , with the latter becoming the Republic of Korea in August 1948 . In 1950 , a North Korean invasion began the Korean War and after its end in 1953 , the country 's economy began to soar , recording the fastest rise in average GDP per capita in the world between 1980 and 1990 . Authoritarian rule ended in 1987 and the country is now the most advanced democracy with the highest level of press freedom in Asia .

A leading member of the New Society Movement , he ruled as a dictator under martial law from 1972 until 1981 . His regime was infamous for its corruption , extravagance , and brutality . Marcos claimed an active part in World War II , including fighting alongside the Americans in the Bataan Death March and being the most decorated war hero in the Philippines . A number of his claims were found to be false and United States Army documents described Marcos 's wartime claims as fraudulent and absurd . Marcos started as an attorney , then served in the Philippine House of Representatives from 1949 to 1959 and the Philippine Senate from 1959 to 1965 . He was elected President in 1965 , and presided over a growing economy during the beginning and intermediate portion of his 20-year rule , but ended in loss of livelihood , extreme poverty , and a crushing debt crisis . Marcos placed the Philippines under martial law on September 23 , 1972 , during which he revamped the constitution , silenced the media , and used violence and oppression against the political opposition , Muslims , communists , and ordinary citizens . Martial law was ratified by 90.77% of voters in the 1973 Philippine Martial Law referendum , though the referendum was marred with controversy . After being elected for a third term in the 1981 Philippine presidential election , Marcos 's popularity suffered greatly due to public outrage of the assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr. in 1983 . The assassination , along with economic collapse , revitalized the opposition , resulting in them securing a better-than-expected victory in the 1984 Philippine parliamentary election . Both of these factors alongside growing discontent and the discovery of documents exposing his finances and falsified war records , led him to call the snap election of 1986 .",

Pinochet assumed power in Chile following a United States-backed coup d'\u00e9tat on 11 September 1973 that overthrew the democratically elected socialist Unidad Popular government of President Salvador Allende and ended civilian rule . The support of the United States was crucial to the coup and the consolidation of power afterward . [ B ] Pinochet had been promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the Chilean Army by Allende on 23 August 1973 , having been its General Chief of Staff since early 1972 . In December 1974 , the ruling military junta appointed Pinochet Supreme Head of the nation by joint decree , although without the support of one of the coup 's instigators , Air Force General Gustavo Leigh . Following his rise to power , Pinochet persecuted leftists , socialists , and political critics , resulting in the executions of from 1,200 to 3,200 people , the internment of as many as 80,000 people and the torture of tens of thousands . According to the Chilean government , the number of executions and forced disappearances was 3,095 . Operation Condor was founded at the behest of the Pinochet regime in late November 1975 , his 60th birthday . Under the influence of the free market-oriented Chicago Boys , Pinochet 's military government implemented economic liberalization , including currency stabilization , removed tariff protections for local industry , banned trade unions and privatized social security and hundreds of state-owned enterprises . These policies produced high economic growth , but critics state that economic inequality dramatically increased and attribute the devastating effects of the 1982 monetary crisis on the Chilean economy to these policies . For most of the 1990s , Chile was the best-performing economy in Latin America , though the legacy of Pinochet 's reforms continues to be in dispute . His fortune grew considerably during his years in power through dozens of bank accounts secretly held abroad and a fortune in real estate .",

Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fern\u00e1ndez , Salas y G\u00f3mez , Desventuradas , and Easter Island in Oceania . Chile also claims about 1,250,000 square kilometres ( 480,000 sq mi ) of Antarctica under the Chilean Antarctic Territory . [ nb 3 ] , The arid Atacama Desert in northern Chile contains great mineral wealth , principally copper and lithium . The relatively small central area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources , and is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century when it incorporated its northern and southern regions . Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands , and features a string of volcanoes and lakes . The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords , inlets , canals , twisting peninsulas , and islands . Spain conquered and colonized the region in the mid-16th century , replacing Inca rule in the north and centre , but failing to conquer the independent Mapuche who inhabited what is now south-central Chile . After declaring its independence from Spain in 1818 , Chile emerged in the 1830s as a relatively stable authoritarian republic . In the 19th century , Chile saw significant economic and territorial growth , ending Mapuche resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in the War of the Pacific ( 1879-83 ) after defeating Peru and Bolivia . In the 1960s and 1970s , the country experienced severe left-right political polarization and turmoil ."
