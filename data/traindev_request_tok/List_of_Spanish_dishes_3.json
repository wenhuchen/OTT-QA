The names mean garlic and oil in Catalan and Proven\u00e7al . It is found in the cuisines of the Mediterranean coasts of Spain ( the Valencian Country , Catalonia , the Balearic Islands , Murcia and eastern Andalusia ) , France ( Provence ) and Italy ( Sicily and Calabria ) . Some versions of the sauce are closer to a garlic mayonnaise , incorporating egg yolks and lemon juice , whereas other versions are without egg yolk and have more garlic . This gives the sauce a pastier texture , while making it more laborious to make as the emulsion is harder to stabilize . There are many variations , such as adding lemon juice or other seasonings . In France it may include mustard . It is served at room temperature . Like mayonnaise , aioli is an emulsion or suspension of small globules of oil and oil-soluble compounds in water and water-soluble compounds . In Spain , purists believe that the absence of egg distinguishes aioli from mayonnaise , but that is not the case in France and other countries , where cooks may use egg or egg yolk as an emulsifier . Using only garlic as an emulsifier requires that the cook thoroughly crush it and add oil drop by drop so excess oil does not cut the aioli . Since the late 1980s , many people have called all flavored mayonnaises aioli .",
