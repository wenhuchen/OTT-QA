  "/wiki/City_of_license": "In American , Canadian and Philippine broadcasting , a city of license or community of license is the community that a radio station or television station is officially licensed to serve by that country 's broadcast regulator . In North American broadcast law , the concept of community of license dates to the early days of AM radio broadcasting . The requirement that a broadcasting station operate a main studio within a prescribed distance of the community which the station is licensed to serve appears in U.S. law as early as 1939 . Various specific obligations have been applied to broadcasters by governments to fulfill public policy objectives of broadcast localism , both in radio and later also in television , based on the legislative presumption that a broadcaster fills a similar role to that held by community newspaper publishers .",
  "/wiki/AM_broadcasting": "AM broadcasting is a radio broadcasting technology , which employs amplitude modulation ( AM ) transmissions . It was the first method developed for making audio radio transmissions , and is still used worldwide , primarily for medium wave ( also known as AM band ) transmissions , but also on the longwave and shortwave radio bands . The earliest experimental AM transmissions began in the early 1900s . However , widespread AM broadcasting was not established until the 1920s , following the development of vacuum tube receivers and transmitters . AM radio remained the dominant method of broadcasting for the next 30 years , a period called the Golden Age of Radio , until television broadcasting became widespread in the 1950s and received most of the programming previously carried by radio . Subsequently , AM radio 's audiences have also greatly shrunk due to competition from FM ( frequency modulation ) radio , Digital Audio Broadcasting ( DAB ) , satellite radio , HD ( digital ) radio and Internet streaming . AM transmissions are much more susceptible than FM or digital signals are to interference , and often have lower audio fidelity . Thus , AM broadcasters tend to specialise in spoken-word formats , such as talk radio , all news and sports , leaving the broadcasting of music mainly to FM and digital stations .",

All-news stations can run the gamut from simulcasting an all-news television station like CNN , to a rip and read headline service , to stations that include live coverage of news events and long-form public affairs programming . Many stations brand themselves Newsradio but only run news during the morning and afternoon drive times , or in some cases , broadcast talk radio shows with frequent news updates . These stations are properly labeled as news/talk stations . Also , some National Public Radio stations identify themselves as News and Information stations , which means that in addition to running the NPR news magazines such as Morning Edition and All Things Considered , they run other information and public affairs programs .",
  "/wiki/Talk_radio": "Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues and consisting entirely or almost entirely of original spoken word content rather than outside music . Most shows are regularly hosted by a single individual , and often feature interviews with a number of different guests . Talk radio typically includes an element of listener participation , usually by broadcasting live conversations between the host and listeners who call in ( usually via telephone ) to the show . Listener contributions are usually screened by a show 's producers in order to maximize audience interest and , in the case of commercial talk radio , to attract advertisers . Generally , the shows are organized into segments , each separated by a pause for advertisements ; however , in public or non-commercial radio , music is sometimes played in place of commercials to separate the program segments . Variations of talk radio include conservative talk , hot talk , liberal talk ( increasingly known as progressive talk ) and sports talk . While talk radio has historically been associated with broadcast radio , starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of live Internet website streaming and podcasts . Now , it is possible for an individual to use a variety of services to host an Internet-based talk-radio show without carriage by a traditional radio station . In addition , TV programming from talk and news outlets such as BBC , CNN , Bloomberg and Fox is now often available expanding the world of talk radio further . Talk radio listening is enjoyed not only on radios , but a wide variety of other devices and services including PCs using iTunes , station directories such as TuneIn , show directory smartphones with apps such as Stitcher and time-shifting services like DAR.fm .",

Programming may be exclusively by students , or may include programmers from the wider community in which the radio station is based . Sometimes campus radio stations are operated for the purpose of training professional radio personnel , sometimes with the aim of broadcasting educational programming , while other radio stations exist to provide alternative to commercial broadcasting or government broadcasters . Campus radio stations are generally licensed and regulated by national governments , and have very different characteristics from one country to the next . One commonality between many radio stations regardless of their physical location is a willingness - or , in some countries , even a licensing requirement - to broadcast musical selections that are not categorized as commercial hits . Because of this , campus radio has come to be associated with emerging musical trends , including genres such as punk and new wave , alternative rock , indie rock and hip hop , long before those genres become part of the musical mainstream . Campus radio stations also often provide airplay and promotional exposure to new and emerging local artists . Campus radio supported U2 and REM Many campus radio stations carry a variety of programming including news ( often local ) , sports ( often relating to the campus ) , and spoken word programming as well as general music . Often the radio format is best described as a freeform , with a lot of creativity and individualism among the disc jockeys and show hosts . A number of these radio stations have gained critical acclaim for their programming and are considered by the community in which they are embedded to be an essential media outlet . Although the term campus radio implies full-power AM or FM transmission over the air , many radio stations experiment with low-power broadcasting , closed circuit or carrier current systems , often to on-campus listeners only .

In the United States , public broadcasters may receive some funding from both federal and state sources , but generally most of their financial support comes from underwriting by foundations and businesses ( ranging from small shops to corporations ) , along with audience contributions via pledge drives . The great majority operate as private not-for-profit corporations . [ citation needed ] Public broadcasting may be nationally or locally operated , depending on the country and the station . In some countries a single organization runs public broadcasting . Other countries have multiple public-broadcasting organizations operating regionally or in different languages . Historically , public broadcasting was once the dominant or only form of broadcasting in many countries ( with the notable exception of the United States ) .

Freeform variety is associated with a wide range of programming including talk , sports , and music from a wide spectrum . This format is usually found on smaller , non-commercial public-broadcasting stations such as college radio , community radio or high school radio stations . If a variety formatted station has a program director , that person exerts little if any influence on the music or other programming choices beyond the normal regulatory control required by that country 's licensing regulations . Variety is also associated with full-service radio . This format is primarily found in the rural United States , on commercial AM stations , and on a few FM public radio stations ( usually those that play jazz ) . These stations tend to favor older listeners and play a mix of music that focuses more on older mainstream music , although much broader than the typical suburban oldies or classic hits station ; a full-service station will often play music from the adult standards , classic country , adult contemporary or ethnic formats as well . Full-service radio also regularly includes room for local news and talk . Hot Adult Contemporary and similarly formatted stations often brand with mix and variety to demonstrate the fact that they play music from several decades ( usually from the 1980s to the present ) . However , these stations have much more restrictive playlists than true variety stations such as those in the freeform and full-service categories . An example is WBNW-FM in Binghamton , New York or www.varietyradio.co.uk .

  "/wiki/Adult_contemporary_music": "In North American music , adult contemporary music ( AC ) is a form of radio-played popular music , ranging from 1960s vocal and 1970s soft rock music to predominantly ballad-heavy music of the present day , with varying degrees of easy listening , pop , soul , rhythm and blues , quiet storm , and rock influence . Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music . Adult contemporary tends to have lush , soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated . It is usually melodic enough to get a listener 's attention , and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music . Like most of pop music , its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse-chorus structure . The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments ( though bass guitar is usually used ) such as acoustic guitars , pianos , saxophones , and sometimes an orchestral set . The electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched . However , recent adult contemporary music may feature synthesizers ( and other electronics , such as drum machines ) . An AC radio station may play mainstream music , but it excludes hip hop , dance tracks , hard rock , and some forms of teen pop , as these are less popular among adults , the target demographic . AC radio often targets the 25-44 age group , the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s . A common practice in recent years of adult contemporary stations is to play less newer music and more hits of the past . This de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart .",

There are several subcategories , dominantly focusing on rock , pop , or urban music . Used alone , CHR most often refers to the CHR-pop format . The term contemporary hit radio was coined in the early 1980s by Radio & Records magazine to designate top 40 stations which continued to play hits from all musical genres as pop music splintered into adult contemporary , urban contemporary and other formats . The term top 40 is also used to refer to the actual list of hit songs , and , by extension , to refer to pop music in general . The term has also been modified to describe top 50 ; top 30 ; top 20 ; top 10 ; hot 100 ( each with its number of songs ) and hot hits radio formats , but carrying more or less the same meaning and having the same creative point of origin with Todd Storz as further refined by Gordon McLendon as well as Bill Drake .

  "/wiki/Adult_standards": "Adult standards is a North American radio format heard primarily on AM or class A FM stations . Adult standards ( also sometimes known as the nostalgia format ) is aimed at mature adults , meaning mainly those persons over 50 years of age , but it is mostly targeted for senior citizens . It is primarily on AM because market research reveals that only persons in that age group listen to music on AM in sizable numbers . Adult standards first became a popular format in the late 1970s and early 1980s as a way to reach mature adults who came of age before the rock era but were perhaps too mature for adult contemporary radio or too young for beautiful music or MOR stations . A typical adult standards playlist includes traditional pop music by artists such as Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett , some easy listening numbers from Roger Whittaker and others , and softer tunes from the oldies and adult contemporary formats ; as originally conceived , the format also features big band music , particularly from the 1940s and 1950s , though most modern stations eschew that genre . Younger artists who record in the big-band era style , such as Harry Connick , Jr. , or Diana Krall , may be played as well . The term standards in the format 's title is a reference to the standard , a song that is covered extensively by many artists over a prolonged period of time ; adult standards may play true standards but are not limited to them . At one time there were several hundred such stations , a number that has declined to approximately 200 as of 2012 . Because the adult standards audience has increased in age to the point where many of its listeners have either died or are no longer attractive to advertisers , the format as it is known today ( much like the contemporary decline of oldies and smooth jazz formats , along with the earlier demise of easy listening ) is likely to die out .

Music that was popularized by MTV in the early 1980s and the nostalgia behind it is a major driver to the format . It is considered the successor to the oldies format , a collection of top 40 songs from the late 1950s through the late 1970s that was once extremely popular in the United States . The term is sometimes incorrectly used as a synonym for the adult hits format , which uses a slightly newer music library stretching from all decades to the present with a major focus on 1990s and 2000s rock and alternative songs . In addition , adult hits stations tend to have larger playlists , playing a given song only a few times per week , compared to the tighter libraries on classic hits stations . For example , KRTH , a classic hits station in Los Angeles , plays power songs up to 30 times a week , which is another differentiator compared to other formats that share songs with classic hits libraries . The classic hits format has become extremely popular in the last few years with stations like KRTH , WCBS-FM in New York , and WLS-FM in Chicago having successful ratings with this model . Classic hits was named format of the summer of 2018 by Nielsen Audio 's research team emphasizing the huge popularity of the format .

However , the station later changed from 99.5 to 106.7 FM in 2005 , due to interference from WDCX-FM in Buffalo . Larche Communications later also launched CICZ-FM in Midland and CICS-FM in Sudbury . On June 4 , 2007 , Larche announced a deal to sell CIKZ to Rogers in exchange for CICX-FM in Orillia . The deal , which was approved by the CRTC on December 24 , 2007 , placed CIKZ in a cluster with Rogers ' existing CKGL and CHYM-FM in Kitchener . On January 28 , 2008 , the station modified its on-air identity to reflect the new ownership . This included some of the on-air personalities and its web site , as well as the adjustment of its branding and logo from KICX ( the spelling used by Larche ) to KIX .

  "/wiki/Country_music": "Country music , also known as country and western ( or simply country ) , and hillbilly music , is a genre of popular music that takes its roots from genres such as American folk music ( especially Appalachian and Western music ) and blues . Its popularized roots originate in the Southern United States of the early 1920s . Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms , folk lyrics , and harmonies mostly accompanied by string instruments such as banjos , electric and acoustic guitars , steel guitars ( such as pedal steels and dobros ) , and fiddles as well as harmonicas . Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history . According to Lindsey Starnes , the term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music ; it came to encompass Western music , which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots , in the mid-20th century . In 2009 in the United States , country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute , and second most popular in the morning commute . The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres . The origins of country music are found in the folk music of working class Americans and/or blue-collar American life , who blended popular songs , Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes , traditional English ballads , cowboy songs , and the musical traditions of various groups of European immigrants .",
