The city proper covers 49 square miles ( 127 km2 ) with an estimated population of 694,583 in 2018 , also making it the most populous city in New England . Boston is the seat of Suffolk County as well , although the county government was disbanded on July 1 , 1999 . The city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area known as Greater Boston , a metropolitan statistical area ( MSA ) home to a census-estimated 4.8 million people in 2016 and ranking as the tenth-largest such area in the country . As a combined statistical area ( CSA ) , this wider commuting region is home to some 8.2 million people , making it the sixth most populous in the United States . Boston is one of the oldest municipalities in the United States , founded on the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630 by Puritan settlers from the English town of the same name . It was the scene of several key events of the American Revolution , such as the Boston Massacre , the Boston Tea Party , the Battle of Bunker Hill , and the Siege of Boston . Upon gaining U.S. independence from Great Britain , it continued to be an important port and manufacturing hub as well as a center for education and culture . The city has expanded beyond the original peninsula through land reclamation and municipal annexation . Its rich history attracts many tourists , with Faneuil Hall alone drawing more than 20 million visitors per year . Boston 's many firsts include the United States ' first public park ( Boston Common , 1634 ) , first public or state school ( Boston Latin School , 1635 ) and first subway system ( Tremont Street Subway , 1897 ) .

It runs from Bowdoin station in downtown Boston under Boston Harbor to East Boston and Revere on the inner North Shore , where it terminates at Wonderland . The stop at Airport Station , by way of a free shuttle bus , is one of two rapid transit connections to Logan International Airport . In 1967 , during a systemwide rebranding , the line was assigned the blue color because it passes under the Boston Harbor . With an end-to-end travel time of less than twenty minutes , the Blue Line is the shortest of Boston 's heavy-rail lines and the only line to have both third rail and overhead catenary sections . The East Boston Tunnel was built as a streetcar tunnel in 1904 with Howard A. Carson as chief engineer ; after an extension to Bowdoin in 1916 , it was converted to heavy rail metro rolling stock in 1924 . In 1952 and 1954 the line was extended along the former route of the Boston , Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad , in a project intended to reach Lynn but ultimately cut short to Wonderland . Further extensions to Lynn and Charles/MGH downtown are long-planned but not yet funded . From approximately 1998-2011 , the MBTA made most Blue Line stations fully accessible as part of a larger effort to accommodate 6-car trains on the line .

  "/wiki/Dorchester,_Boston": "Dorchester ( colloquially referred to as Dot ) is a Boston neighborhood comprising more than 6 square miles ( 16 km2 ) in the City of Boston , Massachusetts , United States . Originally , Dorchester was a separate town , founded by Puritans who emigrated in 1630 from Dorchester , Dorset , England to the Massachusetts Bay Colony . This dissolved municipality , Boston 's largest neighborhood by far , is often divided by city planners in order to create two planning areas roughly equivalent in size and population to other Boston neighborhoods . The neighborhood is named after the town of Dorchester in the English county of Dorset , from which Puritans emigrated on the ship Mary and John , among others . Founded in 1630 , just a few months before the founding of the city of Boston , Dorchester now covers a geographic area approximately equivalent to nearby Cambridge . It was still a primarily rural town and had a population of 12,000 when it was annexed to Boston in 1870 . Railroad and streetcar lines brought rapid growth , increasing the population to 150,000 by 1920 . In the 2010 United States Census , the neighborhood 's population was 92,115 . The Dorchester neighborhood has a very diverse population , which includes a large concentration of African Americans , European Americans ( particularly those of Irish , German , and Polish origin ) , Caribbean Americans , Latinos , and East and Southeast Asian Americans . Dorchester also has a significant LGBT population , with active political groups and the largest concentration of same-sex couples in Boston after the South End and Jamaica Plain .

  "/wiki/111_(MBTA_bus)": "Key bus routes of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority ( MBTA ) system are 15 routes that have high ridership and higher frequency standards than other bus lines , according to the 2004 MBTA Service Policy . Together , they account for roughly 40% of the MBTA 's total bus ridership . These key bus routes ensure basic geographic coverage with frequent service in the densest areas of Boston , and connect to other MBTA services to give access to other areas throughout the region . In recognition of their function as part of the backbone MBTA service , the key bus routes have been added to newer basic route maps installed in subway stations and other public locations . These schematic route maps show the rail rapid transit routes , bus rapid transit routes , commuter rail services , and key bus routes . The key routes have been treated as a distinct category for the purpose of service improvement , such as trial runs of late-night service , and due to the high volume of passenger traffic they carry , both individual routes and the category as a whole have been the subjects of urban planning and transportation engineering studies .",

  "/wiki/CT2_(MBTA_bus)": "The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority operates two specially designated crosstown bus routes in the Boston , Massachusetts , United States area , called CT2 and CT3 , and intended as limited-stop buses connecting major points . These crosstown buses are designated differently from older de facto crosstown routes , such as the # 1 ( Harvard/Holyoke Gate - Dudley Station via Massachusetts Avenue ) and the # 66 ( Harvard Square - Dudley Station via Allston & Brookline Village ) . The bus services are very similar in equipment and fare structure , except that the CT routes have more-limited stops . Both types of routes suffer from frequent delays , unreliable service , and bus bunching caused by congestion in heavy mixed traffic . The CT crosstown buses were envisioned as a first phase in a gradual improvement of circumferential service connecting the radial spokes of the Metro Boston rapid transit system , planned to culminate in the Urban Ring . The CT routes run weekdays only ; all buses in this service have bicycle racks and are based out of the Albany Street garage . The routes were first introduced in September 1994 and have been modified since . A third route , the CT1 , was merged with route 1 in 2019 . With the suspension of the Urban Ring Project ( due to lack of funding ) , the crosstown bus routes remain as an interim service to meet demand for circumferential routes that bypass the crowded subway stations in the hub of downtown Boston .",
