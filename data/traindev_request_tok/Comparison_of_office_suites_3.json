  "/wiki/HTML_editor": "A HTML editor is a program for editing HTML , the markup of a web page . Although the HTML markup in a web page can be controlled with any text editor , specialized HTML editors can offer convenience and added functionality . For example , many HTML editors handle not only HTML , but also related technologies such as CSS , XML and JavaScript or ECMAScript . In some cases they also manage communication with remote web servers via FTP and WebDAV , and version control systems such as Subversion or Git . Many word processing , graphic design and page layout programs that are not dedicated to web design , such as Microsoft Word or Quark XPress , also have the ability to function as HTML editors .",
  "/wiki/Collaborative_software": "Collaborative software or groupware is application software designed to help people working on a common task to attain their goals . One of the earliest definitions of groupware is intentional group processes plus software to support them . As regards available interaction , collaborative software may be divided into : real-time collaborative editing platforms that allow multiple users to engage in live , simultaneous and reversible editing of a single file ( usually a document ) , and version control ( also known as revision control and source control ) platforms , which allow separate users to make parallel edits to a file , while preserving every saved edit by every user as multiple files ( that are variants of the original file ) . [ citation needed ] Collaborative software is a broad concept that overlaps considerably with computer-supported cooperative work ( CSCW ) . According to Carstensen and Schmidt ( 1999 ) groupware is part of CSCW . The authors claim that CSCW , and thereby groupware , addresses how collaborative activities and their coordination can be supported by means of computer systems . The use of collaborative software in the work space creates a collaborative working environment ( CWE ) . Finally , collaborative software relates to the notion of collaborative work systems , which are conceived as any form of human organization that emerges any time that collaboration takes place , whether it is formal or informal , intentional or unintentional . Whereas the groupware or collaborative software pertains to the technological elements of computer-supported cooperative work , collaborative work systems become a useful analytical tool to understand the behavioral and organizational variables that are associated to the broader concept of CSCW .",

Gobe Productive v1.0 for BeOS was released in August 1998 and v2.0 in August 1999 . The resulting product , Gobe Productive , was by far the most polished of the word processors , spreadsheet and vector graphics applications for BeOS , but as an integrated package a la ClarisWorks and Microsoft Works . When Be Inc. outsourced publication of BeOS in 2000 , Gobe became the publisher of BeOS in North America , Australia , and sections of Asia . Only weeks after signing up other publishers around the globe , Be , Inc. halted development for the BeOS platform and publicly announced that all of its corporate focus would be on Internet Appliances and made public announcements that hampered forward momentum of the BeOS platform . In addition , the publishers in general and Gobe in particular did not have source code access to the BeOS and were not able to continue its development or add drivers that the platform needed to be a viable alternative to Windows or Linux . Gobe also published Hicom Entertainment/Next Generation Entertainments Corum III role-playing game for BeOS during this period . The failure of Be , Inc and BeOS meant ports had to be undertaken , and Windows and Linux variants were developed .
