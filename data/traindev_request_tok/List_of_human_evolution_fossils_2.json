In common with the older Australopithecus afarensis , A. africanus was of slender build , or gracile , and was thought to have been a direct ancestor of modern humans . Fossil remains indicate that A. africanus was significantly more like modern humans than A. afarensis , with a more human-like cranium permitting a larger brain and more humanoid facial features . A. africanus has been found only in southern Africa at four sites : Taung ( 1924 ) , Sterkfontein ( 1935 ) , Makapansgat ( 1948 ) and Gladysvale ( 1992 ) . In January 2019 , scientists reported that Australopithecus sediba is distinct from , but shares anatomical similarities to , both the older Australopithecus africanus , and the younger Homo habilis .",

South Africa is the largest country in Southern Africa and the 24th-largest country in the world by land area and , with over 58 million people , is also the world 's 24th-most populous nation . It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere . About 80 percent of South Africans are of Bantu ancestry , divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different African languages , nine of which have official status . The remaining population consists of Africa 's largest communities of European , Asian ( Indian ) , and multiracial ( Coloured ) ancestry . South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures , languages , and religions . Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution 's recognition of 11 official languages , which is the fourth-highest number in the world . Two of these languages are of European origin : Afrikaans developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most coloured and white South Africans ; English reflects the legacy of British colonialism , and is commonly used in public and commercial life , though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language . The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'\u00e9tat , and regular elections have been held for almost a century . However , the vast majority of black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994 . During the 20th century , the black majority sought to claim more rights from the dominant white minority , with this struggle playing a large role in the country 's recent history and politics .",

Kenya is bordered by South Sudan to the northwest , Ethiopia to the north , Somalia to the east , Uganda to the west , Tanzania to the south , and the Indian Ocean to the southeast . According to archaeological dating of associated artifacts and skeletal material , the Cushites first settled in the lowlands of Kenya between 3,200 and 1,300 BC , a phase referred to as the Lowland Savanna Pastoral Neolithic . Nilotic-speaking pastoralists ( ancestral to Kenya 's Nilotic speakers ) started migrating from present-day southern Sudan into Kenya around 500 BC . European colonisation of Kenya began in the 19th century during the European exploration of the interior . Modern-day Kenya emerged from a protectorate established by the British Empire in 1895 and the subsequent Kenya Colony , which began in 1920 .

With over 109 million inhabitants , Ethiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world and the second-most populous nation on the African continent with a total area of 1,100,000 square kilometres ( 420,000 sq mi ) . Its capital and largest city is Addis Ababa , which lies a few miles west of the East African Rift that splits the country into the Nubian and Somali tectonic plates . Some of the oldest skeletal evidence for anatomically modern humans has been found in Ethiopia . It is widely considered as the region from which modern humans first set out for the Middle East and places beyond . According to linguists , the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations settled in the Horn region during the ensuing Neolithic era . Tracing its roots to the 2nd millennium BCE , Ethiopia 's governmental system was a monarchy for most of its history . Oral literature tells that the monarchy was founded by the Solomonic dynasty of the Queen of Sheba , under its first king , Menelik I . In the first centuries , the Kingdom of Aksum maintained a unified civilization in the region , followed by the Ethiopian Empire circa 1137 . During the late 19th-century Scramble for Africa , Ethiopia and Liberia were two nations that preserved their sovereignty from long-term colonisation by a European colonial power and many newly-independent nations on the continent subsequently adopted its flag colours . However , the country was later occupied by Italy in 1936 and became Italian Ethiopia ( part of Italian East Africa ) until it was liberated during World War II .",

The skull was found crushed almost flat and was therefore named after the famously skinny model of the time Twiggy . Estimated at about 1.8 mya ( million years old ) , the cranium was found crushed flat and cemented together with a mass coating of limestone . Originally , there was very little interest placed on the discovery of the skull , but after much effort by scientist Ron Clarke , the skull was finally reconstructed and examined thoroughly . Despite this effort , there still is a good deal of distortion from the fossilization processes that took place . The small cranial capacity estimated at about 590-600 cc ( cubic centimeters ) is in part attributed to this cranial distortion . OH 24 's face is described as being prognathic ( projecting forward under the nose ) , as in other fossils from the Homo habilis family , but not quite to the extent of earlier Australopithecus species . Besides manifesting lesser prognathism than the australopithecines , OH 24 also portrays a larger cranial vault , indicating an expansion in brain size from its ancestor , and the reduction of facial prognathisim typical of the evolution of early Homo . The individual 's third molars had erupted , which indicates that OH 24- Twiggy was an adult at death . Yet , these molars show no sign of wear ( the points on the crowns of the teeth are still sharp , and show little sign of abrasion by rough food matter ) , indicating that this individual died soon after the eruption of these molars .

A side gorge , originating from Lemagrut Mountain , joins the main gorge 8 km from the mouth . This side gorge follows the shoreline of a prehistoric lake , rich in fossils and early man sites . Periodic flows of volcanic ash from Olmoti and Kerimasi helped to ensure preservation of the fossils in the gorge . The site is significant in showing the increasing developmental and social complexities in the earliest humans , or hominins , largely revealed in the production and use of stone tools . Prior to tools , evidence of scavenging and hunting can be noted - highlighted by the presence of gnaw marks that predate cut marks - and of the ratio of meat versus plant material in the early hominin diet . The collecting of tools and animal remains in a centralized area is evidence of developing social interaction and communal activity . All these factors indicate an increase in cognitive capacities at the beginning of the period of hominids transitioning to hominin - that is , to human - form and behavior . Homo habilis , probably the first early human species , occupied Olduvai Gorge approximately 1.9 million years ago ( mya ) ; then came a contemporary australopithecine , Paranthropus boisei , 1.8 mya , followed by Homo erectus , 1.2 mya .",

  "/wiki/Homo_erectus": "Homo erectus ( meaning 'upright man ' ) were a species of archaic humans from the Pleistocene , earliest occurrence about 2 mya . They are proposed to be the direct ancestors to several human species , such as H. heidelbergensis , H. antecessor , Neanderthals , Denisovans , and modern humans . As a chronospecies , the time of its disappearance is thus a matter of contention or even convention . There are also several proposed subspecies with varying levels of recognition . H. erectus appear to have been much more similar to modern humans than to their ancestors , the australopithecines , with a more humanlike gait , body proportions , height , and brain capacity . H. erectus are associated with the Acheulean stone tool industry , and is thought to be the earliest human ancestor capable of starting fires , speech , hunting and gathering in coordinated groups , caring for injured or sick group members , and possibly art-making .",

( 2002 ) , Corresponding Member of the Georgian National Academy of Sciences ( 2009 ) , since 2004 General Director of the Georgian National Museum ( GNM ) . He is a son of the archaeologist Otar Lordkipanidze . David Lordkipanidze is best known for his discovery of the hominin fossil , first named Homo georgicus , but later reclassified as Homo erectus . Conducting excavation at Dmanisi in Georgia , he found skulls of an early hominin thought to be a precursor of Homo erectus . Subsequently , four fossil skeletons were found , showing a species still with primitive features in its skull and upper body but with relatively advanced spines and lower limbs , providing greater mobility . They represent a stage soon after the transition from Homo habilis to Homo erectus , and have been dated at 1.8 million years before the present . Lordkipanidze has received many awards , including the Georgia 's Order of Honour ( 2000 ) , Award of the Prince of Monaco ( 2001 ) , the French Order of Palmes Academiques ( 2002 ) , the Rolex Award for Enterprise ( 2004 ) , the French Order of Honour ( 2006 ) and the Goethe Medal ( 2016 ) .

  "/wiki/Dmanisi_skull_4": "The Dmanisi skulls are a set of hominin fossils ( five crania and four mandibles ) from the archaeological site near Dmanisi , Georgia . They were discovered in excavations at the site between 1991 and 2005 . Dated to approximately 1.85-1.75 Ma , these fossils may morphologically represent the populations of hominins that initially emigrated out of Africa . Their small brain size , primitive skeletal architecture , and range of variation has been a point of debate for their taxonomic status . The fossil hominins have been described as exhibiting similarity to Homo ergaster , Homo georgicus , and are classified as either Homo georgicus , or as a subspecies of Homo erectus , Homo erectus georgicus . The large range of variation between the five individuals is striking due to their geographical and temporal proximity with one another . The large degree of variation present in these specimens calls into question whether or not the morphological differences between H. erectus , H. ergaster , and H. rudolfensis are due to in-species variation as well . Regardless of their taxonomic position , the spatio-temporal proximity of these five individuals provide evidence for large variation in morphology within early Homo populations .",

Described in a publication in October 2013 , it is estimated to be about 1.8 million years old and is the most complete skull of a Pleistocene Homo species , and the first complete adult hominin skull of that degree of antiquity . According to researchers , the discovery provides the first evidence that early Homo comprised adult individuals with small brains but body mass , stature and limb proportions reaching the lower range limit of modern variation . The skull has been the cause of a paleontological controversy that is still ongoing as of 2017 : many hominin fossils thought to be from different species such as Homo rudolfensis or Homo habilis may not have been separate species at all . Rather , they may have been a single evolving lineage .",

  "/wiki/OH_7": "OH 7 ( Olduvai Hominid \u2116 7 ) , also nicknamed Johnny 's Child , is the type specimen of Homo habilis . The fossils were discovered on November 4 , 1960 in Olduvai Gorge , Tanzania , by Jonathan and Mary Leakey . The remains are dated to approximately 1.75 million years , and consist of fragmented parts of a lower mandible ( which still holds thirteen teeth , as well as unerupted wisdom teeth ) , an isolated maxillary molar , two parietal bones , and twenty-one finger , hand , and wrist bones . The OH 7 hand is wide , with a large thumb and broad fingertips , similar to that of humans ; however , unlike in humans the fingers are relatively long and exhibit chimpanzee-like curvature . Furthermore , the thumb 's orientation relative to the other fingers resembles the anatomy of great apes . The parietal bones - a nearly complete left parietal and fragmented right parietal - were used to deduce the cranial capacity of the hominid , which was placed at 663 cc in account of the fact that the fossils belonged to a 12- or 13-year-old male . This was extrapolated by Phillip Tobias to 674 cc for the hominid 's full adult potential . However , other scientists have estimated the cranial capacity at 590 cc to 710 cc . Louis Leakey , John Napier , and Phillip Tobias were among the first to extensively study the fossils . The Leakey team and others argued that , due expanded cranial capacity , gnathic reduction , relatively small post-canine teeth ( compared to Paranthropus boisei ) , Homo-like pattern of craniofacial development , and a precision grip in the hand fragments ( which indicated the ability for tool use ) , set OH 7 apart as a transitional species between Australopithecus africanus and Homo erectus . The Leakey team announced the new species Homo habilis in the April 1964 issue of Nature , igniting debate among the anthropology community which lasted through the 1970s . As early as May 1964 , Kenneth Oakley and Bernard Campbell had raised concerns about the Leakey team 's findings with their own publication in Nature , and in July of that same year Sir Wilfrid Le Gros Clark bluntly stated his hope that H. habilis will disappear as rapidly as he came .",
