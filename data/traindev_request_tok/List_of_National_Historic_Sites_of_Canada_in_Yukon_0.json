  "/wiki/Klondike_Gold_Rush": "The Klondike Gold Rush [ n 1 ] was a migration by an estimated 100,000 prospectors to the Klondike region of the Yukon , in north-western Canada , between 1896 and 1899 . Gold was discovered there by local miners on August 16 , 1896 , and , when news reached Seattle and San Francisco the following year , it triggered a stampede of prospectors . Some became wealthy , but the majority went in vain . It has been immortalized in artifacts , films , games , literature , and photographs . To reach the gold fields , most prospectors took the route through the ports of Dyea and Skagway , in Southeast Alaska . Here , the Klondikers could follow either the Chilkoot or the White Pass trails to the Yukon River , and sail down to the Klondike . The Canadian authorities required each of them to bring a year 's supply of food , in order to prevent starvation . In all , the Klondikers ' equipment weighed close to a ton , which most carried themselves , in stages . Performing this task , and contending with the mountainous terrain and cold climate , meant those who persisted did not arrive until summer 1898 . Once there , they found few opportunities , and many left disappointed . Mining was challenging , as the ore was distributed unevenly , and permafrost made digging slow . Consequently , some miners chose to buy and sell claims , build up huge investments , and let others do the work .",

  "/wiki/Bonanza_Creek": "Bonanza Creek is a watercourse in Yukon Territory , Canada . It runs for about 20 miles ( 32 km ) from King Solomon 's Dome to the Klondike River . In the last years of the 19th century and the early 20th century , Bonanza Creek was the centre of the Klondike Gold Rush , which attracted tens of thousands of prospectors to the creek and the area surrounding it . Prior to 1896 the creek was known as Rabbit Creek . Its name was changed by miners in honour of the millions of dollars in gold found in and around the creek . During gold-mining operations , the course of the creek changed drastically . It was heavily developed during the early 20th century , but was largely abandoned by the 1950s . A handful of small gold-mining operations continue on the creek , but today it is best known for its historic value . Two National Historic Sites of Canada have been designated along the creek :",

With its 72 large buckets , the dredge excavated gravel at the rate of 22 buckets per minute , processing 18,000 cubic yards ( 14,000 m3 ) of material per day . It was in use from late April or early May until late November each season , and sometimes throughout winter . During its operational lifetime , it captured nine tons of gold .",
  "/wiki/Gold_dredge": "A gold dredge is a placer mining machine that extracts gold from sand , gravel , and dirt using water and mechanical methods . The original gold dredges were large , multi-story machines built in the first half of the 1900s . Small suction machines are currently marketed as gold dredges to individuals seeking gold : just offshore from the beach of Nome , Alaska , for instance . A large gold dredge uses a mechanical method to excavate material ( sand , gravel , dirt , etc . ) using steel buckets on a circular , continuous bucketline at the front end of the dredge . The material is then sorted/sifted using water . On large gold dredges , the buckets dump the material into a steel rotating cylinder ( a specific type of trommel called the screen ) that is sloped downward toward a rubber belt ( the stacker ) that carries away oversize material ( rocks ) and dumps the rocks behind the dredge . The cylinder has many holes in it to allow undersized material ( including gold ) to fall into a sluice box . The material that is washed or sorted away is called tailings . The rocks deposited behind the dredge ( by the stacker ) are called tailing piles . The holes in the screen were intended to screen out rocks ( e.g. , 3/4 inch holes in the screen sent anything larger than 3/4 inch to the stacker ) .",
  "/wiki/Placer_mining": "Placer mining /\u02c8pl\u00e6s\u0259r/ is the mining of stream bed ( alluvial ) deposits for minerals . This may be done by open-pit ( also called open-cast mining ) or by various surface excavating equipment or tunnelling equipment . Placer mining is frequently used for precious metal deposits ( particularly gold ) and gemstones , both of which are often found in alluvial deposits - deposits of sand and gravel in modern or ancient stream beds , or occasionally glacial deposits . The metal or gemstones , having been moved by stream flow from an original source such as a vein , are typically only a minuscule portion of the total deposit . Since gems and heavy metals like gold are considerably denser than sand , they tend to accumulate at the base of placer deposits . Placer deposits can be as young as a few years old , such as the Canadian Queen Charlotte beach gold placer deposits , or billions of years old like the Elliott Lake uranium paleoplacer within the Huronian Supergroup in Canada . The containing material in an alluvial placer mine may be too loose to safely mine by tunnelling , though it is possible where the ground is permanently frozen . Where water under pressure is available , it may be used to mine , move , and separate the precious material from the deposit , a method known as hydraulic mining , hydraulic sluicing or hydraulicking .",
  "/wiki/Klondike,_Yukon": "The Klondike ( /\u02c8kl\u0252nda\u026ak/ ) is a region of the Yukon territory in northwest Canada , east of the Alaskan border . It lies around the Klondike River , a small river that enters the Yukon River from the east at Dawson City . The Klondike is famed due to the Klondike Gold Rush , which started in 1897 and lasted until 1899 . Gold has been mined continuously in that area except for a hiatus in the late 1960s and early 1970s . The name Klondike evolved from the H\u00e4n word Tr'ond\u00ebk , which means hammerstone water . Early gold seekers found it difficult to pronounce the First Nations word , so Klondike was the result of this poor pronunciation .",
  "/wiki/S.S._Keno": "The SS Keno is a preserved historic sternwheel paddle steamer and National Historic Site of Canada . The SS Keno is berthed in a dry dock on the waterfront of the Yukon River in Dawson City , Yukon , Canada . The vessel was constructed in 1922 , in Whitehorse , by the British Yukon Navigation Company , a subsidiary of the White Pass and Yukon Route railway company . For most of its career it transported silver , zinc and lead ore down the Stewart River from mines in the Mayo district to the confluence of the Yukon and Stewart rivers at Stewart City . It was retired from commercial service in 1951 due to the extension and improvement of the Klondike Highway in the years after World War II . Following its withdrawal from service the SS Keno was laid up at the BYN Co. shipyard in Whitehorse , before being selected for preservation and donated by the company to the Canadian Government in 1959 . On 25 August 1960 the Keno left Whitehorse to sail downstream to Dawson City . In doing so she became the last of the Yukon 's sternwheeler steamers to navigate the Yukon River under her own power . Three days later she arrived in Dawson and was subsequently installed as a tourist attraction and a permanent memorial to the approximately 250 sternwheelers that provided a vital transport service on the Yukon River and its tributaries during the latter half of the 19th and first half of the 20th centuries .",

  "/wiki/S.S._Klondike": "SS Klondike was the name of two sternwheelers , the second now a national historic site located in Whitehorse , Yukon , Canada . They ran freight between Whitehorse and Dawson City along the Yukon River , the first from 1929-1936 and the second , an almost exact replica of the first , from 1937-1950 . Klondike I was built by the British Yukon Navigation Company ( a subsidiary of the White Pass and Yukon Route railway company ) in 1929 and had the distinction of having 50% more capacity than a regular sternwheeler , while still having the shallow draft and meeting the size requirements in order to travel down the Yukon River . Klondike I had a cargo capacity of 270 metric tonnes without having to push a barge . Klondike I ran aground in June 1936 north of 'The Thirty Mile ' section of the Yukon River ( at 61\u00b040\u203217\u2033N 134\u00b052\u203222\u2033W / 61.67139\u00b0N 134.87278\u00b0W / 61.67139 ; -134.87278 ( The Thirty Mile ) ) . The company salvaged the ship 's boiler , engines and many fittings to build Klondike II the following year . The hull of the SS Klondike I can still be seen at low water by canoeists on the Yukon River . Klondike II carried freight until the early 1950s . Due to the construction of a highway connecting Dawson City and Whitehorse , many Yukon River sternwheelers were decommissioned . In an attempt to save Klondike II , she was converted into a cruise ship . The venture shut down in 1955 due to lack of interest , and Klondike II was left on the ways in the Whitehorse shipyards . The ship was donated to Parks Canada and was gradually restored until 1966 , when city authorities agreed to move the ship to its present location , at that time part of a squatters ' area .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture_in_Canada": "Gothic Revival architecture in Canada is an historically influential style , with many prominent examples . The Gothic Revival was imported to Canada from Britain and the United States in the early 19th century , and rose to become the most popular style for major projects throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries . The Gothic Revival period lasted longer and was more thoroughly embraced in Canada than in either Britain or the United States , only falling out of style in the 1930s . The late 19th and early 20th centuries was also the period when many major Canadian institutions were founded . Throughout Canada many of the most prominent religious , civic , and scholastic institutions are housed in Gothic Revival style buildings . In the 1960s and 1970s several scholars , most notably Alan Gowans , embraced Canadian Gothic Revival architecture as one of the nation 's signature styles and as an integral part of Canadian nationalism . While largely abandoned in the modernist period , several postmodern architects have embraced Canada 's neo-Gothic past .",
  "/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_movement": "The Arts and Crafts movement was an international trend in the decorative and fine arts that began in Britain and flourished in Europe and North America between about 1880 and 1920 , emerging in Japan in the 1920s as the Mingei movement . It stood for traditional craftsmanship using simple forms , and often used medieval , romantic , or folk styles of decoration . It advocated economic and social reform and was essentially anti-industrial . It had a strong influence on the arts in Europe until it was displaced by Modernism in the 1930s , and its influence continued among craft makers , designers , and town planners long afterwards . The term was first used by T. J. Cobden-Sanderson at a meeting of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1887 , although the principles and style on which it was based had been developing in England for at least 20 years . It was inspired by the ideas of architect Augustus Pugin , writer John Ruskin , and designer William Morris . The movement developed earliest and most fully in the British Isles and spread across the British Empire and to the rest of Europe and America . It was largely a reaction against the perceived impoverishment of the decorative arts at the time and the conditions in which they were produced .",

In the late 19th century Tr'och\u00ebk was the camp of Chief Isaac , the leader of the Tr'ondek Hwech'in during the Klondike Gold Rush . The Tr'ondek people used this site primarily in the summer , hunting moose in the flats across the Klondike and fishing for salmon during their migration up the Yukon . Tr'ochek lies on the upstream flat , an alluvial deposition of the Klondike River , at the river confluence . Dawson City is directly north of the site , just across the Klondike . The river flat has a mixture of poplar trees , alder and willow bushes , with open grassy meadows . The steep hillside behind the site is covered with vegetation typical of a northern exposure boreal forest - thick moss , spruce , and small birch groves . On the bench above the flat , mining activity has stripped away both vegetation and soil , leaving a fringe of the original spruce forest along the edge of the river bluffs . The gold rush was a period of great disruption for the Tr'ondek Hwech'in . Thousands of stampeders overwhelmed them at their summer camp .
