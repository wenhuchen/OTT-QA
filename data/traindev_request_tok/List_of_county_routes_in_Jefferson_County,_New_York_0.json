  "/wiki/NY_26": "New York State Route 26 ( NY 26 ) is a north-south state highway that runs for 203.80 miles ( 327.98 km ) through Central New York in the United States . Its southern terminus is located at the Pennsylvania state line south of the town of Vestal in Broome County , where it becomes Pennsylvania Route 267 ( PA 267 ) . Its northern terminus is located at a junction with NY 12 in the village of Alexandria Bay in Jefferson County . NY 26 serves three cities along its routing ; one directly ( Rome ) and two via other roadways ( Binghamton via NY 17 and Watertown via NY 3 ) . NY 26 , as a single route , was established in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York ; however , portions of the route had been signed state routes since the 1920s . Since 1930 , the route has been realigned several times in the North Country , resulting in a modern routing significantly different from its initial alignment . For a brief period during the 1970s , NY 26 ended in Carthage . The truncation directly led to the elimination of one of NY 26 's two spur routes , and the second was absorbed by other routes shortly afterward .",

  "/wiki/US_11_(NY)": "U.S. Route 11 ( US 11 ) is a part of the U.S. Highway System that runs from New Orleans , Louisiana , to the Canada-US border at Rouses Point , New York .

The portion of US 11 south of Watertown follows a mostly north-south alignment and is paralleled by Interstate 81 ( I-81 ) while the part of the route north of Watertown follows a more east-west routing , parallel to but not directly on the St. Lawrence River . The portion of US 11 in New York passes through the central district of four cities : Binghamton , Cortland , Syracuse , and Watertown . East of Watertown , the route traverses mostly rural terrain and serves only small villages , such as Potsdam , Malone , and Champlain . While the portion of US 11 between the Pennsylvania state line and Watertown is merely an alternate route to I-81 , the section east of Watertown is the primary long-distance route across the North Country of New York . US 11 was designated as part of the 1926 establishment of the U.S. Highway System . It was first signed in New York in 1927 , replacing New York State Route 2 ( NY 2 ) , a route assigned three years earlier as part of the creation of the modern New York state route system . The termini of US 11 have more or less remained the same since ; however , multiple realignments have occurred along the points in between . One of US 11 's three suffixed routes , NY 11C , follows a former routing of US 11 ."
