During the years of Cypriot intercommunal violence and after the collapse of the bicommunal structure of the Republic of Cyprus , Richard Patrick wrote that the village , along with Kato Polemidia , were exceptional in that they remained accessible to the Greek Cypriot population and the Greek Cypriot National Guard . The National Guard co-existed with the fighters of the Turkish Resistance Organization , which were open with regards to their existence , but were tolerated by the National Guard so long as they did not carry weaponry . In 1974 , following the ultra-nationalist Greek coup and the Turkish invasion of Cyprus , the population of the village fled to the Akrotiri British Base . Some of the population then fled secretly to Northern Cyprus , but most were transferred in 1975 and resettled in Morphou . The village was repopulated by displaced Greek Cypriots from the north , who initially filled up the homes of Turkish Cypriots .
