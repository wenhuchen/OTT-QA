  "/wiki/Cardinal-nephew": "A cardinal-nephew ( Latin : cardinalis nepos ; Italian : cardinale nipote ; Spanish : valido de su t\u00edo ; French : prince de fortune ) was a cardinal elevated by a pope who was that cardinal 's relative . The practice of creating cardinal-nephews originated in the Middle Ages , and reached its apex during the 16th and 17th centuries . The last cardinal-nephew was named in 1689 and the practice was extinguished in 1692 . The word nepotism originally referred specifically to this practice , when it appeared in the English language about 1669 . From the middle of the Avignon Papacy ( 1309-1377 ) until Pope Innocent XII 's anti-nepotism bull ( a papal charter ) , Romanum decet pontificem ( 1692 ) , a pope without a cardinal-nephew was the exception to the rule . Every Renaissance pope who created cardinals appointed a relative to the College of Cardinals , and the nephew was the most common choice , although one of Alexander VI 's creations was his own son . The institution of the cardinal-nephew evolved over seven centuries , tracking developments in the history of the papacy and the styles of individual Popes . From 1566 until 1692 , a cardinal-nephew held the curial office of the Superintendent of the Ecclesiastical State , known as the Cardinal Nephew , and thus the terms are sometimes used interchangeably . The curial office of the Cardinal Nephew as well as the institution of the cardinal-nephew declined as the power of the Cardinal Secretary of State increased and the temporal power of popes decreased in the 17th and 18th centuries . The list of cardinal-nephews includes at least fifteen , and possibly as many as nineteen popes ( Gregory IX , Alexander IV , Adrian V , Gregory XI , Boniface IX , Innocent VII , Eugene IV , Paul II , Alexander VI , Pius III , Julius II , Leo X , Clement VII , Benedict XIII , and Pius VII ; perhaps also John XIX and Benedict IX , if they were really promoted cardinals ; as well as Innocent III and Benedict XII , if in fact they were related to their elevators ) ; one antipope ( John XXIII ) ; and two or three saints ( Charles Borromeo , Guarinus of Palestrina , and perhaps Anselm of Lucca , if he was really a cardinal ) .",
