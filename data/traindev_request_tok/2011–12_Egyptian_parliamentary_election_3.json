  "/wiki/Proportional_representation": "Proportional representation ( PR ) characterizes electoral systems in which divisions in an electorate are reflected proportionately in the elected body . If n% of the electorate support a particular political party as their favorite , then roughly n% of seats will be won by that party . The essence of such systems is that all votes contribute to the result - not just a plurality , or a bare majority . The most prevalent forms of proportional representation all require the use of multiple-member voting districts ( also called super-districts ) , as it is not possible to fill a single seat in a proportional manner . In fact , the implementations of PR that achieve the highest levels of proportionality tend to include districts with large numbers of seats . The most widely used families of PR electoral systems are party-list PR , the single transferable vote ( STV ) , and mixed-member proportional representation ( MMP ) . With party list PR , political parties define candidate lists and voters vote for a list . The relative vote for each list determines how many candidates from each list are actually elected . Lists can be closed or open ; open lists allow voters to indicate individual candidate preferences and vote for independent candidates . Voting districts can be small ( as few as three seats in some districts in Chile or Ireland ) or as large as a province or an entire nation . The single transferable vote uses small multiple-member districts , with voters ranking individual candidates in order of preference . During the count , as candidates are elected or eliminated , surplus or discarded votes that would otherwise be wasted are transferred to other candidates according to the preferences .",
  "/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting": "In a first-past-the-post ( FPTP ; sometimes FPP , or winner takes all ) electoral system members of the electorate cast their vote for the candidate of their choice and the candidate who receives the most votes wins , even if they did not receive a majority of the votes . First-past-the-post voting is a plurality voting method . FPTP is a common electoral system , especially in systems that use single-member electoral divisions . While most countries use forms of proportional representation , FPTP is used in about a third of the world 's countries , especially in the English-speaking world ( the United States , the United Kingdom , India , Pakistan , Canada and other countries in the British Commonwealth ) .",
  "/wiki/Freedom_and_Justice_Party_(Egypt)": "The Freedom and Justice Party ( FJP ) ( ) is an Egyptian Islamist political party . The ex-president of the party , Mohamed Morsi , won the 2012 presidential election , and in the 2011 parliamentary election it won more seats than any other party . It is nominally independent , but has strong links to the Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt , the largest political group in Egypt . The party was banned and dissolved in 2014 ; however , it continues to function underground . The 2011-12 Egyptian Parliamentary election resulted in the FJP winning 47.2 per cent of all seats in the country 's lower house of parliament , with fellow Islamist parties al Nour and al Wasat winning 24.7 and 2 per cent , respectively . Both the FJP and the Salafist Al Nour Party have since denied alleged intentions of political unification . The FJP originally stated that it would not field a candidate for the 2012 Egyptian presidential election , but in fact did so , first running Muslim Brotherhood leader Khairat al-Shater , and then after he was disqualified running Morsi . The Muslim Brotherhood has been declared a terrorist group by the interim government , leaving the status of the FJP unclear . On 15 April 2014 , the Alexandria Court for Urgent Matters banned current and former members of the Muslim Brotherhood from running in the parliamentary elections . On 9 August 2014 , the Supreme Administrative Court ordered the dissolution of the Muslim Brotherhood 's Freedom and Justice Party and the liquidation of its assets .",

Founded in Egypt by Hassan al-Banna in March 1928 , the group spread to other Muslim countries but has its largest , or one of its largest , organizations in Egypt , despite a succession of government crackdowns in 1948 , 1954 , 1965 , and 2013 after plots , or alleged plots , of assassination and overthrow were uncovered . Following the 2011 Egyptian Revolution , it first had great success . It launched a civic political party - the Freedom and Justice Party - to contest elections , which it described as having the same mission and goals , but different roles than the Brotherhood , and agreeing to honor all Egypt 's international agreements . The party won almost half the seats in the 2011-12 parliamentary elections , and its candidate , Mohamed Morsi , won the June 2012 presidential election . However President Mohammad Morsi was overthrown after mass protests within a year and a crackdown ensued that some have called more damaging to the movement than any in eight decades . Hundreds of members were killed , and hundreds - including Morsi and most of the Brotherhood 's leadership - were imprisoned . Among the general Egyptian population , a huge hostility was felt towards the MB . In September 2013 , an Egyptian court banned the Brotherhood and its associations , and ordered that its assets be seized ; and in December the military-backed interim government declared the movement a terrorist group following the bombing of security directorate building in Mansoura ; The Brotherhood has denied being responsible for the attack , and an al-Qaeda inspired group has claimed responsibility . They also issued a statement condemning violence .",
  "/wiki/Islamism": "Islamism is a concept whose meaning has been debated in both public and academic contexts . The term can refer to diverse forms of social and political activism advocating that public and political life should be guided by Islamic principles or more specifically to movements which call for full implementation of sharia ( Islamic order or law ) . It is commonly used interchangeably with the terms political Islam or Islamic fundamentalism . In academic usage , the term Islamism does not specify what vision of Islamic order or sharia are being advocated , or how their advocates intend to bring them about . In Western mass media it tends to refer to groups whose aim is to establish a sharia-based Islamic state , often with implication of violent tactics and human rights violations , and has acquired connotations of political extremism . In the Muslim world , the term has positive connotations among its proponents . Different currents of Islamist thought include advocating a revolutionary strategy of Islamizing society through exercise of state power , and alternately a reformist strategy to re-Islamizing society through grass-roots social and political activism . Islamists may emphasize the implementation of sharia ; pan-Islamic political unity , including an Islamic state ; or selective removal of non-Muslim , particularly Western military , economic , political , social , or cultural influences in the Muslim world that they believe to be incompatible with Islam . Graham Fuller has argued for a broader notion of Islamism as a form of identity politics , involving support for [ Muslim ] identity , authenticity , broader regionalism , revivalism , [ and ] revitalization of the community . Some authors hold the term Islamic activism to be synonymous and preferable to Islamism , and Rached Ghannouchi writes that Islamists prefer to use the term Islamic movement themselves . Central and prominent figures in twentieth-century Islamism include Hasan al-Banna , Sayyid Qutb , Abul Ala Maududi , and Ruhollah Khomeini . Most Islamist thinkers emphasize peaceful political processes , which are supported by the majority of contemporary Islamists .",
  "/wiki/Al-Nour_Party": "The al - Nour Party ( ) , or Party of The Light , is one of the political parties created in Egypt after the 2011 Egyptian Revolution . It has an ultra-conservative Islamist ideology , which believes in implementing strict Sharia law . It has been described as the political arm of the Salafi Call Society , and by far the most prominent of the several new Salafi parties in Egypt , which it has surpassed by virtue of its long organizational and administrative experience and charismatic leaders . Its political aim is to establish a theocratic state on the lines of Wahhabism like in Saudi Arabia . Saudi Arabia was found to be the main financer of the party according to the public German television news service ARD ( broadcaster ) . In the 2011-12 Egypt parliamentary elections , the Islamist Bloc led by al - Nour party received 7,534,266 votes out of a total 27,065,135 correct votes ( 27.8% ) . The Islamist Bloc , of which al-Nour was a member , gained 127 of the 498 parliamentary seats contested , second-place after the Muslim Brotherhood 's Freedom and Justice Party . Al - Nour Party itself won 111 of the 127 seats . From January 2013 the party gradually distanced itself from President Mohamed Morsi 's Brotherhood government , and came to support the military 's July 2013 coup which overthrew Morsi . A lawsuit against the party was dismissed on 22 September 2014 because the court indicated it had no jurisdiction . A case on the dissolution of the party was adjourned until 17 January 2015 and further postponed until 21 February 2015 . Another court case that was brought forth to dissolve the party was dismissed after the Alexandria Urgent Matters Court ruled on 26 November 2014 that it lacked jurisdiction .",
  "/wiki/Salafi_movement": "The Salafi movement , also called Salafist movement , Salafiya , and Salafism , is a reform branch or revivalist movement within Sunni Islam that developed in Egypt in the late 19th century as a response to Western European imperialism . It had roots in the 18th-century Wahhabi movement that originated in the Najd region of modern-day Saudi Arabia . It advocated a return to the traditions of the salaf , the first three generations of Muslims , which they preached as the unadulterated , pure form of Islam . Those generations included the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his companions ( the Sahabah ) , their successors ( the Tabiun ) , and the successors of the successors ( the Taba Tabiin ) . The Salafist doctrine is based on looking back to the early years of the religion to understand how the contemporary Muslims should practise their faith . They reject religious innovation or bid'ah , and support the implementation of sharia ( Islamic law ) . The movement is often divided into three categories : the largest group are the purists ( or quietists ) , who avoid politics ; the second largest group are the activists , who get involved in politics ; the third group are the jihadists , who form a minority and advocate armed struggle to restore the early Islamic movement . In legal matters , the Salafi are divided between those who , in the name of independent legal judgement ( ijtihad ) , reject strict adherence ( taqlid ) to the four Sunni schools of law ( madhahib ) , and others who remain faithful to these . In the Persian Gulf states , the majority of the Salafis reside in Qatar , United Arab Emirates , and Saudi Arabia . 46.87 per cent of Qataris and 44.8 per cent of Emiratis are Salafis . Salafis are the dominant minority in Saudi Arabia . The 4 million Saudi Salafis make up 22.9 per cent of the population .",

  "/wiki/Liberal_democracy": "Liberal democracy is a liberal political ideology and a form of government in which representative democracy operates under the principles of classical liberalism . Also referred to as Western democracy , it is characterised by elections between multiple distinct political parties , a separation of powers into different branches of government , the rule of law in everyday life as part of an open society , a market economy with private property and the equal protection of human rights , civil rights , civil liberties and political freedoms for all people . To define the system in practice , liberal democracies often draw upon a constitution , either formally written or uncodified , to delineate the powers of government and enshrine the social contract . After a period of sustained expansion throughout the 20th century , liberal democracy became the predominant political system in the world . A liberal democracy may take various constitutional forms as it may be a constitutional monarchy ( such as Australia , Belgium , Canada , Denmark , Japan , Netherlands , Norway , Spain and the United Kingdom ) or a republic ( such as France , Germany , India , Italy , Ireland , Mexico , and the United States ) . It may have a parliamentary system ( such as Australia , Canada , Germany , India , Israel , Ireland , Italy and the United Kingdom ) , a presidential system ( such as Indonesia and the United States ) or a semi-presidential system ( such as France and Romania ) . Liberal democracies usually have universal suffrage , granting all adult citizens the right to vote regardless of ethnicity , sex , or property ownership . However , historically some countries regarded as liberal democracies have had a more limited franchise and some do not have secret ballots . There may also be qualifications such as voters being required to register before being allowed to vote . The decisions made through elections are made not by all of the citizens but rather by those who are eligible and who choose to participate by voting . The liberal democratic constitution defines the democratic character of the state . The purpose of a constitution is often seen as a limit on the authority of the government .",

  "/wiki/Conservatism": "Conservatism is a political and social philosophy promoting traditional social institutions in the context of culture and civilization . The central tenets of conservatism include tradition , organic society , hierarchy , authority , and property rights . Conservatives seek to preserve a range of institutions such as religion , parliamentary government , and property rights , with the aim of emphasizing social stability and continuity . The more traditional elements - reactionaries - oppose modernism and seek a return to the way things were . The first established use of the term in a political context originated in 1818 with Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand during the period of Bourbon Restoration that sought to roll back the policies of the French Revolution . Historically associated with right-wing politics , the term has since been used to describe a wide range of views . There is no single set of policies regarded as conservative because the meaning of conservatism depends on what is considered traditional in a given place and time . Thus conservatives from different parts of the world - each upholding their respective traditions - may disagree on a wide range of issues . Edmund Burke , an 18th-century politician who opposed the French Revolution , but supported the American Revolution , is credited as one of the main theorists of conservatism in Great Britain in the 1790s . According to Quintin Hogg , the chairman of the British Conservative Party in 1959 : Conservatism is not so much a philosophy as an attitude , a constant force , performing a timeless function in the development of a free society , and corresponding to a deep and permanent requirement of human nature itself . In contrast to the tradition-based definition of conservatism , some political theorists such as Corey Robin define conservatism primarily in terms of a general defense of social and economic inequality . From this perspective , conservatism is less an attempt to uphold traditional institutions and more , a meditation on - and theoretical rendition of - the felt experience of having power , seeing it threatened , and trying to win it back .",
