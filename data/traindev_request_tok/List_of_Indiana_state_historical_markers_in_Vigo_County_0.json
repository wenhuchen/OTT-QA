He led a boycott by the ARU against handling trains with Pullman cars in what became the nationwide Pullman Strike , affecting most lines west of Detroit and more than 250,000 workers in 27 states . Purportedly to keep the mail running , President Grover Cleveland used the United States Army to break the strike .

In prison , Debs read various works of socialist theory and emerged six months later as a committed adherent of the international socialist movement .
