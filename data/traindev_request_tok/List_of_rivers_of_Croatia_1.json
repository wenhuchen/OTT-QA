  "/wiki/Adriatic_Sea": "The Adriatic Sea /\u02cce\u026adri\u02c8\u00e6t\u026ak/ is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula . The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea , extending from the Strait of Otranto ( where it connects to the Ionian Sea ) to the northwest and the Po Valley . The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , Italy , Montenegro and Slovenia . The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands , mostly located along the Croatian part of its eastern coast . It is divided into three basins , the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest , with a maximum depth of 1,233 metres ( 4,045 ft ) . The Otranto Sill , an underwater ridge , is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas . The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto , along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western ( Italian ) coast . Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight , although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally . The Adriatic 's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean 's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean , acting as a dilution basin . The surface water temperatures generally range from 30 \u00b0C ( 86 \u00b0F ) in summer to 12 \u00b0C ( 54 \u00b0F ) in winter , significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin 's climate . The Adriatic Sea sits on the Apulian or Adriatic Microplate , which separated from the African Plate in the Mesozoic era . The plate 's movement contributed to the formation of the surrounding mountain chains and Apennine tectonic uplift after its collision with the Eurasian plate .",

Four HE power-plants with large dams ( higher than 15 metres ) provide flood protection , power and water storage . It is recognized for its natural environment and diversity of its landscape . Freshwater ecosystems have suffered from an increasing population and the associated development pressures . One of the most valuable natural resources of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia is its freshwater resource , contained by an abundant wellspring and clear rivers . Situated between the major regional rivers ( Drina river on the east , Una river on the west and the Sava river ) the Neretva basin contains the most significant source of drinking water . The Neretva is notable among rivers of the Dinaric Alps region , especially regarding its diverse ecosystems and habitats , flora and fauna , cultural and historic heritage . Its name has been suggested to come from the Indo-European root *ner , meaning to dive . The same root is seen in the Serbo-Croatian root roniti .",

Korana rises in the eastern parts of Lika , creates the world-famous Plitvice Lakes , a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Downstream from Plitvice Lakes the Korana river forms a 25 kilometers long border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina near Cazin . From there it flows northwards through Croatia , where it finally reaches the river Kupa at Karlovac . The soil of the karst region , through which this river flows consists of limestone . Under certain physical and chemical conditions the river is constantly creating new soil from plants ( see : Plitvice Lakes ) . The river Slunj\u010dica flows into Korana at Rastoke/Slunj , and the river Mre\u017enica flows into it at Karlovac .",
  "/wiki/Gacka": "Gacka is a river located in the Lika region in central Croatia . Because for a large part of its course it is a subterranean river , estimates on its length vary . The overground part has undergone substantial human intervention - before it was 32 kilometres ( 20 miles ) long ; now it is only 11 kilometres ( 6.8 miles ) long . It has been regulated by man to flow into an aqueduct in Gusi\u0107 polje ( known as Tunel Gacka-Gusi\u0107 Jezero ) and then into the Adriatic Sea through a hydroelectric installation HE Senj near Sveti Juraj . HE Senj takes inflow from Gacka and Lika , since it was built in 1965 . The river passes through karst fields and most notably the town Oto\u010dac , and its headwaters are known as a popular locale for trout fishing .",
  "/wiki/Jadro": "The Jadro is a watercourse in Dalmatia , Croatia that discharges to the Adriatic Sea . The upper reaches of the Jadro River , as well as its source , Jadro Spring , are protected as an ichthyological nature reserve , partly due to the presence of an endemic species of soft-mouthed trout . The headwaters of the Jadro River were the original water supply for the ancient city comprised by Diocletian 's Palace ( now an area within the present day city of Split ) . Contemporary studies indicate favourable water quality levels of the river near the headwaters at Jadro Spring . The Jadro flows through the town of Solin and has a length of approximately four kilometres ' moreover , the river provides water to the cities of Split , Ka\u0161tela and Trogir . People from Solin also call it Solinska rika . Salmo obtusirostris salonitana is an endemic trout species living in this river , which is currently endangered by the rainbow trout .",
  "/wiki/Ombla": "The Ombla is a short river in Croatia , northeast of Dubrovnik . Its course is approximately 30 metres ( 98 feet ) long , and it empties into the Rijeka Dubrova\u010dka embayment of the Adriatic Sea near Komolac in Dubrovnik-Neretva County . Rijeka Dubrova\u010dka is actually a ria , a flooded river valley formed through changes in sea surface elevation on a geologic time scale . The river rises as a karst spring fed by groundwater replenished by Trebi\u0161njica , which is an influent stream flowing in Popovo Polje , in the immediate hinterland of the Ombla . The elevation difference between the river 's source and its mouth is just over 2 metres ( 6 feet 7 inches ) . The average discharge of the river is 24.1 cubic metres ( 850 cubic feet ) per second . The drainage basin of the Ombla encompasses 600 square kilometres ( 230 square miles ) and , besides the short surface course , includes only groundwater flow . The Ombla is used as a source of drinking water for Dubrovnik 's water supply network , and construction of a hydroelectric power plant has been planned for the past two decades . As of 2012 [ update ] , the plans entail construction of a subsurface reservoir and a 68 megawatt power plant . The plan sparked controversy amid doubts raised with respect to environmental protection and biodiversity management , technical and financial feasibility , and procedural problems related to the project . A particular concern expressed was that the underground reservoir might trigger earthquakes ."
