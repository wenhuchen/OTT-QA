Shelf space is also reserved for canned and packaged goods and for various non-food items such as kitchenware , household cleaners , pharmacy products and pet supplies . Some supermarkets also sell other household products that are consumed regularly , such as alcohol ( where permitted ) , medicine , and clothes , and some sell a much wider range of non-food products : DVDs , sporting equipment , board games , and seasonal items ( e.g. , Christmas wrapping paper in December ) . A larger full-service supermarket combined with a department store is sometimes known as a hypermarket . Other services may include those of banks , caf\u00e9s , childcare centres/creches , insurance ( and other financial services ) , Mobile Phone services , photo processing , video rentals , pharmacies or petrol stations .

  "/wiki/Convenience_store": "A convenience store , convenience shop , or corner store is a small retail business that stocks a range of everyday items such as coffee , groceries , snack foods , confectionery , soft drinks , tobacco products , over-the-counter drugs , toiletries , newspapers , and magazines . In some jurisdictions , convenience stores are licensed to sell alcohol , although many such jurisdictions limit such beverages to those with relatively low alcoholic content such as beer and wine . Such stores may also offer money order and wire transfer services , along with the use of a fax machine or photocopier for a small per-copy cost . They differ from general stores and village shops in that they are not in a rural location and are used as a convenient supplement to larger stores . A convenience store may be part of a gas/petrol station , so customers can purchase goods conveniently while filling their vehicle with fuel . It may be located alongside a busy road , in an urban area , near a railway or railroad station , or at another transport hub . In some countries , convenience stores have long shopping hours , and some remain open 24 hours . Convenience stores usually charge significantly higher prices than conventional grocery stores or supermarkets , as these stores order smaller quantities of inventory at higher per-unit prices from wholesalers . However , convenience stores make up for this loss by having longer open hours , serving more locations , and having shorter cashier lines .",
