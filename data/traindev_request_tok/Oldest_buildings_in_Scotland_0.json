Orkney is 10 miles ( 16 km ) north of the coast of Caithness and has about 70 islands , of which 20 are inhabited . The largest island , Mainland , is often referred to as the Mainland , and has an area of 523 square kilometres ( 202 sq mi ) , making it the sixth-largest Scottish island and the tenth-largest island in the British Isles . The largest settlement and administrative centre is Kirkwall . Orkney is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland , a constituency of the Scottish Parliament , a lieutenancy area , and a historic county . The local council is Orkney Islands Council , one of only three Councils in Scotland with a majority of elected members who are independents . [ Notes 2 ] The islands have been inhabited for at least 8,500 years , originally occupied by Mesolithic and Neolithic tribes and then by the Picts . Orkney was colonised and later annexed by Norway in 875 and settled by the Norse . The Scottish Parliament then absorbed the earldom to the Scottish Crown in 1472 , following the failed payment of a dowry for James III 's bride Margaret of Denmark . In addition to the Mainland , most of the remaining islands are in two groups , the North and South Isles , all of which have an underlying geological base of Old Red Sandstone . The climate is mild and the soils are extremely fertile , most of the land being farmed . Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy .",

Typical are elegant and distinctive shallow bowls with a band of grooved patterning below the rim , a type of decoration which was created using a technique known as stab-and-drag . A second version consists of undecorated , round-bottomed bowls . Some of the bowls had bits of volcanic rock included in the clay to make them stronger . Bone tools were used to burnish the surfaces to make them shiny and impermeable . Unstan ware is named after the Unstan Chambered Cairn on the Mainland of the Orkney Islands , a fine example of a stalled chambered tomb in a circular mound , where the style of pottery was first found in 1884 . Unstan ware is mostly found in tombs , specifically tombs of the Orkney-Cromarty type . These include the Tomb of the Eagles at Isbister on South Ronaldsay , and Taversoe Tuick and Midhowe on Rousay . Unstan ware has been found occasionally at sites in Orkney other than tombs ; for example , the farmstead of Knap of Howar on Papa Westray . Although more recent excavations in Orkney have found Unstan ware to be a more common feature in a domestic context than previously thought , challenging the interpretation of Unstan ware being mainly from tombs . and in the Western Isles , as at Eilean Domhnuill .

  "/wiki/Tomb_of_the_Eagles": "The Tomb of the Eagles , or Isbister Chambered Cairn , is a Neolithic chambered tomb located on a cliff edge at Isbister on South Ronaldsay in Orkney , Scotland . First explored by Ronald Simison , a farmer , when digging flagstones in 1958 , he conducted his own excavations at the site in 1976 . Alerted by Simison , archaeologist John Hedges then mounted a full study , prepared a technical report and wrote a popular book that cemented the tomb 's name . 16,000 human bones were found at the site , as well as 725 from birds . These were identified as predominantly belonging to the white-tailed sea eagle ( Haliaeetus albicilla ) and represented between 8 and 20 individuals . These were originally interpreted as a foundation deposit ; however , this interpretation has been challenged by new dating techniques . These reveal that the eagles died c. 2450-2050 BCE , up to 1,000 years after the building of the tomb . This confirms growing evidence from other sites that the neolithic tombs of Orkney remained in use for many generations . Access the tomb is via a low tunnel 3 metres ( 9.8 ft ) long . Visitors can lie flat on a wheeled trolley , and then stand up in the interior of the tomb . In January 2017 the tomb was featured in the BBC Two archaeology series Britain 's Ancient Capital : Secrets of Orkney .",

One of up to eleven members in the genus Haliaeetus , which are commonly called sea eagles , it is also referred to as the white-tailed sea-eagle . Sometimes , it is known as the ern or erne ( depending on spelling by sources ) , gray sea eagle and Eurasian sea eagle While found across a very wide range , today breeding as far west as Greenland and Iceland across to as far east in Hokkaido , Japan , they are often scarce and very spottily distributed as a nesting species , mainly due to human activities . These have included habitat alterations and destruction of wetlands , about a hundred years of systematic persecution by humans ( from the early 1800s to around World War II ) followed by inadvertent poisonings and epidemics of nesting failures due to various manmade chemical pesticides and organic compounds , which have threatened eagles since roughly the 1950s and continue to be a potential concern . Due to this , the white-tailed eagle was considered endangered or extinct in several countries . However , some populations have recovered well due to some governmental protections and dedicated conservationists and naturalists protecting habitats and nesting sites and partially regulating poaching and pesticide usage , as well as careful reintroductions into parts of their former range . White-tailed eagles usually live most of the year near large bodies of open water , including both coastal saltwater areas and inland freshwater , and require an abundant food supply and old-growth trees or ample sea cliffs for nesting . They are considered a close cousin of the bald eagle ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) , which occupies a similar niche in North America .",

The island has been occupied since the Mesolithic period , and its history includes a time of Norse rule and a long period of domination by Clan MacLeod and Clan Donald . The 18th century Jacobite risings led to the breaking up of the clan system and subsequent Clearances that replaced entire communities with sheep farms , some of which also involved forced emigrations to distant lands .

  "/wiki/Bronze_Age": "The Bronze Age is a historical period that was characterized by the use of bronze , and in some areas proto-writing , and other early features of urban civilization . The Bronze Age is the second principal period of the three-age Stone-Bronze-Iron system , as proposed in modern times by Christian J\u00fcrgensen Thomsen , for classifying and studying ancient societies . An ancient civilization is defined to be in the Bronze Age either by producing bronze by smelting its own copper and alloying with tin , arsenic , or other metals , or by trading for bronze from production areas elsewhere . Bronze itself is harder and more durable than other metals available at the time , allowing Bronze Age civilizations to gain a technological advantage . Whilst terrestrial iron is naturally abundant , its high melting point of 1,538 \u00b0C ( 2,800 \u00b0F ) placed it out of reach of common use until the end of the second millennium BC . Tin 's low melting point of 231.9 \u00b0C ( 449.4 \u00b0F ) and copper 's relatively moderate melting point of 1,085 \u00b0C ( 1,985 \u00b0F ) placed them within the capabilities of the Neolithic pottery kilns , which date back to 6000 BC and were able to produce temperatures greater than 900 \u00b0C ( 1,650 \u00b0F ) . Copper-tin ores are rare , as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in Western Asia before trading in bronze began in the third millennium BC . Worldwide , the Bronze Age generally followed the Neolithic period , with the Chalcolithic serving as a transition . Although the Iron Age generally followed the Bronze Age , in some areas ( such as Sub-Saharan Africa ) , the Iron Age began as early as 2500 BC . Bronze Age cultures differed in their development of the first writing . According to archaeological evidence , cultures in Mesopotamia ( cuneiform script ) and Egypt ( hieroglyphs ) developed the earliest viable writing systems ."
