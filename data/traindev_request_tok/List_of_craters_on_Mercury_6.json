  "/wiki/Impact_crater": "An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet , moon , or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere , formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body . In contrast to volcanic craters , which result from explosion or internal collapse , impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain . Impact craters range from small , simple , bowl-shaped depressions to large , complex , multi-ringed impact basins . Meteor Crater is a well-known example of a small impact crater on Earth . Impact craters are the dominant geographic features on many solid Solar System objects including the Moon , Mercury , Callisto , Ganymede and most small moons and asteroids . On other planets and moons that experience more active surface geological processes , such as Earth , Venus , Mars , Europa , Io and Titan , visible impact craters are less common because they become eroded , buried or transformed by tectonics over time . Where such processes have destroyed most of the original crater topography , the terms impact structure or astrobleme are more commonly used . In early literature , before the significance of impact cratering was widely recognised , the terms cryptoexplosion or cryptovolcanic structure were often used to describe what are now recognised as impact-related features on Earth . The cratering records of very old surfaces , such as Mercury , the Moon , and the southern highlands of Mars , record a period of intense early bombardment in the inner Solar System around 3.9 billion years ago . The rate of crater production on Earth has since been considerably lower , but it is appreciable nonetheless ; Earth experiences from one to three impacts large enough to produce a 20-kilometre-diameter ( 12 mi ) crater about once every million years on average . This indicates that there should be far more relatively young craters on the planet than have been discovered so far . The cratering rate in the inner solar system fluctuates as a consequence of collisions in the asteroid belt that create a family of fragments that are often sent cascading into the inner solar system .",
  "/wiki/Diameter": "In geometry , a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle . It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle . Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere . In more modern usage , the length of a diameter is also called the diameter . In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter ( which refers to the line segment itself ) , because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length , this being twice the radius r .",

Gaud\u00ed 's works have a highly individualized , one-of-a-kind style . Most are located in Barcelona , including his main work , the church of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia . Gaud\u00ed 's work was influenced by his passions in life : architecture , nature , and religion . He considered every detail of his creations and integrated into his architecture such crafts as ceramics , stained glass , wrought ironwork forging and carpentry . He also introduced new techniques in the treatment of materials , such as trencad\u00eds which used waste ceramic pieces . Under the influence of neo-Gothic art and Oriental techniques , Gaud\u00ed became part of the Modernista movement which was reaching its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . His work transcended mainstream Modernisme , culminating in an organic style inspired by natural forms . Gaud\u00ed rarely drew detailed plans of his works , instead preferring to create them as three-dimensional scale models and moulding the details as he conceived them . Gaud\u00ed 's work enjoys global popularity and continuing admiration and study by architects . His masterpiece , the still-incomplete Sagrada Fam\u00edlia , is the most-visited monument in Spain . Between 1984 and 2005 , seven of his works were declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO .",

Unappreciated until after his death , Gauguin is now recognized for his experimental use of color and Synthetist style that were distinct from Impressionism . Toward the end of his life , he spent ten years in French Polynesia , and most of his paintings from this time depict people or landscapes from that region . His work was influential to the French avant-garde and many modern artists , such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse . Gauguin 's art became popular after his death , partially from the efforts of art dealer Ambroise Vollard , who organized exhibitions of his work late in his career and assisted in organizing two important posthumous exhibitions in Paris . Gauguin was an important figure in the Symbolist movement as a painter , sculptor , printmaker , ceramist , and writer . His expression of the inherent meaning of the subjects in his paintings , under the influence of the cloisonnist style , paved the way to Primitivism and the return to the pastoral . He was also an influential proponent of wood engraving and woodcuts as art forms . In recent years , Gauguin has become a controversial figure at art galleries due to criticism of his voyeuristic artwork created in French Polynesia and his relationships with underage girls , including a traditional Polynesian marriage to a 13 year old .",

It is located at 35.5 N and 110.4 W and has a diameter of 102 km . Gibran is located east of the rayed crater of Degas and nearby Damer . The crater was discovered in January 2008 during the first flyby of the planet by MESSENGER spacecraft . It contains a large ( 29 \u00d7 29 km ) , nearly circular pit crater . Multiple examples of pit craters have been observed on Mercury on the floors of impact craters , leading to the name pit-floor craters for the impact structures that host these features . Unlike impact craters , pit craters are rimless , often irregularly shaped , steep-sided , and often display no associated ejecta or lava flows . These pit craters are thought to be evidence of shallow volcanic activity and may have formed when retreating magma caused an unsupported area of the surface to collapse , creating a pit . They are analogs of Earth 's volcanic calderas . Pit-floor craters may provide an indication of internal igneous processes where other evidence of volcanic processes is absent or ambiguous . The discovery of multiple pit-floor craters augments evidence that volcanic activity has been a widespread process in the geologic evolution of Mercury 's crust .",

He is best known as the author of The Prophet , which was first published in the United States in 1923 and has since become one of the best-selling books of all time , having been translated in more than 100 languages . [ c ] Born in a village of the Ottoman-ruled Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate to a Maronite Christian family , the young Gibran immigrated with his mother and siblings to the United States in 1895 . As his mother worked as a seamstress , he was enrolled at a school in Boston , where his creative abilities were quickly noticed by a teacher who presented him to Fred Holland Day . Gibran was sent back to his native land by his family at the age of fifteen to enroll at the Coll\u00e8ge de la Sagesse in Beirut . Returning to Boston upon his youngest sister 's death in 1902 , he lost his older half-brother and his mother the following year , seemingly relying afterwards on his remaining sister 's income from her work at a dressmaker 's shop for some time . In 1904 , Gibran 's drawings were displayed for the first time at Day 's studio in Boston , and his first book in Arabic was published in 1905 in New York City . With the financial help of a newly-met benefactress , Mary Haskell , Gibran studied art in Paris from 1908 to 1910 . While there , he came in contact with Syrian political thinkers promoting rebellion in the Ottoman Empire after the Young Turk Revolution ; some of Gibran 's writings , voicing the same ideas , would eventually be banned by the Ottoman authorities . In 1911 , Gibran settled in New York , where his first book in English , The Madman , would be published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1918 with writing of The Prophet or The Earth Gods also underway . His visual artwork was shown at Montross Gallery in 1914 , and at the galleries of M. Knoedler & Co. in 1917 . He had also been corresponding remarkably with May Ziadeh since 1912 .",

He worked during the Gothic/Proto-Renaissance period . Giotto 's contemporary , the banker and chronicler Giovanni Villani , wrote that Giotto was the most sovereign master of painting in his time , who drew all his figures and their postures according to nature and of his publicly recognized talent and excellence . In his Lives of the Most Excellent Painters , Sculptors , and Architects , Giorgio Vasari described Giotto as making a decisive break with the prevalent Byzantine style and as initiating the great art of painting as we know it today , introducing the technique of drawing accurately from life , which had been neglected for more than two hundred years . Giotto 's masterwork is the decoration of the Scrovegni Chapel , in Padua , also known as the Arena Chapel , which was completed around 1305 . The fresco cycle depicts the Life of the Virgin and the Life of Christ . It is regarded as one of the supreme masterpieces of the Early Renaissance . That Giotto painted the Arena Chapel and was chosen by the Commune of Florence in 1334 to design the new campanile ( bell tower ) of the Florence Cathedral are among the few certainties about his life . Almost every other aspect of it is subject to controversy : his birth date , his birthplace , his appearance , his apprenticeship , the order in which he created his works , whether or not he painted the famous frescoes in the Upper Basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi and his burial place .",

Born in the Upper Palatinate and raised in Bohemia , both part of the Holy Roman Empire , he gained prominence at the Habsburg court at Vienna . There he brought about the practical reform of opera 's dramaturgical practices for which many intellectuals had been campaigning . With a series of radical new works in the 1760s , among them Orfeo ed Euridice and Alceste , he broke the stranglehold that Metastasian opera seria had enjoyed for much of the century . Gluck introduced more drama by using simpler recitative and cutting the usually long da capo aria . His later operas have half the length of a typical baroque opera . The strong influence of French opera encouraged Gluck to move to Paris in November 1773 . Fusing the traditions of Italian opera and the French ( with rich chorus ) into a unique synthesis , Gluck wrote eight operas for the Parisian stage . Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride was a great success and is generally acknowledged to be his finest work . Though he was extremely popular and widely credited with bringing about a revolution in French opera , Gluck 's mastery of the Parisian operatic scene was never absolute , and after the poor reception of his Echo et Narcisse , he left Paris in disgust and returned to Vienna to live out the remainder of his life .",

He was an early participant in the Sturm und Drang literary movement . During his first ten years in Weimar , Goethe became a member of the Duke 's privy council , sat on the war and highway commissions , oversaw the reopening of silver mines in nearby Ilmenau , and implemented a series of administrative reforms at the University of Jena . He also contributed to the planning of Weimar 's botanical park and the rebuilding of its Ducal Palace .
