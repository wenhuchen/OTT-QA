  "/wiki/Population": "In biology a population is all the organisms of the same group or species , which live in a particular geographical area . The area of a sexual population is the area where inter-breeding is potentially possible between any pair within the area , and where the probability of interbreeding is greater than the probability of cross-breeding with individuals from other areas . In sociology , population refers to a collection of humans and their entire race . Demography is a social science which entails the statistical study of populations . Population , in a more simple term , is the number of people in a city or town , region , country or world ; population is usually determined by a process called census ( a process of collecting , analyzing , compiling and publishing data ) .",
