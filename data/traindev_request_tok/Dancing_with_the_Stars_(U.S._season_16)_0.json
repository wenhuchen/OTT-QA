  "/wiki/Olympic_Games": "The modern Olympic Games or Olympics ( French : Jeux olympiques ) are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions . The Olympic Games are considered the world 's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating . The Olympic Games are held every four years , with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart . Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games ( Ancient Greek : \u1f48\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u1f08\u03b3\u1ff6\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 ) , which were held in Olympia , Greece , from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD . Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) in 1894 , leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896 . The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement , with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority . The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games . Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports , the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability , the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18 , the five Continental games ( Pan American , African , Asian , European , and Pacific ) , and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games . The Deaflympics and Special Olympics are also endorsed by the IOC . The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic , political , and technological advancements . The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism , as envisioned by Coubertin , to allowing participation of professional athletes . The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games .",
  "/wiki/Figure_skater": "Figure skating is a sport in which individuals , duos , or groups perform on figure skates on ice . It was the first winter sport to be included in the Olympic Games , when it was contested at the 1908 Olympics in London . The four Olympic disciplines are men 's singles , ladies ' singles , pair skating , and ice dance . Non-Olympic disciplines include synchronized skating , Theater on Ice , and four skating . From intermediate through senior-level competition , skaters generally perform two programs ( short and free skate ) , which may include spins , jumps , moves in the field , lifts , throw jumps , death spirals , and other elements or moves , depending on the discipline . The blade has a groove on the bottom creating two distinct edges : inside and outside . Judges prefer that skaters glide on one edge of the blade and not on both at the same time , which is referred to as a flat edge . During a spin , skaters use the sweet spot of the blade , formally called a rocker , which is the roundest portion of the blade , just behind the toe pick and near the middle of the blade . Skates used in singles and pair skating have a set of large , jagged teeth called toe picks on the front of the blade . Toe picks are mainly used for the take-off on jumps . Ice dance blades have smaller toe picks . Figure skaters compete at various levels from beginner up to the Olympic level ( senior ) at local , regional , sectional , national , and international competitions .",

  "/wiki/Country_music": "Country music , also known as country and western ( or simply country ) , and hillbilly music , is a genre of popular music that takes its roots from genres such as American folk music ( especially Appalachian and Western music ) and blues . Its popularized roots originate in the Southern United States of the early 1920s . Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms , folk lyrics , and harmonies mostly accompanied by string instruments such as banjos , electric and acoustic guitars , steel guitars ( such as pedal steels and dobros ) , and fiddles as well as harmonicas . Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history . According to Lindsey Starnes , the term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music ; it came to encompass Western music , which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots , in the mid-20th century . In 2009 in the United States , country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute , and second most popular in the morning commute . The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres . The origins of country music are found in the folk music of working class Americans and/or blue-collar American life , who blended popular songs , Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes , traditional English ballads , cowboy songs , and the musical traditions of various groups of European immigrants .",

  "/wiki/Comedian": "A comedian or comic is a person who seeks to entertain an audience by making them laugh . This might be through jokes or amusing situations , or acting foolish ( as in slapstick ) or employing prop comedy . A comedian who addresses an audience directly is called a stand-up comedian . A popular saying , variously quoted but generally attributed to Ed Wynn , is , A comic says funny things ; a comedian says things funny , which draws a distinction between how much of the comedy can be attributed to verbal content and how much to acting and persona . Since the 1980s , a new wave of comedy , called alternative comedy , has grown in popularity with its more offbeat and experimental style . This normally involves more experiential , or observational reporting , e.g . Alexei Sayle , Daniel Tosh and Malcolm Hardee . As far as content is concerned , comedians such as Tommy Tiernan , Des Bishop , Kevin Hart and Joan Rivers draw on their background to poke fun at themselves , while others such as Jon Stewart , and Ben Elton have very strong political and cultural undertones . Many comics achieve a cult following while touring famous comedy hubs such as the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal , the Edinburgh Fringe , and Melbourne Comedy Festival in Australia . Often a comic 's career advances significantly when they win a notable comedy award , such as the Edinburgh Comedy Award ( formerly the Perrier comedy award ) . Comics sometimes foray into other areas of entertainment , such as film and television , where they become more widely known ; e.g. , Eddie Izzard or Ricky Gervais . However , a comic 's stand-up success does not guarantee a film 's critical or box office success .",
  "/wiki/Sitcom": "A sitcom , clipping for situational comedy ( situation comedy in the U.S. ) , is a genre of comedy centered on a fixed set of characters who carry over from episode to episode . Sitcoms can be contrasted with sketch comedy , where a troupe may use new characters in each sketch , and stand-up comedy , where a comedian tells jokes and stories to an audience . Sitcoms originated in radio , but today are found mostly on television as one of its dominant narrative forms . A situational comedy television programme may be recorded in front of a studio audience , depending on the programme 's production format . The effect of a live studio audience can be imitated or enhanced by the use of a laugh track . During filming productions , the laugh track is usually pre-recorded . Critics disagree over the utility of the term sitcom in classifying shows that have come into existence since the turn of the century . Many contemporary American sitcoms use the single-camera setup and do not feature a laugh track , thus often resembling the dramedy shows of the 1980s and 1990s rather than the traditional sitcom . Other topics of debate have included whether or not cartoons , such as The Simpsons or Family Guy , can be classified as sitcoms .",

In contrast with amateur boxing , professional bouts are typically much longer and can last up to twelve rounds , though less significant fights can be as short as four rounds . Protective headgear is not permitted , and boxers are generally allowed to take substantial punishment before a fight is halted .

The NFL 's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December , with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week .

The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season . After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings , a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966 . Following an agreement to merge the NFL with the American Football League ( AFL ) , the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 to determine a champion between the best teams from the two leagues and has remained as the final game of each NFL season since the merger was completed in 1970 .
