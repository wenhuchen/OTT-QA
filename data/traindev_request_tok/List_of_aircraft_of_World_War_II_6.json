  "/wiki/Aichi_B7A": "The Aichi B7A Ryusei ( \u6d41\u661f , Ry\u016bsei , Shooting Star , Allied reporting name Grace ) was a large and powerful carrier-borne torpedo-dive bomber produced by Aichi Kokuki KK for the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service during the Second World War . Built in only small numbers and deprived of the aircraft carriers it was intended to operate from , the type had little chance to distinguish itself in combat before the war ended in August 1945 .",
  "/wiki/Aichi_D1A": "The Aichi D1A or Navy Type 94/96 Carrier Bomber ( Allied reporting name Susie ) was a Japanese carrier-based dive bomber of the 1930s . A single-engine , two-seat biplane based on the Heinkel He 50 , the D1A was produced by Aichi for the Imperial Japanese Navy , remaining in service as a trainer at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor . The D1A was produced in two variants , the D1A1 ( Navy Type 94 Carrier Bomber ) , and the D1A2 ( Navy Type 96 Carrier Bomber , sometimes referred to as the D2A ) .",
  "/wiki/Aichi_D3A": "The Aichi D3A Type 99 Carrier Bomber ( Allied reporting name Val ) is a World War II carrier-borne dive bomber . It was the primary dive bomber of the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) and was involved in almost all IJN actions , including the attack on Pearl Harbor . The Aichi D3A was the first Japanese aircraft to bomb American targets in the war , commencing with Pearl Harbor and U.S. bases in the Philippines , such as Clark Air Force Base . Vals sank more Allied warships than any other Axis aircraft .",
  "/wiki/Blackburn_Skua": "The Blackburn B-24 Skua was a carrier-based low-wing , two-seater , single-radial engine aircraft operated by the British Fleet Air Arm which combined the functions of a dive bomber and fighter . It was designed in the mid-1930s and saw service in the early part of the Second World War . It took its name from the sea bird .",
  "/wiki/Brewster_SB2A_Buccaneer": "The Brewster SB2A Buccaneer was a single-engined mid-wing monoplane scout/bomber aircraft built for the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) and United States Navy between 1942 and 1944 . It was also supplied to the United States Army Air Forces and United States Marine Corps . The SB2A was developed for the US Navy , and also ordered in large quantities by the Dutch , French , and British Governments . The Dutch order was later taken over by the US Navy and the French order by Britain . An Australian order was cancelled before any of the type were delivered . The Buccaneer was underpowered and poorly constructed , and all of its operators considered it to be unsuitable for combat . SB2As were used as target tugs by the RAF and US Navy , trainers by the USMC , and hacks by the USAAF . Many of the completed aircraft were scrapped without entering service , and the type is considered by historians to have been among the worst of World War II . The Truman Committee stated that the SB2A turned in a miserable performance .",
  "/wiki/Consolidated_TBY_Sea_Wolf": "The Consolidated TBY Sea Wolf was a United States Navy torpedo bomber of World War II . A competitor and contemporary to the Grumman TBF Avenger , the Sea Wolf was subject to substantial delays and never saw combat ; only 180 of the type were built before cancellation after VJ Day .",
  "/wiki/Curtiss_SB2C_Helldiver": "The Curtiss SB2C Helldiver is a carrier-based dive bomber aircraft produced for the United States Navy during World War II . It replaced the Douglas SBD Dauntless in US Navy service . The SB2C was much faster than the SBD it replaced . The SB2C Helldiver also saw service with the U.S.Marine Corps ( e.g . VMSB-151 AliBaba ) flying out of Enjibe Island , Enewetok Atoll on bombing missions . Crew nicknames for the aircraft included the Big-Tailed Beast or just the derogatory Beast , Two-Cee , and Son-of-a-Bitch 2nd Class ( after its designation and partly because of its reputation for having difficult handling characteristics ) . Neither pilots nor aircraft carrier captains seemed to like it . Delays marred its production - by the time the A-25 Shrike variant for the USAAF was deployed in late 1943 , the Army Air Forces no longer had a need for a thoroughbred dive bomber . Poor handling of the aircraft was another factor that hampered its service introductions ; both the British Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force cancelled substantial orders . The Truman Committee investigated Helldiver production and turned in a scathing report , which eventually led to the beginning of the end for Curtiss . Problems with the Helldiver were eventually ironed out , and in spite of its early problems , the aircraft was flown through the last two years of the Pacific War with a fine combat record .",
  "/wiki/Curtiss_SBC_Helldiver": "The Curtiss SBC Helldiver was a two-seat scout bomber and dive bomber built by the Curtiss-Wright Corporation . It was the last military biplane procured by the United States Navy . Delivered in 1937 , it became obsolete even before World War II and was kept well away from combat with Axis fighters .",
  "/wiki/Douglas_DT": "The Douglas DT bomber was the Douglas Aircraft Company 's first military contract , forging a link between the company and the United States Navy . Navy Contract No . 53305 of April 1 , 1921 , required only 18 pages to set out the specifications that resulted in the purchase of three DT ( D for Douglas , T for torpedo ) folding-wing aircraft . The DT used a welded steel fuselage with aluminum covering the forward and center sections and fabric covering the rear section . Douglas built 46 DT-1 and DT-2 torpedo bombers for the U.S. Navy , Norwegian Navy , and Peruvian Navy . 20 DT-2 aircraft were built under license by the L-W-F Engineering Company Inc. , six by the Naval Aircraft Factory ( NAF ) , and 11 by the Dayton-Wright Company . Another seven were built for Norway under license by Marinens Flyveb\u00e5tfabrik . Although still in service when the Germans invaded Norway , the Norwegian DTs did not see action in the Norwegian Campaign . The DT could be fitted either with pontoons or wheeled landing gear and could carry a 1,800 lb ( 816 kg ) torpedo . The first flight was in November 1921 and production continued until 1929 . The DT operated off the U.S. Navy 's first aircraft carrier , USS Langley , from land bases , and from seaplane tenders . Several were flown by the Marine Corps .",
  "/wiki/Douglas_SBD_Dauntless": "The Douglas SBD Dauntless is a World War II American naval scout plane and dive bomber that was manufactured by Douglas Aircraft from 1940 through 1944 . The SBD ( Scout Bomber Douglas ) was the United States Navy 's main carrier-based scout/dive bomber from mid-1940 through mid-1944 . The SBD was also flown by the United States Marine Corps , both from land air bases and aircraft carriers . The SBD is best remembered as the bomber that delivered the fatal blows to the Japanese carriers at the Battle of Midway in June 1942 . The type earned its nickname Slow But Deadly ( from its SBD initials ) during this period . During its combat service , the SBD proved to be an excellent naval scout plane and dive bomber . It possessed long range , good handling characteristics , maneuverability , potent bomb load , great diving characteristics from the perforated dive brakes , good defensive armament , and ruggedness . One land-based variant of the SBD - in omitting the arrestor hook - was purpose-built for the U.S. Army Air Forces , as the A-24 Banshee .",
  "/wiki/Douglas_TBD_Devastator": "The Douglas TBD Devastator was an American torpedo bomber of the United States Navy . Ordered in 1934 , it first flew in 1935 and entered service in 1937 . At that point , it was the most advanced aircraft flying for the Navy and possibly for any navy in the world . However , the fast pace of aircraft development quickly caught up with it , and by the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor the TBD was already outdated . The Devastator performed well in some early battles , but earned notoriety for its catastrophically poor performance in the Battle of Midway , in which the 41 Devastators launched during the battle produced zero torpedo hits and only six survived to return to their carriers . Vastly outclassed in both speed and maneuverability by the Mitsubishi Zero fighters they faced , most of the force was wiped out with little consequence except to distract the Zeros from the much more capable ( and survivable ) SBD Dauntless dive bombers that eventually sank four Japanese carriers and a heavy cruiser . Although a sizeable portion of the Devastator 's dismal performance was later attributed to the many well-documented defects in the US Mark 13 torpedo , the aircraft was immediately withdrawn from frontline service after Midway , being replaced by the Grumman TBF Avenger .",
  "/wiki/Fairey_Albacore": "The Fairey Albacore was a British single-engine carrier-borne biplane torpedo bomber built by Fairey Aviation between 1939 and 1943 for the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm and used during the Second World War . It had a crew of three and was designed for spotting and reconnaissance as well as level , dive , and torpedo bombing . The Albacore , popularly known as the Applecore , was conceived as a replacement for the Fairey Swordfish , which had entered service in 1936 . However , the Albacore served alongside the Swordfish and was retired before it , being replaced from 1944 by two monoplane designs , the Fairey Barracuda and Grumman Avenger .",
  "/wiki/Fairey_Barracuda": "The Fairey Barracuda was a British carrier-borne torpedo and dive bomber designed by Fairey Aviation . It was the first aircraft of this type operated by the Royal Navy 's Fleet Air Arm ( FAA ) to be fabricated entirely from metal . The Barracuda was developed as a replacement for the Fairey Albacore biplanes . Development was protracted due to the original powerplant intended for the type , the Rolls-Royce Exe , being cancelled ; it was replaced by the less powerful Rolls-Royce Merlin engine . On 7 December 1940 the first Fairey prototype conducted its maiden flight ; early testing revealed it to be somewhat underpowered . However , the definitive Barracuda Mk II had a more powerful model of the Merlin engine , while later versions were powered by the larger and even more powerful Rolls-Royce Griffon engine . The type was ordered in bulk to equip the FAA ; in addition to Fairey 's own production line , Barracudas were also built by Blackburn Aircraft , Boulton Paul , and Westland Aircraft . The type participated in numerous carrier operations during the conflict , being deployed in the Atlantic Ocean , Mediterranean Sea , and the Pacific Ocean against the Germans , Italians , and Japanese respectively during the latter half of the war . One of the Barracuda 's most noteworthy engagements was a large-scale attack upon the German battleship Tirpitz on 3 April 1944 . In addition to the FAA , the Barracuda was also used by the Royal Air Force , the Royal Canadian Navy , the Dutch Naval Aviation Service and the French Air Force . Following its withdrawal from service during the 1950s , no intact examples of the Barracuda were preserved despite its once-large numbers , although the Fleet Air Arm Museum has ambitions to assemble a full reproduction .",
  "/wiki/Fairey_Swordfish": "The Fairey Swordfish is a biplane torpedo bomber designed by the Fairey Aviation Company . Originating in the early 1930s , the Swordfish , nicknamed Stringbag , was operated by the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy , in addition to having been equipped by the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) alongside multiple overseas operators , including the Royal Canadian Air Force ( RCAF ) and the Royal Netherlands Navy . It was initially operated primarily as a fleet attack aircraft . During its later years , the Swordfish became increasingly used as an anti-submarine and training platform . The type was in frontline service throughout the Second World War , but it was already considered obsolete at the outbreak of the conflict in 1939 . Nonetheless , the Swordfish achieved some spectacular successes during the war . Notable events included sinking one battleship and damaging two others of the Regia Marina ( the Italian Navy ) during the Battle of Taranto , and the famous attack on the Bismarck , which contributed to her eventual demise . By the end of the war , the Swordfish held the distinction of having caused the destruction of a greater tonnage of Axis shipping than any other Allied aircraft . The Swordfish remained in front-line service until V-E Day , having outlived multiple aircraft that had been intended to replace it in service .",

The B5M was designed in response to a 1935 specification for a new bomber for use on the IJNAS aircraft carriers ( Mitsubishi Navy Experimental 10-Shi Carrier Torpedo Attacker ) . The machine was to have a crew of three , folding wings for flight deck storage , a speed of not less than 322 km/h ( 200 mph ) , a flight endurance of not less than seven hours , and the ability to carry at least 800 kg ( 1,760 lb ) of bombs - a tall order for a single-engine aircraft of the mid-1930s . It was intended as a backup for the Nakajima B5N Kate torpedo bomber . Although designed as a carrier-based aircraft , it was relegated to land-based torpedo bomber duties in World War II . 125 were built .",

Although the B5N was substantially faster and more capable than its Allied counterparts , the American Douglas TBD Devastator monoplane ( the U.S. Navy 's first all-metal , carrier-borne monoplane of any type with retracting gear ) , and the British Fairey Swordfish and Fairey Albacore torpedo biplanes , it was nearing obsolescence by 1941 . Nevertheless , the B5N operated throughout the whole war , due to the delayed development of its successor , the B6N . In the early part of the Pacific War , flown by well-trained IJN aircrews and as part of well-coordinated attacks , the B5N achieved particular successes at the battles of Pearl Harbor , Coral Sea , Midway , and Santa Cruz Islands . Primarily a carrier-based aircraft , it was also occasionally used as a land-based bomber . The B5N carried a crew of three : pilot , navigator/bombardier/observer , and radio operator/gunner .",
