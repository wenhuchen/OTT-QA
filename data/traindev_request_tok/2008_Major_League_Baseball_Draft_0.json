  "/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays": "The Tampa Bay Rays are an American professional baseball team based in St. Petersburg , Florida . They compete in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) as a member of the American League ( AL ) East division . Since its inception , the team 's home venue has been Tropicana Field . Following nearly three decades of unsuccessfully trying to gain an expansion franchise or enticing existing teams to relocate to the Tampa Bay Area , an ownership group led by Vince Naimoli was approved on March 9 , 1995 . The Tampa Bay Devil Rays began play in the 1998 Major League Baseball season . Their first decade of play , however , was marked by futility ; they finished in last place in the AL East in all but the 2004 season , when they finished second to last . Following the 2007 season , Stuart Sternberg , who had purchased controlling interest in the team from Vince Naimoli two years earlier , changed the team 's name from Devil Rays to Rays , now meant to primarily refer to a burst of sunshine rather than a manta ray , though a manta ray logo remains on the uniform sleeves . The 2008 season saw the Tampa Bay Rays post their first winning season , their first AL East championship , and their first pennant ( defeating the rival Boston Red Sox in the ALCS ) , though they lost to the Philadelphia Phillies in that year 's World Series . Since then , the Rays have played in the postseason in 2010 , 2011 , 2013 , and 2019 . The Tampa Bay Rays ' chief rivals are the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees . Regarding the former , there have been several notable on-field incidents . The Rays also have an intrastate interleague rivalry with the National League ( NL ) 's Miami Marlins ( originally the Florida Marlins ) , whom they play in the Citrus Series .",
  "/wiki/Shortstop": "Shortstop , abbreviated SS , is the baseball or softball fielding position between second and third base , which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions . Historically the position was assigned to defensive specialists who were typically poor at batting and were often placed at the bottom of the batting order . Today shortstops are often able to hit well and many are placed at the top of the lineup . In the numbering system used by scorers to record defensive plays , the shortstop is assigned the number 6 . More hit balls go to the shortstop than to any other position , as there are more right-handed hitters in baseball than left-handed hitters , and most hitters have a tendency to pull the ball slightly . Like a second baseman , a shortstop must be agile , for example when performing a 4-6-3 double play . Also , like a third baseman , the shortstop fields balls hit to the left side of the infield , where a strong arm is needed to throw out a batter-runner before they reach the safety of first base .",

Founded in 1881 under the name Pittsburgh Allegheny , the franchise has won five World Series championships . The Pirates are also often referred to as the Bucs or the Buccos ( derived from buccaneer , a synonym for pirate ) . The team plays its home games at PNC Park , its home since 2001 . The Pirates previously played at Forbes Field from 1909-1970 and at Three Rivers Stadium , so named because of its location near the confluence of the Allegheny , Monongahela , and Ohio rivers , from 1970-2000 . The franchise joined the NL in its eighth season in 1887 and was competitive from its early years , winning three NL titles from 1901 to 1903 , playing in the inaugural World Series in 1903 and winning their first World Series in 1909 behind Honus Wagner . The Pirates have had many ups and downs during their long history , most famously winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a series-winning walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski , the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run . They also won the 1971 World Series , led by the talent of Roberto Clemente , and the 1979 World Series under the slogan We Are Family , led by Pops Willie Stargell . After a run of regular-season success in the early 1990s ( winning three straight NL East Division titles ) , the Pirates struggled mightily over the following 20 years , with 20 consecutive losing seasons from 1993 to 2012 - the longest such streak in American professional sports history - before posting a winning record in 2013 of 94-68 , qualifying them for the NL Wild Card . They advanced to the NL Division Series round , where they lost in 5 games to the St. Louis Cardinals . The Pirates made the playoffs in both 2014 and 2015 , losing in the Wild Card Game both times .",
  "/wiki/Third_baseman": "A third baseman , abbreviated 3B , is the player in baseball whose responsibility is to defend the area nearest to third base - the third of four bases a baserunner must touch in succession to score a run . In the scoring system used to record defensive plays , the third baseman is assigned the number ' 5 ' . The third baseman requires good reflexes in reacting to batted balls , as he is often the closest infielder ( roughly 90-120 feet ) to the batter . The third base position requires a strong and accurate arm , as the third baseman often makes long throws to first base . The third baseman sometimes must throw quickly to second base in time to start a double play . The third baseman must also field fly balls in fair and foul territory . Third base is known as the hot corner , because the third baseman is relatively close to the batter and most right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball hard in this direction . A third baseman must possess good hand-eye coordination and quick reactions in order to catch hard line drives sometimes in excess of 125 miles per hour ( 201 km/h ) . Third basemen often must begin in a position even closer to the batter if a bunt is expected , creating a hazard if the ball is instead hit sharply . As with middle infielders , right-handed throwing players are standard at the position because they do not need to turn their body before throwing across the infield to first base . Mike Squires , who played fourteen games at third base in 1982 and 1983 , is a very rare example of a third baseman who threw lefty . Some third basemen have been converted from middle infielders or outfielders because the position does not require them to run as fast .",

  "/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals": "The Kansas City Royals are an American professional baseball team based in Kansas City , Missouri . They compete in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) as a member team of the American League ( AL ) Central division . The team was founded as an expansion franchise in 1969 , and has participated in four World Series , winning in 1985 and 2015 , and losing in 1980 and 2014 . The name Royals pays homage to the American Royal , a livestock show , horse show , rodeo , and championship barbeque competition held annually in Kansas City since 1899 as well as the identical names of two former negro league baseball teams that played in the first half of the 20th century ( one a semi-pro team based in Kansas City in the 1910s and 1920s that toured the Midwest and a California Winter League team based in Los Angeles in the 1940s that was managed by Chet Brewer and included Satchel Paige and Jackie Robinson on its roster ) . The Los Angeles team had personnel connections to the Monarchs but could not use the Monarchs name . The name also fits into something of a theme for other professional sports franchises in the city , including the Kansas City Chiefs of the NFL , the former Kansas City Kings of the NBA , and the former Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro National League . In 1968 , the team held a name-the-team contest that received more than 17,000 entries . Sanford Porte , a bridge engineer from the suburb of Overland Park , Kansas was named the winner for his Royals entry . His reason had nothing to do with royalty . Kansas Citys new baseball team should be called the Royals because of Missouris billion-dollar livestock income , Kansas Citys position as the nations leading stocker and feeder market and the nationally known American Royal parade and pageant , Porte wrote . The team 's board voted 6-1 on the name , with the only opposition coming from team owner Ewing Kauffman , who eventually changed his vote and said the name had grown on him . Entering the American League in 1969 along with the Seattle Pilots , the club was founded by Kansas City businessman Ewing Kauffman .",
  "/wiki/First_baseman": "First base , or 1B , is the first of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a baserunner to score a run for that player 's team . A first baseman is the player on the team playing defense who fields the area nearest first base , and is responsible for the majority of plays made at that base . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the first baseman is assigned the number 3 . Also called first sacker or cornerman , the first baseman is ideally a tall player who throws left-handed and possesses good flexibility and quick reflexes . Flexibility is needed because the first baseman receives throws from the other infielders , the catcher and the pitcher after they have fielded ground balls . In order for the runner to be called out , the first baseman must be able to stretch towards the throw and catch it before the runner reaches first base . First base is often referred to as the other hot corner - the hot corner being third base - and therefore , like the third baseman , he must have quick reflexes to field the hardest hit balls down the foul line , mainly by left-handed pull hitters and right-handed hitters hitting to the opposite field . They often are power hitters who have a substantial number of home runs and extra base hits while maintaining a .270 plus batting average . [ citation needed ]",

As one of the American League 's eight charter teams in 1901 , this particular franchise spent its first year as a major league club in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , as the Milwaukee Brewers before moving to St. Louis , Missouri , to become the St. Louis Browns in 1902 . After 52 years in St. Louis , the franchise was purchased in November 1953 by a syndicate of Baltimore business and civic interests led by attorney and civic activist Clarence Miles and Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro , Jr . The team 's current owner is American trial lawyer Peter Angelos . The Orioles adopted their team name in honor of the official state bird of Maryland ; it had also been used by several previous major and minor league baseball clubs in Baltimore , including another AL charter member franchise also named the Baltimore Orioles , which moved north in 1903 to eventually become the New York Yankees . Nicknames for the team include the O 's and the Birds . The Orioles experienced their greatest success from 1966 to 1983 , when they made six World Series appearances , winning three of them ( 1966 , 1970 , 1983 ) . This era of the club featured several future Hall of Famers who would later be inducted representing the Orioles , such as third baseman Brooks Robinson , outfielder Frank Robinson , starting pitcher Jim Palmer , first baseman Eddie Murray , shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. , and manager Earl Weaver .

  "/wiki/Catcher": "Catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player . When a batter takes his/her turn to hit , the catcher crouches behind home plate , in front of the ( home ) umpire , and receives the ball from the pitcher . In addition to this primary duty , the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well . The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket , but in cricket , wicketkeepers are increasingly known for their batting abilities . Positioned behind home plate , the catcher can see the whole field , and is therefore in the best position to direct and lead the other players in a defensive play . The catcher typically calls for pitches using hand signals . The calls are based on the pitcher 's mechanics and strengths , as well as the batter 's tendencies and weaknesses . Foul tips , bouncing balls in the dirt , and contact with runners during plays at the plate are all events to be handled by the catcher , necessitating the use of protective equipment . This includes a mask , chest and throat protectors , shin guards , and a heavily padded catcher 's mitt . Because the position requires a comprehensive understanding of the game 's strategies , the pool of former catchers yields a disproportionate number of managers in both Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball , including such prominent examples as Connie Mack , Steve O'Neill , Al L\u00f3pez , Mike Scioscia , and Joe Torre . The physical and mental demands of being involved on every defensive play can wear catchers down over a long season , and can have a negative effect on their offensive output . Because of the strategic defensive importance of catching , if a catcher has exceptional defensive skills , teams are often willing to overlook their relative offensive weaknesses .",

  "/wiki/Second_baseman": "In baseball and softball , second baseman is a fielding position in the infield , between second and first base . The second baseman often possesses quick hands and feet , needs the ability to get rid of the ball quickly , and must be able to make the pivot on a double play . In addition , second basemen are usually right-handed ; only four left-handed throwing players have ever played second base in Major League Baseball since 1950 . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the second baseman is assigned the number 4 . Good second basemen need to have very good range since they have to field balls closer to the first baseman who is often holding runners on , or moving towards the base to cover . On a batted ball to right field , the second baseman goes out towards the ball for the relay . Due to these requirements , second base is sometimes a primarily defensive position in the modern game , but there are hitting stars as well .",

  "/wiki/Seattle_Mariners": "The Seattle Mariners are an American professional baseball team based in Seattle , Washington . They compete in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) as a member club of the American League ( AL ) West division . The team joined the American League as an expansion team in 1977 playing their home games in the Kingdome . Since July 1999 , the Mariners ' home ballpark has been T-Mobile Park ( formerly Safeco Field ) , located in the SoDo neighborhood of Seattle . The Mariners name originates from the prominence of marine culture in the city of Seattle . They are nicknamed the M 's , a title featured in their primary logo from 1987 to 1992 . They adopted their current team colors - navy blue , northwest green ( teal ) , and silver - prior to the 1993 season , after having been royal blue and gold since the team 's inception . Their mascot is the Mariner Moose . The organization did not field a winning team until 1991 , and any real success eluded them until 1995 when they won their first division championship and defeated the New York Yankees in the ALDS . The game-winning hit in Game 5 , in which Edgar Mart\u00ednez drove home Ken Griffey Jr. to win the game in the 11th inning , clinched a series win for the Mariners , served as a powerful impetus to preserve baseball in Seattle , and has since become an iconic moment in team history . The Mariners won 116 games in 2001 , which set the American League record for most wins in a single season and tied the 1906 Chicago Cubs for the Major League record for most wins in a single season . Through the end of the 2019 season , the franchise has finished with a losing record in 29 of 43 seasons ."
