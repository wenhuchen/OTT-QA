The team represents the Irish Rugby Football Union ( IRFU ) Leinster Branch , which is one of four primary branches of the IRFU and is responsible for rugby union throughout the geographical Irish province of Leinster . Leinster play their home games primarily at the RDS Arena , although larger games are played in the Aviva Stadium when the capacity of the RDS is insufficient . Before moving to the RDS in 2005 , Leinster 's traditional home ground was Donnybrook Stadium , in Dublin 4 . The province plays primarily in blue and the team crest features a harp within a rugby ball , the harp being taken from the flag of Leinster . Leinster turned professional along with its fellow Irish provinces in 1995 and has competed in the Pro14 ( formerly known as the Celtic League and the Pro12 ) since it was founded in 2001 , having previously competed in the annual Irish interprovincial championship . Leinster A competed in the British and Irish Cup , winning the competition twice . Following the suspension of that cup , Leinster ' A ' entered the Celtic Cup in 2018 , winning the inaugural title , and retaining it in 2019 .
