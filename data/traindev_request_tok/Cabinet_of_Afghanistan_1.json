The movement is registered as a political party with the Ministry of Justice . From its foundation to 2005 , the movement was led by Ayatollah Muhammad Asif Muhsini . The movement emerged in 1978 , as a political formation of non-Hazara Shias . Initially the movement was inspired by the Islamic revolutionary ideas of Ali Shari'ati , but over time this influence waned . During the 1980s , the movement was part of the 'Tehran Eight ' , an alliance of Shia mujahedin factions supported by Iran that fought against the PDPA government and Soviet troops . The movement joined the Hezb-e Wahdat , which was intended as a united Shia political front , but soon bolted out of it . During the Taliban years , it joined the 'Northern Alliance ' . After the US occupation of Afghanistan , the movement was divided into two . A dissident sector broke away , and formed the People 's Islamic Movement of Afghanistan . The dissidents , led by Seyyed Hossein Anwari , were based among the militia forces of the movement and had a more secular political outlook . In February 2005 , Muhsini resigned as leader of the movement .",
