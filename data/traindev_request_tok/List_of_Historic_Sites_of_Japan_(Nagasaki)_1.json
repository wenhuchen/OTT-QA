  "/wiki/S\u014dke": "S\u014dke ( \u5b97\u5bb6 ) , pronounced [ so\u02d0ke ] , is a Japanese term that means the head family [ house ] . In the realm of Japanese traditional arts , it is used synonymously with the term iemoto . Thus , it is often used to indicate headmaster ( or sometimes translated as head of the family or even grand master . ) The English translation of s\u014dke as grand master is not a literal translation but it does see use by some Japanese sources . It can mean one who is the leader of any school or the master of a style , but it is most commonly used as a highest level Japanese title , referring to the singular leader of a school or style of martial art . The term , however , is not limited to the genre of martial arts . S\u014dke is sometimes mistakenly believed to mean founder of a style because many modern s\u014dke are the first generation headmasters of their art ( shodai s\u014dke ) , and are thus both s\u014dke and founder . However , the successors to the shodai s\u014dke are also s\u014dke themselves . S\u014dke are generally considered the ultimate authority within their art , and have final discretion and authority regarding promotions , curriculum , doctrine , and disciplinary actions . A s\u014dke has the authority to issue a menkyo kaiden certificate indicating that someone has mastered all aspects of his style . In some schools such as Kashima-Shinryu there is a related position called Shihanke ( \u5e2b\u7bc4\u5bb6 hiragana : \u3057\u306f\u3093\u3051 ) meaning Instructor Line that fills a very similar role . A Shihanke is essentially a second training lineage that exists autonomously from the S\u014dke .",

It is associated with Tsushima Province on Tsushima Island in modern-day Nagasaki Prefecture .

In the summer of 1281 the Yuan invaded with two large armies . The Japanese defenders were aided by a major storm which sunk a sizeable portion of the Mongolian fleets .

After conquering the Japanese settlements on Tsushima and Iki islands , Kublai Khan 's fleet moved on to Japan proper and landed at Hakata Bay , a short distance from Ky\u016bsh\u016b 's administrative capital of Dazaifu . Despite the superior weapons and tactics of the Mongols , who established the Yuan Dynasty in China in the early 1270s , the Yuan forces that disembarked at Hakata Bay were grossly outnumbered by the samurai force ; the Japanese had been preparing , mobilizing warriors and reinforcing defenses since they heard of the defeats at Tsushima and Iki . The Japanese defenders were aided by major storms which sunk a sizable portion of the Mongolian fleets . Ultimately , the invasion attempt was decisively repulsed shortly after the initial landings . The Yuan troops withdrew and took refuge on their ships after only one day of fighting . A typhoon that night , said to be divinely conjured wind , threatened their ships , persuading them to return to Korea . Many of the returning ships sank that night due to the storm .",

The town was established on August 1 , 2004 after the merger of the towns of Arikawa , Kamigot\u014d , Narao , Shin-Uonome and Wakamatsu , all from Minami-Matsuura District . It occupies the two main islands of Nakad\u014dri and Wakamatsu , which are connected by Wakamatsu Oohashi ( Wakamatsu Great Bridge ) via the small , unpopulated islet of Kaminakajima ( \u4e0a\u4e2d\u5cf6 ) , as well as several smaller islands , including the populated islands of Arifuku , Hinoshima , Ry\u014dzegaura , Kashiragashima , and Kirinoko . Wakamatsu Island is connected at its northwestern extremity to Ry\u014dzegaura Island by the Ry\u014dzegaura Bridge , and Ry\u014dzegaura Island is further linked with the islands of Arifuku and Hinoshima by breakwaters that allow traffic of automobiles . Kashiragashima Oohashi connects the eastern end of the main island of Nakad\u014dri with Kashiragashima , on which the famous Kashiragashima Church and the defunct Kamigot\u014d Airport are located . The islands that comprise the territory of Shin-Kamigot\u014d Town also form the northeastern half of the Got\u014d Islands archipelago , which is the origin of the name Kamigot\u014d ( literally , Upper Five Islands ) , in which Got\u014d ( Five Islands ) is the name of the entire archipelago , and Kami- ( Upper ) refers to the fact that this half of the archipelago is located closer to the Japanese capital relative to the southwestern half . The prefix Shin- ( \u65b0 ) at the beginning of the town 's name means new , so its full name may be translated literally to English as New Upper Five Islands Town , though the name may be interpreted to refer to the town as a new and expanded version of the former Kamigot\u014d Town , which was centered on the port of Aokata on the western side of the middle of Nakad\u014dri Island . As of March 31 , 2017 , the town has an estimated population of 19,866 and a density of 93 persons per km2 . The total area is 213.98 km2 .",
