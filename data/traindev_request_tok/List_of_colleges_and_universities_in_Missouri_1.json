  "/wiki/Historically_black_colleges_and_universities": "Historically black colleges and universities ( HBCUs ) are institutions of higher education in the United States that were established before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with the intention of primarily serving the African-American community . During the period of segregation in the United States prior to the Civil Rights Act , the overwhelming majority of higher education institutions were predominantly white and completely disqualified or limited African American enrollment . For a century after the end of slavery in the United States in 1865 , most colleges and universities in the Southern United States prohibited all African Americans from attending , while institutions in other parts of the country regularly employed quotas to limit admissions of blacks . There are 101 HBCUs in the United States , including both public and private institutions ( down from the 121 institutions that existed during the 1930s ) . Of these remaining HBCU institutions in the United States , 27 offer doctoral programs , 52 offer master 's programs , 83 offer bachelor 's degree programs , and 38 offer associate degrees .",
