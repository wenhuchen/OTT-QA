  "/wiki/Kana": "Kana ( \u4eee\u540d , Japanese pronunciation : [ kana ] ) are the syllabaries that form parts of the Japanese writing system , contrasted with the logographic Chinese characters known in Japan as kanji ( \u6f22\u5b57 ) . The modern Japanese writing system makes use of two syllabaries : cursive hiragana ( \u3072\u3089\u304c\u306a ) and angular katakana ( \u30ab\u30bf\u30ab\u30ca ) . Also classified as kana is the ancient syllabic use of kanji known as man'y\u014dgana ( \u4e07\u8449\u4eee\u540d ) , which was ancestral to both hiragana and katakana . Hentaigana ( \u5909\u4f53\u4eee\u540d , variant kana ) are historical variants of modern standard hiragana . In modern Japanese , hiragana and katakana have directly corresponding sets of characters representing the same series of sounds . Katakana , with a few additions , are also used to write Ainu . Taiwanese kana were used in Taiwanese Hokkien as glosses ( furigana ) for Chinese characters in Taiwan under Japanese rule . Each kana character ( syllabogram ) corresponds to one sound in the Japanese language . Apart from the five vowels , this is always CV ( consonant onset with vowel nucleus ) , such as ka , ki , etc. , or V ( vowel ) , such as a , i , etc. , with the sole exception of the C grapheme for nasal codas usually romanised as n. This structure has led some scholars to label the system moraic instead of syllabic , because it requires the combination of two syllabograms to represent a CVC syllable with coda ( i.e . CVn , CVm , CVng ) , a CVV syllable with complex nucleus ( i.e . multiple or expressively long vowels ) , or a CCV syllable with complex onset ( i.e . including a glide , CyV , CwV ) .",
