  "/wiki/Broadcast_syndication": "Broadcasting syndication is the license to broadcast television programs and radio programs by multiple television stations and radio stations , without going through a broadcast network . It is common in the United States where broadcast programming is scheduled by television networks with local independent affiliates . Syndication is less of a practice in the rest of the world , as most countries have centralized networks or television stations without local affiliates . Shows can be syndicated internationally , although this is less common . The three main types of syndication are first-run syndication , which is programming that is broadcast for the first time as a syndicated show and is made specifically to sell directly into syndication ; off-network syndication ( colloquially called a rerun ) , which is the licensing of a program that was originally run on network TV or in some cases , first-run syndication ; and public broadcasting syndication .",

  "/wiki/Ultra": "Ultra was the designation adopted by British military intelligence in June 1941 for wartime signals intelligence obtained by breaking high-level encrypted enemy radio and teleprinter communications at the Government Code and Cypher School ( GC & CS ) at Bletchley Park . Ultra eventually became the standard designation among the western Allies for all such intelligence . The name arose because the intelligence thus obtained was considered more important than that designated by the highest British security classification then used ( Most Secret ) and so was regarded as being Ultra secret . Several other cryptonyms had been used for such intelligence . The code name Boniface was used as a cover name for Ultra . In order to ensure that the successful code-breaking did not become apparent to the Germans , British intelligence created a fictional MI6 master spy , Boniface , who controlled a fictional series of agents throughout Germany . Information obtained through code-breaking was often attributed to the human intelligence from the Boniface network . The U.S. used the codename Magic for its decrypts from Japanese sources , including the Purple cipher . Much of the German cipher traffic was encrypted on the Enigma machine . Used properly , the German military Enigma would have been virtually unbreakable ; in practice , shortcomings in operation allowed it to be broken . The term Ultra has often been used almost synonymously with Enigma decrypts . However , Ultra also encompassed decrypts of the German Lorenz SZ 40/42 machines that were used by the German High Command , and the Hagelin machine .",

  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 .

A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries .

It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire .

  "/wiki/Biopic": "A biographical film , or biopic ( /\u02c8ba\u026ao\u028ap\u026ak/ ; abbreviation for biographical motion picture ) , is a film that dramatizes the life of a non-fictional or historically-based person or people . Such films show the life of a historical person and the central character 's real name is used . They differ from docudrama films and historical drama films in that they attempt to comprehensively tell a single person 's life story or at least the most historically important years of their lives . [ original research ? ] Because the figures portrayed are actual people , whose actions and characteristics are known to the public ( or at least historically documented ) , biopic roles are considered some of the most demanding of actors and actresses . [ citation needed ] Ben Kingsley , Johnny Depp , Jim Carrey , Robert Downey Jr. , Jamie Foxx and Eddie Redmayne all gained new-found respect as dramatic actors after starring in biopics : [ citation needed ] Ben Kingsley as Mahatma Gandhi in Gandhi ( 1982 ) , Depp as Ed Wood in Ed Wood ( 1994 ) , Carrey as Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon ( 1999 ) , Downey as Charlie Chaplin in Chaplin ( 1992 ) , Foxx as Ray Charles in Ray ( 2004 ) , and Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything ( 2014 ) . In rare cases , sometimes called auto biopics , the subject of the film plays himself or herself : Jackie Robinson in The Jackie Robinson Story ; Muhammad Ali in The Greatest ; Audie Murphy in To Hell and Back ; Patty Duke in Call Me Anna ; Bob Mathias in The Bob Mathias Story , Arlo Guthrie in Alice 's Restaurant ; Fantasia Barrino in Life Is Not a Fairytale ; and Howard Stern in Private Parts . Biopic scholars include George F. Custen of the College of Staten Island and Dennis P. Bingham of Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis . Custen , in Bio/Pics : How Hollywood Constructed Public History ( 1992 ) , regards the genre as having died with the Hollywood studio era , and in particular , Darryl F. Zanuck . On the other hand , Bingham 's 2010 study Whose Lives Are They Anyway ? The Biopic as Contemporary Film Genre shows how it perpetuates as a codified genre using many of the same tropes used in the studio era that has followed a similar trajectory as that shown by Rick Altman in his study , Film/Genre . Bingham also addresses the male biopic and the female biopic as distinct genres from each other , the former generally dealing with great accomplishments , the latter generally dealing with female victimization .",

  "/wiki/Academy_Award": "The Academy Awards , more popularly known as the Oscars , are awards for artistic and technical merit in the film industry . Given annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ( AMPAS ) , the awards are an international recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements as assessed by the Academy 's voting membership . The various category winners are awarded a copy of a golden statuette , officially called the Academy Award of Merit , although more commonly referred to by its nickname , the Oscar . The statuette depicts a knight rendered in the Art Deco style . The award was originally sculpted by George Stanley from a design sketch by Cedric Gibbons . AMPAS first presented it in 1929 at a private dinner hosted by Douglas Fairbanks in the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel in what would become known as the 1st Academy Awards . The Academy Awards ceremony was first broadcast by radio in 1930 and was televised for the first time in 1953 . It is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony and is now televised live worldwide . It is also the oldest of the four major annual American entertainment awards ; its other three equivalents - the Emmy Awards for television , the Tony Awards for theater , and the Grammy Awards for music - are modeled after the Academy Awards . The 91st Academy Awards ceremony , honoring the best films of 2018 , was held on February 24 , 2019 , at the Dolby Theatre , in Los Angeles , California . The ceremony was broadcast on ABC . A total of 3,096 Oscar statuettes have been awarded from the inception of the award through the 91st ceremony .",
  "/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress": "The Academy Award for Best Actress is an award presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ( AMPAS ) . It is given in honor of an actress who has delivered an outstanding performance in a leading role while working within the film industry . The award is traditionally presented by the previous year 's Best Actor winner . The 1st Academy Awards ceremony was held in 1929 with Janet Gaynor receiving the award for her roles in 7th Heaven , Street Angel , and Sunrise . Currently , nominees are determined by single transferable vote within the actors branch of AMPAS ; winners are selected by a plurality vote from the entire eligible voting members of the Academy . In the first three years of the awards , actresses were nominated as the best in their categories . At that time , all of their work during the qualifying period ( as many as three films , in some cases ) was listed after the award . However , during the 3rd ceremony held in 1930 , only one of those films was cited in each winner 's final award , even though each of the acting winners had two films following their names on the ballots . The following year , this unwieldy and confusing system was replaced by the current system in which an actress is nominated for a specific performance in a single film . Starting with the 9th ceremony held in 1937 , the category was officially limited to five nominations per year . One actress has been nominated posthumously , Jeanne Eagels . Since its inception , the award has been given to 76 actresses ."
