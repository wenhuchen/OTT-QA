Born to a Presbyterian minister , Cleveland grew up in upstate New York . In 1881 , he was elected Mayor of Buffalo and later , governor of New York . Cleveland was the leader of the pro-business Bourbon Democrats who opposed high tariffs ; Free Silver ; inflation ; imperialism ; and subsidies to business , farmers , or veterans . His crusade for political reform and fiscal conservatism made him an icon for American conservatives of the era . Cleveland won praise for his honesty , self-reliance , integrity , and commitment to the principles of classical liberalism . He fought political corruption , patronage , and bossism . As a reformer , Cleveland had such prestige that the like-minded wing of the Republican Party , called Mugwumps , largely bolted the GOP presidential ticket and swung to his support in the 1884 election . As his second administration began , disaster hit the nation when the Panic of 1893 produced a severe national depression , which Cleveland was unable to reverse . It ruined his Democratic Party , opening the way for a Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896 . The result was a political realignment that ended the Third Party System and launched the Fourth Party System and the Progressive Era .",
