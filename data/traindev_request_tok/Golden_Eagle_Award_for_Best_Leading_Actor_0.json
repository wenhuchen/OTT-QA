  "/wiki/BGN/PCGN_romanization_of_Russian": "BGN/PCGN romanization system for Russian is a method for romanization of Cyrillic Russian texts , that is , their transliteration into the Latin alphabet as used in the English language . There are a number of systems for romanization of Russian , but the BGN/PCGN system is relatively intuitive for anglophones to pronounce . It is part of the larger set of BGN/PCGN romanizations , which includes methods for 29 different languages . It was developed by the United States Board on Geographic Names ( BGN ) and by the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use ( PCGN ) . The portion of the system pertaining to the Russian language was adopted by BGN in 1944 , and by PCGN in 1947 . This romanization of Russian can be rendered by using only the basic letters and punctuation found on English-language keyboards . No diacritics or unusual letters are required , but the interpunct character ( \u00b7 ) is optionally used to avoid some ambiguity . In many publications , a simplified form of the system is used to render English versions of Russian names , which typically converts \u00eb to yo , simplifies -iy and -yy endings to -y and omits apostrophes for \u044a and \u044c . The following table describes the system and provides examples .",
