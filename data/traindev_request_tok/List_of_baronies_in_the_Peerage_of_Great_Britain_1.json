  "/wiki/Baron_Carleton": "Baron Carleton is a title that has been created three times in British history , once in the Peerage of Ireland and twice in the Peerage of Great Britain . The first creation came in the Peerage of England in 1626 when Sir Dudley Carleton was made Baron Carleton , of Imbercourt in the County of Surrey . He was made Viscount Dorchester two years later . See the article on him for more information on this creation . Dudley Carleton was the first cousin of Sir John Carleton , 1st Baronet ( see Carleton baronets ) . The second creation came in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1714 when Henry Boyle was made Baron Carleton , of Carleton in the County of York . He was the son of Charles Boyle , 3rd Viscount Dungarvan and the brother of Charles Boyle , 2nd Earl of Burlington ( see Earl of Cork for earlier history of the family ) . The title became extinct upon his death in 1725 . The third creation came in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1786 when Richard Boyle , 2nd Earl of Shannon was made Baron Carleton , of Carleton in the County of York , which entitled him to a seat in the House of Lords . Lord Shannon was the first cousin of the first holder of the 1714 creation ( through his mother Lady Henrietta Boyle , sister of Charles Boyle , 3rd Viscount Dungarvan ) , as well as a third cousin on his father 's side . The barony and earldom have remained united since . See Earl of Shannon for further history of the titles .",
  "/wiki/Baron_Cobham": "The title Baron Cobham has been created numerous times in the Peerage of England ; often multiple creations have been extant simultaneously , especially in the fourteenth century . The earliest creation was in 1313 for Henry de Cobham , 1st Baron Cobham , lord of the manors of Cobham and of Cooling , both in the county of Kent . The de Cobham family died out in the male line in 1408 , with the death of the 3rd Baron Cobham , but the title continued via a female line to the Brooke family ( anciently de la Brook or At-Brook ) , which originated at the estate of la Brook near Ilchester in Somerset , and which later resided at Holditch in the parish of Thorncombe and at Weycroft in the parish of Axminster , both in Devon , both fortified manor houses . Following their inheritance the Brooke family resided at Cobham Hall and Cooling Castle in Kent . Henry Brooke , 11th Baron Cobham was attainted in 1603 , when the peerage became abeyant instead of becoming extinct . In 1916 the attainder was removed and the abeyance terminated in favor of the fifteenth baron . The twelfth to fourteenth barons never actually held the title . This creation became abeyant again in 1951 . The second creation was in 1324 , when Sir Ralph de Cobham was summoned to parliament as Baron Cobham . The history of this creation is unknown following the death of the 2nd baron in or after 1378 . The third creation was in 1326 , when Sir Stephen de Cobham was summoned to parliament , again as Baron Cobham . This Cobham came from Rundale , and was apparently of no relation to Sir Ralph .",

[ note 1 ] The creation of such titles came to an end in the 19th century . The ranks of the Irish peerage are duke , marquess , earl , viscount and baron .

Following that year 's Treaty of Union , the Kingdom of Scots and the Kingdom of England were combined under the name of Great Britain , and a new Peerage of Great Britain was introduced in which subsequent titles were created . After the Union , the Peers of the ancient Parliament of Scotland elected 16 representative peers to sit in the House of Lords . The Peerage Act 1963 granted all Scottish Peers the right to sit in the House of Lords , but this automatic right was revoked , as for all hereditary peerages ( except those of the incumbent Earl Marshal and Lord Great Chamberlain ) , when the House of Lords Act 1999 received royal assent . Had the Scottish people voted Yes in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum , the eligibility of Peers of Scotland to sit in the House of Lords would have been reviewed . Unlike most peerages , many Scottish titles have been granted with remainder to pass via female offspring ( thus an Italian family has succeeded to and presently holds the earldom of Newburgh ) , and in the case of daughters only , these titles devolve to the eldest daughter rather than falling into abeyance ( as is the case with ancient English baronies by writ of summons ) . Unlike other British peerage titles , Scots Law permits peerages to be inherited by or through a person who was not legitimate at birth , but was subsequently legitimised by their parents marrying later .
