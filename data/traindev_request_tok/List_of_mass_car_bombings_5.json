  "/wiki/Year": "A year is the orbital period of the Earth moving in its orbit around the Sun . Due to the Earth 's axial tilt , the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons , marked by change in weather , the hours of daylight , and , consequently , vegetation and soil fertility . In temperate and subpolar regions around the planet , four seasons are generally recognized : spring , summer , autumn , and winter . In tropical and subtropical regions , several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons ; but in the seasonal tropics , the annual wet and dry seasons are recognized and tracked . A calendar year is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth 's orbital period as counted in a given calendar . The Gregorian calendar , or modern calendar , presents its calendar year to be either a common year of 365 days or a leap year of 366 days , as do the Julian calendars ; see below . For the Gregorian calendar , the average length of the calendar year ( the mean year ) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days . The ISO standard ISO 80000-3 , Annex C , supports the symbol a ( for Latin annus ) to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days . In English , the abbreviations y and yr are commonly used . In astronomy , the Julian year is a unit of time ; it is defined as 365.25 days of exactly 86,400 seconds ( SI base unit ) , totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year . The word year is also used for periods loosely associated with , but not identical to , the calendar or astronomical year , such as the seasonal year , the fiscal year , the academic year , etc . Similarly , year can mean the orbital period of any planet ; for example , a Martian year and a Venusian year are examples of the time a planet takes to transit one complete orbit .",
  "/wiki/Month": "A month is a unit of time , used with calendars , which is approximately as long as a natural period related to the motion of the Moon ; month and Moon are cognates . The traditional concept arose with the cycle of Moon phases ; such months ( lunations ) are synodic months and last approximately 29.53 days . From excavated tally sticks , researchers have deduced that people counted days in relation to the Moon 's phases as early as the Paleolithic age . Synodic months , based on the Moon 's orbital period with respect to the Earth-Sun line , are still the basis of many calendars today , and are used to divide the year .",
  "/wiki/Day": "A day is approximately the period of time during which the Earth completes one rotation around its axis . A solar day is the length of time which elapses between the Sun reaching its highest point in the sky two consecutive times . Days on other planets are defined similarly and vary in length due to differing rotation periods , that of Mars being slightly longer and sometimes called a sol . In 1960 , the second was redefined in terms of the orbital motion of the Earth in the year 1900 , and was designated the SI base unit of time . The unit of measurement day , was redefined as 86,400 SI seconds and symbolized d. In 1967 , the second and so the day were redefined by atomic electron transition . A civil day is usually 86,400 seconds , plus or minus a possible leap second in Coordinated Universal Time ( UTC ) , and occasionally plus or minus an hour in those locations that change from or to daylight saving time . Day can be defined as each of the twenty-four-hour periods , reckoned from one midnight to the next , into which a week , month , or year is divided , and corresponding to a rotation of the earth on its axis . However , its use depends on its context ; for example , when people say 'day and night ' , 'day ' will have a different meaning : the interval of light between two successive nights , the time between sunrise and sunset ; the time of light between one night and the next . For clarity when meaning 'day ' in that sense , the word daytime may be used instead , though context and phrasing often makes the meaning clear . The word day may also refer to a day of the week or to a calendar date , as in answer to the question , On which day ? The life patterns ( circadian rhythms ) of humans and many other species are related to Earth 's solar day and the day-night cycle .",
  "/wiki/South_Vietnam": "South Vietnam , officially the Republic of Vietnam ( RVN ; Vietnamese : Vi\u1ec7t Nam C\u1ed9ng H\u00f2a ; French : R\u00e9publique du Vi\u00eat Nam ) , was a country that existed from 1955 to 1975 , the period when the southern portion of Vietnam was a member of the Western Bloc during part of the Cold War . It received international recognition in 1949 as the State of Vietnam ( a self-governing entity in the French Empire ) , which was a constitutional monarchy ( 1949-1955 ) . The country was renamed the Republic of Vietnam in 1955 . Its capital was Saigon ( now Ho Chi Minh City ) . South Vietnam was bordered by North Vietnam to the north , Laos to the northwest , Cambodia to the southwest , Thailand across the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest , and the Philippines , Malaysia , Brunei , and Indonesia across the South China Sea to the east and southeast . The Republic of Vietnam was proclaimed on 26 October 1955 , with Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m as its first president , after having briefly served as premier under Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i who was exiled . Its sovereignty was recognized by the United States and 87 other nations . It had membership in several special committees of the United Nations , but its application for full membership was rejected in 1957 because of a Soviet veto ( neither South nor North Vietnam were members of the UN during the Vietnam War , but the united Vietnam became a member state in 1977 ) . South Vietnam 's origins can be traced to the French colony of Cochinchina , which consisted of the southern third of Vietnam which was Cochinchina [ Nam K\u1ef3 ] , a subdivision of French Indochina , and the southern half of Central Vietnam or Annam [ Trung K\u1ef3 ] which was a French protectorate . After the Second World War , the anti-Japanese Vi\u1ec7t Minh guerrilla forces , led by Ho Chi Minh , proclaimed the establishment of a Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Hanoi in September 1945 , issuing a Declaration of Independence modeled on the US one from 1776 . In 1949 , anti-communist Vietnamese politicians formed a rival government in Saigon led by former emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i . B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was deposed by Prime Minister Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m in 1955 , who proclaimed himself president after a referendum .",
  "/wiki/US_Embassy,_Saigon": "The United States Embassy in Saigon was first established in June 1952 , and moved into a new building in 1967 and eventually closed in 1975 . The embassy was the scene of a number of significant events of the Vietnam War , most notably the Viet Cong attack during the Tet Offensive which helped turn American public opinion against the war , and the helicopter evacuation during the Fall of Saigon after which the embassy closed permanently . In 1995 , the U.S. and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam formally established relations and the embassy grounds and building were handed back to the United States . The former embassy was subsequently demolished in 1998 and is currently a park inside of the U.S. Consulate General 's compound in what is now called Ho Chi Minh City .",

  "/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine": "Mandatory Palestine [ a ] P\u0101l\u0113\u015bt\u012bn\u0101 ( EY ) , where EY indicates Eretz Yisrael Land of Israel ) was a geopolitical entity established between 1920 and 1948 in the region of Palestine under the terms of the Mandate for Palestine . During the First World War ( 1914-18 ) , an Arab uprising and the British Empire 's Egyptian Expeditionary Force under General Edmund Allenby drove the Turks out of the Levant during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign . The United Kingdom had agreed in the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence that it would honour Arab independence if they revolted against the Ottomans , but the two sides had different interpretations of this agreement , and in the end , the UK and France divided up the area under the Sykes-Picot Agreement - an act of betrayal in the eyes of the Arabs . Further complicating the issue was the Balfour Declaration of 1917 , promising British support for a Jewish national home in Palestine . At the war 's end the British and French set up a joint Occupied Enemy Territory Administration in what had been Ottoman Syria . The British achieved legitimacy for their continued control by obtaining a mandate from the League of Nations in June 1922 . The formal objective of the League of Nations mandate system was to administer parts of the defunct Ottoman Empire , which had been in control of the Middle East since the 16th century , until such time as they are able to stand alone . During the British Mandate period the area experienced the ascent of two major nationalist movements , one among the Jews and the other among the Palestinian Arabs . The competing national interests of the two populations against each other and against the governing British authorities matured into the Arab Revolt of 1936-1939 and the Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine , before culminating in the 1947-1949 Palestine war . This led to the establishment of the 1949 cease-fire agreement , with partition of the former Mandatory Palestine between the newborn state of Israel with a Jewish majority , the Arab West Bank annexed by the Jordanian Kingdom and the Arab All-Palestine Protectorate in the Gaza Strip under Egypt .",
  "/wiki/Jerusalem": "Jerusalem [ note 2 ] is a city in the Middle East , located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea . It is one of the oldest cities in the world , and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions - Judaism , Christianity , and Islam . Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority claim Jerusalem as their capital , as Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there and the State of Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power ; however , neither claim is widely recognized internationally . [ note 3 ] During its long history , Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice , besieged 23 times , captured and recaptured 44 times , and attacked 52 times . The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE , in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds . Jerusalem was named as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets , probably meaning City of Shalem after a Canaanite deity , during the Canaanite period ( 14th century BCE ) . During the Israelite period , significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE ( Iron Age II ) , and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah . In 1538 , the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent . Today those walls define the Old City , which has been traditionally divided into four quarters - known since the early 19th century as the Armenian , Christian , Jewish , and Muslim Quarters . The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981 , and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger . Since 1860 Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City 's boundaries . In 2015 , Jerusalem had a population of some 850,000 residents , comprising approximately 200,000 secular Jewish Israelis , 350,000 Haredi Jews and 300,000 Palestinians .",

  "/wiki/Suicide_bombing": "A suicide attack is any violent attack in which the attacker accepts their own death as a direct result of the method used to harm , damage , or destroy the target . Suicide attacks have occurred throughout history , often as part of a military campaign such as the Japanese kamikaze pilots of World War II , and more recently as part of terrorist campaigns , such as the September 11 attacks . While there were few , if any , successful suicide attacks anywhere in the world from the end of World War II until 1980 , between 1981 and September 2015 , a total of 4,814 suicide attacks occurred in over 40 countries , killing over 45,000 people . During this time the global rate of such attacks grew from an average of three a year in the 1980s , to about one a month in the 1990s , to almost one a week from 2001 to 2003 , to approximately one a day from 2003 to 2015 . Suicide attacks tend to be more deadly and destructive than other terror attacks because they give their perpetrators the ability to conceal weapons , make last-minute adjustments , and because they dispense with the need for remote or delayed detonation , escape plans or rescue teams . They constituted only 4% of all terrorist attacks around the world over one period ( between 1981 and 2006 ) , but caused 32% of all terrorism-related deaths ( 14,599 ) . Ninety percent of those attacks occurred in Afghanistan , Iraq , Israel , the Palestinian territories , Pakistan , and Sri Lanka . Overall , as of mid-2015 about three-quarters of all suicide attacks occurred in just three countries : Afghanistan , Pakistan , and Iraq . Suicide attacks have been described as a weapon of psychological warfare to instill fear in the target population , a strategy to eliminate or at least drastically diminish areas where the public feels safe , and the fabric of trust that holds societies together , as well as demonstrate the lengths to which perpetrators will go to achieve their goals . The motivation of suicide attackers varies . Kamikaze acted under military orders and were motivated by obedience and nationalism . Before 2003 , most attacks targeted forces occupying the attackers ' homeland , according to analyst Robert Pape .",
