It is located on the grounds of Shuri Castle in Naha , Okinawa , a few paces away from the Shureimon castle gate . The utaki , or more specifically its stone gate ( \u77f3\u9580 , ishimon ) , is one of a number of sites which together comprise the UNESCO World Heritage Site officially described as Gusuku Sites and Related Properties of the Kingdom of Ryukyu , and has been designated an Important Cultural Property by the Japanese national government . While the gates were once opened only for the king , today they are always closed , and so the gates have in a way become a sacred space themselves , representative of the actual sacred space behind them . Many travellers and locals come to pray at the gates . The stone gate was first built in 1519 , during the reign of Ryukyuan king Sh\u014d Shin , though the space had been recognized as a sacred utaki prior to that . Whenever the king left the castle on a journey , he would first stop at Sonohyan-utaki to pray for safe travels . The site also played an important role in the initiation of the High Priestess ( \u805e\u5f97\u5927\u541b , kikoe-\u014dgimi ) of the native religion . The gate is said to be a prime example of traditional Okinawan architecture , and shows many signs of Chinese influence , along with a Japanese-influenced gable in the karahafu style . It was severely damaged in the 1945 battle of Okinawa , but was restored in 1957 , and officially designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000 , along with a number of other sites across Okinawa Island .

  "/wiki/Pacific_War": "The Pacific War , sometimes called the Asia-Pacific War , was the theater of World War II that was fought in the Pacific and Asia . It was geographically the largest theater of the war , including the vast Pacific Ocean theater , the South West Pacific theater , the South-East Asian theater , the Second Sino-Japanese War , and the Soviet-Japanese War . The Second Sino-Japanese War between the Empire of Japan and the Republic of China had been in progress since 7 July 1937 , with hostilities dating back as far as 19 September 1931 with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria . However , it is more widely accepted [ g ] that the Pacific War itself began on 7/8 December 1941 , when the Japanese invaded Thailand and attacked the British colonies of Malaya , Singapore , and Hong Kong as well as the United States military and naval bases in Hawaii , Wake Island , Guam , and the Philippines . The Pacific War saw the Allies pitted against Japan , the latter aided by Thailand and to a lesser extent by the Axis allies , Germany and Italy . The war culminated in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , and other large aerial bomb attacks by the Allies , accompanied by the Soviet Union 's declaration of war and invasion of Manchuria and other territories on 9 August 1945 , resulting in the Japanese announcement of intent to surrender on 15 August 1945 . The formal surrender of Japan ceremony took place aboard the battleship USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945 . After the war , Japan lost all rights and titles to its former possessions in Asia and the Pacific , and its sovereignty was limited to the four main home islands and other minor islands as determined by the Allies . Japan 's Shinto Emperor relinquished much of his authority and his divine status through the Shinto Directive in order to pave the way for extensive cultural and political reforms .",

  "/wiki/Climbing_kiln": "The anagama kiln ( Japanese : \u7a96\u7aaf ) is an ancient type of pottery kiln brought to Japan from China via Korea in the 5th century . It is a version of the climbing dragon kiln of south China , whose further development was also copied , for example in breaking up the firing space into a series of chambers in the noborigama kiln . An anagama ( a Japanese term meaning cave kiln ) consists of a firing chamber with a firebox at one end and a flue at the other . Although the term firebox is used to describe the space for the fire , there is no physical structure separating the stoking space from the pottery space . The term anagama describes single-chamber kilns built in a sloping tunnel shape . In fact , ancient kilns were sometimes built by digging tunnels into banks of clay . The anagama is fueled with firewood , in contrast to the electric or gas-fueled kilns commonly used by most contemporary potters . A continuous supply of fuel is needed for firing , as wood thrown into the hot kiln is consumed very rapidly . Stoking occurs round the clock until a variety of variables are achieved including the way the fired pots look inside the kiln , the temperatures reached and sustained , the amount of ash applied , the wetness of the walls and the pots , etc . Burning wood not only produces heat of up to 1400\u00b0C ( 2,500 \u00b0F ) , it also produces fly ash and volatile salts . Wood ash settles on the pieces during the firing , and the complex interaction between flame , ash , and the minerals of the clay body forms a natural ash glaze . This glaze may show great variation in color , texture , and thickness , ranging from smooth and glossy to rough and sharp .",

  "/wiki/Meiji_period": "The Meiji era ( \u660e\u6cbb , Meiji , Japanese pronunciation : [ me\ua71c\u02d0 ( d ) \u0291i ] ) is an era of Japanese history which extended from October 23 , 1868 to July 30 , 1912 . This era represents the first half of the Empire of Japan , during which period the Japanese people moved from being an isolated feudal society at risk of colonisation by European powers to the new paradigm of a modern , industrialised nation state and emergent great power , influenced by Western scientific , technological , philosophical , political , legal , and aesthetic ideas . As a result of such wholesale adoption of radically-different ideas , the changes to Japan were profound , and affected its social structure , internal politics , economy , military , and foreign relations . The period corresponded to the reign of Emperor Meiji and was succeeded upon the accession of Emperor Taish\u014d by the Taish\u014d era .",

  "/wiki/Awamori": "Awamori ( \u6ce1\u76db , Okinawan : \u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u30a4 , aamui ) is an alcoholic beverage indigenous and unique to Okinawa , Japan . It is made from long grain indica rice , and is not a direct product of brewing ( like sake ) but of distillation ( like sh\u014dch\u016b ) . All awamori made today is from indica rice imported from Thailand , the local production not being sufficient to meet domestic demand . Awamori is typically 60-86 proof ( 30-43% alcohol ) , although export brands ( including brands shipped to mainland Japan ) are increasingly 50 proof ( 25% alcohol ) . Some brands ( notably hanazake ) are 120 proof ( 60% ) and are flammable . Awamori is aged in traditional clay pots to improve its flavor and mellowness . The most popular way to drink awamori is with water and ice . When served in a restaurant in Okinawa , it will nearly always be accompanied by a container of ice and carafe of water . Awamori can also be drunk straight , on the rocks , and in cocktails . Traditionally , awamori was served in a kara-kara , a small earthen vessel with a small clay marble inside . The marble would make a distinctive kara-kara sound to let people know the vessel was empty . These vessels are still found in Okinawa , but the clay marbles are often absent ."
