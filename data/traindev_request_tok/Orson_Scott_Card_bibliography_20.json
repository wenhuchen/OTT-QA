As in all role-playing games or RPGs , the player assumes the role of a character ( often in a fantasy world or science-fiction world ) and takes control over many of that character 's actions . MMORPGs are distinguished from single-player or small multi-player online RPGs by the number of players able to interact together , and by the game 's persistent world ( usually hosted by the game 's publisher ) , which continues to exist and evolve while the player is offline and away from the game . MMORPGs are played throughout the world . Worldwide revenues for MMORPGs exceeded half a billion dollars in 2005 , and Western revenues exceeded a billion dollars in 2006 . In 2008 , the spending on subscription MMORPGs by consumers in North America and Europe grew to $ 1.4 billion .

  "/wiki/Video_game": "A video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a two- or three-dimensional video display device such as a touchscreen , virtual reality headset or monitor/TV set . Since the 1980s , video games have become an increasingly important part of the entertainment industry , and whether they are also a form of art is a matter of dispute . The electronic systems used to play video games are called platforms . Video games are developed and released for one or several platforms and may not be available on others . Specialized platforms such as arcade games , which present the game in a large , typically coin-operated chassis , were common in the 1980s in video arcades , but declined in popularity as other , more affordable platforms became available . These include dedicated devices such as video game consoles , as well as general-purpose computers like a laptop , desktop or handheld computing devices . The input device used for games , the game controller , varies across platforms . Common controllers include gamepads , joysticks , mouse devices , keyboards , the touchscreens of mobile devices , or even a person 's body , using a Kinect sensor . Players view the game on a display device such as a television or computer monitor or sometimes on virtual reality head-mounted display goggles . There are often game sound effects , music and voice actor lines which come from loudspeakers or headphones . Some games in the 2000s include haptic , vibration-creating effects , force feedback peripherals and virtual reality headsets . Since the 2010s , the commercial importance of the video game industry has been increasing .",

As a seventh generation console , the PSP primarily competed with the Nintendo DS . Development of the PSP was announced during E3 2003 , and the console was unveiled at a Sony press conference on May 11 , 2004 . The system was the most powerful portable console when it was introduced , and was the first real competitor of Nintendo 's handheld consoles after many challengers , such as SNK 's Neo Geo Pocket and Nokia 's N-Gage , had failed . The PSP 's advanced graphics capabilities made it a popular mobile entertainment device , which could connect to the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 consoles , computers running Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh software , other PSP systems , and the Internet . The PSP is the only handheld console to use an optical disc format - Universal Media Disc ( UMD ) - as its primary storage medium . The PSP was received positively by critics , and sold over 80 million units during its ten-year lifetime . Several models of the console were released , before the PSP line was succeeded by the PlayStation Vita , released in Japan in 2011 and worldwide a year later . The Vita has backward compatibility with PSP games that were released on the PlayStation Network through the PlayStation Store , which became the main method of purchasing PSP games after Sony shut down access to the store from the PSP on March 31 , 2016 . Hardware shipments of the PSP ended worldwide in 2014 ; production of UMDs ended when the last Japanese factory producing them closed in late 2016 .",

  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

It is classified as a sixth generation console , competing with Sony 's PlayStation 2 and Nintendo 's GameCube . It was also the first major console produced by an American company since the Atari Jaguar ceased production in 1996 . Announced in 2000 , the Xbox was graphically powerful compared to its rivals , featuring a 733 MHz Intel Pentium III processor , a processor that could be found on a standard PC . It was also noted for its PC-like size and weight , and was the first console to feature a built-in hard disk . In November 2002 , Microsoft launched Xbox Live , a fee-based online gaming service that enabled subscribers to download new content and connect with other players through a broadband connection . Unlike online services from Sega and Sony , Xbox Live had support in the original console design through an integrated Ethernet port . The service gave Microsoft an early foothold in online gaming and would help the Xbox become a competitor in the sixth-generation of consoles . The popularity of blockbuster titles such as Bungie 's Halo 2 contributed to the popularity of online console gaming , and in particular first-person shooters . The Xbox had a record-breaking launch in North America , selling 1.5 million units before the end of 2001 , aided by the popularity of one of the system 's launch titles , Halo : Combat Evolved , which sold a million units by April 2002 . The system went on to sell a worldwide total of 24 million units , including 16 million in North America ; however , Microsoft was unable to make a steady profit off of the console , which had a manufacturing price far more expensive than its retail price , despite its popularity , losing over $ 4 billion during its market life .",

He is an exceptionally skilful wizard whose coldly sarcastic and controlled exterior conceals deep emotions and anguish . A Professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , Snape is hostile to Harry due to his resemblance to his father James , who bullied Snape during their time at Hogwarts . Snape 's character becomes more layered and enigmatic as the series progresses , and a central mystery concerns his loyalties . Snape dies at the hands of Lord Voldemort in the seventh book , at which time his back story is revealed . Though attracted to the Dark Arts and Voldemort 's ideology of wizard supremacy , Snape 's love for Muggle-born Lily Evans , Harry 's mother , eventually compelled him to defect from the Death Eaters and become a double agent for Albus Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix . The fact that Lily chose James Potter , Harry 's father who had bullied Snape and to whom Harry bears a strong physical resemblance , only fuels Snape 's hostility towards Harry . The character has been widely acclaimed by readers and critics . Rowling described him as a gift of a character whose story she had known since the first book , and Elizabeth Hand of The Washington Post opined that Snape 's life is the most heartbreaking , surprising and satisfying of all of Rowling 's achievements .

The game uses a combination of drawn two-dimensional artwork and limited , pre-rendered three-dimensional movies , with the latter created by Industrial Light & Magic . The game is inspired by an idea originally created for Steven Spielberg 's Amazing Stories series .

The game was conceived in 1988 by Lucasfilm employee Ron Gilbert , who designed it with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman . Gilbert 's frustrations with contemporary adventure titles led him to make the player character 's death almost impossible , which meant that gameplay focused the game on exploration . The atmosphere was based on that of the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride . The Secret of Monkey Island was the fifth game built with the SCUMM engine , which was heavily modified to include a more user-friendly interface . The early releases of the game came with copy-protection . A cardboard wheel , named Dial-a-Pirate , was provided , and the player had to match the pirate shown on-screen with that of the wheel .
