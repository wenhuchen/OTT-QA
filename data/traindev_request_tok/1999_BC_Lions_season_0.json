This has resulted in the development of three platoons of players : the offense ( the team with the ball , which is trying to score ) , the defense ( the team trying to prevent the other team from scoring , and to take the ball from them ) , and the special teams ( who play in kicking situations ) . Within those platoons , various specific positions exist depending on what each player 's main job is .",
