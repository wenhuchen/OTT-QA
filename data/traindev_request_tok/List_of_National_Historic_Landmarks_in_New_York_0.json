  "/wiki/Niagara_Falls,_New_York": "Niagara Falls is a city in Niagara County , New York , United States . As of the 2010 census , the city had a total population of 50,193 , down from the 55,593 recorded in the 2000 census . It is adjacent to the Niagara River , across from the city of Niagara Falls , Ontario , and named after the famed Niagara Falls which they share . The city is within the Buffalo-Niagara Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Western New York region . While the city was formerly occupied by Native Americans , Europeans who migrated to the Niagara Falls in the mid-17th century began to open businesses and develop infrastructure . Later in the 18th and 19th centuries , scientists and businessmen began harnessing the power of the Niagara River for electricity and the city began to attract manufacturers and other businesses drawn by the promise of inexpensive hydroelectric power . After the 1960s , however , the city and region witnessed an economic decline , following an attempt at urban renewal under then Mayor Lackey . Consistent with the rest of the Rust Belt as industries left the city , old line affluent families relocated to nearby suburbs and out of town . Despite the decline in heavy industry , Niagara Falls State Park and the downtown area closest to the falls continue to thrive as a result of tourism . The population , however , has continued to decline from a peak of 102,394 in the 1960s due to the loss of manufacturing jobs in the area .",

The largest of the three is Horseshoe Falls , also known as Canadian Falls , which straddles the international border between Canada and the United States . The smaller American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls lie entirely within the United States . Bridal Veil Falls are separated from Horseshoe Falls by Goat Island and from American Falls by Luna Island , with both islands situated in New York as well . Located on the Niagara River , which drains Lake Erie into Lake Ontario , the combined falls have the highest flow rate of any waterfall in North America that has a vertical drop of more than 50 metres ( 160 ft ) . During peak daytime tourist hours , more than 168,000 m3 ( six million cubic feet ) of water goes over the crest of the falls every minute . Horseshoe Falls is the most powerful waterfall in North America , as measured by flow rate . The falls are 27 kilometres ( 17 mi ) north-northwest of Buffalo , New York , and 121 kilometres ( 75 mi ) south-southeast of Toronto , between the twin cities of Niagara Falls , Ontario , and Niagara Falls , New York . Niagara Falls was formed when glaciers receded at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation ( the last ice age ) , and water from the newly formed Great Lakes carved a path through the Niagara Escarpment en route to the Atlantic Ocean . Niagara Falls is famed both for its beauty and as a valuable source of hydroelectric power . Balancing recreational , commercial , and industrial uses has been a challenge for the stewards of the falls since the 19th century .",
  "/wiki/Adirondack_Park": "The Adirondack Park is a part of New York 's Forest Preserve in northeastern New York , United States . The park 's boundary corresponds with the Adirondack Mountains .

  "/wiki/Upstate_New_York": "Upstate New York is the portion of the American state of New York lying north of the New York metropolitan area . The Upstate region includes most of the land area of the state of New York , but a minority of the state 's population .

Major cities in Upstate New York , from east to west , include Albany , Utica , Binghamton , Syracuse , Rochester , and Buffalo . Before the American Revolutionary War , Upstate was populated by Native Americans and was home to the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy . The region saw many battles between the Continental Army and the Iroquois , and several treaties drawn up after the war ceded much of the land to settlers of European descent . It is largely rural with rugged terrain . Upstate New York was transformed by the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 , which greatly eased the movement of goods from the upper midwest , the cities along the Great Lakes , and Upstate New York , to the port of New York City . As a result , Upstate became a hotbed for manufacturing , giving birth to such firms as General Electric , IBM , Kodak , and Xerox , and it welcomed a large influx of immigrants . Since the mid-20th century , American de-industrialization has contributed to economic and population decline Upstate , and the region is largely considered part of the Rust Belt . Upstate New York contains vast areas of rural land . As a result , Upstate also supports a strong agricultural industry , and is notable for its milk and other dairy products , its fruit production ( especially apples ) , and winemaking .",

Anthony ( February 15 , 1820 - March 13 , 1906 ) was an American social reformer and women 's rights activist who played a pivotal role in the women 's suffrage movement . Born into a Quaker family committed to social equality , she collected anti-slavery petitions at the age of 17 . In 1856 , she became the New York state agent for the American Anti-Slavery Society . In 1851 , she met Elizabeth Cady Stanton , who became her lifelong friend and co-worker in social reform activities , primarily in the field of women 's rights . In 1852 , they founded the New York Women 's State Temperance Society after Anthony was prevented from speaking at a temperance conference because she was female . In 1863 , they founded the Women 's Loyal National League , which conducted the largest petition drive in United States history up to that time , collecting nearly 400,000 signatures in support of the abolition of slavery . In 1866 , they initiated the American Equal Rights Association , which campaigned for equal rights for both women and African Americans . In 1868 , they began publishing a women 's rights newspaper called The Revolution . In 1869 , they founded the National Woman Suffrage Association as part of a split in the women 's movement . In 1890 , the split was formally healed when their organization merged with the rival American Woman Suffrage Association to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association , with Anthony as its key force . In 1876 , Anthony and Stanton began working with Matilda Joslyn Gage on what eventually grew into the six-volume History of Woman Suffrage . The interests of Anthony and Stanton diverged somewhat in later years , but the two remained close friends .",

The elegantly proportioned Tempietto was built in the form of a Tholos , an ancient classical temple , which complimented Americas third quarter of the 19th century fascination with classical forms The house was built in 1859-1860 by financier Paul J. Armour based on the architectural ideas of Orson Squire Fowler , the author of The Octagon House : A Home for All Occasions . Fowler believed that octagonal houses enclosed more space , provided more interior sunlight , and that its rooms were easily accessible to each other . The architect of the house is unknown . It is the only known octagonal house based on the domed colonnade shape of a Roman temple . The dome was added and the house was enlarged during 1872-1876 by Joseph Stiner , who was a tea importer .

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Bennington": "The Battle of Bennington was a battle of the American Revolutionary War , part of the Saratoga campaign , that took place on August 16 , 1777 , in Walloomsac , New York , about 10 miles ( 16 km ) from its namesake Bennington , Vermont . A rebel force of 2,000 men , primarily New Hampshire and Massachusetts militiamen , led by General John Stark , and reinforced by Vermont militiamen led by Colonel Seth Warner and members of the Green Mountain Boys , decisively defeated a detachment of General John Burgoyne 's army led by Lieutenant Colonel Friedrich Baum , and supported by additional men under Lieutenant Colonel Heinrich von Breymann . Baum 's detachment was a mixed force of 700 , composed primarily of Hessians but also including smaller numbers of dismounted Brunswick dragoons , Canadians , Loyalists and Indians . He was sent by Burgoyne to raid Bennington in the disputed New Hampshire Grants area for horses , draft animals , provisions , and other supplies . Believing the town to be only lightly defended , Burgoyne and Baum were unaware that Stark and 1,500 militiamen were stationed there . After a rain-caused standoff , Stark 's men enveloped Baum 's position , taking many prisoners , and killing Baum . Reinforcements for both sides arrived as Stark and his men were mopping up , and the battle restarted , with Warner and Stark driving away Breymann 's reinforcements with heavy casualties . The battle was a major strategic success for the American cause and is considered part of the turning point of the Revolutionary War ; it reduced Burgoyne 's army in size by almost 1,000 men , led his Native-American support to largely abandon him , and deprived him of much-needed supplies , such as mounts for his cavalry regiments , draft animals and provisions , all factors that contributed to Burgoyne 's eventual defeat at Saratoga . The victory galvanized colonial support for the independence movement , and played a key role in bringing France into the war on the rebel side . The battle 's anniversary is celebrated in the state of Vermont as Bennington Battle Day .",
  "/wiki/Dragoons": "Dragoons originally were a class of mounted infantry , who used horses for mobility , but dismounted to fight on foot . From the early 18th century onward , dragoons were increasingly also employed as conventional cavalry , trained for combat with swords from horseback . Dragoon regiments were established in most European armies during the late 17th and early 18th centuries .

The title has been retained in modern times by a number of armoured or ceremonial mounted regiments .",
  "/wiki/Continental_Army": "The Continental Army was formed by the Second Continental Congress after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War by the ex-British colonies that became the United States of America . Established by a resolution of the Congress on June 14 , 1775 , it was created to coordinate the military efforts of the Thirteen Colonies in their revolt against the rule of Great Britain . The Continental Army was supplemented by local militias and volunteer troops that remained under control of the individual states or were otherwise independent . General George Washington was the commander-in-chief of the army throughout the war . Most of the Continental Army was disbanded in 1783 after the Treaty of Paris formally ended the war . The 1st and 2nd Regiments went on to form the nucleus of the Legion of the United States in 1792 under General Anthony Wayne . This became the foundation of the United States Army in 1796 .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Saratoga": "The Battles of Saratoga ( September 19 and October 7 , 1777 ) marked the climax of the Saratoga campaign , giving a decisive victory to the Americans over the British in the American Revolutionary War . British General John Burgoyne led a large invasion army southward from Canada in the Champlain Valley , hoping to meet a similar British force marching northward from New York City and another British force marching eastward from Lake Ontario ; the southern and western forces never arrived , and Burgoyne was surrounded by American forces in upstate New York . He fought two small battles to break out which took place 18 days apart on the same ground , 9 miles ( 14 km ) south of Saratoga , New York . They both failed . Burgoyne found himself trapped by superior American forces with no relief , so he retreated to Saratoga ( now Schuylerville ) and surrendered his entire army there on October 17 . His surrender , says historian Edmund Morgan , was a great turning point of the war because it won for Americans the foreign assistance which was the last element needed for victory . Burgoyne 's strategy to divide New England from the southern colonies had started well but slowed due to logistical problems . He won a small tactical victory over General Horatio Gates and the Continental Army in the September 19 Battle of Freeman 's Farm at the cost of significant casualties . His gains were erased when he again attacked the Americans in the October 7 Battle of Bemis Heights and the Americans captured a portion of the British defenses . Burgoyne was therefore compelled to retreat , and his army was surrounded by the much larger American force at Saratoga , forcing him to surrender on October 17 . News of Burgoyne 's surrender was instrumental in formally bringing France into the war as an American ally , although it had previously given supplies , ammunition , and guns , notably the de Valliere cannon which played an important role in Saratoga . This battle also resulted in Spain joining France in the war against Britain .",

  "/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States": "Abolitionism ( or the Anti-Slavery Movement ) in the United States of America was the movement which sought to end slavery in the United States immediately , active both before and during the American Civil War . In the Americas and western Europe , abolitionism was a movement which sought to end the Atlantic slave trade and set slaves free . In the 17th century , enlightenment thinkers condemned slavery on humanistic grounds and English Quakers and some Evangelical denominations condemned slavery as un-Christian . At that time , most slaves were Africans , but thousands of Native Americans were also enslaved . In the 18th century , as many as six million Africans were transported to the Americas as slaves , at least a third of them on British ships to North America . The colony of Georgia originally prohibited slavery within its territory , and thereafter , abolition was part of the message of the First Great Awakening of the 1730s and 1740s in the Thirteen Colonies . During the Age of Enlightenment rationalist thinkers criticized slavery for violating people 's natural rights . A member of the British Parliament , James Edward Oglethorpe , was among the first to articulate the Enlightenment case against slavery . The founder of the Province of Georgia , Oglethorpe banned slavery on humanistic grounds . He argued against it in Parliament and eventually encouraged his friends Granville Sharp and Hannah More to vigorously pursue the cause . Soon after his death in 1785 , Sharp and More joined with William Wilberforce and others in forming the Clapham Sect . Although anti-slavery sentiments were widespread by the late 18th century , many colonies , churches , and emerging nations ( notably in the southern United States ) continued to use and defend the traditions of slavery .",

In May 1856 , Brown and his supporters killed five supporters of slavery in the Pottawatomie massacre , which responded to the sacking of Lawrence by pro-slavery forces . Brown then commanded anti-slavery forces at the Battle of Black Jack ( June 2 ) and the Battle of Osawatomie ( August 30 , 1856 ) . In October 1859 , Brown led a raid on the federal armory at Harpers Ferry , Virginia ( today West Virginia ) , intending to start a slave liberation movement that would spread south through the mountainous regions of Virginia and North Carolina ; there was a draft constitution for the state he hoped to establish . He seized the armory , but seven people were killed , and ten or more were injured . He intended to arm slaves with weapons from the arsenal , but only a small number of local slaves joined his revolt . Within 36 hours , those of Brown 's men who had not fled were killed or captured by local farmers , militiamen , and US Marines , the latter led by Robert E. Lee .

The Buffalo area was inhabited before the 17th century by the Native American Iroquois tribe and later by French colonizers . The city grew significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of immigration , the construction of the Erie Canal and rail transportation , and its close proximity to Lake Erie . This growth provided an abundance of fresh water and an ample trade route to the Midwestern United States while grooming its economy for the grain , steel and automobile industries that dominated the city 's economy in the 20th century . Since the city 's economy relied heavily on manufacturing , deindustrialization in the latter half of the 20th century led to a steady decline in population . While some manufacturing activity remains , Buffalo 's economy has transitioned to service industries with a greater emphasis on healthcare , research and higher education , which emerged following the Great Recession . Buffalo is on the eastern shore of Lake Erie , at the head of the Niagara River , 16 miles ( 26 km ) south of Niagara Falls .

Construction began in 447 BC when the Athenian Empire was at the peak of its power . It was completed in 438 BC , although decoration of the building continued until 432 BC . It is the most important surviving building of Classical Greece , generally considered the zenith of the Doric order [ by whom ? ] . Its decorative sculptures are considered some of the high points of Greek art . The Parthenon is regarded as an enduring symbol of Ancient Greece , Athenian democracy and Western civilization , and one of the world 's greatest cultural monuments . To the Athenians who built it , the Parthenon and other Periclean monuments of the Acropolis were seen fundamentally as a celebration of Hellenic victory over the Persian invaders and as a thanksgiving to the gods for that victory . The Parthenon itself replaced an older temple of Athena , which historians call the Pre-Parthenon or Older Parthenon , that was destroyed in the Persian invasion of 480 BC . Like most Greek temples , the Parthenon served a practical purpose as the city treasury . For a time , it served as the treasury of the Delian League , which later became the Athenian Empire . In the final decade of the 6th century AD , the Parthenon was converted into a Christian church dedicated to the Virgin Mary . After the Ottoman conquest , it was turned into a mosque in the early 1460s .",

Driven by what one needs or wants to learn , the available opportunities , and the manner in which one learns , adult learning is affected by demographics , globalization and technology .

  "/wiki/Sloop": "A sloop is a sailboat with a single mast typically meaning one headsail in front of the mast , and one mainsail aft of ( behind ) the mast . This is called a fore-and-aft rig , and can be rigged as a Bermuda rig with triangular sails fore and aft , or as a gaff-rig with triangular foresails and a gaff rigged mainsail . Sailboats can be classified according to type of rig , and so a sailboat may be a sloop , catboat , cutter , ketch , yawl , or schooner . A sloop usually has only one headsail , although an exception is the Friendship sloop , which is usually gaff-rigged with a bowsprit and multiple headsails . If the vessel has two or more headsails , the term cutter may be used , especially if the mast is stepped further towards the back of the boat . The name originates from the Dutch sloep , which is related to the Old English sl\u016bpan , to glide . In naval terminology , sloop-of-war refers to the purpose of the craft , rather than to the specific size or sail-plan , and thus a sloop should not be confused with a sloop-of-war . After the cat rig which has only a single sail , the Bermuda rig is the simplest sailing rig configurations . It is the most popular yacht rigging because it is easier to sail with a smaller crew or even single-handed , it is cheaper since it has less hardware than more complex rigs , and it sails well into the wind . A limitation is that when a boat gets over 45 feet in length , the sails become so large that they are difficult to handle , although modern technology is helping with this . The headsail can be masthead-rigged or fractional-rigged . On a masthead-rigged sloop , the forestay ( on which the headsail is carried ) attaches at the top of the mast .",
