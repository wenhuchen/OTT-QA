  "/wiki/Ge\u02bdez": "Ge\u02bdez ( ; , ' ; referred to in some scholarly literature as Classical Ethiopic ) is an ancient South Semitic language of the Ethiopic branch . The language originates from the region encompassing southern Eritrea and northern Ethiopia regions in the Horn of Africa . Today , Ge\u02bdez is used only as the main liturgical language of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church , the Ethiopian Catholic Church and Eritrean Catholic Church , and the Beta Israel Jewish community . However , in Ethiopia , Amharic or other local languages , and in Eritrea and Ethiopia 's Tigray Region , Tigrinya may be used for sermons . Tigrinya and Tigre are closely related to Ge\u02bdez . The closest living languages to Ge\u02bdez are Tigre and Tigrinya , with lexical similarity at 71% and 68% respectively . Some linguists do not believe that Ge\u02bdez constitutes a common ancestor of modern Ethiosemitic languages , but that Ge\u02bdez became a separate language early on from another hypothetical unattested language , which can be seen as an extinct sister language of Amharic , Tigre and Tigrinya . In the transcription employed by the Encyclopaedia Aethiopica , which is widely employed in academia , the contrast here represented as a/\u0101 is represented \u00e4/a .",
  "/wiki/Tigrinya_language": "The Tigrinya language ( also spelled Tigrigna ) , is a Semitic language spoken by Tigrinyas of East Africa . They live primarily in modern countries of Eritrea and Ethiopia . Eritrea has nine languages of equal status . There is no official language at the policy level . In Ethiopia , Tigrinya is spoken in the Tigray region . It is also spoken by groups of emigrants from these regions , including some Beta Israel . Tigrinya should not be confused with the related Tigre language . The latter is a Semitic language spoken by the Tigre people , who mostly inhabit the lowland regions of Eritrea , Sudan , and northwest Eritrea .",
  "/wiki/Amharic": "Amharic ( /\u00e6m\u02c8h\u00e6r\u026ak/ or /\u0251\u02d0m\u02c8h\u0251\u02d0r\u026ak/ ; ( Amharic : \u12a0\u121b\u122d\u129b ) , Amar\u0259\u00f1\u00f1a , IPA : [ amar\u0268\u0272\u02d0a ] ( listen ) ) is one of the Ethiopian Semitic languages , which are a subgrouping within the Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic languages . It is spoken as a first language by the Amharas and as a lingua franca by other populations residing in major cities and towns of Ethiopia . The Amharic language possibly originated as result of a pidginization process with a Cushitic substratum and a Semitic superstratum to enable communication between people who spoke a mix of different languages . This pidginization of the new language had enabled the soldiers to create communication means independent of the church which used the Ge\u02bdez language . The language serves as the working language of Ethiopia , and is also the working language of several of the states within the Ethiopian federal system . With 21,811,600 total speakers as of 2007 , including around 4,000,000 L2 speakers , Amharic is the second-most commonly spoken Semitic language in the world , after Arabic . Amharic is written left-to-right using a system that grew out of the Ge'ez script . The writing system is called Fid\u00e4l ( \u134a\u12f0\u120d ) in Ethiopian Semitic languages . Fid\u00e4l means script , alphabet , letter , or character or abugida ( \u12a0\u1261\u130a\u12f3 ) , from the first four symbols . The modern linguistic term abugida originates from the Ethiopian word . There is no agreed way of romanising Amharic into Latin script . The Amharic examples in the sections below use one system that is common , though not universal , among linguists specialising in Ethiopian Semitic languages .",

In the 2nd century BCE , Egyptian began to be written in the Coptic alphabet , which is an adaptation of the Greek alphabet with the addition of six or seven signs from the Demotic Egyptian to compensate the absence of the Afro-Asiatic sounds that the Greek language did not have . Several distinct Coptic dialects are identified , the most prominent of which are Sahidic , originating in parts of Upper Egypt and Bohairic , originally from the western Nile Delta in Lower Egypt . Coptic and Demotic are grammatically closely related to Late Egyptian , which was written with Egyptian hieroglyphs . Coptic flourished as a literary language from the 2nd to 13th centuries and its Bohairic dialect continues to be the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria . It was supplanted by Egyptian Arabic as a spoken language toward the early modern period , but language revitalization efforts have been underway since the 19th century .",

The calendar was the predominant calendar in the Roman world , most of Europe , and in European settlements in the Americas and elsewhere , until it was gradually replaced by the Gregorian calendar , promulgated in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII . The Julian calendar is still used in parts of the Eastern Orthodox Church and in parts of Oriental Orthodoxy as well as by the Berbers .
