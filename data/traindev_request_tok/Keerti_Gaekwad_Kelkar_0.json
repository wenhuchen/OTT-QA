  "/wiki/Santoshi_Mata": "Santoshi Mata ( Hindi : \u0938\u0902\u0924\u094b\u0937\u0940 \u092e\u093e\u0924\u093e ) or Santoshi Maa ( \u0938\u0902\u0924\u094b\u0937\u0940 \u092e\u093e\u0901 ) is a goddess in the Hindu pantheon . She is venerated as the Mother of Satisfaction , the meaning of her name . Santoshi Mata is particularly worshipped by women of North India . A vrata ( ritual fast ) called the Santoshi Maa vrata performed by women on 16 consecutive Fridays wins the goddess ' favour . Santoshi Mata was influenced to be a goddess in the 1960s . Her prayer initially spread through word of mouth , vrata-pamphlet literature , and poster art . Her vrata was gaining popularity with North Indian women . However , it was the 1975 Bollywood film Jai Santoshi Maa ( Hail to Santoshi Maa ) - narrating the story of the goddess and her ardent devotee Satyavati - which propelled this then little-known new goddess to the heights of devotional fervour . With the rising popularity of the film , Santoshi Mata entered the pan-Indian Hindu pantheon and her images and shrines were incorporated in Hindu temples . The film portrayed the goddess to be the daughter of the popular Hindu god Ganesha and related her to the Raksha Bandhan festival , however , it had no basis in Hindu scriptures .",
