  "/wiki/Craig_Kieswetter": "Craig Kieswetter ( born 28 November 1987 ) is an English professional golfer and former cricketer who appeared in 71 matches for the England cricket team between 2010 and 2013 . Born and raised in South Africa , Kieswetter moved to England to complete his education , and began playing county cricket for Somerset in 2007 . Three years later , he made his international debut in a One Day International ( ODI ) against Bangladesh . A wicket-keeper batsman , he was considered a one-day specialist , and all his international appearances came in ODIs or Twenty20 Internationals . Kieswetter played junior cricket for Western Province until the age of 18 , but lack of opportunity led him to seek an alternative route in England . He studied at Millfield , where he was noticed by Somerset . The county 's lack of a strong wicket-keeper gave Kieswetter his opportunity , and he made his debut for the team early in the 2007 season . Through his Scottish mother , he qualified to play county cricket , and his performances soon generated discussion about his potential to play for England . Around this time , the captain of South Africa , Graeme Smith , invited him to return to play in South Africa but Kieswetter preferred to qualify for England . In early 2010 , Kieswetter achieved his target ; some strong performances for the England Lions , especially in a match against the senior England team , won him a place in the squad to face Bangladesh . His selection , along with the presence of other South African-born players in the England team , was criticised ; some commentators suggested there should be fewer foreign-born players in the team . Kieswetter scored his only international century in his third match , and a couple of months later he was the man of the match in the final when England won the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 .",
