  "/wiki/Burry_Inlet": "The River Loughor ( /\u02c8l\u028cx\u0259r/ ) ( Welsh : Afon Llwchwr ) is a river in Wales which marks the border between Carmarthenshire and Swansea . The river has its source at an underground lake at the Black Mountain and emerges at the surface from Llygad Llwchwr which translates from the Welsh as eye of the Loughor . It flows past Ammanford and Hendy in Carmarthenshire and Pontarddulais in Swansea . The river divides Carmarthenshire from Swansea for much of its course and it separates Hendy from Pontarddulais at the point where the river becomes tidal . The Loughor meets the sea at its estuary near the town of Loughor where it separates the south coast of Carmarthenshire from the north coast of the Gower Peninsula . Among its tributaries is the River Amman , which joins the Loughor near Pantyffynnon . The area of the catchment is some 262 km2 ( 101 sq Miles ) . In the 18th century , the river was a noted salmon and sea trout river . Fish from the river was then carried on ponies to be sold at Swansea Market . The fishing declined in the 19th century due to increasing pollution from industrialisation . Carmarthenshire County Council is currently undertaking studies into the possibility of constructing a barrage across the River Loughor upstream from the Loughor bridges .",

The three largest towns are Llanelli , Carmarthen and Ammanford . Carmarthen is the county town and administrative centre . Carmarthenshire has been inhabited since prehistoric times . The county town was founded by the Romans , and the region was part of the Principality of Deheubarth in the High Middle Ages . After invasion by the Normans in the 12th and 13th centuries it was subjugated , along with other parts of Wales , by Edward I of England . There was further unrest in the early 15th century , when the Welsh rebelled under Owain Glynd\u0175r , and during the English Civil War . Carmarthenshire is mainly an agricultural county , apart from the southeastern part which was once heavily industrialised with coal mining , steel-making and tin-plating . In the north of the county , the woollen industry was very important in the 18th century . The economy depends on agriculture , forestry , fishing and tourism . West Wales was identified in 2014 as the worst-performing region in the United Kingdom along with the South Wales Valleys with the decline in its industrial base , and the low profitability of the livestock sector . Carmarthenshire , as a tourist destination , offers a wide range of outdoor activities .",

During the second half of the first millennium Ceredigion was a minor kingdom . It has been administered as a county since 1282 . Welsh is spoken by more than half the population . Ceredigion is considered to be a centre of Welsh culture . The county is mainly rural with over 50 miles ( 80 km ) of coastline and a mountainous hinterland . The numerous sandy beaches and the long-distance Ceredigion Coast Path provide excellent views of Cardigan Bay . In the 18th and early 19th centuries , Cardiganshire had more industry than it does today ; Cardigan was the commercial centre of the county ; lead , silver and zinc were mined and Cardigan was the principal port of South Wales prior to the silting of its harbour . The economy became highly dependent on dairy farming and the rearing of livestock for the English market . During the 20th century , livestock farming became less profitable , and the county 's population declined as people moved to the more prosperous parts of Wales or emigrated . However , there has been a population increase caused by elderly people moving to the county for retirement , and various government initiatives have encouraged tourism and other alternative sources of income . Ceredigion 's population at the 2011 UK census was 75,900 .",
  "/wiki/Bog": "A bog or bogland is a wetland that accumulates peat , a deposit of dead plant material - often mosses , and in a majority of cases , sphagnum moss . It is one of the four main types of wetlands . Other names for bogs include mire , quagmire , and muskeg ; alkaline mires are called fens . They are frequently covered in ericaceous shrubs rooted in the sphagnum moss and peat . The gradual accumulation of decayed plant material in a bog functions as a carbon sink . Bogs occur where the water at the ground surface is acidic and low in nutrients . In some cases , the water is derived entirely from precipitation , in which case they are termed ombrotrophic ( cloud-fed ) . Water flowing out of bogs has a characteristic brown colour , which comes from dissolved peat tannins . In general , the low fertility and cool climate result in relatively slow plant growth , but decay is even slower owing to the saturated soil . Hence , peat accumulates . Large areas of the landscape can be covered many meters deep in peat . Bogs have distinctive assemblages of animal , fungal and plant species , and are of high importance for biodiversity , particularly in landscapes that are otherwise settled and farmed .",

  "/wiki/Peat": "Peat ( /pi\u02d0t/ ) , also known as turf ( /t\u025c\u02d0rf/ ) , is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation or organic matter . It is unique to natural areas called peatlands , bogs , mires , moors , or muskegs . The peatland ecosystem is the most efficient carbon sink on the planet , because peatland plants capture CO2 naturally released from the peat , maintaining an equilibrium . In natural peatlands , the annual rate of biomass production is greater than the rate of decomposition , but it takes thousands of years for peatlands to develop the deposits of 1.5 to 2.3 m [ 4.9 to 7.5 ft ] , which is the average depth of the boreal [ northern ] peatlands . Sphagnum moss , also called peat moss , is one of the most common components in peat , although many other plants can contribute . The biological features of Sphagnum mosses act to create a habitat aiding peat formation , a phenomenon termed 'habitat manipulation ' . Soils consisting primarily of peat are known as histosols . Peat forms in wetland conditions , where flooding or stagnant water obstructs the flow of oxygen from the atmosphere , slowing the rate of decomposition . Peatlands , particularly bogs , are the primary source of peat , although less-common wetlands including fens , pocosins , and peat swamp forests also deposit peat . Landscapes covered in peat are home to specific kinds of plants including Sphagnum moss , ericaceous shrubs , and sedges ( see bog for more information on this aspect of peat ) . Because organic matter accumulates over thousands of years , peat deposits provide records of past vegetation and climate by preserving plant remains , such as pollen . This allows the reconstruction of past environments and study changes in land use .",
  "/wiki/Estuary": "An estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of brackish water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it , and with a free connection to the open sea . Estuaries form a transition zone between river environments and maritime environments known as ecotone . Estuaries are subject both to marine influences such as tides , waves , and the influx of saline water and to riverine influences such as flows of freshwater and sediment . The mixing of seawater and freshwater provides high levels of nutrients both in the water column and in sediment , making estuaries among the most productive natural habitats in the world . Most existing estuaries formed during the Holocene epoch with the flooding of river-eroded or glacially scoured valleys when the sea level began to rise about 10,000-12,000 years ago . Estuaries are typically classified according to their geomorphological features or to water-circulation patterns . They can have many different names , such as bays , harbors , lagoons , inlets , or sounds , although some of these water bodies do not strictly meet the above definition of an estuary and could be fully saline . Many estuaries suffer degeneration from a variety of factors including soil erosion , deforestation , overgrazing , overfishing and the filling of wetlands . Eutrophication may lead to excessive nutrients from sewage and animal wastes ; pollutants including heavy metals , polychlorinated biphenyls , radionuclides and hydrocarbons from sewage inputs ; and diking or damming for flood control or water diversion .",
  "/wiki/Salt_marsh": "A salt marsh or saltmarsh , also known as a coastal salt marsh or a tidal marsh , is a coastal ecosystem in the upper coastal intertidal zone between land and open saltwater or brackish water that is regularly flooded by the tides .

These plants are terrestrial in origin and are essential to the stability of the salt marsh in trapping and binding sediments . Salt marshes play a large role in the aquatic food web and the delivery of nutrients to coastal waters . They also support terrestrial animals and provide coastal protection .",

Plantlife found in the bog is more typical of that found in East Anglia . Habitats range from swamps , carr ( fen ) , water meadows and tall reed beds to waterlogged scrub consisting mainly of willow , where wetter areas merge with woodland . There are a number of plants found in the wetland that are rare in Great Britain . Examples of these include the slender cotton grass and lesser water plantain . In 2003 , surveys of Crymlyn Bog , Pant-y-Sais Fen and the inter-connecting wetlands identified the area as one of only three locations in the UK at which the fen raft spider is found . The extent of the population is unknown but the quality of habitat at the site is considered good enough for the population to be stable . The reserve is a haven for birds . Predatory visitors like the hen harrier , buzzard , hobby and the occasional marsh harrier visit the site regularly .

  "/wiki/Great_bittern": "The Eurasian bittern or great bittern ( Botaurus stellaris ) is a wading bird in the bittern subfamily ( Botaurinae ) of the heron family Ardeidae . There are two subspecies , the northern race ( B. s. stellaris ) breeding in parts of Europe and Asia , as well as on the northern coast of Africa , while the southern race ( B. s. capensis ) is endemic to parts of southern Africa . It is a secretive bird , seldom seen in the open as it prefers to skulk in reed beds and thick vegetation near water bodies . Its presence is apparent in the spring , when the booming call of the male during the breeding season can be heard . It feeds on fish , small mammals , fledgling birds , amphibians , crustaceans and insects . The nest is usually built among reeds at the edge of bodies of water . The female incubates the clutch of eggs and feeds the young chicks , which leave the nest when about two weeks old . She continues to care for them until they are fully fledged some six weeks later . With its specific habitat requirements and the general reduction in wetlands across its range , the population is thought to be in decline globally . However the decline is slow , and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its overall conservation status as being of least concern . Nevertheless , some local populations are at risk and the population of the southern race has declined more dramatically and is cause for concern . In the United Kingdom it is one of the most threatened of all bird species .",

Northern and eastern populations are migratory , but this species is a permanent resident in the warmer parts of its breeding range . The adult is 23-28 cm ( 9-11 in ) long , and , like other rails , has a body that is flattened laterally , allowing it easier passage through the reed beds it inhabits . It has mainly brown upperparts and blue-grey underparts , black barring on the flanks , long toes , a short tail and a long reddish bill . Immature birds are generally similar in appearance to the adults , but the blue-grey in the plumage is replaced by buff . The downy chicks are black , as with all rails . The former subspecies R. indicus , has distinctive markings and a call that is very different from the pig-like squeal of the western races , and is now usually split as a separate species , the brown-cheeked rail . The water rail breeds in reed beds and other marshy sites with tall , dense vegetation , building its nest a little above the water level from whatever plants are available nearby . The off-white , blotched eggs are incubated mainly by the female , and the precocial downy chicks hatch in 19-22 days . The female will defend her eggs and brood against intruders , or move them to another location if they are discovered . This species can breed after its first year , and it normally raises two clutches in each season .

Salmon are intensively farmed in many parts of the world . Typically , salmon are anadromous : they hatch in fresh water , migrate to the ocean , then return to fresh water to reproduce . However , populations of several species are restricted to fresh water through their lives . Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact spot where they hatched to spawn . Tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true .
