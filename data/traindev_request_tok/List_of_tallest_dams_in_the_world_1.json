  "/wiki/Rogun_Dam": "Rogun Dam is an embankment dam under construction on the Vakhsh River in southern Tajikistan . The dam is situated 110 km from Dushanbe . It is one of the planned hydroelectric power plants of Vakhsh Cascade . Construction of the dam began in the Soviet era , in 1976 , but was abandoned after the collapse of the Soviet Union . Over three decades only preliminary construction has been carried out on the dam . Due to its controversial state , construction was suspended in August 2012 pending World Bank reports . The project was restarted by the Tajik government with Chinese help in 2017 . The power plant 's first unit was commissioned in November 2018 . The dam has drawn complaints from neighboring Uzbekistan , which fears it will negatively impact its lucrative cotton crops . The dispute over the project has contributed significantly to bitter relations between the two former Soviet republics .",

It is bordered by Afghanistan to the south , Uzbekistan to the west , Kyrgyzstan to the north , and China to the east . The traditional homelands of the Tajik people include present-day Tajikistan as well as parts of Afghanistan and Uzbekistan . The territory that now constitutes Tajikistan was previously home to several ancient cultures , including the city of Sarazm of the Neolithic and the Bronze Age , and was later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures , including the Oxus civilisation , Andronovo culture , Buddhism , Nestorian Christianity , Zoroastrianism , Manichaeism and Islam . The area has been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties , including the Achaemenid Empire , Sasanian Empire , Hephthalite Empire , Samanid Empire , Mongol Empire , Timurid dynasty , the Khanate of Bukhara , the Russian Empire , and subsequently the Soviet Union . Within the Soviet Union , the country 's modern borders were drawn when it was part of Uzbekistan as an autonomous republic before becoming a full-fledged Soviet republic in 1929 . On 9 September 1991 , Tajikistan became an independent sovereign nation when the Soviet Union disintegrated . A civil war was fought almost immediately after independence , lasting from 1992 to 1997 . Since the end of the war , newly established political stability and foreign aid have allowed the country 's economy to grow . Like all other Central Asian neighbouring states , the country , led by President Emomali Rahmon since 1994 , has been criticised by a number of non-governmental organizations for authoritarian leadership , lack of religious freedom , corruption and widespread violations of human rights .

In the Indian Ocean , India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives ; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia . Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",

Early civilisations in Myanmar included the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu city-states in Upper Burma and the Mon kingdoms in Lower Burma . In the 9th century , the Bamar people entered the upper Irrawaddy valley and , following the establishment of the Pagan Kingdom in the 1050s , the Burmese language , culture and Theravada Buddhism slowly became dominant in the country . The Pagan Kingdom fell due to the Mongol invasions and several warring states emerged . In the 16th century , reunified by the Taungoo dynasty , the country was for a brief period the largest empire in the history of Mainland Southeast Asia . The early 19th century Konbaung dynasty ruled over an area that included modern Myanmar and briefly controlled Manipur and Assam as well .

Steep canyon walls line the swift and powerful Salween . Its extensive drainage basin supports a biodiversity comparable with the Mekong and is home to about 7 million people . In 2003 , key parts of the mid-region watershed of the river were included within the Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas , a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The people who live on the Salween are relatively isolated from the rest of the world . The river is only navigable up to 90 kilometres ( 56 mi ) from the mouth , and only in the rainy season . The Burma Road was constructed between 1937 and 1938 during the Second Sino-Japanese War and crossed the river at the Huitong bridge . The Huitong bridge was blown by the retreating Chinese army and the river became the frontline from 1942 to 1944 . The Salween Campaign of World War II , was launched in order to liberate occupied China and open the Burma Road again and connect it to the Ledo Road . Logging began on the mountains surrounding the Salween in the late 20th century , and has damaged the river 's ecology . In recent years , there have been a number of proposals to dam the Salween River , both upstream in China and downstream in Myanmar , which have prompted social and environmental concerns as well as widespread opposition .",
