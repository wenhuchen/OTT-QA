The awards show was also notable for a very politically charged acceptance speech by Vanessa Redgrave .

It also uses its score as symbolism , something considered novel . Chalbaud describes it as a very character-driven film , and it is structured as a traditional melodrama . In 2016 , the film was screened for its 40th Anniversary at Cinemateca Nacional de Venezuela del Museo de Bellas Artes .",
