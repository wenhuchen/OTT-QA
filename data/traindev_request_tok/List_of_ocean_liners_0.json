  "/wiki/SS_Andrea_Doria": "SS Andrea Doria , pronounced [ an\u02c8dr\u025b\u02d0a \u02c8d\u0254\u02d0rja ] , was an ocean liner for the Italian Line ( Societ\u00e0 di navigazione Italia ) home-ported in Genoa , Italy , most famous for her sinking in 1956 , when 46 people died . Named after the 16th-century Genoese admiral Andrea Doria , the ship had a gross register tonnage of 29,100 and a capacity of about 1,200 passengers and 500 crew . For a country attempting to rebuild its shattered economy and reputation after World War II , Andrea Doria was an icon of Italian national pride . Of all Italy 's ships at the time , Andrea Doria was the largest , fastest and supposedly safest . Launched on 16 June 1951 , the ship undertook its maiden voyage on 14 January 1953 . On 25 July 1956 , while Andrea Doria was approaching the coast of Nantucket , Massachusetts , bound for New York City , the eastbound MS Stockholm of the Swedish American Line collided with her in one of history 's most infamous maritime disasters . Struck in the side , the top-heavy Andrea Doria immediately started to list severely to starboard , which left half of its lifeboats unusable . The consequent shortage of lifeboats could have resulted in significant loss of life , but the ship stayed afloat for over 11 hours after the collision . The calm , appropriate behavior of the crew , together with improvements in communications , and the rapid response of other ships , averted a disaster similar in scale to that of Titanic in 1912 . While 1,660 passengers and crew were rescued and survived , 46 people on the ship died as a direct consequence of the collision . The evacuated luxury liner capsized and sank the following morning . This accident remains the worst maritime disaster to occur in United States waters since the sinking of SS Eastland in 1915 .",

Why Antilles\u2032 captain decided to sail into the narrow , shallow strait is still not known . But on hitting the rocks the impact ruptured a fuel tank and she caught fire . All of her passengers and crew evacuated the ship safely to the island of Mustique and they were rescued by the Cunard Line\u2032s Queen Elizabeth 2 .
