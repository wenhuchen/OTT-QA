  "/wiki/Sean_Farrell": "Sean Ward Farrell ( born May 25 , 1960 ) is a former American football guard who played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers , New England Patriots , Denver Broncos , and Seattle Seahawks of the NFL . Farrell attended Westhampton Beach High School in Westhampton Beach , New York , where he was a football and track star . He then played college football for Penn State University , where he was named to a number of All-American teams in 1980 and 1981 . Farrell was the first round draft pick of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 1982 NFL Draft ; Buccaneers management had actually intended to select defensive end Booker Reese , and Farrell 's name was turned in due to a communication error in the draft room . The team then traded the next year 's first round pick in order to get Reese as well . Ironically , Farrell played at a high level for the Buccaneers , while Reese ultimately came to be considered one of the most disappointing draft picks in team history . Tampa Bay 's team performance declined during Farrell 's years with the team . After his first contract expired in 1985 , he signed a one-year contract for the 1986 season based on the team 's assurances that things would improve , but the team had another bad year and Farrell made news by publicly telling a group of Bucs fans , I know what I want this Christmas . . . I want to get the hell out of Tampa Bay . New England acquired him in return for three draft picks , and he was the Patriots ' starting guard for three seasons before shoulder surgery kept him on the injured reserve list for most of the 1990 season .",

  "/wiki/Booker_Reese": "Booker Reese ( born September 20 , 1959 ) is a former American football defensive end who played four seasons for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Los Angeles Rams from 1982 to 1985 in the National Football League . Reese is considered to be the biggest draft bust in Buccaneers history . Reese played college football in Bethune-Cookman College and was drafted in the second round of the 1982 NFL Draft by the Buccaneers . The Buccaneers intended to draft him in the first round , but a broken communication resulted in their mistakenly drafting Sean Farrell . They were so convinced of his talent that they traded a future first round pick in the 1983 NFL Draft to get him , despite advance knowledge that 1983 would be a particularly strong draft class . Although highly talented , Reese had trouble making the mental adjustment to professional football . Frustration over his inability to excel , along with his unpreparedness for the NFL lifestyle , led to problems with alcohol and cocaine . Reese 's best season in the NFL came in 1983 . He played in all 16 games that season , scoring one sack and two interceptions . Reese only lasted two seasons with the Bucs before being traded to the Rams for a 12th round draft pick in 1984 . He played eleven games with the Rams , who then sent him to rehab and released him . He signed with the San Francisco 49ers in 1985 , but was released before the season after again failing a drug test .",
