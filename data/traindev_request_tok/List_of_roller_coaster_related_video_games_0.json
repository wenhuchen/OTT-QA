  "/wiki/MS-DOS": "MS-DOS ( /\u02cc\u025bm\u02cc\u025bs\u02c8d\u0252s/ em-es-DOSS ; acronym for Microsoft Disk Operating System ) is an operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft . Collectively , MS-DOS , its rebranding as IBM PC DOS , and some operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS-DOS , are sometimes referred to as DOS ( which is also the generic acronym for disk operating system ) . MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s , from which point it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface ( GUI ) , in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system . IBM licensed and re-released it in 1981 , as PC DOS 1.0 for use in its PCs . Although MS-DOS and PC DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM , the two products diverged after twelve years , in 1993 , with recognizable differences in compatibility , syntax , and capabilities . During its lifetime , several competing products were released for the x86 platform , and MS-DOS went through eight versions , until development ceased in 2000 . Initially , MS-DOS was targeted at Intel 8086 processors running on computer hardware using floppy disks to store and access not only the operating system , but application software and user data as well . Progressive version releases delivered support for other mass storage media in ever greater sizes and formats , along with added feature support for newer processors and rapidly evolving computer architectures . Ultimately , it was the key product in Microsoft 's development from a programming language company to a diverse software development firm , providing the company with essential revenue and marketing resources . It was also the underlying basic operating system on which early versions of Windows ran as a GUI . It is a flexible operating system , and consumes negligible installation space .",
  "/wiki/Walt_Disney_Computer_Software,_Inc.": "Disney Interactive Studios , Inc. ( originally established as Walt Disney Computer Software , Disney Interactive , Buena Vista Interactive , and Buena Vista Games ) was an American video game developer and publisher owned by The Walt Disney Company through Disney Interactive . Prior to its closure in 2016 , it developed and distributed multi-platform video games and interactive entertainment worldwide . Most of the games released by Disney Interactive Studios were typically tie-in products to existing character franchises . On May 10 , 2016 , as a result of the discontinuation of its Disney Infinity series , Disney shut down Disney Interactive Studios , and exited the first party home console game development business in order to focus on third-party development of home console video games through other developers such as Electronic Arts ( Star Wars games ) , WB Games ( owned by rival company Warner Bros. , which handles the publishing of Disney-related Lego video games and Cars 3 : Driven to Win ) , Bandai Namco Entertainment , Square Enix ( Kingdom Hearts ) , and Capcom ( several Disney games and Marvel vs. Capcom ) .

  "/wiki/Amiga": "The Amiga is a family of personal computers introduced by Commodore in 1985 . The original model was part of a series of 16/32- and 32-bit computers that featured 256 KB or more of RAM , mouse-based GUIs , and significantly improved graphics and audio over 8-bit systems . This wave included the Atari ST - released the same year - Apple 's Macintosh , and later the Apple IIGS . Based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor , the Amiga differed from its contemporaries through the inclusion of custom hardware to accelerate graphics and sound , including sprites and a blitter , and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS . The Amiga 1000 was released in July 1985 , but a series of production problems kept it from becoming widely available until early 1986 . The best selling model , the Amiga 500 , was introduced in 1987 and became one of the leading home computers of the late 1980s and early 1990s with four to six million sold . The A3000 was introduced in 1990 , followed by the A500+ , and the A600 in March 1992 . Finally , the A1200 and the A4000 were released in late 1992 . The platform became particularly popular for gaming and programming demos . It also found a prominent role in the desktop video , video production , and show control business , leading to video editing systems such as the Video Toaster . The Amiga 's native ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it a popular platform for early tracker music software . The relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory enabled the development of 3D rendering packages , including LightWave 3D , Imagine , Aladdin4D , TurboSilver and Traces , a predecessor to Blender .",
  "/wiki/3DO_Interactive_Multiplayer": "The 3DO Interactive Multiplayer , often called the 3DO , is a home video game console developed by The 3DO Company . Conceived by entrepreneur and Electronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins , the 3DO was not a console manufactured by the company itself , but a series of specifications , originally designed by Dave Needle and R. J. Mical of New Technologies Group , that could be licensed by third parties . Panasonic produced the first models in 1993 , and further renditions of the hardware were released in 1994 by GoldStar ( now LG Electronics ) and in 1995 by Sanyo . Despite a highly promoted launch ( including being named Time magazine 's 1993 Product of the Year ) and a host of cutting-edge technologies , the 3DO 's high price and an oversaturated console market prevented the system from achieving success comparable to veteran competitors Sega and Nintendo . As a result , it was discontinued in late 1996 .",
  "/wiki/Sega_Genesis": "The Sega Genesis , known as the Mega Drive [ b ] outside North America , is a 16-bit home video game console developed and sold by Sega . The Genesis is Sega 's third console and the successor to the Master System . Sega released it as the Mega Drive in Japan in 1988 , and later as the Genesis in North America in 1989 . In 1990 , it was distributed as the Mega Drive by Virgin Mastertronic in Europe , Ozisoft in Australasia , and Tec Toy in Brazil . In South Korea , it was distributed by Samsung as the Super Gam*Boy and later the Super Aladdin Boy . [ c ] Designed by an R & D team supervised by Hideki Sato and Masami Ishikawa , the Genesis was adapted from Sega 's System 16 arcade board , centered on a Motorola 68000 processor as the CPU , a Zilog Z80 as a sound controller , and a video system supporting hardware sprites , tiles , and scrolling . It plays a library of more than 900 games created by Sega and a wide array of third-party publishers delivered on ROM-based cartridges . Several add-ons were released , including a Power Base Converter to play Master System games . It was released in several different versions , some created by third parties . Sega created two network services to support the Genesis : Sega Meganet and Sega Channel . In Japan , the Mega Drive fared poorly against its two main competitors , Nintendo 's Super Famicom and NEC 's PC Engine ( aka TurboGrafx-\u206016 ) , but it achieved considerable success in North America , Brazil , and Europe . Contributing to its success were its library of arcade game ports , the popularity of Sega 's Sonic the Hedgehog series , several popular sports franchises , and aggressive youth marketing that positioned the system as the cool console for adolescents .",
  "/wiki/Sega_CD": "The Sega CD , released as the Mega-CD [ a ] in most regions outside North America and Brazil , is a CD-ROM accessory for the Sega Genesis designed and produced by Sega as part of the fourth generation of video game consoles . It was released on December 12 , 1991 in Japan , October 15 , 1992 in North America , and April 2 , 1993 in Europe . The Sega CD plays CD-based games and adds hardware functionality such as a faster central processing unit and graphic enhancements . It can also play audio CDs and CD+G discs . The main benefit of CD technology was greater storage , which allowed for games to be nearly 320 times larger than Genesis cartridges . This benefit manifested as full motion video ( FMV ) games such as the controversial Night Trap , which became a focus of the 1993 congressional hearings on issues of video game violence and ratings . Sega of Japan partnered with JVC to design the Sega CD and refused to consult with Sega of America until the project was complete . Sega of America assembled parts from various dummy units to obtain a working prototype . It was redesigned several times by Sega and licensed third-party developers . While the Sega CD became known for several well received games such as Sonic CD and Lunar : Eternal Blue , its game library contained many Genesis ports and poorly received FMV games . 2.24 million Sega CD units were sold by March 1996 , after which Sega discontinued the system to focus on the Sega Saturn . Retrospective reception is mixed , with praise for individual games and additional functions , but criticism for its lack of deep games , high price , and support from Sega .",
  "/wiki/Amiga_CD32": "The Amiga CD32 , styled Amiga CD32 and code-named Spellbound , is a 32 bit home video game console developed by Commodore and released in western Europe , Australia , Canada and Brazil . It was first announced at the Science Museum in London on July 16 , 1993 , and was released in September of the same year . The CD32 is part of a family of Amiga computers and other hardware . It uses CD-ROM as its storage medium . It was based on Commodore 's Advanced Graphics Architecture chipset , and is of similar specification to the Amiga 1200 computer . Using third party devices , it is possible to upgrade the CD32 with keyboard , floppy drive , hard drive , RAM and mouse , turning it into the equivalent of an Amiga 1200 personal computer . A hardware MPEG decompression module for playing Video CD was also released . In the Christmas period following its launch , the CD32 accounted for 38% of all CD-ROM drive sales in the UK , exceeding sales of the Mega-CD ; however , it was soon overshadowed by CD-ROM based games consoles from other companies , and was discontinued as Commodore went into bankruptcy .",
  "/wiki/Mac_OS": "The family of Macintosh operating systems developed by Apple Inc. includes the graphical user interface-based operating systems it has designed for use with its Macintosh series of personal computers since 1984 , as well as the related system software it once created for compatible third-party systems . In 1984 , Apple debuted the operating system that is now known as the Classic Mac OS with its release of the original Macintosh System Software . The system , rebranded Mac OS in 1996 , was preinstalled on every Macintosh until 2002 and offered on Macintosh clones for a short time in the 1990s . Noted for its ease of use , it was also criticized for its lack of modern technologies compared to its competitors . The current Mac operating system is macOS , originally named Mac OS X until 2012 and then OS X until 2016 . Developed between 1997 and 2001 after Apple 's purchase of NeXT , Mac OS X brought an entirely new architecture based on NeXTSTEP , a Unix system , that eliminated many of the technical challenges that the classic Mac OS faced . The current macOS is preinstalled with every Mac and is updated annually . It is the basis of Apple 's current system software for its other devices - iOS , iPadOS , watchOS , and tvOS . Prior to the introduction of Mac OS X , Apple experimented with several other concepts , releasing different products designed to bring the Macintosh interface or applications to Unix-like systems or vice versa , A/UX , MAE , and MkLinux . Apple 's effort to expand upon and develop a replacement for its classic Mac OS in the 1990s led to a few cancelled projects , code named Star Trek , Taligent , and Copland . Although they have different architectures , the Macintosh operating systems share a common set of GUI principles , including a menu bar across the top of the screen ; the Finder shell , featuring a desktop metaphor that represents files and applications using icons and relates concepts like directories and file deletion to real-world objects like folders and a trash can ; and overlapping windows for multitasking .",
  "/wiki/Atari_Jaguar": "The Atari Jaguar is a 64-bit home video game console that was developed by Atari Corporation , originally released in North America in November 1993 . The Jaguar is Atari 's sixth programmable console . Controversially , Atari marketed the Jaguar as being the first 64-bit video game console , while competing with the existing 16-bit consoles ( Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System ) and the 32-bit 3DO Interactive Multiplayer platform ( which launched the same year ) . Development on the Atari Jaguar started in the early 1990s by Flare Technology . The Jaguar shipped with Cybermorph as the pack-in game . The multi-chip architecture , hardware bugs , and lacking developer support tools made game development difficult . Underwhelming sales further contributed to the console 's lack of third-party support . This , in addition to the lack of internal development at Atari , led to a games library comprising only 50 licensed titles , plus another 13 games on the Jaguar CD . Atari attempted to extend the lifespan of the system with the Atari Jaguar CD add-on and marketing the Jaguar as the low-cost next generation console , with a price tag over $ 100 less than any of its competitors . With the release of the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation in 1995 , sales of the Jaguar continued to fall , ultimately selling no more than 250,000 units before it was discontinued in 1996 . The commercial failure of the Jaguar prompted Atari to leave the video game console market . After Hasbro Interactive acquired all Atari properties in 1998 , the patents to the Jaguar were released into the public domain , with the console being declared an open platform .",

It started as a proprietary PC variant intended for multimedia applications and PC games , but later became more compatible with regular PCs . In 1993 , the FM Towns Marty was released , a game console compatible with existing FM Towns games . The FM part of the name means Fujitsu Micro like their earlier products , while the Towns part is derived from the code name the system was assigned while in development , Townes . This refers to Charles Townes , one of the winners of the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics , following a custom of Fujitsu at the time to code name PC products after Nobel Prize winners . The e in Townes was dropped when the system went into production to make it clearer that the term was to be pronounced like the word towns rather than the potential tow-nes .",
  "/wiki/Sega_Saturn": "The Sega Saturn [ a ] [ b ] is a 32-bit fifth-generation home video game console developed by Sega and released on November 22 , 1994 in Japan , May 11 , 1995 in North America , and July 8 , 1995 in Europe . The successor to the successful Sega Genesis , the Saturn has a dual-CPU architecture and eight processors . Its games are in CD-ROM format , and its game library contains several arcade ports as well as original games . Development of the Saturn began in 1992 , the same year Sega 's groundbreaking 3D Model 1 arcade hardware debuted . The system was designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company Hitachi . Sega added another video display processor in early 1994 to better compete with Sony 's forthcoming PlayStation . The Saturn was initially successful in Japan , but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after its surprise May 1995 launch , four months before its scheduled release date . After the debut of the Nintendo 64 in late 1996 , the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S. , where it was discontinued in 1998 . Having sold 9.26 million units worldwide , the Saturn is considered a commercial failure . The failure of Sega 's development teams to release a game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series , known in development as Sonic X-treme , has been considered a factor in the console 's poor performance . Although the Saturn is remembered for several well regarded games , including Nights into Dreams , the Panzer Dragoon series , and the Virtua Fighter series , its reputation is mixed due to its complex hardware design and limited third-party support . Sega 's management has been criticized for its decisions during the system 's development and discontinuation .",

As a fifth generation console , the PlayStation primarily competed with the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn . The PlayStation was the first computer entertainment platform to ship over 100 million units , which it had reached nine years after its initial launch . In July 2000 , a redesigned , slim version called the PS one was released , replacing the original grey console and named appropriately to avoid confusion with its successor , the PlayStation 2 . The PlayStation 2 , which is backwards compatible with the PlayStation 's DualShock controller and games , was announced in 1999 and launched in 2000 . The last PS one units were sold in late 2006 to early 2007 shortly after it was officially discontinued , for a total of 102 million units shipped since its launch eleven years earlier . Games for the PlayStation continued to sell until Sony ceased production of both the PlayStation and PlayStation games on 23 March 2006 - over eleven years after it had been released , and less than a year before the debut of the PlayStation 3 . On 19 September 2018 , Sony unveiled the PlayStation Classic to mark the 24th anniversary of the original console .

The console introduced advanced graphics and sound capabilities compared with other systems at the time . The system was designed to accommodate the ongoing development of a variety of enhancement chips integrated in game cartridges to be competitive into the next generation . The SNES was a global success , becoming the best-selling console of the 16-bit era after launching relatively late and facing intense competition from Sega 's Genesis console in North America and Europe . Overlapping the NES 's 61.9 million unit sales , the SNES remained popular well into the 32-bit era , with 49.1 million units sold worldwide by the time it was discontinued in 2003 .

Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones .

  "/wiki/Dreamcast": "The Dreamcast [ a ] is a home video game console released by Sega on November 27 , 1998 in Japan , September 9 , 1999 in North America , and October 14 , 1999 in Europe .

The Dreamcast was Sega 's final home console , marking the end of the company 's 18 years in the console market . In contrast to the expensive hardware of the unsuccessful Sega Saturn , the Dreamcast was designed to reduce costs with off-the-shelf components , including a Hitachi SH-4 CPU and an NEC PowerVR2 GPU .

Sales did not meet Sega 's expectations despite several price cuts , and the company continued to incur significant financial losses . After a change in leadership , Sega discontinued the Dreamcast on March 31 , 2001 , withdrawing from the console business and restructuring itself as a third-party publisher . 9.13 million Dreamcast units were sold worldwide . Although the Dreamcast had a short lifespan and limited third-party support , reviewers have considered the console ahead of its time . Its library contains many games considered creative and innovative , including Crazy Taxi , Jet Set Radio and Shenmue , as well as high-quality ports from Sega 's NAOMI arcade system board .
