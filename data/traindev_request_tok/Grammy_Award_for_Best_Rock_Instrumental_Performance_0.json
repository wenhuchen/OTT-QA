  "/wiki/Paul_McCartney": "Sir James Paul McCartney CH MBE ( born 18 June 1942 ) is an English singer , songwriter , musician , composer , and record and film producer who gained worldwide fame as co-lead vocalist and bassist for the Beatles . His songwriting partnership with John Lennon remains the most successful in history . After the group disbanded in 1970 , he pursued a solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife , Linda , and Denny Laine . A self-taught musician , McCartney is proficient on bass , guitar , keyboards , and drums . He is known for his melodic approach to bass-playing ( mainly playing with a plectrum ) , his versatile and wide tenor vocal range ( spanning over four octaves ) , and his eclecticism ( exploring styles ranging from pre-rock and roll pop to classical and electronica ) . McCartney began his career as a member of the Quarrymen in 1957 , which evolved into the Beatles in 1960 . Starting with the 1967 album Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , he gradually became the Beatles ' de facto leader , providing the creative impetus for most of their music and film projects . His Beatles songs And I Love Her ( 1964 ) , Yesterday ( 1965 ) , Eleanor Rigby ( 1966 ) and Blackbird ( 1968 ) rank among the most covered songs in history . In 1970 , McCartney debuted as a solo artist with the album McCartney .

  "/wiki/Paul_McCartney_and_Wings": "Paul McCartney and Wings ( also known by their original name Wings ) were a British-American rock band formed in 1971 by former Beatle Paul McCartney , his wife Linda on keyboards , session drummer Denny Seiwell , and former Moody Blues guitarist Denny Laine . Wings were noted for frequent personnel changes along with their commercial successes , going through three lead guitarists and four drummers . However , the core trio of the McCartneys and Laine remained intact throughout the group 's existence . Created following the McCartneys ' 1971 album Ram , the band 's first two albums , Wild Life ( 1971 ) and Red Rose Speedway ( 1973 ) ( the latter featuring guitarist Henry McCullough ) , were viewed as artistic disappointments beside Paul 's work with the Beatles . After the release of the title track of the James Bond movie Live and Let Die , McCullough and Seiwell resigned from the band . The McCartneys and Laine then released 1973 's Band on the Run , a commercial and critical success that spawned two top ten singles in Jet and the title track . Following that album , the band recruited guitarist Jimmy McCulloch and drummer Geoff Britton , only for Britton to quit shortly afterwards and be replaced by Joe English . With the new line-up , Wings released 1975 's Venus and Mars , which included the US number one single Listen to What the Man Said , and undertook a highly successful world tour over 1975-76 . Intended as more of a group effort , Wings at the Speed of Sound ( 1976 ) was issued midway through the tour and featured the hit singles Silly Love Songs and Let 'Em In . In 1977 , the band earned their only UK number one single , with Mull of Kintyre , which became the then-best-selling UK single in history . Wings experienced another line-up shuffle , however , with both McCulloch and English departing before the release of the group 's 1978 album London Town . The McCartneys and Laine again added new members , recruiting guitarist Laurence Juber and drummer Steve Holley .",

The band incorporated elements of blues , jazz , and country music , and their live shows featured jam band-style improvisation and instrumentals . The group 's first two studio releases , The Allman Brothers Band ( 1969 ) and Idlewild South ( 1970 ) ( both released by Capricorn Records ) , stalled commercially , but their 1971 live release , At Fillmore East , represented an artistic and commercial breakthrough . The album features extended renderings of their songs In Memory of Elizabeth Reed and Whipping Post , and is considered among the best live albums ever made . Group leader Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident later that year - on October 29 , 1971 , and the band dedicated Eat a Peach ( 1972 ) to his memory , a dual studio/live album that cemented the band 's popularity and featured Gregg Allman 's Melissa and Dickey Betts 's Blue Sky . Following the motorcycling death of bassist Berry Oakley exactly one year and 13 days later on November 11 , 1972 , the group recruited keyboardist Chuck Leavell and bassist Lamar Williams for 1973 's Brothers and Sisters . This album included Betts 's hit single Ramblin ' Man and instrumental Jessica . These tunes went on to become classic rock radio staples , and placed the group at the forefront of 1970s rock music . Internal turmoil overtook them soon after ; the group dissolved in 1976 , reformed briefly at the end of the decade with additional personnel changes , and dissolved again in 1982 . The band reformed once more in 1989 , releasing a string of new albums and touring heavily . A series of personnel changes in the late 1990s was capped by the departure of Betts .

The main theme then leads into the first guitar solo by Toler , an organ solo by Allman , and a second guitar solo by Betts . The song suddenly gets quiet for a different reintroduction into the main theme , featuring muted guitar and Clavinet . During the second repetition of the main theme , it suddenly begins to slow into a breakdown that shifts key from A Major to B Major at the very end of the song .",
  "/wiki/Frank_Zappa": "Frank Vincent Zappa [ nb 1 ] ( December 21 , 1940 - December 4 , 1993 ) was an American multi-instrumentalist musician , composer , and bandleader . His work is characterized by nonconformity , free-form improvisation , sound experiments , musical virtuosity , and satire of American culture . In a career spanning more than 30 years , Zappa composed rock , pop , jazz , jazz fusion , orchestral and musique concr\u00e8te works , and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist . Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos , and designed album covers . He is considered one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse rock musicians of his era . As a self-taught composer and performer , Zappa 's diverse musical influences led him to create music that was sometimes difficult to categorize . While in his teens , he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical modernism , African-American rhythm and blues , and doo-wop music . He began writing classical music in high school , while at the same time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands , later switching to electric guitar . His 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention , Freak Out ! , combined songs in conventional rock and roll format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound collages . He continued this eclectic and experimental approach , irrespective of whether the fundamental format was rock , jazz or classical . Zappa 's output is unified by a conceptual continuity he termed Project/Object , with numerous musical phrases , ideas , and characters reappearing across his albums . His lyrics reflected his iconoclastic views of established social and political processes , structures and movements , often humorously so , and he has been described as the godfather of comedy rock .",

The music on the album was performed by members of a band which toured Europe and North America throughout 1980 under the name of 'The League of Gentlemen ' . The album was released in the UK in 1981 in vinyl format on the Editions EG label . It has never been reissued on CD . So the 'League of Gentlemen ' was released at a cultural cusp . The band had been positioned by Fripp himself as a new wave instrumental dance band which would suggest that he considered the music produced by the band to be 'New wave ' in character . Commentators have pointed to the rawness of the production as significant in so far as this approach had been popular among producers of post-punk/New wave recordings of the time . It may be that Robert Fripp was seeking to make his music fit to the prevailing 'alternative ' style of the time or it may simply be a reflection of the speed with which the record was recorded and released at the end of an exhausting tour . Whatever the motivation or the underlying reasons the music seems to fit well with the Post-punk scene , a feeling which is only re-inforced by the socio-political messaging laid over the tracks in the form of vocal samples . The musical backbone of the album is the spiky and complex interaction between guitar and keyboards and the repetitive and gradually developing nature of the melodic themes to which the bass and drums provide an easy to dance to 4/4 beat ( Fripp stated repeatedly that the League of Gentlemen was a dance band , and at gigs a section of empty floor space was sometimes reserved so that audience members had an area in which to dance ) .",

The band has earned a large cult following . They were ranked No . 87 on VH1 's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock . Although considered to be a seminal progressive rock band ( a genre characterised by extended instrumental sections and complex song structures ) , they have often distanced themselves from the genre : as well as influencing several generations of progressive and psychedelic rock bands , they have also been an influence on subsequent alternative metal , hardcore and experimental/noise musicians . Developed from the unsuccessful psychedelic pop trio Giles , Giles and Fripp , the initial King Crimson were key to the formation of early progressive rock , strongly influencing and altering the music of contemporaries such as Yes and Genesis . Their debut album , In the Court of the Crimson King ( 1969 ) , remains their most successful and influential release , with its elements of jazz , classical and experimental music . Their success increased following an opening act performance for the Rolling Stones at Hyde Park , London , in 1969 . Following In the Wake of Poseidon ( 1970 ) and the less successful chamber jazz-inspired Lizard ( 1970 ) , and Islands ( 1971 ) , the group reformatted and changed their instrumentation ( swapping out saxophone in favour of violin and unusual percussion ) in order to develop their own take on European rock improvisation , reaching a new creative peak on Larks ' Tongues in Aspic ( 1973 ) , Starless and Bible Black ( 1974 ) and Red ( 1974 ) .

His live performances at their best are seen as transcendental and inspired ; while some of his recordings , such as the studio albums Astral Weeks and Moondance , and the live album It 's Too Late to Stop Now , are highly acclaimed . Moondance ( 1970 ) established Morrison as a major artist , and he built on his reputation throughout the 1970s with a series of acclaimed albums and live performances . He continues to record and tour , producing albums and live performances that sell well and are generally warmly received , sometimes collaborating with other artists , such as Georgie Fame and The Chieftains . Much of Morrison 's music is structured around the conventions of soul music and R & B , such as the popular singles Brown Eyed Girl , Jackie Wilson Said ( I 'm in Heaven When You Smile ) , Domino and Wild Night . An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy , loosely connected , spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition , jazz and stream-of-consciousness narrative , such as the album Astral Weeks and the lesser known Veedon Fleece and Common One .",

Newton wrote the words from personal experience . He grew up without any particular religious conviction , but his life 's path was formed by a variety of twists and coincidences that were often put into motion by others ' reactions to what they took as his recalcitrant insubordination . He was pressed ( conscripted ) into service in the Royal Navy . After leaving the service , he became involved in the Atlantic slave trade . In 1748 , a violent storm battered his vessel off the coast of County Donegal , Ireland , so severely that he called out to God for mercy . This moment marked his spiritual conversion but he continued slave trading until 1754 or 1755 , when he ended his seafaring altogether . He began studying Christian theology . Ordained in the Church of England in 1764 , Newton became curate of Olney , Buckinghamshire , where he began to write hymns with poet William Cowper . Amazing Grace was written to illustrate a sermon on New Year 's Day of 1773 . It is unknown whether there was any music accompanying the verses ; it may have been chanted by the congregation . It debuted in print in 1779 in Newton and Cowper 's Olney Hymns but settled into relative obscurity in England .",
