[ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

  "/wiki/Liberty_ship": "Liberty ships were a class of cargo ship built in the United States during World War II . Though British in concept , the design was adapted by the United States for its simple , low-cost construction . Mass-produced on an unprecedented scale , the Liberty ship came to symbolize U.S. wartime industrial output . The class was developed to meet British orders for transports to replace ships that had been lost . Eighteen American shipyards built 2,710 Liberty ships between 1941 and 1945 ( an average of three ships every two days ) , easily the largest number of ships ever produced to a single design . Their production mirrored ( albeit on a much larger scale ) the manufacture of Hog Islander and similar standardized ship types during World War I . The immensity of the effort , the number of ships built , the role of female workers in their construction , and the survival of some far longer than their original five-year design life combine to make them the subject of much continued interest .",
