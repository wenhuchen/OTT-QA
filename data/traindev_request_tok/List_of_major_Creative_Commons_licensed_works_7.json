  "/wiki/CcMixter": "ccMixter is a produsage community music site that promotes remix culture and makes samples , remixes , and a cappella tracks licensed under Creative Commons available for download and re-use in creative works . Visitors are able to listen to , sample , mash-up , or interact with music in a variety of ways including the download and use of tracks and samples in their own remixes . Most sampling or mash-up web sites on the Internet stipulate that users forgo their rights to the new song once it is created . By contrast , the material on ccMixter.org is generally licensed to be used in any arena , not just the ccMixter site or a specific contest . The ccMixter site contains over 10,000 samples from a wide range of recording artists , including high-profile artists such as Beastie Boys and David Byrne . As a cultural phenomenon , ccMixter represents a direct response to what some say is the increasingly litigious attitude of organizations like the RIAA - one which prevents artists from appropriating elements of others ' work for creative reuse in their own . The site originated as a project of Creative Commons , with the idea being conceived of and developed by Neeru Paharia ( then Assistant Director of Creative Commons ) as a Friendster for music with the intent of exposing the genealogy of remixed music . The vision was both to create a body of openly licensed music , and to motivate artists to share by exposing how their work was being used by other artists in their remixes . Paharia hired Victor Stone ( a developer and musician ) to build the website , who then became the site 's administrator , and project lead . In 2009 Creative Commons licensed the name 'ccMixter ' and transferred operations to ArtisTech Media , a company run by members of the ccMixter community . The project maintains close organizational ties to independent minded , open music labels such as Magnatune and BBE . The site runs on ccHost , an award-winning open source multimedia content management system that is able to keep track of how content is being remixed .",
