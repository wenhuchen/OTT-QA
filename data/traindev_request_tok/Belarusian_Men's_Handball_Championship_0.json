Ketones and aldehydes are simple compounds that contain a carbonyl group ( a carbon-oxygen double bond ) . They are considered simple because they do not have reactive groups like \u2212OH or \u2212Cl attached directly to the carbon atom in the carbonyl group , as in carboxylic acids containing \u2212COOH . Many ketones are known and many are of great importance in industry and in biology . Examples include many sugars ( ketoses ) and the industrial solvent acetone , which is the smallest ketone ."
