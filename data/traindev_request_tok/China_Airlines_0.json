  "/wiki/Taiwan": "Taiwan ( Chinese : \u81fa\u7063 ; pinyin : T\u00e1iw\u0101n ) , [ II ] officially the Republic of China ( ROC ) , [ I ] is a state in East Asia . Neighbouring states include the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) to the north-west , Japan to the north-east , and the Philippines to the south . The island of Taiwan has an area of 35,808 square kilometres ( 13,826 sq mi ) , with mountain ranges dominating the eastern two-thirds and plains in the western third , where its highly urbanised population is concentrated . Taipei is the capital and largest metropolitan area . Other major cities include Kaohsiung , Taichung , Tainan and Taoyuan . With 23.7 million inhabitants , Taiwan is among the most densely populated states , and is the most populous state and largest economy that is not a member of the United Nations ( UN ) . Taiwanese indigenous peoples settled the island of Taiwan around 6,000 years ago . In the 17th century , Dutch rule opened the island to mass Han immigration . After the brief Kingdom of Tungning in parts of the southern and western areas of the island , the island was annexed in 1683 by the Qing dynasty of China , and ceded to the Empire of Japan in 1895 . Following the surrender of Japan in 1945 , the Republic of China , which had overthrown and succeeded the Qing in 1911 , took control of Taiwan on behalf of the World War II Allies . The resumption of the Chinese Civil War led to the loss of the mainland to the Communist Party of China and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949 . Although the ROC government continued to claim to be the legitimate representative of China , since 1950 its effective jurisdiction has been limited to Taiwan and numerous smaller islands .",

The first airline was the German airship company DELAG , founded on 16 November 1909 . The four oldest non-airship airlines that still exist are the Netherlands ' KLM ( 1919 ) , Colombia 's Avianca ( 1919 ) , Australia 's Qantas ( 1921 ) and the Czech Republic 's Czech Airlines ( 1923 ) . Airline ownership has seen a shift from mostly personal ownership until the 1930s to government-ownership of major airlines from the 1940s to 1980s and back to large-scale privatisation following the mid-1980s . Since the 1980s , there has also been a trend of major airline mergers and the formation of airline alliances . The largest alliances are Star Alliance , SkyTeam and Oneworld , and these three collectively accounted for more than 60% of global commercial air traffic in 2015 . Airline alliances coordinate their passenger service programs ( such as lounges and frequent-flyer programs ) , offer special interline tickets and often engage in extensive codesharing ( sometimes systemwide ) . As of 2019 [ update ] , the largest airline by passengers carried and fleet size was the American Airlines Group , while Delta Air Lines was the largest by revenue .
