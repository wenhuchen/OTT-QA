The Chorale ceased operations permanently in 1965 , shortly before Shaw assumed the post of Music Director of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra . During its existence the Robert Shaw Chorale became arguably the best-known and most widely respected professional choral organization in the United States , with repertoire ranging from J.S . Bach to folk music and Broadway theatre tunes . The group 's album recording Christmas Hymns And Carols released in November 1957 was certified gold in August 1964 by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . This recording peaked at # 5 on Billboard 's Top Pop Album Chart . The group made several tours sponsored by the U.S. State Department as part of a cultural exchange program , including 21 European and Mid-eastern countries in 1956 ; South America ; and in 1962 , a seven-week tour of Russia . The Robert Shaw Chorale was notable for its homogeneity of tone , finely wrought balances between vocal sections , elegance of phrasing , and rhythmic vitality . Many of its members were recruited from Juilliard and other NYC-area conservatories , sometimes to the consternation of those singers voice teachers : Shaw was fond in later years of relating that when he was preparing to take the Chorale on a grueling U.S. tour of 36 one-night stands performing Bachs lengthy Mass in B Minor , several teachers protested that he would ruin their students voices . At the end of the tour , when teachers remarked with astonishment that the voices had actually improved , Shaw replied to the effect that Bach has been teaching singing . Alumni of the Chorale include a number of singers who had significant careers as solo artists , including sopranos Yvonne Ciannella and Shirlee Emmons , alto Florence Kopleff , tenors Seth McCoy and Jon Humphrey , and baritone Thomas Pyle ; and several others who have worked with distinction as directors of their own choruses , such as Clayton Krehbiel , Donald Craig , and Maurice Casey .",
