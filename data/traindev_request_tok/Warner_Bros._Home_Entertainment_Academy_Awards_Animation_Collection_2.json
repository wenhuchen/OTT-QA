Essentially the polar opposite of Avery 's other MGM character , the loud and wacky Screwy Squirrel , Droopy moves slowly and lethargically , speaks in a jowly monotone voice , and - though hardly an imposing character - is shrewd enough to outwit his enemies . When finally roused to anger , often by a bad guy laughing heartily at him , Droopy is capable of beating adversaries many times his size with a comical thrashing ( You know what ? That makes me mad ! ) . The character first appeared , nameless , in Avery 's 1943 cartoon Dumb-Hounded . Though he was not called Droopy onscreen until his fifth cartoon , Se\u00f1or Droopy ( 1949 ) , the character was already named Droopy in model sheets for his first cartoon . He was officially first labeled Happy Hound , a name used in the character 's appearances in Our Gang Comics . The original Droopy series ended in 1958 as a result of MGM closing its cartoon department , but the character has been revived several times for new productions including films and television shows also featuring MGM 's other famous cartoon stars , Tom and Jerry , either as their ally or enemy .
