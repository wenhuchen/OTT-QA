Its area is about 660,000 square kilometres ( 250,000 sq mi ) . Alberta and its neighbour Saskatchewan were districts of the Northwest Territories until they were established as provinces on September 1 , 1905 . The premier is Jason Kenney as of April 30 , 2019 . Alberta is bordered by the provinces of British Columbia to the west and Saskatchewan to the east , the Northwest Territories to the north , and the U.S. state of Montana to the south . Alberta is one of three Canadian provinces and territories to border only a single U.S. state and one of only two landlocked provinces . It has a predominantly humid continental climate , with stark contrasts over a year ; but seasonal temperature average swings are smaller than in areas further east , due to winters being warmed by occasional chinook winds bringing sudden warming . Alberta 's capital , Edmonton , is near the geographic centre of the province and is the primary supply and service hub for Canada 's crude oil , the Athabasca oil sands and other northern resource industries . About 290 km ( 180 mi ) south of the capital is Calgary , the largest city in Alberta .

The district consisted of the Canadian high Arctic Islands , notably Ellesmere Island , Baffin Island , and Victoria Island . The district also contained the mainland Melville Peninsula and Boothia Peninsula . English navigators Martin Frobisher and Henry Hudson were the first Europeans known to have visited the area ( although Viking sailors , coming from Greenland , may have made occasional landings and hunting treks on Baffin Island in the 11th and 12th centuries ) . The area was transferred from British colonial authority to the Dominion of Canada in 1894 and named after Sir John Franklin in the following year ; however , the northernmost islands were claimed by Norway until the year 1930 . Along with the District of Keewatin and the District of Mackenzie , it was one of the three districts of the old Northwest Territories before the formation of Nunavut in 1999 , at which point the district ceased to exist , although as an administrative district of the NWT it had ceased to function several years prior to the splitting off of Nunavut . The area of the former District of Franklin was divided between the remaining portion of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut . In the process , Victoria Island was divided with approximately two-thirds of its area falling in Nunavut , and several other islands were also divided between the two territories .",

On the southwest it is connected to the mainland by the Rae Isthmus named after arctic explorer Dr John Rae . Between 1821 and 1823 its east side was mapped by William Edward Parry . Since 1999 , it has been part of Nunavut . Before that , it was part of the District of Franklin . Most of the peninsula lies in Nunavut 's Qikiqtaaluk Region , while its southwesternmost section , around Repulse Bay , lies in the Kivalliq Region .

On April 1 , 1999 , the Keewatin Region was formally dissolved , as Nunavut was created from eastern parts of the Northwest Territories , including all of Keewatin .

It has the smallest population of any province or territory in Canada , with a population of 35,874 people . Whitehorse , the territorial capital and Yukon 's only city , is the largest settlement in any of the three territories . Yukon was split from the Northwest Territories in 1898 and was originally named the Yukon Territory . The federal government 's Yukon Act , which received royal assent on March 27 , 2002 , established Yukon as the territory 's official name , though Yukon Territory is also still popular in usage and Canada Post continues to use the territory 's internationally approved postal abbreviation of YT . Though officially bilingual ( English and French ) , the Yukon government also recognizes First Nations languages . At 5,959 m ( 19,551 ft ) , Yukon 's Mount Logan , in Kluane National Park and Reserve , is the highest mountain in Canada and the second-highest on the North American continent ( after Denali in the U.S. state of Alaska ) . Most of Yukon has a subarctic climate , characterized by long , cold winters and brief , warm summers . The Arctic Ocean coast has a tundra climate .

Manitoba covers 649,950 square kilometres ( 250,900 sq mi ) with a widely varied landscape , stretching from the northern oceanic coastline to the southern border with the United States . The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south . Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived on two major river systems , what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system . A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson 's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert 's Land . During the next 200 years , communities continued to grow and evolve , with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg . The assertion of M\u00e9tis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba . There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the M\u00e9tis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion . The resolution of the assertion of the right to representation led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 that created the province .

  "/wiki/History_of_Yukon": "Yukon ( formerly the Yukon Territory ) is one of Canada 's three territories in the country 's extreme northwest . Its history of human habitation dates back to the Ice Age , and the original inhabitants are believed to have arrived over 20,000 years ago by migrating over the land bridge from Asia . In the 18th century , Russian explorers began trade with the First Nations people along the Alaskan coast , beginning the establishment of trade relations throughout the region . The famous Klondike Gold Rush began after gold was discovered near Dawson City in 1896 . As a result of the influx of people looking for gold , it was made a separate territory in 1898 , split off from the Northwest Territories . The second major event in the Yukon 's history is the construction of the Alaska Highway during the Second World War , for the transportation of war supplies . Eventually Whitehorse became the largest city in the Yukon , and then the capital in 1953 .",
  "/wiki/Klondike_Gold_Rush": "The Klondike Gold Rush [ n 1 ] was a migration by an estimated 100,000 prospectors to the Klondike region of the Yukon , in north-western Canada , between 1896 and 1899 . Gold was discovered there by local miners on August 16 , 1896 , and , when news reached Seattle and San Francisco the following year , it triggered a stampede of prospectors . Some became wealthy , but the majority went in vain . It has been immortalized in artifacts , films , games , literature , and photographs . To reach the gold fields , most prospectors took the route through the ports of Dyea and Skagway , in Southeast Alaska . Here , the Klondikers could follow either the Chilkoot or the White Pass trails to the Yukon River , and sail down to the Klondike . The Canadian authorities required each of them to bring a year 's supply of food , in order to prevent starvation . In all , the Klondikers ' equipment weighed close to a ton , which most carried themselves , in stages . Performing this task , and contending with the mountainous terrain and cold climate , meant those who persisted did not arrive until summer 1898 . Once there , they found few opportunities , and many left disappointed . Mining was challenging , as the ore was distributed unevenly , and permafrost made digging slow . Consequently , some miners chose to buy and sell claims , build up huge investments , and let others do the work ."
