  "/wiki/VisiCalc": "VisiCalc ( for visible calculator ) was the first spreadsheet computer program for personal computers , originally released for the Apple II by VisiCorp . It is often considered the application that turned the microcomputer from a hobby for computer enthusiasts into a serious business tool , prompting IBM to introduce the IBM PC two years later . VisiCalc is considered the Apple II 's killer app . It sold over 700,000 copies in six years , and as many as 1 million copies over its history . Initially developed for the Apple II using a 6502 assembler running on the Multics time sharing system , VisiCalc was ported to numerous platforms , both 8-bit and some of the early 16-bit systems . In order to do this , the company developed porting platforms that produced bug compatible versions . The company took the same approach when the IBM PC was launched , producing a product that was essentially identical to the original 8-bit Apple II version . Sales were initially brisk , with about 300,000 copies sold . VisiCalc used the A1 notation in formulas . When Lotus 1-2-3 was launched in 1983 , taking full advantage of the expanded memory and screen of the PC , VisiCalc sales ended almost overnight . Sales declined so rapidly that the company was soon insolvent . Lotus Development purchased the company in 1985 , and immediately ended sales of VisiCalc and the company 's other products .",

  "/wiki/Space_Shuttle": "The Space Shuttle is a partially reusable low Earth orbital spacecraft system that was operated from 1981 to 2011 by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) as part of the Space Shuttle program . Its official program name was Space Transportation System ( STS ) , taken from a 1969 plan for a system of reusable spacecraft of which it was the only item funded for development . The first of four orbital test flights occurred in 1981 , leading to operational flights beginning in 1982 . In addition to the prototype whose completion was cancelled , five complete Shuttle systems were built and used on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011 , launched from the Kennedy Space Center ( KSC ) in Florida . Operational missions launched numerous satellites , interplanetary probes , and the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) ; conducted science experiments in orbit ; and participated in construction and servicing of the International Space Station . The Shuttle fleet 's total mission time was 1322 days , 19 hours , 21 minutes and 23 seconds . Shuttle components include the Orbiter Vehicle ( OV ) with three clustered Rocketdyne RS-25 main engines , a pair of recoverable solid rocket boosters ( SRBs ) , and the expendable external tank ( ET ) containing liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen . The Space Shuttle was launched vertically , like a conventional rocket , with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV 's three main engines , which were fueled from the ET . The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit , and the ET was jettisoned just before orbit insertion , which used the orbiter 's two Orbital Maneuvering System ( OMS ) engines . At the conclusion of the mission , the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and reenter the atmosphere . The orbiter then glided as a spaceplane to a runway landing , usually to the Shuttle Landing Facility at Kennedy Space Center , Florida or Rogers Dry Lake in Edwards Air Force Base , California . After landing at Edwards , the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft , a specially modified Boeing 747 .",

  "/wiki/Automated_teller_machine": "An automated teller machine ( ATM ) is an electronic telecommunications device that enables customers of financial institutions to perform financial transactions , such as cash withdrawals , deposits , funds transfers , or account information inquiries , at any time and without the need for direct interaction with bank staff . ATMs are known by a variety of names , including automatic teller machine ( ATM ) in the United States ( sometimes redundantly as ATM machine ) . In Canada , the term automated banking machine ( ABM ) is used , , although ATM is also very commonly used in Canada , with many Canadian organizations using ATM over ABM . In British English , the terms cashpoint , cash machine and hole in the wall are most widely used . Other terms include any time money , cashline , nibank , tyme machine , cash dispenser , cash corner , bankomat , or bancomat . Many ATMs have a sign above them indicating the name of the bank or organisation that owns the ATM , and possibly including the networks to which it can connect . ATMs that are not operated by a financial institution are known as white-label ATMs . Using an ATM , customers can access their bank deposit or credit accounts in order to make a variety of financial transactions , most notably cash withdrawals and balance checking , as well as transferring credit to and from mobile phones . ATMs can also be used to withdraw cash in a foreign country . If the currency being withdrawn from the ATM is different from that in which the bank account is denominated , the money will be converted at the financial institution 's exchange rate . Customers are typically identified by inserting a plastic ATM card ( or some other acceptable payment card ) into the ATM , with authentication being by the customer entering a personal identification number ( PIN ) , which must match the PIN stored in the chip on the card ( if the card is so equipped ) , or in the issuing financial institution 's database .

The story was mostly written at Barnhill , a farmhouse on the Scottish island of Jura , at times while Orwell suffered from severe tuberculosis . Thematically , Nineteen Eighty-Four centres on the consequences of government over-reach , totalitarianism , mass surveillance , and repressive regimentation of all persons and behaviours within society . The story takes place in an imagined future , the year 1984 , when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war , omnipresent government surveillance , historical negationism , and propaganda . Great Britain , known as Airstrip One , has become a province of a superstate named Oceania that is ruled by the Party who employ the Thought Police to persecute individuality and independent thinking . Big Brother , the leader of the Party , enjoys an intense cult of personality despite the fact that he may not exist . The protagonist , Winston Smith , is a diligent and skillful rank-and-file worker and Party member who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion . He enters a forbidden relationship with a co-worker , Julia . Nineteen Eighty-Four has become a classic literary example of political and dystopian fiction . Many terms used in the novel have entered common usage , including Big Brother , doublethink , thoughtcrime , Newspeak , Room 101 , telescreen , 2 + 2 = 5 , prole , and memory hole .

  "/wiki/Fantasia_(1940_film)": "Fantasia is a 1940 American animated film produced by Walt Disney and released by Walt Disney Productions . With story direction by Joe Grant and Dick Huemer , and production supervision by Ben Sharpsteen , it is the third Disney animated feature film . The film consists of eight animated segments set to pieces of classical music conducted by Leopold Stokowski , seven of which are performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra . Music critic and composer Deems Taylor acts as the film 's Master of Ceremonies , providing a live-action introduction to each animated segment . Disney settled on the film 's concept as work neared completion on The Sorcerer 's Apprentice , an elaborate Silly Symphonies short designed as a comeback role for Mickey Mouse , who had declined in popularity . As production costs grew higher than what it could earn , Disney decided to include the short in a feature-length film with other segments set to classical pieces . The soundtrack was recorded using multiple audio channels and reproduced with Fantasound , a pioneering sound reproduction system that made Fantasia the first commercial film shown in stereophonic sound . Fantasia was first released as a theatrical roadshow held in thirteen U.S. cities from November 13 , 1940 . While acclaimed by critics , it was unable to make a profit due to World War II cutting off distribution to the European market , the film 's high production costs , and the expense of leasing theatres and installing the Fantasound equipment for the roadshow presentations . The film was subsequently reissued multiple times with its original footage and audio being deleted , modified , or restored in each version . Fantasia is the 23rd highest-grossing film of all time in the U.S. when adjusted for inflation . The Fantasia franchise has grown to include video games , Disneyland attractions , and a live concert .",

It was strongly influenced by Taoist philosophy , especially Neo-Daoist thought , and developed as a distinct school of Chinese Buddhism . From China , Ch\u00e1n spread south to Vietnam and became Vietnamese Thi\u1ec1n , northeast to Korea to become Seon Buddhism , and east to Japan , becoming Japanese Zen . The term Zen is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Middle Chinese word \u79aa ( Ch\u00e1n ) , which traces its roots to the Indian practice of dhy\u0101na ( meditation ) . [ note 1 ] Zen emphasizes rigorous self-restraint , meditation-practice , insight into the nature of mind ( Ch . jianxing , Jp . kensho , perceiving the true nature ) and nature of things , and the personal expression of this insight in daily life , especially for the benefit of others . As such , it de-emphasizes mere knowledge of sutras and doctrine and favors direct understanding through spiritual practice and interaction with an accomplished teacher . The teachings of Zen include various sources of Mahayana thought , especially Yogachara , the Tath\u0101gatagarbha s\u016btras , the La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra , and the Huayan school , with their emphasis on Buddha-nature , totality , and the Bodhisattva-ideal .

The boom ended when the Panic of 1893 led to a collapse in the silver market , and the city began a half-century known as the quiet years during which its population steadily declined , reaching a nadir of fewer than a thousand by 1930 . Aspen 's fortunes reversed in the mid-20th century when neighboring Aspen Mountain was developed into a ski resort , and industrialist Walter Paepcke bought many properties in the city in the 1950s and redeveloped them .

Although ENIAC was designed and primarily used to calculate artillery firing tables for the United States Army 's Ballistic Research Laboratory ( which later became a part of the Army Research Laboratory ) , its first program was a study of the feasibility of the thermonuclear weapon . ENIAC was completed in 1945 and first put to work for practical purposes on December 10 , 1945 . ENIAC was formally dedicated at the University of Pennsylvania on February 15 , 1946 and was heralded as a Giant Brain by the press . It had a speed on the order of one thousand times faster than that of electro-mechanical machines ; this computational power , coupled with general-purpose programmability , excited scientists and industrialists alike . The combination of speed and programmability allowed for thousands more calculations for problems , as ENIAC calculated a trajectory in 30 seconds that took a human 20 hours ( allowing one ENIAC hour to displace 2,400 human hours ) . The completed machine was announced to the public the evening of February 14 , 1946 and formally dedicated the next day at the University of Pennsylvania , having cost almost $ 500,000 ( approximately $ 6,300,000 today ) . It was formally accepted by the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps in July 1946 .

  "/wiki/Apollo_program": "The Apollo program , also known as Project Apollo , was the third United States human spaceflight program carried out by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) , which succeeded in landing the first humans on the Moon from 1969 to 1972 . First conceived during Dwight D. Eisenhower 's administration as a three-person spacecraft to follow the one-person Project Mercury which put the first Americans in space , Apollo was later dedicated to the national goal set by President John F. Kennedy of landing a man on the Moon by the end of this decade and returning him safely to the Earth in an address to Congress on May 25 , 1961 . It was the third US human spaceflight program to fly , preceded by the two-person Project Gemini conceived in 1961 to extend spaceflight capability in support of Apollo . Kennedy 's goal was accomplished on the Apollo 11 mission when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed their Apollo Lunar Module ( LM ) on July 20 , 1969 , and walked on the lunar surface , while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the command and service module ( CSM ) , and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24 . Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon , the last in December 1972 . In these six spaceflights , twelve men walked on the Moon .",
  "/wiki/Laserdisc": "LaserDisc ( abbreviated as LD ) is a home video format and the first commercial optical disc storage medium , initially licensed , sold and marketed as MCA DiscoVision in the United States in 1978 . Although the format was capable of offering higher-quality video and audio than its consumer rivals , VHS and Betamax videotape , LaserDisc never managed to gain widespread use in North America , largely due to high costs for the players and video titles themselves and the inability to record TV programs . However , it eventually did gain some traction in that region and became somewhat popular in the 1990s . It was not a popular format in Europe and Australia . By contrast , the format was much more popular in Japan and in the more affluent regions of Southeast Asia , such as Hong Kong , Singapore and Malaysia , and was the prevalent rental video medium in Hong Kong during the 1990s . Its superior video and audio quality made it a popular choice among videophiles and film enthusiasts during its lifespan .

It is imperative , procedural and , since 2002 , object-oriented . COBOL is primarily used in business , finance , and administrative systems for companies and governments . COBOL is still widely used in legacy applications deployed on mainframe computers , such as large-scale batch and transaction processing jobs . But due to its declining popularity and the retirement of experienced COBOL programmers , programs are being migrated to new platforms , rewritten in modern languages or replaced with software packages . Most programming in COBOL is now purely to maintain existing applications . COBOL was designed in 1959 by CODASYL and was partly based on previous programming language design work by Grace Hopper , commonly referred to as the ( grand ) mother of COBOL . It was created as part of a US Department of Defense effort to create a portable programming language for data processing . It was originally seen as a stopgap , but the Department of Defense promptly forced computer manufacturers to provide it , resulting in its widespread adoption . It was standardized in 1968 and has since been revised four times . Expansions include support for structured and object-oriented programming . The current standard is ISO/IEC 1989:2014 .",
  "/wiki/Apple_Lisa": "Lisa is a desktop computer developed by Apple , released on January 19 , 1983 . It is one of the first personal computers to present a graphical user interface ( GUI ) in a machine aimed at individual business users . Development of the Lisa began in 1978 , and it underwent many changes during the development period before shipping at US $ 9,995 with a five-megabyte hard drive . The Lisa was challenged by a relatively high price , insufficient software library , unreliable Apple FileWare ( Twiggy ) floppy disks , and the immediate release of the cheaper and faster Macintosh - yielding lifelong sales of only 10,000 units in two years . In 1982 , after Steve Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project , he appropriated the existing Macintosh project , which Jef Raskin had conceived in 1979 and led to develop a text-based appliance computer . Jobs immediately redefined Macintosh as a cheaper and more usable version of the graphical Lisa . Macintosh was launched in January 1984 , quickly surpassing Lisa sales , and assimilating increasing numbers of Lisa staff . Newer Lisa models were introduced that addressed its faults and lowered its price considerably , but the platform failed to achieve favorable sales compared to the much less expensive Mac . The final model , the Lisa 2/10 , was modified as the high end of the Macintosh series , the Macintosh XL . Considered a commercial failure but with technical acclaim , the Lisa introduced a number of advanced features that would not reappear on the Macintosh or the PC platform for many years . Among those is an operating system with protected memory and a more document-oriented workflow . The hardware overall is more advanced than the Macintosh , with a hard drive , support for up to 2 megabytes ( MB ) of random-access memory ( RAM ) , expansion slots , and a larger , higher-resolution display .",
  "/wiki/Hamurabi": "Hammurabi [ a ] ( c. 1810 - c. 1750 BC ) was the sixth king of the First Babylonian dynasty of the Amorite tribe reigning from c. 1792 BC to c. 1750 BC ( according to the Middle Chronology ) . He was preceded by his father , Sin-Muballit , who abdicated due to failing health . During his reign , he conquered Elam and the city-states of Larsa , Eshnunna , and Mari . He ousted Ishme-Dagan I , the king of Assyria , and forced his son Mut-Ashkur to pay tribute , bringing almost all of Mesopotamia under Babylonian rule . Hammurabi is best known for having issued the Code of Hammurabi , which he claimed to have received from Shamash , the Babylonian god of justice . Unlike earlier Sumerian law codes , such as the Code of Ur-Nammu , which had focused on compensating the victim of the crime , the Law of Hammurabi was one of the first law codes to place greater emphasis on the physical punishment of the perpetrator . It prescribed specific penalties for each crime and is among the first codes to establish the presumption of innocence . Although its penalties are extremely harsh by modern standards , they were intended to limit what a wronged person was permitted to do in retribution . The Code of Hammurabi and the Law of Moses in the Torah contain numerous similarities . Hammurabi was seen by many as a god within his own lifetime . After his death , Hammurabi was revered as a great conqueror who spread civilization and forced all peoples to pay obeisance to Marduk , the national god of the Babylonians . Later , his military accomplishments became de-emphasized and his role as the ideal lawgiver became the primary aspect of his legacy .",

He was the founder of the Lyceum and the Peripatetic school of philosophy and Aristotelian tradition . Along with his teacher Plato , he has been called the Father of Western Philosophy . His writings cover many subjects - including physics , biology , zoology , metaphysics , logic , ethics , aesthetics , poetry , theatre , music , rhetoric , psychology , linguistics , economics , politics and government . Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him , and it was above all from his teachings that the West inherited its intellectual lexicon , as well as problems and methods of inquiry . As a result , his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion . Little is known about his life . Aristotle was born in the city of Stagira in Northern Greece . His father , Nicomachus , died when Aristotle was a child , and he was brought up by a guardian . At seventeen or eighteen years of age , he joined Plato 's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven ( c. 347 BC ) . Shortly after Plato died , Aristotle left Athens and , at the request of Philip II of Macedon , tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC . He established a library in the Lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls .",

It first aired in 10 local outlets , including Twin Falls , Idaho , where Chiat\\Day ran the ad on December 31 , 1983 , at the last possible break before midnight on KMVT , so that the advertisement qualified for the 1984 Clio Awards . Its second televised airing , and only national airing , was on January 22 , 1984 , during a break in the third quarter of the telecast of Super Bowl XVIII by CBS . In one interpretation of the commercial , 1984 used the unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh ( indicated by her white tank top with a stylized line drawing of Apples Macintosh computer on it ) as a means of saving humanity from conformity ( Big Brother ) . These images were an allusion to George Orwell 's noted novel , Nineteen Eighty-Four , which described a dystopian future ruled by a televised Big Brother . The estate of George Orwell and the television rightsholder to the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four considered the commercial to be a copyright infringement and sent a cease-and-desist letter to Apple and Chiat\\Day in April 1984 .

  "/wiki/Telegraphy": "Telegraphy is the long-distance transmission of textual messages where the sender uses symbolic codes , known to the recipient , rather than a physical exchange of an object bearing the message . Thus flag semaphore is a method of telegraphy , whereas pigeon post is not . Ancient signalling systems , although sometimes quite extensive and sophisticated as in China , were generally not capable of transmitting arbitrary text messages . Possible messages were fixed and predetermined and such systems are thus not true telegraphs . The earliest true telegraph put into widespread use was the optical telegraph of Claude Chappe , invented in the late 18th century . The system was extensively used in France , and European countries controlled by France , during the Napoleonic era . The electric telegraph started to replace the optical telegraph in the mid-19th century . It was first taken up in Britain in the form of the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph , initially used mostly as an aid to railway signalling . This was quickly followed by a different system developed in the United States by Samuel Morse . The electric telegraph was slower to develop in France due to the established optical telegraph system , but an electrical telegraph was put into use with a code compatible with the Chappe optical telegraph . The Morse system was adopted as the international standard in 1865 , using a modified Morse code developed in Germany . The heliograph is a telegraph system using reflected sunlight for signalling .",
  "/wiki/Macintosh": "The Macintosh ( mainly Mac since 1998 ) is a family of personal computers designed , manufactured , and sold by Apple Inc. since January 1984 . The original Macintosh is the first successful mass-market personal computer to have featured a graphical user interface , built-in screen , and mouse . Apple sold the Macintosh alongside its popular Apple II family of computers for almost ten years until the latter was discontinued in 1993 . Early Macintosh models were expensive , hindering competitiveness in a market dominated by the much cheaper Commodore 64 for consumers , as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses . Although they were less expensive than the Xerox Alto and other computers with graphical user interfaces that predated the Mac . Macintosh systems were successful in education and desktop publishing , making Apple the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade . In the early 1990s , Apple introduced the Macintosh LC II and Color Classic which were price-competitive with Wintel machines at the time . However , the introduction of Windows 3.1 and Intel 's Pentium processor which beat the Motorola 68040 in most benchmarks , gradually took market share from Apple , and by the end of 1994 Apple was relegated to third place as Compaq became the top PC manufacturer . Even after the transition to the superior PowerPC-based Power Macintosh line in the mid-1990s , the falling prices of commodity PC components , poor inventory management with the Macintosh Performa , and the release of Windows 95 contributed to some decline of the Macintosh user base . Upon his return , Steve Jobs led Apple to consolidate the complex line of nearly twenty Macintosh models in mid-1997 ( including models made for specific regions ) down to four in mid-1999 : the Power Macintosh G3 , iMac , 14.1 PowerBook G3 , and 12 iBook . All four products were critically and commercially successful due to their high performance , competitive prices and aesthetic designs , and helped return Apple to profitability . Around this time , Apple phased out the Macintosh name in favor of Mac , a nickname that had been in common use since the development of the first model .",
  "/wiki/Public_relations": "Public relations ( PR ) is the practice of deliberately managing the spread of information between an individual or an organization ( such as a business , government agency , or a nonprofit organization ) and the public . Public relations may include an organization or individual gaining exposure to their audiences using topics of public interest and news items that do not require direct payment . This differentiates it from advertising as a form of marketing communications . Public relations is the idea of creating coverage for clients for free , rather than marketing or advertising . But now , advertising is also a part of greater PR Activities . An example of good public relations would be generating an article featuring a client , rather than paying for the client to be advertised next to the article . The aim of public relations is to inform the public , prospective customers , investors , partners , employees , and other stakeholders and ultimately persuade them to maintain a positive or favorable view about the organization , its leadership , products , or political decisions . Public relations professionals typically work for PR and marketing firms , businesses and companies , government , and public officials as PIOs and nongovernmental organizations , and nonprofit organizations .

In May 1987 , Sculley was named Silicon Valley 's top-paid executive , with an annual salary of US $ 10.2 million . :412 Sales at Apple increased from $ 800 million to $ 8 billion under Sculley 's management , although many attribute his success to the fact that Sculley joined the company just when Steve Jobs ' visions and Steve Wozniak 's creations had become highly lucrative . However , his stint at Apple remains controversial due to his departure from co-founder Steve Jobs 's sales structure , particularly regarding Sculley 's decision to compete with IBM in selling computers to the same types of customers . Others say that the two clashed over management styles and priorities , Jobs focusing on future innovation and Sculley more on current product lines and profitability . But Sculley ultimately was forced to step down as Apple CEO because he was opposed to licensing Macintosh software and was talking to Goldman-Sachs about splitting Apple into two companies . When Sculley left in May 1993 , Apple had $ 2 billion in cash and $ 200 million in debt . Sculley is recognized as an expert in marketing , in part because of his early successes at PepsiCo , notably his introduction of the Pepsi Challenge , which allowed the company to gain market share from primary rival Coca-Cola . He used similar marketing strategies throughout the 1980s and 1990s at Apple to mass-market Macintosh personal computers , and today he continues to speak and write about disruptive marketing strategies .

  "/wiki/Dark_Ages_(historiography)": "The Dark Ages is a historical periodization traditionally referring to the Middle Ages that asserts that a demographic , cultural , and economic deterioration occurred in Western Europe following the decline of the Roman Empire . The term employs traditional light-versus-darkness imagery to contrast the era 's darkness ( lack of records ) with earlier and later periods of light ( abundance of records ) . The concept of a Dark Age originated in the 1330s with the Italian scholar Petrarch , who regarded the post-Roman centuries as dark compared to the light of classical antiquity . The phrase Dark Age itself derives from the Latin saeculum obscurum , originally applied by Caesar Baronius in 1602 to a tumultuous period in the 10th and 11th centuries . The concept thus came to characterize the entire Middle Ages as a time of intellectual darkness between the fall of Rome and the Renaissance ; this became especially popular during the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment . As the accomplishments of the era came to be better understood in the 19th and 20th centuries , scholars began restricting the Dark Ages appellation to the Early Middle Ages ( c. 5th-10th century ) , and now scholars also reject its usage in this period . The majority of modern scholars avoid the term altogether due to its negative connotations , finding it misleading and inaccurate . The pejorative meaning remains in use , typically in popular culture which often mischaracterises the Middle Ages as a time of violence and backwardness .",

Since the 1980s , video games have become an increasingly important part of the entertainment industry , and whether they are also a form of art is a matter of dispute . The electronic systems used to play video games are called platforms . Video games are developed and released for one or several platforms and may not be available on others . Specialized platforms such as arcade games , which present the game in a large , typically coin-operated chassis , were common in the 1980s in video arcades , but declined in popularity as other , more affordable platforms became available . These include dedicated devices such as video game consoles , as well as general-purpose computers like a laptop , desktop or handheld computing devices . The input device used for games , the game controller , varies across platforms . Common controllers include gamepads , joysticks , mouse devices , keyboards , the touchscreens of mobile devices , or even a person 's body , using a Kinect sensor . Players view the game on a display device such as a television or computer monitor or sometimes on virtual reality head-mounted display goggles . There are often game sound effects , music and voice actor lines which come from loudspeakers or headphones .

Desktop publishing often requires the use of a personal computer and WYSIWYG page layout software to create documents for either large-scale publishing or small-scale local multifunction peripheral output and distribution - although a non-WYSIWYG system such as LaTeX could also be used for the creation of highly-structured and technically-demanding documents as well . Desktop publishing methods provide more control over design , layout , and typography than word processing . However , word processing software has evolved to include most , if not all , capabilities previously available only with professional printing or desktop publishing . The same DTP skills and software used for common paper and book publishing are sometimes used to create graphics for point of sale displays , presentations , infographics , brochures , business cards , promotional items , trade show exhibits , retail package designs and outdoor signs . Although what is classified as DTP software is usually limited to print and PDF publications , DTP is n't limited to print . The content produced by desktop publishers may also be exported and used for electronic media . The job descriptions that include DTP , such as DTP artist , often require skills using software for producing e-books , web content , and web pages , which may involve web design or user interface design for any graphical user interface .",

  "/wiki/ARPANET": "The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) was an early packet-switching network and the first network to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite . Both technologies became the technical foundation of the Internet . The ARPANET was initially founded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency ( ARPA ) of the United States Department of Defense . The packet-switching methodology employed in the ARPANET was based on concepts and designs by Paul Baran , Donald Davies , Leonard Kleinrock , and Lawrence Roberts . The ARPANET originally used the Network Control Program . Later , the TCP/IP communications protocols were developed by Robert Kahn and Vint Cerf , and incorporated concepts from the French CYCLADES project directed by Louis Pouzin ; the ARPANET switched to TCP/IP in 1983 . As the network development progressed , protocols for internetworking were developed by which multiple separate networks could be joined into a network of networks . Access to the ARPANET was expanded in 1981 , when the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) funded the Computer Science Network ( CSNET ) . In 1982 , the Internet protocol suite ( TCP/IP ) was introduced as the standard networking software stack in the ARPANET . In the early 1980s , the NSF funded the establishment of national supercomputing centers at several universities , and provided network access and network interconnectivity with the NSFNET project in 1986 . The ARPANET project was formally decommissioned in 1990 , after partnerships with the telecommunication industry paved the way of future commercialization of a new world-wide network , known as the Internet .",
  "/wiki/Douglas_Englebart": "Douglas Carl Engelbart ( January 30 , 1925 - July 2 , 2013 ) was an American engineer and inventor , and an early computer and Internet pioneer . He is best known for his work on founding the field of human-computer interaction , particularly while at his Augmentation Research Center Lab in SRI International , which resulted in creation of the computer mouse , and the development of hypertext , networked computers , and precursors to graphical user interfaces . These were demonstrated at The Mother of All Demos in 1968 . Engelbart 's law , the observation that the intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential , is named after him . In the early 1950s , he decided that instead of having a steady job - such as his position at Ames Research Center - he would focus on making the world a better place . He reasoned that because the complexity of the world 's problems was increasing , and because any effort to improve the world would require the coordination of groups of people , the most effective way to solve problems was to augment human intelligence and develop ways of building collective intelligence . He believed that the computer , which was at the time thought of only as a tool for automation , would be an essential tool for future knowledge workers to solve such problems . He was a committed , vocal proponent of the development and use of computers and computer networks to help cope with the world 's increasingly urgent and complex problems . Engelbart embedded a set of organizing principles in his lab , which he termed bootstrapping . His belief was that when human systems and tool systems were aligned , such that workers spent time improving their tools for improving their tools it would lead to an accelerating rate of progress . NLS , the oN-Line System , developed by the Augmentation Research Center under Engelbart 's guidance with funding primarily from ARPA ( as DARPA was then known ) , demonstrated numerous technologies , most of which are now in widespread use ; it included the computer mouse , bitmapped screens , hypertext ; all of which were displayed at The Mother of All Demos in 1968 . The lab was transferred from SRI to Tymshare in the late 1970s , which was acquired by McDonnell Douglas in 1984 , and NLS was renamed Augment ( now the Doug Engelbart Institute ) .",

  "/wiki/Blue_box": "In November 1954 , the Bell System Technical Journal published an article entitled In-Band Single-Frequency Signaling , which described the process used for routing telephone calls over trunk lines with the then-current signaling system , R1 . The article described the basics of the inter-office trunking system and the signals used to start , route , and end calls . In November 1960 , further technical details were disclosed in the Bell System Technical Journal in an article entitled Signaling Systems for Control of Telephone Switching . This article identified the specific single frequency ( SF ) and multi-frequency ( MF ) tones used to start and end calls , and to transmit the called number , on a long-distance connection . This engineering design assumed that these signals would only originate in the automatic switching equipment . The designers were aware that the in-band signaling method was subject to false signals arising in the telephone handset from ambient sounds , and chose the frequency of 2600 Hz because it was not present in normal speech . This choice performed well in the normal use of telephones . It was not foreseen , that a telephone user could insert control signals into the switching system by sending the appropriate tones into the telephone handset . Before the technical details were published , many users discovered unintentionally and to their annoyance that a 2600 Hz tone , used as a steady signal to mark currently unused long-distance telephone lines , or trunk lines , would reset those lines . Joe Engressia , known as Joybubbles , accidentally discovered it at the age of seven by whistling ( with his mouth ) . He and other famous phone phreaks , such as Bill from New York and The Glitch , trained themselves to whistle 2600 Hz to reset a trunk line . They also learned how to route telephone calls by causing trunks to flash in certain patterns [ clarification needed ] .",

  "/wiki/Alpha_compositing": "In computer graphics , alpha compositing is the process of combining one image with a background to create the appearance of partial or full transparency . It is often useful to render picture elements ( pixels ) in separate passes or layers and then combine the resulting 2D images into a single , final image called the composite . Compositing is used extensively in film when combining computer-rendered image elements with live footage . Alpha blending is also used in 2D computer graphics to put rasterized foreground elements over a background . In order to combine the picture elements of the images correctly , it is necessary to keep an associated matte for each element in addition to its color . This matte layer contains the coverage information - the shape of the geometry being drawn - making it possible to distinguish between parts of the image where something was drawn and parts that are empty . Although the most basic operation of combining two images is to put one over the other , there are many operations , or blend modes , that are used .",

  "/wiki/Situational_ethics": "Situational ethics or situation ethics takes into account the particular context of an act when evaluating it ethically , rather than judging it according to absolute moral standards . With the intent to have a fair basis for judgments or action , one looks to personal ideals of what is appropriate to guide them , rather than an unchanging universal code of conduct , such as Biblical law under divine command theory or the Kantian categorical imperative . Proponents of situational approaches to ethics include existentialist philosophers Sartre , de Beauvoir , Jaspers , and Heidegger . Specifically Christian forms of situational ethics placing love above all particular principles or rules were proposed in the first half of the twentieth century by liberal theologians Rudolf Bultmann , John A.

Other theologians who advocated situational ethics include Josef Fuchs , Reinhold Niebuhr , Karl Barth , Emil Brunner , and Paul Tillich . :33 Tillich , for example , declared that Love is the ultimate law . Fletcher , who became prominently associated with this approach in the English-speaking world due to his book ( Situation Ethics ) , stated that all laws and rules and principles and ideals and norms , are only contingent , only valid if they happen to serve love in the particular situation , :30 and thus may be broken or ignored if another course of action would achieve a more loving outcome .
