  "/wiki/King_Kamehameha_Golf_Course_Clubhouse": "The King Kamehameha Golf Course Clubhouse , formerly known as the Waikapu Valley Country Club , is a building in Waikapu , Maui , Hawaii . The structure is based on the unbuilt Arthur Miller house ( 1957 ) originally conceived by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright ( 1867-1959 ) . Wright designed the house for Arthur Miller 's wife , Marilyn Monroe ( 1926-1962 ) , but Miller and Monroe divorced soon after and the project was abandoned . The Arthur Miller house design was a modification of two previous unbuilt projects - the Ra\u00fal Baill\u00e8res house ( 1952 ) and before it , the Robert F. Windfohr house ( 1949 ) , also known as the Crownfield house . Wright 's work remained in the Taliesin archives for more than two decades until 1988 when Pundy Yokouchi and Howard Hamamoto visited Taliesin Architects in Scottsdale , Arizona , and expressed interest in building a Frank Lloyd Wright-designed golf clubhouse . Architect John Rattenbury combined all three unfinished Wright designs , enlarged them to meet the spatial requirements of a commercial clubhouse , and designed it to fit into the natural landscape of Waikapu 's hilly terrain . Construction of the clubhouse was completed in 1993 .

The Buffalo area was inhabited before the 17th century by the Native American Iroquois tribe and later by French colonizers . The city grew significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of immigration , the construction of the Erie Canal and rail transportation , and its close proximity to Lake Erie . This growth provided an abundance of fresh water and an ample trade route to the Midwestern United States while grooming its economy for the grain , steel and automobile industries that dominated the city 's economy in the 20th century . Since the city 's economy relied heavily on manufacturing , deindustrialization in the latter half of the 20th century led to a steady decline in population . While some manufacturing activity remains , Buffalo 's economy has transitioned to service industries with a greater emphasis on healthcare , research and higher education , which emerged following the Great Recession . Buffalo is on the eastern shore of Lake Erie , at the head of the Niagara River , 16 miles ( 26 km ) south of Niagara Falls .

  "/wiki/Filling_Station": "A filling station is a facility that sells fuel and engine lubricants for motor vehicles . The most common fuels sold in the 2010s are gasoline ( gasoline or gas in the United States and Canada , generally petrol elsewhere ) and diesel fuel . A filling station that sells only electric energy is also known as a charging station , while a typical filling station can also be known as a fueling or gas station ( United States and Canada ) , gasbar ( Canada ) , gasoline stand or SS [ Note 1 ] ( Japan ) , petrol pump or petrol bunk ( India , Pakistan and Bangladesh ) , garage , petrol station ( Australia , Hong Kong , New Zealand , Singapore , South Africa , United Kingdom and Ireland ) , service station ( Australia , France , Italy , Japan , New Zealand and United Kingdom and Ireland ) , servo ( Australia ) , or fuel station ( Northern Europe and Israel ) . Fuel dispensers are used to pump gasoline , diesel , compressed natural gas , CGH2 , HCNG , LPG , liquid hydrogen , kerosene , alcohol fuel ( like methanol , ethanol , butanol , propanol ) , biofuels ( like straight vegetable oil , biodiesel ) , or other types of fuel into the tanks within vehicles and calculate the financial cost of the fuel transferred to the vehicle . Fuel dispensers are also known as bowsers ( in some parts of Australia ) , petrol pumps ( in most Commonwealth countries ) or gas pumps ( in North America ) . Besides fuel dispensers , one other significant device which is also found in filling stations and can refuel certain ( compressed-air ) vehicles is an air compressor , although generally these are just used to inflate car tires ( tyres ) . Also , many filling stations incorporate a convenience store , which like most other buildings generally have electricity sockets ; hence , in some cases , plug-in electric vehicles can be recharged . The convenience stores found in filling stations typically sell candy , soft drinks , snacks and , in some cases , a small selection of grocery items , such as milk . Some also sell propane or butane and have added shops to their primary business . Conversely , some chain stores , such as supermarkets , discount stores , warehouse clubs , or traditional convenience stores , have provided filling stations on the premises ."
