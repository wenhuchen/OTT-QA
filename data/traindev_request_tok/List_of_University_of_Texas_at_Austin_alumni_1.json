  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country . [ f ] The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union . [ g ] The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years .",
  "/wiki/Reconstruction_era_in_the_United_States": "The Reconstruction era was the period in American history which lasted from 1863 to 1877 . It was a significant chapter in the history of American civil rights . The term has two applications : the first applies to the complete history of the entire country from 1865 to 1877 following the American Civil War ; the second , to the attempted transformation of the 11 former Confederate states from 1863 to 1877 , as directed by Congress , and the role of the Union states in that transformation . Reconstruction ended the remnants of Confederate secession and abolished slavery , making the newly freed slaves citizens with civil rights ostensibly guaranteed by three new constitutional amendments . Three visions of Civil War memory appeared during Reconstruction : the reconciliationist vision , which was rooted in coping with the death and devastation the war had brought ; the white supremacist vision , which included segregation and the preservation of the traditional cultural standards of the South ; and the emancipationist vision , which sought full freedom , citizenship , and constitutional equality for African Americans . When President Abraham Lincoln , a Republican , was assassinated at the end of the Civil War , Vice President Andrew Johnson , a Democrat from Tennessee and former slave holder , became president . Johnson favored rapid measures to bring the South back into the Union , allowing the Southern states to determine the rights of former slaves . Radical Republicans in Congress sought stronger , federal measures to upgrade the rights of African Americans , including the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , while curtailing the rights of former Confederates , such as through the provisions of the Wade-Davis Bill . Johnson , the most prominent Southerner to oppose the Confederacy , followed a lenient policy toward ex-Confederates . Lincoln 's last speeches show that he was leaning toward supporting the suffrage of all freedmen , whereas Johnson and the Democratic Party were strongly opposed to this . Johnson 's weak Reconstruction policies prevailed until the congressional elections of 1866 . Those elections followed outbreaks of violence against blacks in the former rebel states , including the Memphis riots of 1866 and the New Orleans massacre of 1866 .",

It was developed by Robert S. Boyer and J Strother Moore in 1977 . The algorithm preprocesses the string being searched for ( the pattern ) , but not the string being searched in ( the text ) . It is thus well-suited for applications in which the pattern is much shorter than the text or where it persists across multiple searches . The Boyer-Moore algorithm uses information gathered during the preprocess step to skip sections of the text , resulting in a lower constant factor than many other string search algorithms . In general , the algorithm runs faster as the pattern length increases . The key features of the algorithm are to match on the tail of the pattern rather than the head , and to skip along the text in jumps of multiple characters rather than searching every single character in the text .",

Social work applies social sciences , such as sociology , psychology , political science , public health , community development , law , and economics , to engage with client systems , conduct assessments , and develop interventions to solve social and personal problems ; and to bring about social change . Social work practice is often divided into micro-work , which involves working directly with individuals or small groups ; and macro-work , which involves working with communities , and - within social policy - fostering change on a larger scale . The social work industry developed in the 19th century , with some of its roots in voluntary philanthropy and in grassroots organizing . However , responses to social needs had existed long before then , primarily from private charities and from religious organizations . The effects of the Industrial Revolution and of the Great Depression of the 1930s placed pressure on social work to become a more defined discipline . [ need quotation to verify ]",

  "/wiki/Nonlinear_dynamics": "In mathematics and science , a nonlinear system is a system in which the change of the output is not proportional to the change of the input . Nonlinear problems are of interest to engineers , biologists , physicists , mathematicians , and many other scientists because most systems are inherently nonlinear in nature . Nonlinear dynamical systems , describing changes in variables over time , may appear chaotic , unpredictable , or counterintuitive , contrasting with much simpler linear systems . Typically , the behavior of a nonlinear system is described in mathematics by a nonlinear system of equations , which is a set of simultaneous equations in which the unknowns ( or the unknown functions in the case of differential equations ) appear as variables of a polynomial of degree higher than one or in the argument of a function which is not a polynomial of degree one . In other words , in a nonlinear system of equations , the equation ( s ) to be solved can not be written as a linear combination of the unknown variables or functions that appear in them . Systems can be defined as nonlinear , regardless of whether known linear functions appear in the equations . In particular , a differential equation is linear if it is linear in terms of the unknown function and its derivatives , even if nonlinear in terms of the other variables appearing in it . As nonlinear dynamical equations are difficult to solve , nonlinear systems are commonly approximated by linear equations ( linearization ) . This works well up to some accuracy and some range for the input values , but some interesting phenomena such as solitons , chaos , and singularities are hidden by linearization . It follows that some aspects of the dynamic behavior of a nonlinear system can appear to be counterintuitive , unpredictable or even chaotic . Although such chaotic behavior may resemble random behavior , it is in fact not random . For example , some aspects of the weather are seen to be chaotic , where simple changes in one part of the system produce complex effects throughout .",

It is located between the Atlantic Ocean and the Western United States , with the Midwestern United States and Northeastern United States to its north and the Gulf of Mexico and Mexico to its south . The South does not fully match the geographic south of the United States but is commonly defined as including the states that fought for the Confederate States of America in the American Civil War . The Deep South is fully located in the southeastern corner . California , Arizona and New Mexico , which are geographically in the southern part of the country , are rarely considered part , while West Virginia , which separated from Virginia in 1863 , commonly is . Some scholars have proposed definitions of the South that do not coincide neatly with state boundaries . While the states of Delaware and Maryland , as well as the District of Columbia , permitted slavery prior to and during the Civil War , they remained with the Union . Since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s , they became more culturally , economically , and politically aligned with the industrial Northern states , and are often identified as part of the Mid-Atlantic or Northeast by many residents , businesses , public institutions , and private organizations ; however , the United States Census Bureau continues to define them as in the South with regard to census regions . Usually , the South is defined as including the southeastern and south-central United States . The region is known for its culture and history , having developed its own customs , musical styles , and cuisines , which have distinguished it in some ways from the rest of the United States . The Southern ethnic heritage is diverse and includes strong European ( mostly English , Italian , Scottish , Scotch-Irish , Irish , German , French , Portuguese and Spanish American ) , African and some Native American components . Some other aspects of the historical and cultural development of the South have been influenced by the institution of slave labor on plantations in the Deep South to an extent seen nowhere else in the United States ; the presence of a large proportion of African Americans in the population ; support for the doctrine of states ' rights , and the legacy of racism magnified by the Civil War and Reconstruction Era , as seen in thousands of lynchings ( mostly from 1880 to 1930 ) , the segregated system of separate schools and public facilities known as Jim Crow laws , that lasted until the 1960s , and the widespread use of poll taxes and other methods to frequently deny black people of the right to vote or hold office until the 1960s .",

  "/wiki/STS-1": "STS-1 ( Space Transportation System-1 ) was the first orbital spaceflight of NASA 's Space Shuttle program . The first orbiter , Columbia , launched on 12 April 1981 and returned on 14 April , 54.5 hours later , having orbited the Earth 36 times . Columbia carried a crew of two - mission commander John W. Young and pilot Robert L. Crippen . It was the first American crewed space flight since the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975 . STS-1 was also the only maiden test flight of a new American spacecraft to carry a crew , though it was preceded by atmospheric testing of the orbiter and ground testing of the Space Shuttle system . The launch occurred on the 20th anniversary of the first human spaceflight . This was a coincidence rather than a celebration of the anniversary ; a technical problem had prevented STS-1 from launching two days earlier , as was planned ."
