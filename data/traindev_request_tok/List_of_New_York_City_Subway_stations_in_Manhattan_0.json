These lines and services were operated by the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation ( BMT ) and city-owned Independent Subway System ( IND ) before the 1940 city takeover of the BMT . B Division rolling stock is wider , longer , and heavier than those of the A Division , measuring 10 or 9.75 ft ( 3,048 or 2,972 mm ) by 60 or 75 ft ( 18.29 or 22.86 m ) . The B Division is broken down into two subdivisions , B1 ( BMT ) and B2 ( IND ) , for chaining purposes .

  "/wiki/Independent_Subway_System": "The Independent Subway System ( IND or ISS ) , formerly known as the Independent City-Owned Subway System ( ICOS ) or the Independent City-Owned Rapid Transit Railroad , was a rapid transit rail system in New York City that is now part of the New York City Subway . It was first constructed as the Eighth Avenue Line in Manhattan in 1932 . One of three rail networks that became part of the modern New York City subway , the IND was intended to be fully owned and operated by the municipal government , in contrast to the privately operated or jointly funded Interborough Rapid Transit Company ( IRT ) and Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation ( BMT ) companies . It was merged with these two networks in 1940 . The original IND service lines are the modern subway 's A , B , C , D , E , F , G and M services . In addition , the BMT 's N , Q and R now run partly on IND trackage . The Rockaway Park Shuttle supplements the A service . For operational purposes , the IND and BMT lines and services are referred to jointly as the B Division .",
  "/wiki/Second_Avenue_Subway": "The Second Avenue Subway ( internally referred to as the IND Second Avenue Line by the MTA and abbreviated to SAS ) is a New York City Subway line that runs under Second Avenue on the East Side of Manhattan . The first phase of this new line , with three new stations on Manhattan 's Upper East Side , opened on January 1 , 2017 . The full Second Avenue Line , if and when it is funded , will be built in three more phases to eventually connect Harlem-125th Street in Harlem to Hanover Square in Lower Manhattan . The proposed full line would be 8.5 miles ( 13.7 km ) and 16 stations long , serve a projected 560,000 daily riders , and cost more than $ 17 billion . The line was originally proposed in 1920 as part of a massive expansion of what would become the Independent Subway System ( IND ) . In anticipation of the Second Avenue Subway being built to replace them , parallel elevated lines along Second Avenue and Third Avenue were demolished in 1942 and 1955 , respectively , despite several factors causing plans for the Second Avenue Subway to be cancelled . Construction on the line finally began in 1972 as part of the Program for Action , but was halted in 1975 because of the city 's fiscal crisis , leaving only a few short segments of tunnels completed . Work on the line restarted in April 2007 following the development of a financially secure construction plan . The first phase of the line , consisting of the 96th Street , 86th Street and 72nd Street stations , as well as two miles ( 3.2 km ) of tunnel , cost $ 4.45 billion . A 1.5-mile ( 2.4 km ) , $ 6 billion second phase from 96th to 125th Streets is in planning and is expected to open by 2027-2029 . Phase 1 is served by the Q train at all times , weekend and evening M trains , and limited rush-hour N and R trains . Phase 2 will extend the line 's northern terminus from 96th Street to Harlem-125th Street , and both the Q and limited N services will be extended to 125th Street .",
  "/wiki/IND_Sixth_Avenue_Line": "The IND Sixth Avenue Line is a rapid transit line of the B Division of the New York City Subway in the United States . It runs mainly under Sixth Avenue in Manhattan , and continues south to Brooklyn . The B , D , F , and M trains , which use the Sixth Avenue Line through Midtown Manhattan , are colored orange . The B and D trains use the express tracks , while the F , < F > and M trains use the local tracks . The Sixth Avenue Line , constructed in stages during the 1930s , was the last trunk line built by the Independent Subway System ( IND ) before it was incorporated into the modern-day New York City Subway . It was more difficult to build than other subway trunk lines in New York City because construction had to proceed around , over , and under existing tunnels and elevated structures . The Sixth Avenue Line replaced the Interborough Rapid Transit Company ( IRT ) 's Sixth Avenue elevated , which closed in 1939 . The first section of the line opened in 1936 from West Fourth Street to East Broadway with service provided by Eighth Avenue Line trains . This section was initially referred to as the Houston-Essex Street Route . The Sixth Avenue subway was completed in 1940 , providing service north of West Fourth Street , connecting to the Queens Boulevard Line and the Eighth Avenue Line . Initially , the Sixth Avenue Line carried only local service , since there were no express tracks between 34th Street and West 4th Street . In 1967 and 1968 , the Chrystie Street Connection was completed , connecting the line with former BMT lines in Brooklyn via the Manhattan Bridge and with the BMT Jamaica Line over the Williamsburg Bridge .",

With two stations , it is the shortest regular service in the system by number of stops , running about 2,402 feet ( 732 m ) in 90 seconds . The shuttle is used by over 100,000 passengers every day , and by up to 10,200 passengers per hour during rush hours .

The tracks that it uses opened in 1904 as part of the first subway in the city . The original subway line ran north from City Hall on what is now the IRT Lexington Avenue Line to 42nd Street , from where it turned west to run across 42nd Street . Then , at Broadway , the line turned north to 145th Street on what is now the IRT Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line . This operation continued until 1918 , when construction on the Lexington Avenue Line north of 42nd Street , and on the Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line south of 42nd Street was completed . One trunk would run via the new Lexington Avenue Line down Park Avenue , and the other trunk would run via the new Seventh Avenue Line up Broadway .
