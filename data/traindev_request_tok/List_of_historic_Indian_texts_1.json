  "/wiki/Rig_Veda": "The Rigveda ( Sanskrit : \u090b\u0917\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0926 \u1e5bgveda , from \u1e5bc praise and veda knowledge ) is an ancient Indian collection of Vedic Sanskrit hymns . It is one of the four sacred canonical texts ( \u015bruti ) of Hinduism known as the Vedas . The text is layered consisting of the Samhita , Brahmanas , Aranyakas and Upanishads . [ note 1 ] The Rigveda Samhita is the core text , and is a collection of 10 books ( ma\u1e47\u1e0dalas ) with 1,028 hymns ( s\u016bktas ) in about 10,600 verses ( called \u1e5bc , eponymous of the name Rigveda ) . In the eight books - Books 2 through 9 - that were composed the earliest , the hymns predominantly discuss cosmology and praise deities . The younger books ( Books 1 and 10 ) in part also deal with philosophical or speculative questions , virtues such as d\u0101na ( charity ) in society , questions about the origin of the universe and the nature of god , and other metaphysical issues in their hymns . The Rigveda is the oldest known Vedic Sanskrit text . Its early layers are one of the oldest extant texts in any Indo-European language . [ note 2 ] The Philological and linguistic evidence indicates that the bulk of the Rigveda Samhita was composed in the northwestern region ( Punjab ) of the Indian subcontinent , most likely between c. 1500 and 1200 BC , although a wider approximation of c. 1700-1100 BC has also been given . [ note 3 ] Some of its verses continue to be recited during Hindu rites of passage celebrations ( such as weddings ) and prayers , making it probably the world 's oldest religious text in continued use .",
  "/wiki/Veda": "The Vedas ( /\u02c8ve\u026ad\u0259z , \u02c8vi\u02d0-/ ; Sanskrit : \u0935\u0947\u0926 veda , knowledge ) are a large body of religious texts originating in ancient India . Composed in Vedic Sanskrit , the texts constitute the oldest layer of Sanskrit literature and the oldest scriptures of Hinduism . Hindus consider the Vedas to be apauru\u1e63eya , which means not of a man , superhuman and impersonal , authorless . Vedas are also called \u015bruti ( what is heard ) literature , distinguishing them from other religious texts , which are called sm\u1e5bti ( what is remembered ) . The Veda , for orthodox Indian theologians , are considered revelations seen by ancient sages after intense meditation , and texts that have been more carefully preserved since ancient times . In the Hindu Epic the Mahabharata , the creation of Vedas is credited to Brahma . The Vedic hymns themselves assert that they were skillfully created by Rishis ( sages ) , after inspired creativity , just as a carpenter builds a chariot . [ note 1 ] According to tradition , Vyasa is the compiler of the Vedas , who arranged the four kinds of mantras into four Samhitas ( Collections ) . There are four Vedas : the Rigveda , the Yajurveda , the Samaveda and the Atharvaveda . Each Veda has been subclassified into four major text types - the Samhitas ( mantras and benedictions ) , the Aranyakas ( text on rituals , ceremonies , sacrifices and symbolic-sacrifices ) , the Brahmanas ( commentaries on rituals , ceremonies and sacrifices ) , and the Upanishads ( texts discussing meditation , philosophy and spiritual knowledge ) . Some scholars add a fifth category - the Upasanas ( worship ) . The various Indian philosophies and denominations have taken differing positions on the Vedas .",
  "/wiki/Samhita": "Samhita literally means put together , joined , union , a collection , and a methodically , rule-based combination of text or verses . Samhita also refers to the most ancient layer of text in the Vedas , consisting of mantras , hymns , prayers , litanies and benedictions . Parts of Vedic Samhitas constitute the oldest living part of Hindu tradition .",

It is the primary liturgical language of Hinduism and the predominant language of most works of Hindu philosophy as well as some of the principal texts of Buddhism and Jainism . Sanskrit , in its variants and numerous dialects , was the lingua franca of ancient and medieval India . In the early 1st millennium CE , along with Buddhism and Hinduism , Sanskrit migrated to Southeast Asia , parts of East Asia and Central Asia , emerging as a language of high culture and of local ruling elites in these regions . Sanskrit is an Old Indo-Aryan language . As one of the oldest documented members of the Indo-European family of languages , [ note 1 ] [ note 2 ] Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies . It is related to Greek and Latin , as well as Hittite , Luwian , Old Avestan and many other living and extinct languages with historical significance to Europe , West Asia , Central Asia and South Asia . It traces its linguistic ancestry to the Proto-Indo-Aryan language , Proto-Indo-Iranian and the Proto-Indo-European languages . Sanskrit is traceable to the 2nd millennium BCE in a form known as Vedic Sanskrit , with the Rigveda as the earliest-known composition . A more refined and standardized grammatical form called Classical Sanskrit emerged in the mid-1st millennium BCE with the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b treatise of P\u0101\u1e47ini . Sanskrit , though not necessarily Classical Sanskrit , is the root language of many Prakrit languages . Examples include numerous , modern , North Indian , subcontinental daughter languages such as Hindi , Marathi , Bengali , Punjabi , Gujarati , Sindhi , Kashmiri , Kumaoni , Garhwali , Urdu , Dogri , Maithili , Konkani , Assamese , Odia , and Nepali .",
  "/wiki/Yajur_Veda": "The Yajurveda ( Sanskrit : \u092f\u091c\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0926 , yajurveda , from yajus meaning worship , and veda meaning knowledge ) is the Veda primarily of prose mantras for worship rituals . An ancient Vedic Sanskrit text , it is a compilation of ritual-offering formulas that were said by a priest while an individual performed ritual actions such as those before the yajna fire . Yajurveda is one of the four Vedas , and one of the scriptures of Hinduism . The exact century of Yajurveda 's composition is unknown , and estimated by scholars to be around 1200 to 1000 BCE , contemporaneous with Samaveda and Atharvaveda . The Yajurveda is broadly grouped into two - the black or dark ( Krishna ) Yajurveda and the white or bright ( Shukla ) Yajurveda . The term black implies the un-arranged , unclear , motley collection of verses in Yajurveda , in contrast to the white which implies the well arranged , clear Yajurveda . The black Yajurveda has survived in four recensions , while two recensions of white Yajurveda have survived into the modern times . The earliest and most ancient layer of Yajurveda samhita includes about 1,875 verses , that are distinct yet borrow and build upon the foundation of verses in Rigveda . The middle layer includes the Satapatha Brahmana , one of the largest Brahmana texts in the Vedic collection . The youngest layer of Yajurveda text includes the largest collection of primary Upanishads , influential to various schools of Hindu philosophy . These include the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad , the Isha Upanishad , the Taittiriya Upanishad , the Katha Upanishad , the Shvetashvatara Upanishad and the Maitri Upanishad . Two of the oldest surviving manuscript copies of the Shukla Yajurveda sections have been discovered in Nepal and Western Tibet , and these are dated to the 12th-century CE .",

It is an ancient Vedic Sanskrit text , and part of the scriptures of Hinduism . One of the four Vedas , it is a liturgical text which consists of 1,549 verses . All but 75 verses have been taken from the Rigveda . Three recensions of the Samaveda have survived , and variant manuscripts of the Veda have been found in various parts of India . While its earliest parts are believed to date from as early as the Rigvedic period , the existing compilation dates from the post-Rigvedic Mantra period of Vedic Sanskrit , c. 1200 or 1000 BCE , roughly contemporary with the Atharvaveda and the Yajurveda . Embedded inside the Samaveda is the widely studied Chandogya Upanishad and Kena Upanishad , considered as primary Upanishads and as influential on the six schools of Hindu philosophy , particularly the Vedanta school . The classical Indian music and dance tradition considers the chants and melodies in Samaveda as one of its roots . It is also referred to as Sama Veda .",
  "/wiki/Atharva_Veda": "The Atharva Veda ( Sanskrit : \u0905\u0925\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0935\u0947\u0926 , Atharvaveda from atharv\u0101\u1e47as and veda , meaning knowledge ) is the knowledge storehouse of atharv\u0101\u1e47as , the procedures for everyday life . The text is the fourth Veda , but has been a late addition to the Vedic scriptures of Hinduism . The Atharvaveda is composed in Vedic Sanskrit , and it is a collection of 730 hymns with about 6,000 mantras , divided into 20 books . About a sixth of the Atharvaveda texts adapts verses from the Rigveda , and except for Books 15 and 16 , the text is in poem form deploying a diversity of Vedic matters . Two different recensions of the text - the Paippal\u0101da and the \u015aaunak\u012bya - have survived into modern times . Reliable manuscripts of the Paippalada edition were believed to have been lost , but a well-preserved version was discovered among a collection of palm leaf manuscripts in Odisha in 1957 . The Atharvaveda is sometimes called the Veda of magical formulas , an epithet declared to be incorrect by other scholars . In contrast to the 'hieratic religion ' of the other three Vedas , the Atharvaveda is said to represent a 'popular religion ' , incorporating not only formulas for magic , but also the daily rituals for initiation into learning ( upanayana ) , marriage and funerals . Royal rituals and the duties of the court priests are also included in the Atharvaveda . The Atharvaveda was likely compiled as a Veda contemporaneously with Samaveda and Yajurveda , or about 1200 BC - 1000 BC . Along with the Samhita layer of text , the Atharvaveda includes a Brahmana text , and a final layer of the text that covers philosophical speculations . The latter layer of Atharvaveda text includes three primary Upanishads , influential to various schools of Hindu philosophy .",

An individual follower of a particular school or recension is called a \u015b\u0101khin . The term is also used in Hindu philosophy to refer to an adherent of a particular orthodox system . A related term cara\u1e47a , ( conduct of life or behavior ) is also used to refer to such a Vedic school : although the words cara\u1e47a and \u015b\u0101kh\u0101 are sometimes used synonymously , yet cara\u1e47a properly applies to the sect or collection of persons united in one school , and \u015b\u0101kh\u0101 to the traditional text followed , as in the phrase \u015b\u0101kh\u0101m adhite , ( he recites a particular version of the Veda ) . The schools have different points of view , described as difference of ( Vedic ) school ( \u015b\u0101kh\u0101bheda\u1e25 ) . Each school would learn a specific Vedic Sa\u1e43hita ( one of the four Vedas properly so-called ) , as well as its associated Brahmana , Aranyakas , Shrautasutras , Grhyasutras and Upanishads . In traditional Hindu society affiliation with a specific school is an important aspect of class identity .

The concepts of Brahman ( ultimate reality ) and \u0100tman ( soul , self ) are central ideas in all of the Upanishads , and know that you are the \u0100tman is their thematic focus .

The chronology of Maitrayaniya Upanishad is contested , but generally accepted to be a late period Upanishadic composition . The Maitrayaniya Upanishad consists of seven Prapathakas ( lessons ) . The first Prapathaka is introductory , the next three are structured in a question-answer style and discuss metaphysical questions relating to Atman ( Self , Soul ) , while the fifth to seventh Prapathaka are supplements . However , several manuscripts discovered in different parts of India contain lesser number of Prapathakas , with a Telugu language version showing just four , and another Burnell version showing just one section . The content and structure of the Upanishad is also different in various manuscript recensions , suggesting that the Upanishad was extensively interpolated and expanded over a period of time . The common kernel of the Upanishad across different recensions , states Max Muller , is a reverence for soul , that can be summarized in a few words as , ( Man ) is the Self - the immortal , the fearless , the Brahman . The Maitri Upanishad is an important ancient text notable , in its expanded version , for its references to theories also found in Buddhism , elements of the Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hinduism , as well as the Ashrama system . The text is also notable for its practice of Anyatrapyuktam ( or Ityevam Hyaha ) , that is being one of the earliest known Sanskrit texts that embedded quotes with credits and frequent citations to more ancient Sanskrit texts ."
