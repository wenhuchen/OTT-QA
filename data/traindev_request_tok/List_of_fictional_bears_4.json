  "/wiki/Boss_(video_gaming)": "In video games , a boss is a significant computer-controlled enemy . A fight with a boss character is commonly referred to as a boss battle or boss fight . Boss battles are generally seen at a climax of a particular section of the game , usually at the end of a level or stage , or guarding a specific objective ; the boss enemy is generally far stronger than the opponents the player has faced up to that point and is usually faced solo . A miniboss is a boss weaker or less significant than the main boss in the same area or level . A superboss is generally much more powerful than the bosses encountered as part of the main game 's plot and often optional to encounter . A final boss is often the main antagonist of a game 's story and the defeat of that character provides ultimate satisfaction to the game player . For example , in a run ' n ' gun video game all regular enemies might use pistols while the boss uses a machine gun . A boss enemy is quite often larger in size than other enemies and the player character . At times , bosses are very hard , even impossible , to defeat without being adequately prepared and/or knowing the correct fighting approach . Bosses take strategy and special knowledge to defeat , such as how to attack weak points or avoid specific attacks . Bosses are common in many genres of video games , but they are especially common in story-driven titles . RPGs , FPSs , platform games , and fighting games are particularly associated with boss battles .",

It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere , almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle , and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean . At 14,200,000 square kilometres ( 5,500,000 square miles ) , it is the fifth-largest continent and nearly twice the size of Australia . At 0.00008 people per square kilometre , it is by far the least densely populated continent . About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages 1.9 km ( 1.2 mi ; 6,200 ft ) in thickness , which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula . Antarctica , on average , is the coldest , driest , and windiest continent , and has the highest average elevation of all the continents . Most of Antarctica is a polar desert , with annual precipitation of 200 mm ( 7.9 in ) along the coast and far less inland ; there has been no rain there for almost 2 million years , yet 80% of the world freshwater reserves are stored there . The temperature in Antarctica has reached \u221289.2 \u00b0C ( \u2212128.6 \u00b0F ) ( or even \u221294.7 \u00b0C ( \u2212135.8 \u00b0F ) as measured from space ) , though the average for the third quarter ( the coldest part of the year ) is \u221263 \u00b0C ( \u221281 \u00b0F ) .

Organisms native to Antarctica include many types of algae , bacteria , fungi , plants , protista , and certain animals , such as mites , nematodes , penguins , seals and tardigrades . Vegetation , where it occurs , is tundra . Antarctica is noted as the last region on Earth in recorded history to be discovered , unseen until 1820 when the Russian expedition of Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev on Vostok and Mirny sighted the Fimbul ice shelf ."
