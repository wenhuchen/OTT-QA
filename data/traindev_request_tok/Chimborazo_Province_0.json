  "/wiki/Cajabamba,_Ecuador": "Cajabamba ( Villa la Uni\u00f3n ) is a location in the Chimborazo Province , Ecuador . It is the seat of the Colta Canton . The village of Cajabamba ( Kichwa : Kashapampa , thorn plain ) is situated in a fertile arable valley in Colta Canton , Chimborazo Province ( Chimborazo = snows on the other side ) . It is unknown when the valley was first inhabited but it is known to have been settled in pre-Incan times as the city of Liribamba , the capital of the ancient Puruh\u00e1 people . As the Incan empire expanded , the region became an area of conquest and was fully under the control of the Inca by the time of Wayna Qhapaq . After the capture and subsequent murder of his son and successor Atahualpa in Cajamarca , resistance to the conquista centered on the Incan general Rumi\u00f1awi , who withdrew his troops to the region . After a drawn-out series of engagements with the conquistadors , who allied with the Ca\u00f1ari ( recently conquered Incan subjects ) , Rumi\u00f1awi , faced with the prospect of near-certain defeat , ordered the city of Liribamba burned and the treasures of the Incas hidden or destroyed . Within the month ( August 1534 ) , Spanish conquistador Diego de Almagro founded a new city on the ashes of Liribamba which he named Santiago de Quito , the first city founded by the Spanish . By the end of the year , Incan resistance had collapsed , culminating in a battle at Mount Chimborazo , and Rumi\u00f1ahui was captured . Soon after , the city of Quito was moved to its current location . The city in the valley was renamed by its founders Villa de Riobamba , which means plain on the journey ( possibly referring to its centrality ) . The city was destroyed in a massive 8.3 magnitude earthquake in 1797 and moved to its current location 20 km away .",
