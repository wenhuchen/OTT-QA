  "/wiki/Italian_Civil_War": "The Italian Civil War ( Italian : Guerra civile italiana ) was a civil war in Italy fought by the Italian Co-Belligerent Army and the Italian Resistance ( with the Allies of World War II ) against the Italian Fascists and Italian Social Republic ( and the Axis powers ) from 9 September 1943 ( the date of the armistice of Cassibile ) to 2 May 1945 ( the date of the surrender of German forces in Italy ) . During World War II , after Mussolini was deposed and arrested on 25 July 1943 by King Victor Emmanuel III , Italy signed the Armistice of Cassabile on 8 September 1943 , ending its war with the Allies . However , German forces shortly succeeded in taking control of northern and central Italy , creating the Italian Social Republic ( RSI ) , with Mussolini installed as leader after he was rescued by German paratroopers . The Germans , often helped by Fascists , committed several atrocities against Italian civilians and troops . As result , the Italian Co-Belligerent Army was created to fight against the RSI and its German allies , while other Italian troops , loyal to Mussolini , continued to fight alongside the Germans in the National Republican Army . In addition , a large Italian resistance movement started a guerrilla war against the German and Italian fascist forces . The anti-fascist victory led to the execution of Mussolini , the liberation of the country , and the birth of the Italian Republic .",

  "/wiki/Nanking_Massacre": "The Nanjing Massacre or the Rape of Nanjing , alternately written as the Nanking Massacre or the Rape of Nanking , was an episode of mass murder and mass rape committed by Imperial Japanese troops against the residents of Nanjing ( Nanking ) , then the capital of China , during the Second Sino-Japanese War . The massacre occurred over a period of six weeks starting on December 13 , 1937 , the day that the Japanese captured Nanjing . During this period , soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army murdered Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants who numbered an estimated 40,000 to over 300,000 , and perpetrated widespread rape and looting . Since most Japanese military records on the killings were kept secret or destroyed shortly after the surrender of Japan in 1945 , historians have been unable to accurately estimate the death toll of the massacre . The International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo estimated in 1946 that over 200,000 Chinese were killed in the incident . China 's official estimate is more than 300,000 dead based on the evaluation of the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal in 1947 . The death toll has been actively contested among scholars since the 1980s . The event remains a contentious political issue and a stumbling block in Sino-Japanese relations . The Chinese government has been accused of exaggerating aspects of the massacre such as the death toll by many Japanese , while historical negationists and Japanese nationalists go as far as claiming the massacre was fabricated for propaganda purposes . The controversy surrounding the massacre remains a central issue in Japanese relations with other Asia-Pacific nations as well , such as South Korea . Although the Japanese government has admitted to the killing of many non-combatants , looting , and other violence committed by the Imperial Japanese Army after the fall of Nanjing , and Japanese veterans who served there have confirmed that a massacre took place , a small but vocal minority within both the Japanese government and society have argued that the death toll was military in nature and that no such crimes ever occurred . Denial of the massacre and revisionist accounts of the killings have become a staple of Japanese nationalism .",

  "/wiki/Irish_neutrality": "Ireland has been neutral in international relations since the 1930s . The nature of Irish neutrality has varied over time , and has been contested since the 1970s . Historically , the state was a non-belligerent in the Second World War ( see Irish neutrality during World War II ) and has never joined NATO , although during the Cold War it was anti-communist and aloof from the Non-Aligned Movement . The compatibility of neutrality with Ireland 's membership of the European Union has been a point of debate in EU treaty referendum campaigns since the 1990s . The Seville Declarations on the Treaty of Nice acknowledge Ireland 's traditional policy of military neutrality , reflecting the narrow formulation of successive Irish governments . Others define Irish neutrality more broadly , as having a strong normative focus , with a commitment to development , United Nations peacekeeping , human rights and disarmament .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Britain": "The Battle of Britain ( German : die Luftschlacht um England , the Air Battle for England ) was a military campaign of the Second World War , in which the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) defended the United Kingdom ( UK ) against large-scale attacks by Nazi Germany 's air force , the Luftwaffe . It has been described as the first major military campaign fought entirely by air forces . The British officially recognise the battle 's duration as being from 10 July until 31 October 1940 , which overlaps the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz , that lasted from 7 September 1940 to 11 May 1941 . German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard the battle as a single campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941 , including the Blitz . The primary objective of the German forces was to compel Britain to agree to a negotiated peace settlement . In July 1940 , the air and sea blockade began , with the Luftwaffe mainly targeting coastal-shipping convoys , ports and shipping centres , such as Portsmouth . On 1 August , the Luftwaffe was directed to achieve air superiority over the RAF with the aim of incapacitating RAF Fighter Command ; 12 days later , it shifted the attacks to RAF airfields and infrastructure . As the battle progressed , the Luftwaffe also targeted factories involved in aircraft production and strategic infrastructure . Eventually , it employed terror bombing on areas of political significance and on civilians . [ nb 9 ] The Germans had rapidly overwhelmed France and the Low Countries , leaving Britain to face the threat of invasion by sea . The German high command knew the difficulties of a seaborne attack and its impracticality while the Royal Navy controlled the English Channel and the North Sea .

  "/wiki/Italian_Campaign_(World_War_II)": "The Italian campaign of World War II consisted of Allied and Axis operations in and around Italy , from 1943 to 1945 . The Joint Allied Forces Headquarters ( AFHQ ) was operationally responsible for all Allied land forces in the Mediterranean theatre and it planned and led the invasion of Sicily in July 1943 , followed in September by the invasion of the Italian mainland and the campaign in Italy until the surrender of the German Armed Forces in Italy in May 1945 . It is estimated that between September 1943 and April 1945 , 60,000-70,000 Allied and 38,805-150,660 German soldiers died in Italy . [ nb 1 ] The number of Allied casualties was about 320,000 and the German figure ( excluding those involved in the final surrender ) was over 330,000 . [ nb 2 ] Fascist Italy , prior to its collapse , suffered about 200,000 casualties , mostly POWs taken in the Allied invasion of Sicily , including more than 40,000 killed or missing . Over 150,000 Italian civilians died , as did 35,828 anti-fascist partisans and some 35,000 troops of the Italian Social Republic . On the Western Front of World War II , Italy was the most costly campaign in terms of casualties suffered by infantry forces of both sides , during bitter small-scale fighting around strongpoints at the Winter Line , the Anzio beachhead and the Gothic Line . The Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943 led to the collapse of the Fascist Italian regime and the fall of Mussolini , who was deposed and arrested by order of King Victor Emmanuel III on 25 July . The new government signed an armistice with the Allies on 8 September 1943 . However , German forces soon took control of northern and central Italy ; Mussolini , who was rescued by German paratroopers , established a collaborationist puppet state , the Italian Social Republic ( RSI ) to administer the German-occupied territory . The Germans , often with Italian fascists , also committed several atrocities against civilians and non-fascist troops . As result , the Italian Co-Belligerent Army was created to fight against the RSI and its German allies , alongside the large Italian resistance movement , while other Italian troops , loyal to Mussolini , continued to fight alongside the Germans in the National Republican Army .",

  "/wiki/Knut_Hamsun": "Knut Hamsun ( August 4 , 1859 - February 19 , 1952 ) was a Norwegian writer who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1920 . Hamsun 's work spans more than 70 years and shows variation with regard to the subject , perspective and environment . He published more than 20 novels , a collection of poetry , some short stories and plays , a travelogue , and some essays . The young Hamsun objected to realism and naturalism . He argued that the main object of modernist literature should be the intricacies of the human mind , that writers should describe the whisper of blood , and the pleading of bone marrow . Hamsun is considered the leader of the Neo-Romantic revolt at the turn of the 20th century , with works such as Hunger ( 1890 ) , Mysteries ( 1892 ) , Pan ( 1894 ) , and Victoria ( 1898 ) . His later works - in particular his Nordland novels - were influenced by the Norwegian new realism , portraying everyday life in rural Norway and often employing local dialect , irony , and humour . Hamsun is considered to be one of the most influential and innovative literary stylists of the past hundred years ( ca . 1890-1990 ) . He pioneered psychological literature with techniques of stream of consciousness and interior monologue , and influenced authors such as Thomas Mann , Franz Kafka , Maxim Gorky , Stefan Zweig , Henry Miller , Hermann Hesse , and Ernest Hemingway . Isaac Bashevis Singer called Hamsun the father of the modern school of literature in his every aspect - his subjectiveness , his fragmentariness , his use of flashbacks , his lyricism . The whole modern school of fiction in the twentieth century stems from Hamsun .",
