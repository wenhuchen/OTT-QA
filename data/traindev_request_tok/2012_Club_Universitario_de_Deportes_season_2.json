  "/wiki/Forward_(association_football)": "Forwards are the players on a football ( soccer ) team who play nearest to the opposing team 's goal , and are therefore most responsible for scoring goals . Their advanced position and limited defensive responsibilities mean forwards normally score more goals on behalf of their team than other players . Modern team formations generally include one to three forwards ; for example , the common 4-2-3-1 formation includes one forward . Unconventional formations may include more than three forwards , or none .",

  "/wiki/Loan_(association_football)": "In sports , a loan involves a particular player being able to temporarily play for a club other than the one which they 're currently contracted to . Loan deals may last from a few weeks to a full season , sometimes persisting for multiple seasons at a time . Players may be loaned out to other clubs for several reasons . Most commonly , young prospects will be loaned to a club in a lower league in order to gain valuable first team experience . In this instance , the parent club may continue to pay the player 's wages in full or in part . Some clubs put a formal arrangement in place with a feeder club for this purpose , such as Manchester United and Royal Antwerp , Arsenal and Beveren , or Chelsea and Vitesse . In other leagues such as Italy 's Serie A , some smaller clubs have a reputation as a farm club and regularly take players , especially younger players , on loan from larger clubs . A club may take a player on loan if they are short on transfer funds but can still pay wages , or as temporary cover for injuries or suspensions . The parent club might demand a fee or that the loaning club pays some or all of the player 's wages during the loan period . A club might seek to loan out a squad player to make a saving on his wages , or a first team player to regain match fitness following an injury . A loan may be made to get around a transfer window . Such a loan might include an agreed fee for a permanent transfer when the next transfer window opens .",
  "/wiki/Midfielder": "A midfielder is an association football position . Midfielders are generally positioned on the field between their team 's defenders and forwards . Some midfielders play a disciplined defensive role , breaking up attacks , and are otherwise known as defensive midfielders . Others blur the boundaries , being more mobile and efficient in passing : they are commonly referred to as deep-lying midfielders , play-makers , box-to-box , or holding midfielders . The number of midfielders on a team and their assigned roles depends on the team 's formation ; the collective group of these players on the field is sometimes referred to as the midfield . Most managers assign at least one midfielder to disrupt the opposing team 's attacks , while others may be tasked with creating goals , or have equal responsibilities between attack and defence . Midfielders are the players who typically travel the greatest distance during a match . Because midfielders arguably have the most possession during a game they are among the fittest players on the pitch .",

  "/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)": "The goalkeeper , often shortened to keeper or goalie , is one of the major positions of association football . It is the most specialised position in the sport . The goalkeeper 's primary role is to prevent the opposing team from scoring ( moving the ball over the defended goal-line within the frame of the goal ) . This is accomplished by the goalkeeper moving into the path of the ball and either catching it or directing it away from the vicinity of the goal line . Within the penalty area goalkeepers are able to use their hands , making them ( outside throw-ins ) the only players on the field permitted to handle the ball . The special status of goalkeepers is indicated by them wearing different coloured kits from their teammates . The back-pass rule prevents goalkeepers handling direct passes back to them from teammates . Goalkeepers usually perform goal kicks , and also give commands to their defence during corner kicks , direct and indirect free kicks , and marking . Goalkeepers play an important role in directing on field strategy as they have an unrestricted view of the entire pitch , giving them a unique perspective on play development . The goalkeeper is the only required position of a team . If they are injured or sent off , a substitute goalkeeper has to take their place , otherwise an outfield player must take the ejected keeper 's place in goal . In order to replace a goalkeeper who is sent off , a team usually substitutes an outfield player for the backup keeper ( thus effectively the red card and substitution takes out two of the starting eleven players ) .",
