  "/wiki/Othello": "Othello ( The Tragedy of Othello , the Moor of Venice ) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare , believed to have been written in 1603 . It is based on the story Un Capitano Moro ( A Moorish Captain ) by Cinthio ( a disciple of Boccaccio 's ) , first published in 1565 . The story revolves around its two central characters : Othello , a Moorish general in the Venetian army , and his treacherous ensign , Iago . Given its varied and enduring themes of racism , love , jealousy , betrayal , revenge , and repentance , Othello is still often performed in professional and community theatre alike , and has been the source for numerous operatic , film , and literary adaptations .",
  "/wiki/Iago": "Iago ( /i\u02c8\u0251\u02d0\u0261o\u028a/ ) is a fictional character in Shakespeare 's Othello ( c. 1601-1604 ) . Iago is the play 's main antagonist , and Othello 's standard-bearer . He is the husband of Emilia , who is in turn the attendant of Othello 's wife Desdemona . Iago hates Othello and devises a plan to destroy him by making him believe that his wife is having an affair with his lieutenant , Michael Cassio . The role is thought to have been first played by Robert Armin , who typically played intelligent clown roles like Touchstone in As You Like It or Feste in Twelfth Night . The character 's source is traced to Giovanni Battista Giraldi Cinthio 's tale Un Capitano Moro in Gli Hecatommithi ( 1565 ) . There , the character is simply the ensign .",
