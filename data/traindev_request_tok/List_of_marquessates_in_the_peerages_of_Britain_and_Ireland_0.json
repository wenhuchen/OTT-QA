Anne was the daughter of Thomas Boleyn , 1st Earl of Wiltshire , and his wife , Lady Elizabeth Howard , and was educated in the Netherlands and France , largely as a maid of honour to Queen Claude of France . Anne returned to England in early 1522 , to marry her Irish cousin James Butler , 9th Earl of Ormond ; the marriage plans were broken off , and instead she secured a post at court as maid of honour to Henry VIII 's wife , Catherine of Aragon . Early in 1523 Anne was secretly betrothed to Henry Percy , son of Henry Percy , 5th Earl of Northumberland , but the betrothal was broken off when the Earl refused to support their engagement . Cardinal Thomas Wolsey refused the match in January 1524 and Anne was sent back home to Hever Castle . In February or March 1526 , Henry VIII began his pursuit of Anne . She resisted his attempts to seduce her , refusing to become his mistress , which her sister Mary had been . Henry soon focused his desires on annulling his marriage to Catherine so he would be free to marry Anne . When it became clear that Pope Clement VII would not annul the marriage , Henry and his advisers began the breaking of the Catholic Church 's power in England .
