As commanding officer of the 6th Panzer Army during the Battle of the Bulge , Dietrich bore responsibility for the Malmedy massacre , the murder of U.S. prisoners of war in December 1944 .

  "/wiki/Killed_in_action": "Killed in action ( KIA ) is a casualty classification generally used by militaries to describe the deaths of their own combatants at the hands of hostile forces . The United States Department of Defense , for example , says that those declared KIA need not have fired their weapons but have been killed due to hostile attack . KIAs include those killed by friendly fire in the midst of combat , but not from incidents such as accidental vehicle crashes , murder and other non-hostile events or terrorism . KIA can be applied both to front-line combat troops and to naval , air and support troops . Someone who is killed in action during a particular event is denoted with a \u2020 ( dagger ) beside their name to signify their death in that event or events . [ citation needed ] Further , KIA denotes a person to have been killed in action on the battlefield whereas died of wounds ( DOW ) relates to someone who survived to reach a medical treatment facility . The North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) also uses DWRIA , rather than DOW , for died of wounds received in action . However , historically , militaries and historians have used the former acronym . [ citation needed ] PKIA means presumed killed in action .

Translated as senior leader , an Oberf\u00fchrer was typically a NSDAP member in charge of a group of paramilitary units in a particular geographical region . From 1921 to 1925 , the phrase Oberf\u00fchrer was used as a title in the Sturmabteilung ( SA ) , but became an actual SA rank after 1926 .

  "/wiki/Executed": "Capital punishment , also known as the death penalty , is a government-sanctioned practice whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime . The sentence ordering that someone be punished in such a manner is referred to as a death sentence , whereas the act of carrying out such a sentence is known as an execution . A prisoner who has been sentenced to death and is awaiting execution is referred to as condemned , and is said to be on death row . Crimes that are punishable by death are known as capital crimes , capital offences or capital felonies , and vary depending on the jurisdiction , but commonly include serious offences such as murder , mass murder , aggravated cases of rape , child rape , child sexual abuse , terrorism , treason , espionage , sedition , piracy , aircraft hijacking , drug trafficking and drug dealing , war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide , and in some cases , the most serious acts of recidivism , aggravated robbery , and kidnapping . Etymologically , the term capital ( lit . of the head , derived via the Latin capitalis from caput , head ) in this context alluded to execution by beheading . Fifty-six countries retain capital punishment , 106 countries have completely abolished it de jure for all crimes , eight have abolished it for ordinary crimes ( while maintaining it for special circumstances such as war crimes ) , and 28 are abolitionist in practice . Capital punishment is a matter of active controversy in several countries and states , and positions can vary within a single political ideology or cultural region . In the European Union , Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union prohibits the use of capital punishment . The Council of Europe , which has 47 member states , has sought to abolish the use of the death penalty by its members absolutely , through Protocol 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights .

  "/wiki/Suicide": "Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one 's own death . Mental disorders , including depression , bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , personality disorders , anxiety disorders , and substance abuse - including alcoholism and the use of benzodiazepines - are risk factors . Some suicides are impulsive acts due to stress , such as from financial difficulties , relationship problems such as breakups , or bullying . Those who have previously attempted suicide are at a higher risk for future attempts . Effective suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to methods of suicide - such as firearms , drugs , and poisons ; treating mental disorders and substance misuse ; careful media reporting about suicide ; and improving economic conditions . Even though crisis hotlines are common , they have not been well studied . The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries , and is partly related to the availability of effective means . Common methods of suicide include hanging , pesticide poisoning , and firearms . Suicides resulted in 828,000 global deaths in 2015 , an increase from 712,000 deaths in 1990 . This makes suicide the 10th leading cause of death worldwide . Approximately 1.5% of people die by suicide . In a given year this is roughly 12 per 100,000 people .",
