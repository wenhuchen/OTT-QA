Salts of cholic acid are called cholates . Cholic acid , along with chenodeoxycholic acid , is one of the two major bile acids produced by the liver , where it is synthesized from cholesterol . These two major bile acids are roughly equal in concentration in humans . Derivatives are made from cholyl-CoA , which exchanges its CoA with either glycine , or taurine , yielding glycocholic and taurocholic acid , respectively . Cholic acid downregulates cholesterol-7-\u03b1-hydroxylase ( rate-limiting step in bile acid synthesis ) , and cholesterol does the opposite . This is why chenodeoxycholic acid , and not cholic acid , can be used to treat gallstones ( because decreasing bile acid synthesis would supersaturate the stones even more ) . Cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid are the most important human bile acids . Other species may synthesize different bile acids as their predominant primary bile acids . Cholic acid , formulated as Cholbam capsules , is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for children and adults with bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects , and for peroxisomal disorders ( such as Zellweger syndrome ) .",
  "/wiki/Emulsifier": "An emulsion is a mixture of two or more liquids that are normally immiscible ( unmixable or unblendable ) . Emulsions are part of a more general class of two-phase systems of matter called colloids . Although the terms colloid and emulsion are sometimes used interchangeably , emulsion should be used when both phases , dispersed and continuous , are liquids . In an emulsion , one liquid ( the dispersed phase ) is dispersed in the other ( the continuous phase ) . Examples of emulsions include vinaigrettes , homogenized milk , and some cutting fluids for metal working . The word emulsion comes from the Latin emulgere to milk out , from ex out + mulgere to milk , as milk is an emulsion of fat and water , along with other components . Two liquids can form different types of emulsions . As an example , oil and water can form , first , an oil-in-water emulsion , wherein the oil is the dispersed phase , and water is the continuous phase . ( Lipoproteins , used by all complex living organisms , are one example of this . ) Second , they can form a water-in-oil emulsion , wherein water is the dispersed phase and oil is the continuous phase . Multiple emulsions are also possible , including a water-in-oil-in-water emulsion and an oil-in-water-in-oil emulsion . Emulsions , being liquids , do not exhibit a static internal structure .",

  "/wiki/Flavour_enhancer": "Flavor ( American English ) or flavour ( British English ; see spelling differences ) is the sensory impression of food or other substances , and is determined primarily by the chemical senses of taste and smell . The trigeminal senses , which detect chemical irritants in the mouth and throat , as well as temperature and texture , are also important to the overall gestalt of flavor perception . The flavor of the food , as such , can be altered with natural or artificial flavorants which affect these senses . A flavorant is defined as a substance that gives another substance flavor , altering the characteristics of the solute , causing it to become sweet , sour , tangy , etc . A flavor is a quality of something that affects the sense of taste . Of the three chemical senses , smell is the main determinant of a food item 's flavor . Five basic tastes - sweet , sour , bitter , salty and umami ( savory ) are universally recognized , although some cultures also include pungency and oleogustus ( fattiness ) . The number of food smells is unbounded ; a food 's flavor , therefore , can be easily altered by changing its smell while keeping its taste similar . This is exemplified in artificially flavored jellies , soft drinks and candies , which , while made of bases with a similar taste , have dramatically different flavors due to the use of different scents or fragrances . The flavorings of commercially produced food products are typically created by flavorists . Although the terms flavoring and flavorant in common language denote the combined chemical sensations of taste and smell , the same terms are used in the fragrance and flavors industry to refer to edible chemicals and extracts that alter the flavor of food and food products through the sense of smell . Due to the high cost or unavailability of natural flavor extracts , most commercial flavorants are nature-identical , which means that they are the chemical equivalent of natural flavors , but chemically synthesized rather than being extracted from source materials .",

Dextrins can be produced from starch using enzymes like amylases , as during digestion in the human body and during malting and mashing , or by applying dry heat under acidic conditions ( pyrolysis or roasting ) . This procedure was first discovered in 1811 by Edme-Jean Baptiste Bouillon-Lagrange . The latter process is used industrially , and also occurs on the surface of bread during the baking process , contributing to flavor , color and crispness . Dextrins produced by heat are also known as pyrodextrins . The starch hydrolyses during roasting under acidic conditions , and short-chained starch parts partially rebranch with \u03b1- ( 1,6 ) bonds to the degraded starch molecule . See also Maillard Reaction . Dextrins are white , yellow , or brown powder that are partially or fully water-soluble , yielding optically active solutions of low viscosity . Most of them can be detected with iodine solution , giving a red coloration ; one distinguishes erythrodextrin ( dextrin that colours red ) and achrodextrin ( giving no colour ) . White and yellow dextrins from starch roasted with little or no acid are called British gum .",
  "/wiki/Dextrin": "Dextrins are a group of low-molecular-weight carbohydrates produced by the hydrolysis of starch or glycogen . Dextrins are mixtures of polymers of D-glucose units linked by \u03b1- ( 1\u21924 ) or \u03b1- ( 1\u21926 ) glycosidic bonds . Dextrins can be produced from starch using enzymes like amylases , as during digestion in the human body and during malting and mashing , or by applying dry heat under acidic conditions ( pyrolysis or roasting ) . This procedure was first discovered in 1811 by Edme-Jean Baptiste Bouillon-Lagrange . The latter process is used industrially , and also occurs on the surface of bread during the baking process , contributing to flavor , color and crispness . Dextrins produced by heat are also known as pyrodextrins .

  "/wiki/E1401": "Modified starch , also called starch derivatives , are prepared by physically , enzymatically , or chemically treating native starch to change its properties . Modified starches are used in practically all starch applications , such as in food products as a thickening agent , stabilizer or emulsifier ; in pharmaceuticals as a disintegrant ; or as binder in coated paper . They are also used in many other applications . Starches are modified to enhance their performance in different applications . Starches may be modified to increase their stability against excessive heat , acid , shear , time , cooling , or freezing ; to change their texture ; to decrease or increase their viscosity ; to lengthen or shorten gelatinization time ; or to increase their visco-stability .",
