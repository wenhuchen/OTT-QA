  "/wiki/Atlas_(rocket_family)": "Atlas is a family of US missiles and space launch vehicles that originated with the SM-65 Atlas . The Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) program was initiated in the late 1950s under the Convair Division of General Dynamics . Atlas was a liquid propellant rocket burning RP-1 fuel with liquid oxygen in three engines configured in an unusual stage-and-a-half or parallel staging design : two outboard booster engines were jettisoned along with supporting structures during ascent , while the center sustainer engine , propellant tanks and other structural elements remained connected through propellant depletion and engine shutdown . The Atlas name was originally proposed by Karel Bossart and his design team working at Convair on project MX-1593 . Using the name of a mighty titan from Greek mythology reflected the missile 's place as the biggest and most powerful at the time . It also reflected the parent company of Convair , the Atlas Corporation . The missiles saw only brief ICBM service , and the last squadron was taken off operational alert in 1965 . However , from 1962 to 1963 Atlas boosters launched the first four US astronauts to orbit the Earth ( in contrast to the preceding two Redstone suborbital launches ) . The Atlas-Agena and Atlas-Centaur satellite launch vehicles were also derived directly from the original Atlas . The Atlas-Centaur was evolved into the Atlas II , various models of which were launched 63 times between 1991 and 2004 . There were only six launches of the succeeding Atlas III , all between 2000 and 2005 . The Atlas V is still in service , with launches planned into the 2020s .",
  "/wiki/United_States": "The United States of America ( USA ) , commonly known as the United States ( U.S. or US ) or America , is a country consisting of 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . [ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",
  "/wiki/Black_Arrow": "Black Arrow , officially capitalised BLACK ARROW , was a British satellite carrier rocket . Developed during the 1960s , it was used for four launches between 1969 and 1971 . Its final flight was the first and only successful orbital launch to be conducted by the United Kingdom , and placed the Prospero satellite into low Earth orbit . Black Arrow originated from studies by the Royal Aircraft Establishment for carrier rockets based on the Black Knight rocket , with the project being authorised in 1964 . It was initially developed by Saunders-Roe , and later Westland Aircraft as the result of a merger . Black Arrow was a three-stage rocket , fuelled by RP-1 paraffin ( kerosene ) and high test peroxide , a concentrated form of hydrogen peroxide ( 85% hydrogen peroxide + 15% water ) . It was retired after only four launches in favour of using American Scout rockets , which the Ministry of Defence calculated to be cheaper than maintaining the Black Arrow programme .",

  "/wiki/Diamant": "The Diamant rocket ( Diamant is French for diamond ) was the first exclusively French expendable launch system and at the same time the first satellite launcher not built by either the United States or USSR . As such , it has been referred to as being a key predecessor for all subsequent European launcher projects . During 1962 , development of the Diamant commenced as the inaugural spacecraft project of France 's space agency , the Centre National d'\u00c9tudes Spatiales ( CNES ) . As a project , it was derived from the military program Pierres pr\u00e9cieuses ( fr . : gemstones ) that included the five prototypes Agate , Topaze , Emeraude , Rubis and Saphir ( Agate , Topaz , Emerald , Ruby and Sapphire ) , and drew heavily upon the knowledge and technologies that had been previously developed . On 26 November 1965 , the Diamant A performed its maiden flight . Out of a total of 12 launch attempts to be performed between 1965 and 1975 , 9 of these were successful . Most notably , on 26 November 1965 , the Diamant was used to successfully launch the first French satellite , named Ast\u00e9rix . Three successive versions of the Diamant rocket were developed , designated A , B and BP4 . All versions had three stages and a payload of approximately 150 kg for a 200 km orbit . Despite the success of the Diamant as a launcher , France ultimately chose to terminate further work on its national launcher program in favor of participation in the multi-European programme to produce what would become the Ariane launcher in 1975 .",

[ XIII ] The metropolitan area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea , and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean . It is bordered by Belgium , Luxembourg and Germany to the northeast , Switzerland and Italy to the east , and Andorra and Spain to the south . The overseas territories include French Guiana in South America and several islands in the Atlantic , Pacific and Indian oceans . The country 's 18 integral regions ( five of which are situated overseas ) span a combined area of 643,801 square kilometres ( 248,573 sq mi ) and a total population of 67.02 million ( as of July 2019 [ update ] ) .

Other major urban areas include Lyon , Marseille , Toulouse , Bordeaux , Lille and Nice . France , including its overseas territories , has the most number of time zones of any country , with a total of 12 . During the Iron Age , what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls , a Celtic people . Rome annexed the area in 51 BC , holding it until the arrival of Germanic Franks in 476 , who formed the Kingdom of Francia . The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned Francia into East Francia , Middle Francia and West Francia .

  "/wiki/Europa_(rocket)": "The Europa rocket was an early expendable launch system of the European Launcher Development Organisation ( ELDO ) , which was the precursor to the European Space Agency ( ESA ) . It was developed with the aim to delivering space access technology , and more specifically to facilitate the deployment of European-wide telecommunication and meteorological satellites into orbit . The Blue Streak missile predated the Europa programme , having originally been developed by Britain primarily for military purposes , however it was cancelled in 1960 . Efforts to repurpose the Blue Streak , such as the studied Black Prince expendable launch system , eventually cumulated in the multinational Europa programme . Workshare on the programme was shared between the various members of the ELDO based upon their financial contributions . The Europa launcher itself primarily consisted of the Blue Streak , Coralie , and Astris rocket stages . The programme proceeded to perform multiple test launches , however these frequently resulted in partial failures . In addition , Britain decided to pull out of the ELDO organisation , and thus Europa , to instead focus on the rival British Black Arrow launcher instead . This led to the replacement of the Blue Streak by the French-built Diamant section . However , confidence in the programme had diminished due to the poor reliability figures , and this led to its termination . While Europa was ultimately cancelled , the ambition for such a launcher was still present and supported by the majority of ELDO members and , following its reformation into the ESA in 1974 , the agency proceeded to develop the Ariane family of launchers , would which prove to be a commercial success with hundreds of launches performed .",
  "/wiki/Europe": "Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere . It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north , the Atlantic Ocean to the west , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , and Asia to the east . The eastern border comprises a long and mixed line of mountain ranges and waterways that would normally define a subcontinent . However , Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition . It is the 6th largest continent in the world . Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains , the Ural River , the Caspian and Black Seas and the waterways of the Turkish Straits . Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres ( 3,930,000 sq mi ) , or 2% of the Earth 's surface ( 6.8% of land area ) . Politically , Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which Russia is the largest and most populous , spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population . Europe had a total population of about 741 million ( about 11% of the world population ) as of 2018 [ update ] . The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent , even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe . Further from the sea , seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast . Europe , in particular ancient Greece and ancient Rome , was the birthplace of Western civilisation .",

  "/wiki/Soviet_Union": "The Soviet Union , [ b ] officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR or \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 ) , [ c ] was a federal sovereign state in northern Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991 . Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas .",

China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa .

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",
  "/wiki/R-7_(rocket_family)": "The R-7 family of rockets ( Russian : \u0420-7 ) is a series of rockets , derived from the Soviet R-7 Semyorka , the world 's first ICBM . More R-7 rockets have been launched than any other family of large rockets . When Soviet nuclear warheads became lighter , the R-7 turned out to be impractical as a ballistic missile . It was not necessary to launch such heavy payloads in a military application . The rockets became useful in the Soviet , and later , Russian space programmes with long-term development . Their purpose shifted primarily to launching satellites , probes , manned and unmanned spacecraft , and other non-threatening payloads . The R-7 family consists of both missiles and orbital carrier rockets . Derivatives include the Vostok , Voskhod and Soyuz rockets , which as of 2019 have been used for all Soviet , and later Russian human spaceflights . The type has a unique configuration where four break-away liquid-fueled engines surround a central core . The core acts as , in effect , a second stage after the other four engines are jettisoned . These rockets are expendable . Later modifications were standardised around the Soyuz design .",

The original R-36 was deployed under the GRAU index 8K67 and was given the NATO reporting name SS-9 Scarp . It was able to carry three warheads and was the first Soviet MIRV ( multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle ) missile . The later version , the R-36M was produced under the GRAU designations 15A14 and 15A18 and was given the NATO reporting name SS-18 Satan . This missile was viewed by certain United States analysts as giving the Soviet Union first strike advantage over the U.S. , particularly because of its rapid silo-reload ability , very heavy throw weight and extremely large number of re-entry vehicles . Some versions of the R-36M were deployed with 10 warheads and up to 40 penetration aids and the missile 's high throw-weight made it theoretically capable of carrying more warheads or penetration aids . Contemporary U.S. missiles , such as the Minuteman III , carried up to three warheads at most . The R-36 became the base for the Tsyklon launch vehicles family . As of early 2018 , Cyclone-4M , the last modification of it , is developed and planned for launch in 2020 . Russia intends to replace the R-36M with a new heavy ICBM , the RS-28 Sarmat .",

The Saturn family used liquid hydrogen as fuel in the upper stages . Originally proposed as a military satellite launcher , they were adopted as the launch vehicles for the Apollo Moon program . Three versions were built and flown : the medium-lift Saturn I , the heavy-lift Saturn IB , and the super heavy-lift Saturn V. The Saturn name was proposed by von Braun in October 1958 as a logical successor to the Jupiter series as well as the Roman god 's powerful position . In 1963 , president John F. Kennedy identified the Saturn I SA-5 launch as being the point where US lift capability would surpass the Soviets , after having been behind since Sputnik . He last mentioned this in a speech given at Brooks AFB in San Antonio on the day before he was assassinated . To date , the Saturn V is the only launch vehicle to transport human beings beyond low Earth orbit .
