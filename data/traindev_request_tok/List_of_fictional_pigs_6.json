  "/wiki/Personal_computer": "A personal computer ( PC ) is a multi-purpose computer whose size , capabilities , and price make it feasible for individual use . Personal computers are intended to be operated directly by an end user , rather than by a computer expert or technician . Unlike large costly minicomputers and mainframes , time-sharing by many people at the same time is not used with personal computers . Institutional or corporate computer owners in the 1960s had to write their own programs to do any useful work with the machines . While personal computer users may develop their own applications , usually these systems run commercial software , free-of-charge software ( freeware ) , which is most often proprietary , or free and open-source software , which is provided in ready-to-run , or binary , form . Software for personal computers is typically developed and distributed independently from the hardware or operating system manufacturers . Many personal computer users no longer need to write their own programs to make any use of a personal computer , although end-user programming is still feasible . This contrasts with mobile systems , where software is often only available through a manufacturer-supported channel , and end-user program development may be discouraged by lack of support by the manufacturer . Since the early 1990s , Microsoft operating systems and Intel hardware dominated much of the personal computer market , first with MS-DOS and then with Microsoft Windows . Alternatives to Microsoft 's Windows operating systems occupy a minority share of the industry . These include Apple 's macOS and free and open-source Unix-like operating systems . The advent of personal computers and the concurrent Digital Revolution have significantly affected the lives of people in all countries .",

In addition to online multimedia features , it allows users to stream media from local PCs . Several peripherals have been released , including wireless controllers , expanded hard drive storage , and the Kinect motion sensing camera . The release of these additional services and peripherals helped the Xbox brand grow from gaming-only to encompassing all multimedia , turning it into a hub for living-room computing entertainment . Launched worldwide across 2005-2006 , the Xbox 360 was initially in short supply in many regions , including North America and Europe . The earliest versions of the console suffered from a high failure rate , indicated by the so-called Red Ring of Death , necessitating an extension of the device 's warranty period . Microsoft released two redesigned models of the console : the Xbox 360 S in 2010 , and the Xbox 360 E in 2013 .",

It was alleged to be 12 feet ( 3.7 m ) long and weighed over 1,000 pounds ( 450 kg ) . It was originally widely considered a hoax . The animal 's remains were exhumed in early 2005 and studied by forensic scientists for a documentary for the National Geographic Channel . In March 2005 , these scientists confirmed that Hogzilla actually weighed 800 pounds ( 360 kg ) and was between 6.9 feet ( 2.1 m ) and 8.6 feet ( 2.6 m ) long , diminishing the previous claim . DNA testing was performed , revealing that Hogzilla was a hybrid of wild boar and domestic pig ( Hampshire breed ) .

The story follows the adventures of Jade , an investigative reporter and martial artist , who works with a resistance movement to reveal a planet-wide alien conspiracy . The player controls Jade and allies , solving puzzles , fighting enemies , and obtaining photographic evidence . Michel Ancel , creator of the Rayman series , envisioned the game as the first part of a trilogy . The game was developed under the codename Project BG & E by 30 employees of Ubisoft 's studio divisions in Montpellier and Milan , with production lasting more than three years . One of the main goals of the game is to create a meaningful story while giving players lots of freedom , though the game adopts a relatively linear structure . The game was received poorly when it was shown at E3 2002 , and it prompted the developers to change some of the game 's elements , including Jade 's design . Ancel also attempted to streamline the game in order to make it more commercially appealing . Beyond Good & Evil was critically acclaimed . Critics praised the game 's animation , setting , story , and design , but criticized its combat and technical issues . The game received a nomination for Game of the Year at the 2004 Game Developers Choice Awards . While the game had a cult following , it was considered a commercial failure at launch .",

The Super FX Chip has been used in other Super NES games as well , some with increased processing speed . Its reboot , Star Fox 64 , further revolutionized the video game industry by being the first Nintendo 64 game to feature the Rumble Pak . Due to perceived issues with the German company StarVox , Star Fox and Star Fox 64 were released in PAL region territories as Starwing and Lylat Wars respectively .

Human intervention has spread its distribution further , making the species one of the widest-ranging mammals in the world , as well as the most widely spread suiform . Its wide range , high numbers , and adaptability mean that it is classed as least concern by the IUCN and it has become an invasive species in part of its introduced range . The animal probably originated in Southeast Asia during the Early Pleistocene , and outcompeted other suid species as it spread throughout the Old World . As of 1990 , up to 16 subspecies are recognized , which are divided into four regional groupings based on skull height and lacrimal bone length . The species lives in matriarchal societies consisting of interrelated females and their young ( both male and female ) . Fully grown males are usually solitary outside the breeding season . The grey wolf , coyote , american alligator , jaguar , bobcat , lynx , cougar , and black bear , and brown bear is the wild boar 's main predators in the world , throughout most of its range , except in the Far East and the Lesser Sunda Islands , where it is replaced by the tiger , leopard , asiatic lion , and Komodo dragon , respectively . It has a long history of association with humans , having been the ancestor of most domestic pig breeds and a big-game animal for millennia . Boars have also re-hybridized in recent decades with feral pigs ; these boar-pig hybrids have become a serious pest wild animal in Australia , Canada , United States , and Mexico .",

It has a total land area of 268,000 square kilometres ( 103,500 sq mi ) . New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 mi ) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres ( 600 mi ) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal , fungal , and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , and its most populous city is Auckland . Sometime between 1250 and 1300 , Polynesians settled in the islands and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture . In 1642 , Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight New Zealand . In 1840 , representatives of the United Kingdom and M\u0101ori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi , which declared British sovereignty over the islands . In 1841 , New Zealand became a colony within the British Empire and in 1907 it became a dominion ; it gained full statutory independence in 1947 and the British monarch remained the head of state .",
