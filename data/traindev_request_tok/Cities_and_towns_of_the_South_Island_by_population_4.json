Since the re-organisation of New Zealand local government in 1989 it has been inside the Dunedin City Council area . Mosgiel has a population of approximately 13,400 as of June 2019 . The town celebrates its location , calling itself The pearl of the plain . Its low-lying nature does pose problems , making it prone to flooding after heavy rains . Mosgiel takes its name from Mossgiel Farm , Ayrshire , the farm of the poet Robert Burns , the uncle of the co-founder in 1848 of the Otago settlement , the Reverend Thomas Burns . [ note 1 ] Mosgiel stands at the north-eastern extremity of the Taieri Plains . The Silver Stream , a tributary of the Taieri River , runs through its north end . Between Mosgiel and the centre of Dunedin stand the rugged Three Mile Hill and Scroggs Hill , which form part of the crater-wall of a long-extinct volcano , the crater being the Otago Harbour . To the south of the town lies one of the many peaks that formed part of the volcano : Saddle Hill , a prominent landmark , visible from a considerable distance and notable for its distinctive shape , lies east of State Highway One where Kinmont Park , a new housing subdivision is located at the foot of the hill . The Dunedin Southern Motorway , upgraded in 2003 , links Mosgiel with the centre of Dunedin . State Highway 87 to Kyeburn starts at a junction with State Highway 1 at the southeastern edge of Mosgiel , the first part of the highway being the main street of Mosgiel , Gordon Road .",
  "/wiki/Otago": "Otago ( /\u0259\u02c8t\u0251\u02d0\u0261o\u028a/ ( listen ) , /o\u028a- , \u0252-/ , Maori : \u014ct\u0101kou [ \u0254 : \u02c8ta : kou ] ) is a region of New Zealand in the south of the South Island administered by the Otago Regional Council . It has an area of approximately 32,000 square kilometres ( 12,000 sq mi ) , making it the country 's third largest local government region . Its population was 232,300 in June 2018 . The name Otago is an Anglicisation of Otakou , the name of the M\u0101ori village near the entrance to the harbour . The exact meaning of the term is disputed , with common translations being isolated village and place of red earth , the latter referring to the reddish-ochre clay which is common in the area around Dunedin . Otago is also the old name of the European settlement on the Otago Harbour , established by the Weller Brothers in 1831 , which lies close to the modern harbourside community of Otakou . The place later became the focus of the Otago Association , an offshoot of the Free Church of Scotland , notable for its adoption of the principle that ordinary people , not the landowner , should choose the ministers . Major centres include Dunedin ( the principal city ) , Oamaru ( made famous by Janet Frame ) , Balclutha , Alexandra , and the major tourist centres Queenstown and Wanaka . Kaitangata in South Otago is a prominent source of coal . The Waitaki and Clutha rivers provide much of the country 's hydroelectric power . Some parts of the area originally covered by Otago Province are now administered by either Canterbury Regional Council or Southland Regional Council . The Central Otago wine region produces award-winning wines made from varieties such as the Pinot noir , Chardonnay , Sauvignon blanc , Merlot and Riesling grapes .",

A densely populated residential suburb , it lies on the southern part of the city 's central plain , to the southwest of the head of the harbour and immediately north of Ocean Beach , parts of which ( St Kilda Beach and Middle Beach ) are within the suburb and form its major geographical feature . Saint Kilda 's 2001 population was 5,904 . The suburb has fairly well-defined boundaries , having been a separate borough from 1875 until the time of local government restructuring in 1989 . This borough was bounded by Forbury Road in the west , Bay View Road in the north , and Royal Crescent in the east , and at the time of its amalgamation into Dunedin City , was the most densely populated borough in New Zealand . Much of the borough 's growth was between 1900 and 1930 , during which time the population rose from around 1500 to 8000 , slowly declining from that time to its current figure . Many of St Kilda 's houses date from this period . St Kilda was named for the Melbourne suburb by early property developer George Scott , who had arrived in New Zealand from Victoria in 1862 . The area previously had the Maori name Whakaherekau . St Kilda gave its name to a New Zealand electoral constituency which covered much of southern Dunedin and the Otago Peninsula . This electorate existed from 1946 to 1993 ( after which it was replaced by the new Dunedin South electorate ) , and was represented in turn by Fred Jones ( Labour , 1946-1951 ) , Sir James Barnes ( National , 1951-1957 ) , Bill Fraser , ( Labour , 1957-1981 ) , and Michael Cullen ( Labour , 1981-1993 ) .

Major road and rail routes south lie nearby ; the South Island Main Trunk railway runs through the suburb , and a bypass skirts its main retail area , connecting Dunedin 's one-way street system with the Dunedin Southern Motorway . The suburb is linked by several bus routes to its neighbouring suburbs and central Dunedin . The suburb was founded by wealthy pioneer William Henry Valpy , and its name reflects his family connections with the town of Reading , in the English county of Berkshire . Caversham grew rapidly during the Central Otago Gold Rush of the 1860s because of its location on routes south to the Otago hinterland . By the end of the 19th century , Caversham was heavily industrialised , and its population included many skilled or semi-skilled tradespeople . This , combined with the community 's strong Protestant roots , led to the area 's generally left-leaning political stance . Caversham 's early history has been the subject of the Caversham Project , a major historical and archaeological study by the University of Otago . Caversham was a separate borough until 1904 , when it was amalgamated with Dunedin city . It is currently administered as part of the city 's South Dunedin ward .
