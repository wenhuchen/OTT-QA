  "/wiki/St_Trinian's_(film)": "St Trinian 's is a 2007 British comedy film and the sixth in a long-running series of British films based on the works of cartoonist Ronald Searle set in St Trinian 's School . The first five films form a series , [ citation needed ] starting with The Belles of St Trinian 's in 1954 , with sequels in 1957 , 1960 , 1966 and 1980 . The release of 2007 , 27 years after the last entry , and 53 years after the first film , is a rebooting of the franchise , rather than a direct sequel , with certain plot elements borrowed from the first film . Whereas the earlier films concentrated on the adults , this film gives the school pupils greater prominence . St Trinian 's is an anarchic school for uncontrollable girls run by eccentric headmistress Camilla Dagey Fritton ( the reboot continues the tradition , established by Alastair Sim in the original film , of casting a male actor to play the female headmistress , with Rupert Everett inheriting the role ) . St Trinian 's received mixed reviews but remains one of the highest-grossing British independent films of the last thirty years .",

  "/wiki/Quantum_of_Solace": "Quantum of Solace is a 2008 spy film and the twenty-second in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions . Directed by Marc Forster and written by Paul Haggis , Neal Purvis and Robert Wade , it is a direct sequel to Casino Royale , and the second film to star Daniel Craig as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond . The film also stars Olga Kurylenko , Mathieu Amalric , Gemma Arterton , Jeffrey Wright , and Judi Dench . In the film , Bond seeks revenge for the death of his lover , Vesper Lynd , and is assisted by Camille Montes , who is plotting revenge for the murder of her own family . The trail eventually leads them to wealthy businessman Dominic Greene , a member of the Quantum organisation , who intends to stage a coup d'\u00e9tat in Bolivia to seize control of their water supply . Producer Michael G. Wilson developed the film 's plot while the previous film in the series , Casino Royale , was being shot . Purvis , Wade , and Haggis contributed to the script . Although Craig and Forster wrote some sections themselves during the screenwriter strike , they received no such credits in the final cut . The title was chosen from a 1959 short story in Ian Fleming 's For Your Eyes Only , though the film does not contain any elements of that story . Location filming took place in Mexico , Panama , Chile , Italy , Austria and Wales , while interior sets were built and filmed at Pinewood Studios . Forster aimed to make a modern film that also featured classic cinema motifs : a vintage Douglas DC-3 was used for a flight sequence , and Dennis Gassner 's set designs are reminiscent of Ken Adam 's work on several early Bond films . Taking a course away from the usual Bond villains , Forster rejected any grotesque appearance for the character Dominic Greene to emphasise the hidden and secret nature of the film 's contemporary villains .",
