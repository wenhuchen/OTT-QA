Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613 . [ d ] His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres .",

He created some of the world 's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era . His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime , and by the 20th century , critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius . His novels and short stories are still widely read today . Born in Portsmouth , Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors ' prison . Despite his lack of formal education , he edited a weekly journal for 20 years , wrote 15 novels , five novellas , hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles , lectured and performed readings extensively , was an indefatigable letter writer , and campaigned vigorously for children 's rights , education , and other social reforms . Dickens 's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers . Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity , famous for his humour , satire , and keen observation of character and society . His novels , most published in monthly or weekly instalments , pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction , which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication . Cliffhanger endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense . The installment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience 's reaction , and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback . For example , when his wife 's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities , Dickens improved the character with positive features .",

The play contains music and songs that evoke the spirit of enchantment on the island . It explores many themes , including magic , betrayal , revenge , and family . In Act IV , a wedding masque serves as a play-within-the play , and contributes spectacle , allegory , and elevated language . Though The Tempest is listed in the First Folio as the first of Shakespeare 's comedies , it deals with both tragic and comic themes , and modern criticism has created a category of romance for this and others of Shakespeare 's late plays . The Tempest has been put to varied interpretations - from those that see it as a fable of art and creation , with Prospero representing Shakespeare , and Prospero 's renunciation of magic signaling Shakespeare 's farewell to the stage , to interpretations that consider it an allegory of Europeans colonizing foreign lands .",

  "/wiki/The_Taming_of_the_Shrew": "The Taming of the Shrew is a comedy by William Shakespeare , believed to have been written between 1590 and 1592 . The play begins with a framing device , often referred to as the induction , [ a ] in which a mischievous nobleman tricks a drunken tinker named Christopher Sly into believing he is actually a nobleman himself . The nobleman then has the play performed for Sly 's diversion . The main plot depicts the courtship of Petruchio and Katherina , the headstrong , obdurate shrew . Initially , Katherina is an unwilling participant in the relationship ; however , Petruchio tames her with various psychological torments , such as keeping her from eating and drinking , until she becomes a desirable , compliant , and obedient bride .

The Epistle is noteworthy for its indication that Middleton , atypically for dramatists of his era , composed his plays for readers as well as theatre audiences . The Roaring Girl is a fictionalized dramatization of the life of Mary Frith , known as Moll Cutpurse , a woman who had gained a reputation as a virago in the early 17th century . ( The term roaring girl was adapted from the slang term roaring boy , which was applied to a young man who caroused publicly , brawled , and committed petty crimes . ) She was also the subject of a lost chapbook written by John Day titled The Mad Pranks of Merry Moll of the Bankside , which was entered into the Stationers ' Register on 7 August 1610 .
