  "/wiki/Mid-levels": "Mid-Levels ( Chinese : \u534a\u5c71\u5340 ; Sidney Lau : boon3 saan1 kui1 ; literally : 'mid mountain area ' ) is an affluent residential area on Hong Kong Island in Hong Kong . It is located between Victoria Peak and Central . Residents are predominantly more affluent Hong Kong locals and expatriate professionals . The Mid-Levels is further divided into four areas : Mid-Levels West ( near Central , Sheung Wan and Sai Wan including Bonham Road , Caine Road , and Conduit Road , stretching from University of Hong Kong in the west to Garden Road in the east ) , Mid-Levels Central ( near Admiralty and Wan Chai , including Macdonnell Road , Kennedy Road and Bowen Road ) , stretching from Garden Road in the west to Happy Valley in the east ) , Mid-Levels East ( near Causeway Bay , including Jardine 's Lookout and Mount Butler ) , and Mid-Levels North ( near North Point including Braemar Hill ) . Aside from the panoramic view of Victoria Harbour or the rest of the city or both , it is also close to Central and Admiralty , which are both significant business areas , thus providing easy and convenient access for the business people living in Mid-Levels . An added attraction of the Mid-Levels is its close proximity to nature and comparatively better air quality than many parts of the Hong Kong Island . Many wealthy people in Hong Kong are willing to pay higher residential property price for a residence that is away from pollution and yet remain so close to the centre of the city . Many streets are named after former Governors of Hong Kong . Examples include Bonham Road ( after George Bonham , 1848-1854 ) and Kennedy Road ( after Arthur Edward Kennedy , 1872-1877 ) . Many of the roads in this area are within walking distance of the Central Business District , which is accessible by the Mid-Levels escalator from Central . Many choices for housing are available , from ultra-luxurious apartments to compact , near-luxury apartments . The costs of these apartments vary considerably according to the size , location and age of the building .",
