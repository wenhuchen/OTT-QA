  "/wiki/Comedy": "In a modern sense , comedy ( from the Greek : \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 , k\u014dm\u014did\u00eda ) is a genre of fiction that refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter , especially in theatre , television , film , stand-up comedy , books and novels or any other medium of entertainment . The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece . In the Athenian democracy , the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters . The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict . Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a Society of Youth and a Society of the Old . A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes . In this struggle , the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority , and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter . Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt , thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor . Parody subverts popular genres and forms , critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them . Other forms of comedy include screwball comedy , which derives its humor largely from bizarre , surprising ( and improbable ) situations or characters , and black comedy , which is characterized by a form of humor that includes darker aspects of human behavior or human nature . Similarly scatological humor , sexual humor , and race humor create comedy by violating social conventions or taboos in comic ways . A comedy of manners typically takes as its subject a particular part of society ( usually upper-class society ) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members .",

  "/wiki/Sport": "Sport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which , through casual or organised participation , at least in part aim to use , maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants , and in some cases , entertainment for spectators . Hundreds of sports exist , from those between single contestants , through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants , either in teams or competing as individuals . In certain sports such as racing , many contestants may compete , simultaneously or consecutively , with one winner ; in others , the contest ( a match ) is between two sides , each attempting to exceed the other . Some sports allow a tie or draw , in which there is no single winner ; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser . A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion . Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season , followed in some cases by playoffs . Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity , with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition , and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports . However , a number of competitive , but non-physical , activities claim recognition as mind sports . The International Olympic Committee ( through ARISF ) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports , and SportAccord , the international sports federation association , recognises five non-physical sports : bridge , chess , draughts ( checkers ) , Go and xiangqi , and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports . Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs , which serve to ensure fair competition , and allow consistent adjudication of the winner . Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first . It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance , including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression .",

  "/wiki/Interview": "An interview is essentially a structured conversation where one participant asks questions , and the other provides answers . In common parlance , the word interview refers to a one-on-one conversation between an interviewer and an interviewee . The interviewer asks questions to which the interviewee responds , usually so information is offered by the interviewee to interviewer -- and that information may be used or provided to other audiences , whether in real time or later . This feature is common to many types of interviews -- a job interview or interview with a witness to an event may have no other audience present at the time , but the answers will be later provided to others in the employment or investigative process . The information or answers may also be transferred in both directions in a tradition interview . Interviews usually take place face-to-face and in person , although modern communications technologies such as the Internet have enabled conversations to happen in which parties are separated geographically , such as with videoconferencing software , and telephone interviews can happen without visual contact . Interviews almost always involve spoken conversation between two or more parties , although in some instances a conversation can happen between two persons who type questions and answers back and forth . Interviews can range from Unstructured interview or free-wheeling and open-ended conversations in which there is no predetermined plan with prearranged questions , to highly structured conversations in which specific questions occur in a specified order . They can follow diverse formats ; for example , in a ladder interview , a respondent 's answers typically guide subsequent interviews , with the object being to explore a respondent 's subconscious motives . Typically the interviewer has some way of recording the information that is gleaned from the interviewee , often by writing with a pencil and paper , sometimes transcribing with a video or audio recorder , depending on the context and extent of information and the length of the interview . Interviews have a duration in time , in the sense that the interview has a beginning and an ending . The traditional two-person interview format , sometimes called a one-on-one interview , permits direct questions and followups , which enables an interviewer to better gauge the accuracy of responses .",
