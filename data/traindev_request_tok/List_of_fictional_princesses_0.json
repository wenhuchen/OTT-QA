At 17,125,200 square kilometres ( 6,612,100 sq mi ) , it is by far the largest country in the world by area , covering more than one-eighth of the Earth 's inhabited land area , spanning eleven time zones , and bordering 16 sovereign nations . The territory of Russia extends from the Baltic Sea in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east , and from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea and the Caucasus in the south . With 146.7 million inhabitants living in the country 's 85 federal subjects as of 2020 , Russia is the most populous nation in Europe and the ninth-most populous nation in the world . Russia 's capital and largest city is Moscow ; other major urban areas include Saint Petersburg , Novosibirsk , Yekaterinburg , Nizhny Novgorod , Kazan and Chelyabinsk . The East Slavs emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD . Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants , the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century . In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire , beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium . Rus ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states , until it was finally reunified by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th century . By the 18th century , the nation had greatly expanded through conquest , annexation , and exploration to become the Russian Empire , which was the third largest empire in history , stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east . Following the Russian Revolution , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) became the largest and leading constituent of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR/Soviet Union ) , the world 's first constitutionally socialist state .",
  "/wiki/Fairy_tale": "A fairy tale , fairytale , wonder tale , magic tale , or M\u00e4rchen is an instance of a folklore genre that takes the form of a short story . Such stories typically feature entities such as dwarfs , dragons , elves , fairies , giants , gnomes , goblins , griffins , mermaids , talking animals , trolls , unicorns , or witches , and usually magic or enchantments . In most cultures , there is no clear line separating myth from folk or fairy tale ; all these together form the literature of preliterate societies . Fairy tales may be distinguished [ by whom ? ] from other folk narratives such as legends ( which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described ) and explicit moral tales , including beast fables . The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and , at least in recent centuries , mostly relates to children 's literature . In less technical contexts , the term is also used to describe something blessed with unusual happiness , as in fairy-tale ending ( a happy ending ) or fairy-tale romance . Colloquially , the term fairy tale or fairy story can also mean any far-fetched story or tall tale ; it is used especially of any story that not only is not true , but could not possibly be true . Legends are perceived [ by whom ? ] as real ; fairy tales may merge into legends , where the narrative is perceived both by teller and hearers as being grounded in historical truth . However , unlike legends and epics , fairy tales usually do not contain more than superficial references to religion and to actual places , people , and events ; they take place once upon a time rather than in actual times . Fairy tales occur both in oral and in literary form ; the name fairy tale ( conte de f\u00e9es in French ) was first ascribed to them by Madame d'Aulnoy in the late 17th century .",
