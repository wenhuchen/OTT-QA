  "/wiki/Cynognathus": "Cynognathus is an extinct genus of large-bodied cynodontian therapsids that lived in the Middle Triassic . It is known from a single species , Cynognathus crateronotus . Cynognathus was a 1.2-metre ( 3 ft 11 in ) long predator closely related to mammals and had a southern hemispheric distribution . Fossils have so far been recovered from South Africa , Argentina , Antarctica , and Namibia .",
  "/wiki/Cynodont": "The cynodonts ( dog teeth ) ( clade Cynodontia ) are therapsids that first appeared in the Late Permian ( approximately 260 Ma ) . The cynodonts include modern mammals ( including humans ) as well as their extinct ancestors and close relatives , but not all cynodonts were mammals .",
  "/wiki/Diademodontidae": "Diademodontidae is an extinct family of Triassic gomphodonts . The best-known genus is Diademodon from South Africa . Titanogomphodon from Namibia may also be a member of Diademodontidae . The Chinese genera Hazhenia and Ordosiodon have also been included in the family , but were more recently identified as baurioid therocephalians . Remains of a diademodontid have been discovered in the Early Triassic Fremouw Formation in Antarctica .",
  "/wiki/Ericiolacerta": "Ericiolacerta is an extinct genus of small therocephalian therapsids from the early Triassic of South Africa and Antarctica . It was around 20 centimetres ( 7.9 in ) in length , with long limbs and relatively small teeth . It probably ate insects and other small invertebrates . The therocephalians - reptiles with mammal-like heads - were quite abundant in Permian times , but only a few made it into the Triassic . Ericiolacerta was one of those . It is possible that they gave rise to the cynodonts , the only mammal-like reptile group to exist into late Triassic times . It was these that gave rise to the mammals . Little holes in the snout area of the skull suggest that perhaps the snout had highly developed sense organs , like whiskers . There is a palate in the roof of the mouth , separating the breathing passage from the eating area . This suggests an efficient eating mechanism that may indicate a warm-blooded lifestyle . Ericiolacerta , meaning Eric 's little lizard , was named in 1931 .",
  "/wiki/Therocephalia": "Therocephalia is an extinct suborder of eutheriodont therapsids from the Permian and Triassic . The therocephalians ( beast-heads ) are named after their large skulls , which , along with the structure of their teeth , suggest that they were carnivores . Like other non-mammalian synapsids , therocephalians were once described as mammal-like reptiles . Therocephalia is the group most closely related to the cynodonts , which gave rise to the mammals . This relationship takes evidence in a variety of skeletal features . The phylogeny of therocephalians has been disputed , as the monophyly of the group and the relationships of its members are unclear . The fossils of therocephalians are numerous in the Karoo of South Africa , but have also been found in Russia , China , and Antarctica . Early therocephalian fossils discovered in Middle Permian deposits of South Africa support a Gondwanan origin for the group , which seems to have spread quickly throughout the world . Although almost every therocephalian lineage ended during the great Permian-Triassic extinction event , a few representatives of the subgroup called Eutherocephalia survived into the Early Triassic . However , the last therocephalians became extinct by the early Middle Triassic , possibly due to climate change and competition with cynodonts and various groups of reptiles .",
  "/wiki/Kannemeyeriidae": "Kannemeyeria was a large dicynodont of the family Kannemeyeriidae , one of the first representatives of the family , and hence one of the first large herbivores of the Triassic . It lived during the later Early and early Middle part of the Triassic period ( from the late Olenekian to the Middle Anisian age ) .",
  "/wiki/Dicynodont": "Dicynodontia is a taxon of anomodont therapsids with beginnings in the mid-Permian , which were dominant in the Late Permian , survived the Permian Extinction that wiped out most other therapsids and continued on throughout the Triassic before dying out at the end of the period . Dicynodonts were herbivorous animals with two tusks , hence their name , which means 'two dog tooth ' . They are also the most successful and diverse of the non-mammalian therapsids , with over 70 genera known , varying from rat- to elephant-sized .",
  "/wiki/Kombuisia": "Kombuisia is a genus of dicynodont from Early to Middle Triassic ( Induan to Anisian ) of South Africa and Antarctica . Two species were described for the genus : Kombuisia frerensis ( type ) and Kombuisia antarctica . Dicynodonts were a diverse clade that inhabited the earth from the Middle Permian to the Late Triassic . Kombuisia is one of few species to survive the mass extinction event in the late Permian . Kombuisia are non-mammalian synapsid herbivores . Specimens of this genus were discovered in the 1960s and 1970s and years later were determined to be two different species of the genus . The two species were found in diverse areas , K. frerensis in South Africa and K. antarctica in Antarctica . This indicated that this genus existed in a wider biographical region in the southern hemisphere of Pangaea and believed by some to indicate the migration to Antarctica to avoid the rise in global temperatures that lead to the mass extinction . Migration to avoid global warming has been highly controversial because many of the fossils that are found in this region are juvenile and of small body size . But so far no Permian vertebrate fossils are known from Antarctica , making it less likely that they were already living there prior to the event . Originally the specimens that were collected in Antarctica were considered to be part of the Kingoria ( now known as Dicynodontoides ) genus . The specimens were originally catalogued in the American Museum of Natural History as Kingoria , however , with no formal reasoning for this categorization , this has since been revised with more up-to-date knowledge of features and speciation .",

Four to six species are currently recognized , although from the 1930s to 1970s the number of species was thought to be much higher . They ranged in size from that of a small dog to 2.5 meters long . [ better source needed ] Being a dicynodont , Lystrosaurus had only two teeth ( a pair of tusk-like canines ) , and is thought to have had a horny beak that was used for biting off pieces of vegetation . Lystrosaurus was a heavily built , herbivorous animal , approximately the size of a pig . The structure of its shoulders and hip joints suggests that Lystrosaurus moved with a semi-sprawling gait . The forelimbs were even more robust than the hindlimbs , and the animal is thought to have been a powerful digger that nested in burrows . Lystrosaurus survived the Permian-Triassic extinction , 252 million years ago . In the Early Triassic , they were by far the most common terrestrial vertebrates , accounting for as many as 95% of the total individuals in some fossil beds . Researchers have forwarded various hypotheses for why Lystrosaurus survived the extinction event and prospered in the early Triassic .",

  "/wiki/Thrinaxodon": "Thrinaxodon is an extinct genus of cynodonts , most commonly regarded by its species T. liorhinus which lived in what are now South Africa and Antarctica . Thrinaxodon has been dated between the Permian-Triassic mass extinction and the mid-Triassic . Its survival during the extinction may have been due to its burrowing habits . Similar to other synapsids , Thrinaxodon adopted a semi-sprawling posture , an intermediary form between the sprawling position of pelycosaurs ( not unlike current Crocodylia ) and the more upright posture present in current mammals . Thrinaxodon is prevalent in the fossil record in part because it was one of the few carnivores of its time , and was of a larger size than similar cynodont carnivores . [ citation needed ]"
