  "/wiki/Armenia": "The original native Armenian name for the country was \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0584 ( Hayk ) ; however , it is currently rarely used . The contemporary name \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576 ( Hayastan ) became popular in the Middle Ages by addition of the Persian suffix -stan ( place ) . [ citation needed ] . However the origins of the name Hayastan trace back to much earlier dates and were first attested in circa 5th century in the works of Agathangelos , Faustus of Byzantium , Ghazar Parpetsi , Koryun , and Sebeos . The name has traditionally been derived from Hayk ( \u0540\u0561\u0575\u056f ) , the legendary patriarch of the Armenians and a great-great-grandson of Noah , who , according to the 5th-century AD author Moses of Chorene ( Movsis Khorenatsi ) , defeated the Babylonian king Bel in 2492 BC and established his nation in the Ararat region . The further origin of the name is uncertain . It is also further postulated that the name Hay comes from one of the two confederated , Hittite vassal states - the \u1e2aaya\u0161a-Azzi ( 1600-1200 BC ) . The exonym Armenia is attested in the Old Persian Behistun Inscription ( 515 BC ) as Armina ( ) . The Ancient Greek terms \u1f08\u03c1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 ( Armen\u00eda ) and \u1f08\u03c1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 ( Arm\u00e9nioi , Armenians ) are first mentioned by Hecataeus of Miletus ( c. 550 BC - c. 476 BC ) . Xenophon , a Greek general serving in some of the Persian expeditions , describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BC . Some scholars have linked the name Armenia with the Early Bronze Age state of Armani ( Armanum , Armi ) or the Late Bronze Age state of Arme ( Shupria ) . These connections are inconclusive as it is not known what languages were spoken in these kingdoms .",

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia .

Ferdinand I was crowned a Tsar at the Declaration of Independence , mainly because of his military plans and for seeking options for unification of all lands in the Balkans region with an ethnic Bulgarian majority ( lands that had been seized from Bulgaria and given to the Ottoman Empire in the Treaty of Berlin ) . The state was almost constantly at war throughout its existence , lending to its nickname as the Balkan Prussia . For several years Bulgaria mobilized an army of more than 1 million people from its population of about 5 million and in the 1910s it engaged in three wars - the First and Second Balkan Wars , and the First World War . Following the First World War , the Bulgarian army was disbanded and forbidden to exist by the Allied Powers , and all plans for national unification of the Bulgarian lands failed . Less than two decades later Bulgaria once again went to war for national unification as part of the Second World War , and once again found itself on the losing side , until it switched sides to the Allies in 1944 .

Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces .

It was established in January 1912 after the Xinhai Revolution , which overthrew the Qing dynasty , the last imperial dynasty of China . The Republic 's first president , Sun Yat-sen , served only briefly before handing over the position to Yuan Shikai , the leader of the Beiyang Army . Sun 's party , the Kuomintang ( KMT ) , then led by Song Jiaoren , won the parliamentary election held in December 1912 . However , Song was assassinated on Yuan 's orders shortly after ; and the Beiyang Army , led by Yuan , maintained full control of the Beiyang government . Between late 1915 and early 1916 , Yuan proclaimed himself Emperor of China before abdicating not long after due to popular unrest . After Yuan 's death in 1916 , the authority of the Beiyang government was further weakened by a brief restoration of the Qing dynasty . Cliques in the Beiyang Army claimed individual autonomy and clashed with each other during the ensuing Warlord Era . In 1921 , the KMT established a rival government in Canton , supported by the fledgling Communist Party of China ( CPC ) . The economy of northern China , overtaxed to support warlord adventurism , collapsed between 1927 and 1928 .

  "/wiki/French_Third_Republic": "The French Third Republic ( French : La Troisi\u00e8me R\u00e9publique , sometimes written as La IIIe R\u00e9publique ) was the system of government adopted in France from 1870 , when the Second French Empire collapsed during the Franco-Prussian War , until 10 July 1940 after France 's defeat by Nazi Germany in World War II led to the formation of the Vichy government in France . The early days of the Third Republic were dominated by political disruptions caused by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 , which the Republic continued to wage after the fall of Emperor Napoleon III in 1870 . Harsh reparations exacted by the Prussians after the war resulted in the loss of the French regions of Alsace ( keeping the Territoire de Belfort ) and Lorraine ( the northeastern part , i.e . present-day department of Moselle ) , social upheaval , and the establishment of the Paris Commune . The early governments of the Third Republic considered re-establishing the monarchy , but disagreement as to the nature of that monarchy and the rightful occupant of the throne could not be resolved . Consequently , the Third Republic , originally envisioned as a provisional government , instead became the permanent form of government of France . The French Constitutional Laws of 1875 defined the composition of the Third Republic . It consisted of a Chamber of Deputies and a Senate to form the legislative branch of government and a president to serve as head of state . Calls for the re-establishment of the monarchy dominated the tenures of the first two presidents , Adolphe Thiers and Patrice de MacMahon , but growing support for the republican form of government among the French populace and a series of republican presidents in the 1880s gradually quashed prospects of a monarchical restoration . The Third Republic established many French colonial possessions , including French Indochina , French Madagascar , French Polynesia , and large territories in West Africa during the Scramble for Africa , all of them acquired during the last two decades of the 19th century . The early years of the 20th century were dominated by the Democratic Republican Alliance , which was originally conceived as a centre-left political alliance , but over time became the main centre-right party . The period from the start of World War I to the late 1930s featured sharply polarized politics , between the Democratic Republican Alliance and the Radicals .",

Berlin remained its capital , and Otto , Prince of Bismarck , Minister-President of Prussia became Chancellor , the head of government . As these events occurred , the Prussian-led North German Confederation and its southern German allies were still engaged in the Franco-Prussian War . The German Empire consisted of 26 states , most of them ruled by royal families . They included four kingdoms , six grand duchies , five duchies ( six before 1876 ) , seven principalities , three free Hanseatic cities , and one imperial territory . Although Prussia was one of several kingdoms in the realm , it contained about two thirds of Germany 's population and territory . Prussian dominance had also been established constitutionally . After 1850 , the states of Germany had rapidly become industrialized , with particular strengths in coal , iron ( and later steel ) , chemicals , and railways . In 1871 , Germany had a population of 41 million people ; by 1913 , this had increased to 68 million .

  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary": "The Kingdom of Hungary was a monarchy in Central Europe that existed from the Middle Ages into the 20th century ( 1000-1946 with the exception of 1918-1920 ) . The Principality of Hungary emerged as a Christian kingdom upon the coronation of the first king Stephen I at Esztergom around the year 1000 ; his family ( the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty ) led the monarchy for 300 years . By the 12th century , the kingdom became a European middle power within the Western world . Due to the Ottoman occupation of the central and southern territories of Hungary in the 16th century , the country was partitioned into three parts : the Habsburg Royal Hungary , Ottoman Hungary , and the semi-independent Principality of Transylvania . The House of Habsburg held the Hungarian throne after the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs until 1918 and also played a key role in the liberation wars against the Ottoman Empire . From 1867 , territories connected to the Hungarian crown were incorporated into Austria-Hungary under the name of Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen . The monarchy ended with the deposition of the last king Charles IV in 1918 , after which Hungary became a republic . The kingdom was nominally restored during the Regency of 1920-46 , ending under the Soviet occupation in 1946 . The Kingdom of Hungary was a multiethnic state from its inception until the Treaty of Trianon and it covered what is today Hungary , Slovakia , Transylvania and other parts of Romania , Carpathian Ruthenia ( now part of Ukraine ) , Vojvodina ( now part of Serbia ) , the territory of Burgenland ( now part of Austria ) , Me\u0111imurje ( now part of Croatia ) , Prekmurje ( now part of Slovenia ) and a few villages in Poland . From 1102 it also included Croatia , being in personal union with it , united under the King of Hungary . According to the demographers , about 80 percent of the population was made up of Hungarians before the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs , [ neutrality is disputed ] however in the mid 19th century out of a population of 14 million less than 6 million were Hungarian due to the resettlement policies and continuous immigration from neighboring countries .

The rule is also called Crown rule in India , or direct rule in India . The region under British control was commonly called India in contemporaneous usage , and included areas directly administered by the United Kingdom , which were collectively called British India , plus those ruled by indigenous rulers , but under British tutelage or paramountcy , called the princely states . The whole was never officially called the Indian Empire , only informally .

This system of governance was instituted on 28 June 1858 , when , after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the rule of the British East India Company was transferred to the Crown in the person of Queen Victoria ( who , in 1876 , was proclaimed Empress of India ) . It lasted until 1947 , when it was partitioned into two sovereign dominion states : the Dominion of India ( later the Republic of India ) and the Dominion of Pakistan ( later the Islamic Republic of Pakistan , the eastern part of which , still later , became the People 's Republic of Bangladesh in 1971 ) . At the inception of the Raj in 1858 , Lower Burma was already a part of British India ; Upper Burma was added in 1886 , and the resulting union , Burma ( Myanmar ) , was administered as an autonomous province until 1937 , when it became a separate British colony , gaining its own independence in 1948 .",

  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy": "The Kingdom of Italy ( Italian : Regno d'Italia ) was a state which existed from 1861 - when King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia was proclaimed King of Italy - until 1946 - when civil discontent led an institutional referendum to abandon the monarchy and form the modern Italian Republic . The state was founded as a result of the unification of Italy under the influence of the Kingdom of Sardinia , which can be considered its legal predecessor state . Italy declared war on Austria in alliance with Prussia in 1866 and received the region of Veneto following their victory . Italian troops entered Rome in 1870 , thereby ending more than one thousand years of Papal temporal power . Italy entered into a Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1882 , following strong disagreements with France about the respective colonial expansions . However , even if relations with Berlin became very friendly , the alliance with Vienna remained purely formal as the Italians were keen to acquire Trentino and Trieste , corners of Austria-Hungary populated by Italians . So during World War I , Italy accepted the British invitation to join the Allied Powers , as the western powers promised territorial compensation ( at the expense of Austria-Hungary ) for participation that was more generous than Vienna 's offer in exchange for Italian neutrality . Victory in the war gave Italy a permanent seat in the Council of the League of Nations . Fascist Italy is the era of National Fascist Party government from 1922 to 1943 with Benito Mussolini as head of government . The fascists imposed totalitarian rule and crushed the political and intellectual opposition , while promoting economic modernization , traditional social values and a rapprochement with the Roman Catholic Church . According to Payne ( 1996 ) , [ the ] Fascist government passed through several relatively distinct phases . The first phase ( 1923-1925 ) was nominally a continuation of the parliamentary system , albeit with a legally-organized executive dictatorship .",

  "/wiki/Empire_of_Japan": "The Empire of Japan ( \u5927\u65e5\u672c\u5e1d\u570b , Dai Nippon Teikoku , literally Empire of Great Japan ) was the historical nation-state [ nb 2 ] and great power that existed from the Meiji Restoration in 1868 to the enactment of the 1947 constitution of modern Japan . Japan 's rapid industrialization and militarization under the slogan Fukoku Ky\u014dhei ( \u5bcc\u570b\u5f37\u5175 , Enrich the Country , Strengthen her Armed Forces ) and Shokusan K\u014dgy\u014d ( \u6b96\u7523\u8208\u696d , Promote Industry ) led to its emergence as a world power and the establishment of a colonial empire following the First Sino-Japanese War , the Boxer Rebellion , the Russo-Japanese War , and World War I . Economic and political turmoil in the 1920s led to the rise of militarism and totalitarianism , eventually culminating in Japan 's membership in the Axis alliance and the conquest of a large part of the Asia-Pacific in World War II . Japan 's armed forces initially achieved large-scale military successes during the Second Sino-Japanese War ( 1937-1945 ) and the Pacific War . However , after many Allied victories and following the Soviet Union 's declaration of war against Japan on August 9 , 1945 , and subsequent invasion of Manchuria and other territories , and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the Empire surrendered to the Allies on August 15 , 1945 . A period of occupation by the Allies followed . In 1947 , with American involvement , a new constitution was enacted , officially bringing the Empire of Japan to an end . Occupation and reconstruction continued until 1952 , eventually forming the current constitutional monarchy known as Japan . The Emperors during this time , which spanned the entire Meiji , Taish\u014d , and the lesser part of the Sh\u014dwa era , are now known in Japan by their posthumous names , which coincide with those era names : Emperor Meiji ( Mutsuhito ) , Emperor Taish\u014d ( Yoshihito ) , and Emperor Sh\u014dwa ( Hirohito ) .",

  "/wiki/Dominion_of_Newfoundland": "Newfoundland was a British dominion from 1907 to 1934 when it surrendered dominion status by ending self-government in exchange for British Royal Commission rule as a crown colony . Newfoundland remained a crown colony until Newfoundland joined Canada as a province . The dominion , situated in northeastern North America along the Atlantic coast , comprised the island of Newfoundland as well as Labrador on the continental mainland . Before attaining dominion status , Newfoundland was a British colony , self-governing from 1855 . Newfoundland was one of the original dominions within the meaning of the Balfour Declaration of 1926 and the Statute of Westminster of 1931 , accordingly enjoyed a constitutional status equivalent to the other dominions at the time . In 1934 , Newfoundland became the only dominion to give up its self-governing status , ending 79 years of self-government . This episode came about due to a crisis in Newfoundland 's public finances in 1932 . Newfoundland had accumulated a significant amount of debt by building a railway across the island ( completed in the 1890s ) and by raising its own regiment for the First World War . In November 1932 the government warned that Newfoundland would default on payments on the public debt . The British government quickly established the Newfoundland Royal Commission to inquire into and report on the position . The Commission 's report , published in October 1933 , recommended that Newfoundland give up its system of self-government temporarily and allow the United Kingdom to administer the dominion through an appointed commission . The Newfoundland parliament accepted this recommendation and presented a petition to the King asking for the suspension of the constitution and the appointment of commissioners to administer the government until the country became self-supporting again .",

  "/wiki/Dominion_of_New_Zealand": "The Dominion of New Zealand ( M\u0101ori : Te Tominiana o Aotearoa ) was the historical successor to the Colony of New Zealand . It was a constitutional monarchy with a high level of self-government within the British Empire . New Zealand became a separate British Crown colony in 1841 and received responsible government with the Constitution Act in 1852 . New Zealand chose not to take part in Australian Federation and became the Dominion of New Zealand on 26 September 1907 , Dominion Day , by proclamation of King Edward VII . Dominion status was a public mark of the political independence that had evolved over half a century through responsible government . Just under one million people lived in New Zealand in 1907 and cities such as Auckland and Wellington were growing rapidly . The Dominion of New Zealand allowed the British Government to shape its foreign policy , and it followed Britain into the First World War . The 1923 and 1926 Imperial Conferences decided that New Zealand should be allowed to negotiate its own political treaties , and the first commercial treaty was ratified in 1928 with Japan . When the Second World War broke out in 1939 the New Zealand Government made its own decision to enter the war . In the post-war period , the term Dominion has fallen into disuse . Full independence was granted with the Statute of Westminster in 1931 and adopted by the New Zealand Parliament in 1947 . However , the 1907 royal proclamation of Dominion status has never been revoked and remains in force today .",
