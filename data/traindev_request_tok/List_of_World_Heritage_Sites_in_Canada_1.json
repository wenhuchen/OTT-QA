  "/wiki/World_Heritage_Site": "A World Heritage Site is a landmark or area , selected by the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) for having cultural , historical , scientific or other form of significance , which is legally protected by international treaties . The sites are judged to be important for the collective and preservative interests of humanity . To be selected , a World Heritage Site must be an already-classified landmark , unique in some respect as a geographically and historically identifiable place having special cultural or physical significance ( such as an ancient ruin or historical structure , building , city , complex , desert , forest , island , lake , monument , mountain , or wilderness area ) . It may signify a remarkable accomplishment of humanity , and serve as evidence of our intellectual history on the planet . The sites are intended for practical conservation for posterity , which otherwise would be subject to risk from human or animal trespassing , unmonitored/uncontrolled/unrestricted access , or threat from local administrative negligence . Sites are demarcated by UNESCO as protected zones . The list is maintained by the international World Heritage Program administered by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee , composed of 21 states parties that are elected by their General Assembly . The programme catalogues , names , and conserves sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common culture and heritage of humanity . Under certain conditions , listed sites can obtain funds from the World Heritage Fund . The programme began with the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World 's Cultural and Natural Heritage , which was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO on 16 November 1972 . Since then , 193 state parties have ratified the convention , making it one of the most widely recognised international agreements and the world 's most popular cultural programme . In 1978 the city of Quito earned the distinction of being the first city in the world to be declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site .",
  "/wiki/Hectare": "The hectare ( /\u02c8h\u025bkt\u025b\u0259r , -t\u0251\u02d0r/ ; SI symbol : ha ) is a non-SI metric unit of area equal to a square with 100-metre sides ( 1 hm2 ) , or 10,000 m2 , and is primarily used in the measurement of land . There are 100 hectares in one square kilometre . An acre is about 0.405 hectare and one hectare contains about 2.47 acres . In 1795 , when the metric system was introduced , the are was defined as 100 square metres and the hectare ( hecto- + are ) was thus 100 ares or \u200b1\u2044100 km2 ( 10,000 square metres ) . When the metric system was further rationalised in 1960 , resulting in the International System of Units ( SI ) , the are was not included as a recognised unit . The hectare , however , remains as a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI and whose use is expected to continue indefinitely . Though the dekare/decare daa ( 1,000 m2 ) and are a ( 100 m2 ) are not officially accepted for use , they are still used in some contexts .",

Based upon the International yard and pound agreement of 1959 , an acre may be declared as exactly 4,046.8564224 square metres . An internationally recognised symbol for the acre is ac . The acre is a statute measure in the United States , in the United Kingdom and in almost all countries of the former British Empire : in most it is lawful to 'use for trade ' if given as supplementary information and is not used for land registration . In the United States both the international acre and the US survey acre are in use , but they differ by only two parts per million : see below . The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land . Traditionally , in the Middle Ages , an acre was defined as the area of land that could be ploughed in one day by a yoke of oxen .",

The first British settlement in the area was Fort Victoria , established in 1843 , which gave rise to the City of Victoria , at first the capital of the separate Colony of Vancouver Island . Subsequently , on the mainland , the Colony of British Columbia ( 1858-1866 ) was founded by Richard Clement Moody and the Royal Engineers , Columbia Detachment , in response to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush . Moody was Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for the Colony and the first Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia : he was hand-picked by the Colonial Office in London to transform British Columbia into the British Empire 's bulwark in the farthest west , and to found a second England on the shores of the Pacific . Moody selected the site for and founded the original capital of British Columbia , New Westminster , established the Cariboo Road and Stanley Park , and designed the first version of the Coat of arms of British Columbia .

Initially named Northern Yukon National Park , the park was renamed Ivvavik in 1992 for the Inuvialuktun word meaning nursery or birthplace , in reference to the importance of the area as a calving ground for caribou . Created as a result of the Inuvialuit Final Agreement in 1984 , negotiated between the Canadian Government and the Inuvialuit of the Northern Yukon , Ivvavik is the first national park in Canada to be established as a result of an aboriginal land claims agreement . Ivvavik contains the British Mountains which run east to west , parallel to the Arctic coast , and merge into the Brooks Range in Alaska . Draining north through the Park from the British Mountains is the Firth River , the oldest river in Canada and considered one of the great rafting rivers of the world . The river starts from year-round aufeis formations at the headwaters and then flows through extensive canyon areas before forming a huge delta as it enters the Beaufort Sea just west of Herschel Island . The first raft descent was by Martyn Williams , Alan Dennis and Jim Boyde . Gold miners have operated on the Firth River and at Sheep Creek until the area became a National Park . The area around Sheep Creek is the northern most extension of Dall sheep habitat in Canada The park contains many cultural sites of continuing importance to the local indigenous people , both Inuit and Indian . Protecting a portion of the calving grounds of the caribou herd , the park allows only a minimal number of people to visit per year .

  "/wiki/Klondike_Gold_Rush": "The Klondike Gold Rush [ n 1 ] was a migration by an estimated 100,000 prospectors to the Klondike region of the Yukon , in north-western Canada , between 1896 and 1899 . Gold was discovered there by local miners on August 16 , 1896 , and , when news reached Seattle and San Francisco the following year , it triggered a stampede of prospectors . Some became wealthy , but the majority went in vain . It has been immortalized in artifacts , films , games , literature , and photographs . To reach the gold fields , most prospectors took the route through the ports of Dyea and Skagway , in Southeast Alaska . Here , the Klondikers could follow either the Chilkoot or the White Pass trails to the Yukon River , and sail down to the Klondike . The Canadian authorities required each of them to bring a year 's supply of food , in order to prevent starvation . In all , the Klondikers ' equipment weighed close to a ton , which most carried themselves , in stages . Performing this task , and contending with the mountainous terrain and cold climate , meant those who persisted did not arrive until summer 1898 . Once there , they found few opportunities , and many left disappointed . Mining was challenging , as the ore was distributed unevenly , and permafrost made digging slow . Consequently , some miners chose to buy and sell claims , build up huge investments , and let others do the work .",

According to the BCGNIS , the northern boundary of Queen Charlotte Sound is defined as a line running from the southernmost point of Price Island to Cape St James on Kunghit Island , the southernmost point of Haida Gwaii . The western boundary is a line from Cape St James to Cape Scott at the north end of Vancouver Island . The southern boundary runs along the coast of Vancouver Island from Cape Scott to Cape Sutil , then to Cape Caution on the mainland . An older definition placed the northern boundary as a line from the southernmost point of Aristazabal Island to Cape St James . Queen Charlotte Sound was named by James Strange on August 5 , 1786 , in honour of Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz , the wife of King George III . Strange was the leader of a fur trading expedition of two vessels , Captain Cook , under Captain Henry Lawrie , and Experiment , under Captain John Guise . During a boat excursion up Goletas Channel Strange saw an opening ahead and named it Queen Charlotte Sound . The body of water he named was what is today known as Queen Charlotte Strait . For some time Queen Charlotte Strait was also called Queen Charlotte Sound , until 1920 when the BCGNIS and Hydrographic Service distinguished between Queen Charlotte Sound and Queen Charlotte Strait .",
