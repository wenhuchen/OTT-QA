  "/wiki/Bronze": "Bronze is an alloy consisting primarily of copper , commonly with about 12-12.5% tin and often with the addition of other metals ( such as aluminium , manganese , nickel or zinc ) and sometimes non-metals or metalloids such as arsenic , phosphorus or silicon . These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone , or have other useful properties , such as stiffness , ductility , or machinability . The archeological period in which bronze was the hardest metal in widespread use is known as the Bronze Age . The beginning of the Bronze Age in India and western Eurasia is conventionally dated to the mid-4th millennium BC , and to the early 2nd millennium BC in China ; elsewhere it gradually spread across regions . The Bronze Age was followed by the Iron Age starting from about 1300 BC and reaching most of Eurasia by about 500 BC , although bronze continued to be much more widely used than it is in modern times . Because historical pieces were often made of brasses ( copper and zinc ) and bronzes with different compositions , modern museum and scholarly descriptions of older objects increasingly use the generalized term copper alloy instead .",

  "/wiki/Granite": "Granite ( /\u02c8\u0261r\u00e6n\u026at/ ) is a common type of felsic intrusive igneous rock that is granular and phaneritic in texture . Granites can be predominantly white , pink , or gray in color , depending on their mineralogy . The word granite comes from the Latin granum , a grain , in reference to the coarse-grained structure of such a holocrystalline rock . Strictly speaking , granite is an igneous rock with between 20% and 60% quartz by volume , and at least 35% of the total feldspar consisting of alkali feldspar , although commonly the term granite is used to refer to a wider range of coarse-grained igneous rocks containing quartz and feldspar . The term granitic means granite-like and is applied to granite and a group of intrusive igneous rocks with similar textures and slight variations in composition and origin . These rocks mainly consist of feldspar , quartz , mica , and amphibole minerals , which form an interlocking , somewhat equigranular matrix of feldspar and quartz with scattered darker biotite mica and amphibole ( often hornblende ) peppering the lighter color minerals . Occasionally some individual crystals ( phenocrysts ) are larger than the groundmass , in which case the texture is known as porphyritic . A granitic rock with a porphyritic texture is known as a granite porphyry . Granitoid is a general , descriptive field term for lighter-colored , coarse-grained igneous rocks . Petrographic examination is required for identification of specific types of granitoids . The extrusive igneous rock equivalent of granite is rhyolite .",
