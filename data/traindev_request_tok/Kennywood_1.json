The seats are free to rock sideways and swing out under centrifugal force as the wheel rotates . Invariably , the seats on the Paratrooper ride have a round shaped umbrella or other shaped canopy above the seats . In contrast to modern thrill rides , the Paratrooper is a ride suitable for almost all ages , except for infants and very small children . Older Paratrooper rides have a rotating wheel which is permanently raised , which has the disadvantage that riders can only load two at a time as each seat is brought to hang vertically at the lowest point of the wheel . Some models have a lower platform that 's slightly raised on the ends that could permit the loading of up to three seats at a time . Most of these rides were made by either Bennett , Watkins or Hrubetz . The German manufacturer Heintz-Fahtze also made larger models under the name of Twister . Most of them require the rider to be at least 36 inches tall with an adult and over 48 to ride alone . More modern Paratrooper rides use a hydraulic lifting piston to raise the wheel to their riding angle while spinning the seats . In its lowered position , all the seats hang vertically near the ground and can be loaded simultaneously .
