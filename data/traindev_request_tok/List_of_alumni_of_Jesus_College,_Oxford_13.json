  "/wiki/Dandy": "A dandy , historically , is a man who places particular importance upon physical appearance , refined language , and leisurely hobbies , pursued with the appearance of nonchalance in a cult of self . A dandy could be a self-made man who strove to imitate an aristocratic lifestyle despite coming from a middle-class background , especially in late 18th- and early 19th-century Britain . Previous manifestations of the petit-ma\u00eetre ( French for small master ) and the Muscadin have been noted by John C. Prevost , but the modern practice of dandyism first appeared in the revolutionary 1790s , both in London and in Paris . The dandy cultivated cynical reserve , yet to such extremes that novelist George Meredith , himself no dandy , once defined cynicism as intellectual dandyism . Some took a more benign view ; Thomas Carlyle wrote in Sartor Resartus that a dandy was no more than a clothes-wearing man . Honor\u00e9 de Balzac introduced the perfectly worldly and unmoved Henri de Marsay in La fille aux yeux d'or ( 1835 ) , a part of La Com\u00e9die Humaine , who fulfils at first the model of a perfect dandy , until an obsessive love-pursuit unravels him in passionate and murderous jealousy . Charles Baudelaire defined the dandy , in the later metaphysical phase of dandyism , as one who elevates \u00e6sthetics to a living religion , that the dandy 's mere existence reproaches the responsible citizen of the middle class : Dandyism in certain respects comes close to spirituality and to stoicism and These beings have no other status , but that of cultivating the idea of beauty in their own persons , of satisfying their passions , of feeling and thinking . Dandyism is a form of Romanticism . Contrary to what many thoughtless people seem to believe , dandyism is not even an excessive delight in clothes and material elegance . For the perfect dandy , these things are no more than the symbol of the aristocratic superiority of mind . The linkage of clothing with political protest had become a particularly English characteristic during the 18th century . Given these connotations , dandyism can be seen as a political protest against the levelling effect of egalitarian principles , often including nostalgic adherence to feudal or pre-industrial values , such as the ideals of the perfect gentleman or the autonomous aristocrat .",

The Ordinances of The Clothworkers ' Company , first issued in 1532 and signed by Sir Thomas More , sought to regulate clothworking , to maintain standards and to protect approved practices . From the later Middle Ages , cloth production gradually moved away from London , a situation exacerbated by the Great Fire of London and the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries .
