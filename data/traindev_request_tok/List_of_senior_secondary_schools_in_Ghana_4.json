  "/wiki/Accra_Academy": "The Accra Academy was the first private academy to be established in the Gold Coast , present-day Ghana . The academy is one of the foremost secondary educational institutions in Ghana and operates as a non-denominational day and boarding boys ' school , located at Bubuashie , near Kaneshie in the Greater Accra Region . The academy runs courses in business , science , general arts , general agric and visual arts , leading to the award of a West African Senior School Certificate . The academy ' s founders provided tuition to students who wanted a secondary-grade education but who did not have financial support to enable them do so . Dr. Kofi Konuah periodically travelled to some of the major towns in each region of the country to organise entrance examinations for students , so as to offer the brilliant but needy among them the opportunity of education in the Accra Academy . The academy does not offer special admission to brilliant but needy students but , as per a 2005 directive from the Ghana Education Service , admits its students through a school selection placement system . The academy admits both local and foreign students . The academy was established as a private secondary educational institution in 1931 and gained the status of a Government-Assisted School in 1950 . In 1981 , the academy gained the status of a completely developed senior secondary school . In 1990 , the academy became a semi-autonomous secondary educational institution and operates as such with the aid of a board of governors , a Parent-Teacher Association and a students ' representative council . Accra Academy was ranked 8th out of the top 100 best high schools in Africa by Africa Almanac in 2003 , based upon quality of education , student engagement , strength and activities of alumni , school profile , internet and news visibility .",
  "/wiki/Public_school_(government_funded)": "State schools , called public schools in North America and many other countries , [ note 1 ] are generally primary or secondary schools mandated for or offered to all children without charge , funded in whole or in part by taxation . While such schools are to be found in virtually every country , there are significant variations in their structure and educational programs . State education generally encompasses primary and secondary education ( kindergarten to twelfth grade , or equivalent ) , as well as post-secondary educational institutions such as universities , colleges , and technical schools that are funded and overseen by government rather than by private entities . The position before there were government-funded schools varied : in many instances there was an established educational system which served a significant , albeit often elite , sector of the population ; these systems were often funded by religious institutions . The introduction of government-organised schools was in some cases able to build upon this established system , and often both systems have continued to exist , sometimes in a parallel and complementary relationship and other times less harmoniously .",
  "/wiki/Single-sex_education": "Single-sex education , also known as single-gender education and gender-isolated education , is the practice of conducting education with male and female students attending separate classes , perhaps in separate buildings or schools . The practice of single-sex schooling was common before the 20th century , particularly in secondary and higher education . Single-sex education in many cultures is advocated on the basis of tradition as well as religion , and is practiced in many parts of the world . Recently , there has been a surge of interest and establishment of single-sex schools due to educational research . Single-sex education is practiced in many Muslim majority countries ; while in other parts of the world it is most popular in Chile , Israel , South Korea , and English-speaking countries such as Singapore , Ireland , the United Kingdom , Hong Kong , New Zealand , and Australia . In the Western world , single sex education is primarily associated with the private sector , with the public ( state ) sector being overwhelmingly mixed sex ; while in the Muslim world the situation is the opposite : public schools are usually single sex , while many private schools are mixed sex . Motivations for single sex education range from religious ideas of sex segregation to beliefs that the sexes learn and behave differently , and , as such , they thrive in a single sex environment . In the 19th century , in Western countries , single sex girls ' finishing schools , and women 's colleges offered women a chance of education at a time when they were denied access to mainstream educational institutions . The former were especially common in Switzerland , the latter in the US and the UK , which were pioneers in women 's education .",

  "/wiki/Accra": "Accra ( /\u0259\u02c8kr\u0251\u02d0/ ; Akuapem & Asante Twi : Nkran ) is the capital of Ghana covering an area of 225.67 km2 ( 87.13 sq mi ) with an estimated urban population of 2.27 million as of 2012 [ update ] . It is organized into 12 local government districts - 11 municipal districts and the Accra Metropolitan District , which is the only district within the capital to be granted city status . Accra usually refers to the Accra Metropolitan Area , which serves as the capital of Ghana , while the district which is within the jurisdiction of the Accra Metropolitan Assembly is distinguished from the rest of the capital as the City of Accra . In common usage , however , the terms Accra and City of Accra are used interchangeably . The intersection of the Lafa stream and Mallam junction serves as the western border of Accra , the Great Hall of the University of Ghana forms Accra 's northern border , while the Nautical College forms the eastern border . The Gulf of Guinea forms the southern border . Formed from the merger of distinct settlements around British Fort James , Dutch Fort Cr\u00eavecoeur ( Ussher Fort ) , and Danish Fort Christiansborg as Jamestown , Usshertown , and Christiansborg respectively , Accra served as the capital of the British Gold Coast between 1877 and 1957 and has since transitioned into a modern metropolis . The capital 's architecture reflects this history , ranging from 19th-century colonial architecture to modern skyscrapers and apartment blocks . Accra is the Greater Accra Region 's economic and administrative hub , and serves as the anchor of the larger Greater Accra Metropolitan Area ( GAMA ) , which is inhabited by about 4 million people , making it the thirteenth-largest metropolitan area in Africa . Strategic initiatives , such as transportation , are coordinated between the local government authorities , while the Accra Metropolitan Assembly , based in West Ridge , is responsible for the administration of the 60 km2 ( 23 sq mi ) City of Accra only . The central business district of Accra contains the city 's main banks and department stores , as well as an area known as the Ministries , where Ghana 's government administration is concentrated . Economic activities in Accra include the financial and commercial sectors , fishing and the manufacture of processed food , lumber , plywood , textiles , clothing and chemicals .",

The school was founded in 1924 by Sir Frederick Gordon Guggisberg , Dr. James Emman Kwegyir Aggrey and the Rev . Alec Garden Fraser . It was formally opened in 1927 by Sir Frederick Guggisberg , then Governor of the British Gold Coast colony . Achimota , modelled on the British public school system , was the first mixed-gender school to be established on the Gold Coast . The school has educated many African leaders , including Kwame Nkrumah , Edward Akufo-Addo , Jerry John Rawlings , and John Evans Atta Mills all of whom are former Heads of State of Ghana . Former President of Ghana , John Dramani Mahama had his primary education there while former Prime Minister of Ghana , Kofi Abrefa Busia also taught at Achimota . Also included in its list of African heads of state are Zimbabwe 's second president Robert Mugabe and Sir Dawda Jawara , first head of state of The Gambia . An alumnus/alumna of Achimota is known as an Akora . The motto of the school is Ut Omnes Unum Sint meaning That they all may be one , a reference to the founders ' expressed philosophy that starting in the context of school life , black and white , male and female , everyone should integrate and combine synergistically for the good of all . The stylised piano-key design of the Achimota School crest was described by Aggrey at the time : You can play a tune of sorts on the black keys only ; and you can play a tune of sorts on the white keys only ; but for perfect harmony , you must use both the black and the white keys . Achimota remains the only mixed school ever to win the National Science and Maths Quiz , doing so twice .",
  "/wiki/Boarding_school": "A boarding school provides education for pupils who live on the premises , as opposed to a day school . The word boarding is used in the sense of room and board , i.e . lodging and meals . As they have existed for many centuries , and now extend across many countries , their function and ethos varies greatly . Traditionally , pupils stayed at the school for the length of the term ; some schools facilitate returning home every weekend , and some welcome day pupils . Some are for either boys or girls while others are co-educational . In the United Kingdom , which has a more extensive history of such schools , many independent ( private ) schools offer boarding , but likewise so do a few dozen state schools , many of which serve children from remote areas . In the United States , most boarding schools cover grades seven or nine through grade twelve - the high school years . Some American boarding schools offer a post-graduate year of study to help students prepare for college entrance . In some times and places boarding schools are the most elite educational option ( such as Eton and Harrow , which have produced several prime ministers ) , whereas in other contexts , they serve as places to segregate children deemed a problem to their parents or wider society . Canada and the United States tried to assimilate indigenous children in the Canadian Indian residential school system and American Indian boarding schools respectively . Some function essentially as orphanages , e.g .",

  "/wiki/Private_school": "An independent school is independent in its finances and governance . Also known as private schools , non-governmental , privately funded , or non-state schools , they are not administered by local , state or national governments . They are usually not dependent upon national or local government to finance their financial endowment . They are typically governed by a board of governors which is elected independently of government , and has a system of governance that ensures its independent operation . Children who attend private schools may be there because they are dissatisfied with public schools in their area . They may be selected for their academic prowess , or prowess in other fields , or sometimes their religious background . Private schools retain the right to select their students and are funded in whole or in part by charging their students for tuition , rather than relying on taxation through public ( government ) funding ; at some private schools students may be able to get a scholarship , lowering this tuition fee , dependent on a student 's talents or abilities ( e.g . sport scholarship , art scholarship , academic scholarship ) , need for financial aid , or tax credit scholarships that might be available . Some private schools are associated with a particular religion , such as Judaism , Roman Catholicism , or Lutheranism . For the past century , roughly one in 10 U.S. families has chosen to enroll their children in private school . Independent schools may have a religious affiliation , but the precise usage of the term excludes parochial ( and other ) schools if there is a financial dependence upon , or governance subordinate to , outside organizations . These definitions generally apply equally to both primary and secondary education .",

Single-sex education , however , remains prevalent in many Muslim countries . The relative merits of both systems have been the subject of debate . The world 's oldest co-educational school is thought to be Archbishop Tenison 's Church of England High School , Croydon , established in 1714 in the United Kingdom , which admitted boys and girls from its opening onwards . This has always been a day school only . The world 's oldest co-educational day and boarding school is Dollar Academy , a junior and senior school for males and females from ages 5 to 18 in Scotland , United Kingdom .
