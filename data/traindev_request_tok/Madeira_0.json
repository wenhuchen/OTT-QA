  "/wiki/Freguesia": "Freguesia ( Portuguese pronunciation : [ \u02ccf\u027e\u025b\u0263\u0268\u02c8zi.\u0250 ] ) , usually translated as parish or civil parish , is the third-level administrative subdivision of Portugal , as defined by the 1976 Constitution . It is also a local administrative unit in the former Portuguese overseas territories of Cape Verde and Macau ( until 2001 ) . In the past , was also an administrative division of the other Portuguese overseas territories . The parroquia in the Spanish autonomous communities of Galicia and Asturias is similar to a freguesia . A freguesia is a subdivision of a munic\u00edpio ( municipality ) . Most often , a parish takes the name of its seat , which is usually the most important ( or the single ) human agglomeration within its area , which can be a neighbourhood or city district , a group of hamlets , a village , a town or an entire city . In cases where the seat is itself divided into more than one parish , each one takes the name of a landmark within its area or of the patron saint from the usually coterminous Catholic parish ( par\u00f3quia in Portuguese ) . Be it a city district or village , the civil parish is often based on an ecclesiastical parish . Since the creation of a democratic local administration , in 1976 , the Portuguese parishes have been ruled by a system composed by an executive body ( the junta de freguesia , parish board ) and a deliberative body ( the assembleia de freguesia , parish assembly ) . The members of the assembleia de freguesia are publicly elected every four years . The presidents of the parish boards are also members of the municipal assembly .",
