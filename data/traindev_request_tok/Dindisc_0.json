  "/wiki/Orchestral_Manoeuvres_in_the_Dark": "Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark ( OMD ) are an English electronic band formed in Wirral , Merseyside in 1978 . Spawned by earlier band the Id , the outfit is composed of co-founders Andy McCluskey ( vocals , bass guitar ) and Paul Humphreys ( keyboards , vocals ) , along with Martin Cooper ( various instruments ) and Stuart Kershaw ( drums ) ; McCluskey is the only constant member . OMD released their debut single , Electricity , in 1979 , and gained popularity throughout Europe with the 1980 anti-war song Enola Gay . The band achieved broader recognition via their album Architecture & Morality ( 1981 ) and its three singles , all of which were international hits . Although retrospectively acclaimed , the experimental Dazzle Ships ( 1983 ) eroded European support . The band embraced a more straightforward pop sound on Junk Culture ( 1984 ) , while continuing to experiment via newly acquired digital samplers ; this change in direction led to greater success in the United States , and yielded the 1986 hit , If You Leave . A year after the release of The Best of OMD ( 1988 ) , creative differences rendered McCluskey the only remaining member of the group as Humphreys formed spin-off band The Listening Pool . OMD would return with a new line-up and explore the dance-pop genre : Sugar Tax ( 1991 ) and its initial singles were sizeable hits . By the mid 1990s , however , electronic music had been supplanted by alternative rock , and both OMD and The Listening Pool disbanded in 1996 . McCluskey later conceived pop girl group Atomic Kitten , for whom he served as a principal songwriter , while Humphreys performed as half of the duo Onetwo . In 2006 , OMD reformed with Humphreys back in the fold , and began to work on material more akin to their early output . The band re-established themselves as a chart act , and kept on touring extensively .",

  "/wiki/The_Rezillos": "The Rezillos are a punk/new wave band formed in Edinburgh , Scotland , in 1976 . Although emerging at the same time as other bands in the punk rock movement , the Rezillos did not share the nihilism or social commentary of their contemporaries , but instead took a more light-hearted approach to their songs , preferring to describe themselves at the time as a new wave beat group . Their songs are heavily influenced by 1950s rock and roll , 1960s English beat music and garage rock , early 1970s glam rock , and recurring lyrical themes of science fiction and B movies ; their influences mirrored those of US bands the Cramps , the B-52s , and X , who were starting out at the same time . The Rezillos ' biggest hit in their home country was the UK Top 20 single Top of the Pops in 1978 , but they are best known outside the UK for their cover version of Somebody 's Gon na Get Their Head Kicked In Tonight , which was featured on the soundtrack to in 2002 . Since the Rezillos recorded it , the song has been covered by other punk bands , including Youth Brigade and Murphy 's Law . Released in July 1978 , the Rezillos ' first studio album Ca n't Stand the Rezillos is now considered a classic album of the first wave of British punk , but the group split up four months after its release , following internal arguments about their future direction . After the Rezillos split , the band 's guitarist and principal songwriter , Jo Callis , briefly joined a couple of unsuccessful Edinburgh post-punk groups before being invited to join The Human League . He went on to co-write some of The Human League 's best known songs during their most successful period , including their biggest worldwide hit , Do n't You Want Me . The Rezillos ' vocalists , Eugene Reynolds and Fay Fife , formed the Revillos , a group with an ever-changing line-up that continued where the Rezillos left off . The Revillos split up in 1985 , briefly reforming in 1994 for a tour of Japan , and again in 1996 for a UK tour . In 2001 the Rezillos reformed after being invited to play at Edinburgh 's Hogmanay celebrations , and have continued to play live ever since , as well as releasing new singles occasionally .",
