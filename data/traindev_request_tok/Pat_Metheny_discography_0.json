In the late 1950s , Haden was an original member of the ground-breaking Ornette Coleman Quartet . Haden revolutionized the harmonic concept of bass playing in jazz . German musicologist Joachim-Ernst Berendt wrote that Haden 's ability to create serendipitous harmonies by improvising melodic responses to Coleman 's free-form solos ( rather than sticking to predetermined harmonies ) was both radical and mesmerizing . His virtuosity lies\u2026in an incredible ability to make the double bass 'sound out ' . Haden cultivated the instrument 's gravity as no one else in jazz . He is a master of simplicity which is one of the most difficult things to achieve . ) Haden played a vital role in this revolutionary new approach , evolving a way of playing that sometimes complemented the soloist and sometimes moved independently . In this respect , as did his predecessor bassists Jimmy Blanton and Charles Mingus , Haden helped liberate the bassist from a strictly accompanying role to becoming a more direct participant in group improvisation . In 1969 , he formed his first band , the Liberation Music Orchestra , featuring arrangements by pianist Carla Bley . In the late 1960s , he became a member of pianist Keith Jarrett 's trio , quartet and quintet . In the 1980s , he formed his band , Quartet West .",

Reich 's work is marked by its use of repetitive figures , slow harmonic rhythm , and canons . His innovations include using tape loops to create phasing patterns , as on the early compositions It 's Gon na Rain ( 1965 ) and Come Out ( 1966 ) , and the use of simple , audible processes , as on Pendulum Music ( 1968 ) and Four Organs ( 1970 ) . The 1978 recording Music for 18 Musicians would help entrench minimalism as a movement . Reich 's work took on a darker character in the 1980s with the introduction of historical themes as well as themes from his Jewish heritage , notably Different Trains ( 1988 ) . Reich 's style of composition has influenced many contemporary composers and groups , especially in the US .
