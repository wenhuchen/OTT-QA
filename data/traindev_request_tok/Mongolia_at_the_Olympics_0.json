The Games saw 10,625 athletes compete , some 600 more than expected , accompanied by 5,501 team officials from 201 countries . There were 301 medal events in 28 different sports . Athens 2004 marked the first time since the 1996 Summer Olympics that all countries with a National Olympic Committee were in attendance . 2004 also marked the return of the Olympic Games to the city where they began . Having previously hosted the Olympics in 1896 , Athens became one of only four cities to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games on two separate occasions at the time ( together with Paris , London , and Los Angeles ) . A new medal obverse was introduced at these Games , replacing the design by Giuseppe Cassioli that had been used since the 1928 Games . This rectified the long lasting mistake of using a depiction of the Roman Colosseum rather than a Greek venue . The new design features the Panathenaic Stadium . The 2004 Summer Games were hailed as unforgettable , dream games by IOC President Jacques Rogge , and left Athens with a significantly improved infrastructure , including a new airport , ring road , and subway system . There have been arguments ( mostly in popular media ) regarding the cost of the 2004 Athens Summer Games and their possible contribution to the 2010-2018 Greek government-debt crisis , however , there is little or no evidence for such a correlation . The 2004 Olympics were generally deemed to be a success , with the rising standard of competition amongst nations across the world .",
  "/wiki/Judo_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics": "Judo at the 2004 Summer Olympics took place in the Ano Liossia Olympic Hall and featured 368 judoka competing for 14 gold medals with seven different weight categories in both the men 's and women 's competitions . Japan dominated the event by taking 8 gold and 2 silver medals . Gold and silver medals in each weight class were determined by a single-elimination bracket . There was a repechage for those who are eliminated by one of the eventual semifinalists . Since there are four semifinalists , this means that four of the losers of the round of 32 ( i.e. , 25% ) faced four of the losers from the round of 16 ( 50% ) . The winners of these matches faced the four judokas who have lost in the quarterfinals . The winners , then , of these four matches faced each other to narrow the repechage field down to two judokas . Until this stage , the repechage has been segregated into two distinct halves , with each successive competitor facing another one from the same half of the original bracket ; but each of the two judokas who emerge from the repechage challenged the loser of the other bracket 's semifinal . ( Since these two always come from opposite halves of the original bracket , they could not have faced each other already . ) The winners of these two matches were each awarded a bronze medal , making judo unusual among Olympic events in not determining a single third-place finisher . There was controversy in the men 's competition , when Iranian competitor and two-times world champion Arash Miresmaeili weighed in overweight and was disqualified before a match in which he would have faced Israeli judoka Ehud Vaks . Miresmaeili 's comments strongly suggested that he had intentionally disqualified himself so as not to compete against an Israeli .",
