  "/wiki/Hour": "An hour ( symbol : h ; also abbreviated hr . ) is a unit of time conventionally reckoned as \u200b1\u204424 of a day and scientifically reckoned as 3,599-3,601 seconds , depending on conditions . The hour was initially established in the ancient Near East as a variable measure of \u200b1\u204412 of the night or daytime . Such seasonal , temporal , or unequal hours varied by season and latitude . Medieval astronomers such as al-Biruni and Sacrobosco , subsequently divided the hour into 60 minutes , each of 60 seconds . ( This derives from Babylonian astronomy , where the corresponding terms denoted the time required for the Sun 's apparent motion through the ecliptic to describe one minute or second of arc , respectively . In present terms , the Babylonian degree of time was thus four minutes long , the minute of time was thus four seconds long and the second 1/15 of a second . ) Equal or equinoctial hours were taken as \u200b1\u204424 of the day as measured from noon to noon ; the minor seasonal variations of this unit were eventually smoothed by making it \u200b1\u204424 of the mean solar day . Since this unit was not constant due to long term variations in the Earth 's rotation , the hour was finally separated from the Earth 's rotation and defined in terms of the atomic or physical second . In the modern metric system , hours are an accepted unit of time defined as 3,600 atomic seconds . However , on rare occasions an hour may incorporate a positive or negative leap second , [ a ] making it last 3,599 or 3,601 seconds , in order to keep it within 0.9 seconds of UT1 , which is based on measurements of the mean solar day .",
  "/wiki/Minute": "The minute is a unit of time usually equal to \u200b1\u204460 ( the first sexagesimal fraction ) of an hour , or 60 seconds . In the UTC time standard , a minute on rare occasions has 61 seconds , a consequence of leap seconds ( there is a provision to insert a negative leap second , which would result in a 59-second minute , but this has never happened in more than 40 years under this system ) . Although not an SI unit , the minute is accepted for use with SI units . The SI symbol for minute or minutes is min ( without a dot ) . The prime symbol is also sometimes used informally to denote minutes of time . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/Second": "The second ( symbol : s , abbreviation : sec ) is the base unit of time in the International System of Units ( SI ) , commonly understood and historically defined as \u200b1\u204486400 of a day - this factor derived from the division of the day first into 24 hours , then to 60 minutes and finally to 60 seconds each . Analog clocks and watches often have sixty tick marks on their faces , representing seconds ( and minutes ) , and a second hand to mark the passage of time in seconds . Digital clocks and watches often have a two-digit seconds counter . The second is also part of several other units of measurement like meters per second for velocity , meters per second per second for acceleration , and cycles per second for frequency . Although the historical definition of the unit was based on this division of the Earth 's rotation cycle , the formal definition in the International System of Units ( SI ) is a much steadier timekeeper : it is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency \u2206\u03bdCs , the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom , to be 9192631770 when expressed in the unit Hz , which is equal to s\u22121 . Because the Earth 's rotation varies and is also slowing ever so slightly , a leap second is periodically added to clock time [ nb 1 ] to keep clocks in sync with Earth 's rotation . Multiples of seconds are usually counted in hours and minutes . Fractions of a second are usually counted in tenths or hundredths . In scientific work , small fractions of a second are counted in milliseconds ( thousandths ) , microseconds ( millionths ) , nanoseconds ( billionths ) , and sometimes smaller units of a second . An everyday experience with small fractions of a second is a 1-gigahertz microprocessor which has a cycle time of 1 nanosecond . Camera shutter speeds are often expressed in fractions of a second , such as \u200b1\u204430 second or \u200b1\u20441000 second . Sexagesimal divisions of the day from a calendar based on astronomical observation have existed since the third millennium BC , though they were not seconds as we know them today [ citation needed ] .",

Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",

It is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau , the Alps , and the Jura , spanning a total area of 41,285 km2 ( 15,940 sq mi ) , and land area of 39,997 km2 ( 15,443 sq mi ) . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory , the Swiss population of approximately 8.5 million is concentrated mostly on the plateau , where the largest cities are located , among them the two global cities and economic centres of Z\u00fcrich and Geneva . The establishment of the Old Swiss Confederacy dates to the late medieval period , resulting from a series of military successes against Austria and Burgundy . Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire was formally recognized in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 . The Federal Charter of 1291 is considered the founding document of Switzerland which is celebrated on Swiss National Day . Since the Reformation of the 16th century , Switzerland has maintained a strong policy of armed neutrality ; it has not fought an international war since 1815 and did not join the United Nations until 2002 . Nevertheless , it pursues an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace-building processes around the world . Switzerland is the birthplace of the Red Cross , one of the world 's oldest and best known humanitarian organisations , and is home to numerous international organisations , including the second largest UN office .
