  "/wiki/Real_estate_development": "Real estate development , or property development , is a business process , encompassing activities that range from the renovation and re-lease of existing buildings to the purchase of raw land and the sale of developed land or parcels to others . Real estate developers are the people and companies who coordinate all of these activities , converting ideas from paper to real property . Real estate development is different from construction , although many developers also manage the construction process . Developers buy land , finance real estate deals , build or have builders build projects , create , imagine , control , and orchestrate the process of development from the beginning to end . Developers usually take the greatest risk in the creation or renovation of real estate - and receive the greatest rewards . Typically , developers purchase a tract of land , determine the marketing of the property , develop the building program and design , obtain the necessary public approval and financing , build the structures , and rent out , manage , and ultimately sell it . Sometimes property developers will only undertake part of the process . For example , some developers source a property and get the plans and permits approved before selling the property with the plans and permits to a builder at a premium price . Alternatively , a developer that is also a builder may purchase a property with the plans and permits in place so that they do not have the risk of failing to obtain planning approval and can start construction on the development immediately . Developers work with many different counterparts along each step of this process , including architects , city planners , engineers , surveyors , inspectors , contractors , lawyers , leasing agents , etc . In the Town and Country Planning context in the United Kingdom , 'development ' is defined in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 s55 .",

  "/wiki/Fast_food": "Fast food is a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial resale and with a strong priority placed on speed of service versus other relevant factors involved in culinary science . Fast food was originally created as a commercial strategy to accommodate the larger numbers of busy commuters , travelers and wage workers who often did not have the time to sit down at a public house or diner and wait for their meal . By making speed of service the priority , this ensured that customers with strictly limited time ( a commuter stopping to procure dinner to bring home to their family , for example , or an hourly laborer on a short lunch break ) were not inconvenienced by waiting for their food to be cooked on-the-spot ( as is expected from a traditional sit down restaurant ) . For those with no time to spare , fast food became a multibillion-dollar industry . In 2018 , the fast food industry was worth an estimated $ 570 billion globally . The fastest form of fast food consists of pre-cooked meals kept in readiness for a customer 's arrival ( Boston Market rotisserie chicken , Little Caesars pizza , etc . ) , with waiting time reduced to mere seconds . Other fast food outlets , primarily the hamburger outlets ( McDonald 's , Burger King , etc . ) use mass-produced pre-prepared ingredients ( bagged buns & condiments , frozen beef patties , prewashed/sliced vegetables , etc . ) but take great pains to point out to the customer that the meat and potatoes ( hamburgers and french fries ) are always cooked fresh ( or at least relatively recently ) and assembled to order ( like at a diner ) . Although a vast variety of food can be cooked fast , fast food is a commercial term limited to food sold in a restaurant or store with frozen , preheated or precooked ingredients , and served to the customer in a packaged form for take-out/take-away . Fast food restaurants are traditionally distinguished by their ability to serve food via a drive-through .",

  "/wiki/CNN": "CNN ( Cable News Network ) is an American news-based pay television channel owned by AT & T 's WarnerMedia . CNN was founded in 1980 by American media proprietor Ted Turner as a 24-hour cable news channel . Upon its launch in 1980 , CNN was the first television channel to provide 24-hour news coverage and was the first all-news television channel in the United States . While the news channel has numerous affiliates , CNN primarily broadcasts from 30 Hudson Yards in New York City , and studios in Washington , D.C. and Los Angeles . Its headquarters at the CNN Center in Atlanta is only used for weekend programming . CNN is sometimes referred to as CNN/U.S . ( or CNN Domestic ) to distinguish the U.S. channel from its international sister network , CNN International . The network is known for its dramatic live coverage of breaking news , some of which has drawn criticism as overly sensationalistic , and for its efforts to be nonpartisan , which have led to accusations of false balance . As of September 2018 , CNN has 90.1 million television households as subscribers ( 97.7% of households with cable ) in the United States . In 2019 , CNN ranked third in viewership among cable news networks , behind rivals Fox News and MSNBC , averaging 972,000 viewers . CNN ranks 14th among all basic cable networks . Globally , CNN programming airs through CNN International , which can be seen by viewers in over 212 countries and territories .",
