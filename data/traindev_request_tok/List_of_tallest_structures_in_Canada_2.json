The climate around the major cities is four-seasons continental with cold and snowy winters combined with warm to hot humid summers , but farther north long winter seasons dominate and as a result the northern areas of the province are marked by tundra conditions .",
  "/wiki/Church_(building)": "A church building or church house , often simply called a church , is a building used for Christian religious activities , particularly for Christian worship services . The term is often used by Christians to refer to the physical buildings where they worship , but it is sometimes used ( by analogy ) to refer to buildings of other religions . In traditional Christian architecture , a church interior is often structured in the shape of a Christian cross . When viewed from plan view the vertical beam of the cross is represented by the center aisle and seating while the horizontal beam and junction of the cross is formed by the bema and altar . Towers or domes are often added with the intention of directing the eye of the viewer towards the heavens and inspiring a range of thoughts and emotions in visitors and worshippers . Modern church buildings have a variety of architectural styles and layouts ; many buildings that were designed for other purposes have now been converted for church use , and , conversely , many original church buildings have been put to other uses . The earliest identified Christian church building was a house church founded between 233 and 256 . From the 11th through the 14th centuries , a wave of building of cathedrals and smaller parish churches were erected across Western Europe . A cathedral is a church building , usually Roman Catholic , Protestant ( including Anglican ) , Eastern Orthodox , or Oriental Orthodox , housing a cathedra , the formal name for the seat or throne of a presiding bishop .",
  "/wiki/Bell_tower": "A bell tower is a tower that contains one or more bells , or that is designed to hold bells even if it has none . Such a tower commonly serves as part of a church , and will contain church bells , but there are also many secular bell towers , often part of a municipal building , an educational establishment , or a tower built specifically to house a carillon . Church bell towers often incorporate clocks , and secular towers usually do , as a public service .

A bell tower may also in some traditions be called a belfry , though this term may also refer specifically to the substructure that houses the bells and the ringers rather than the complete tower . The tallest free-standing bell tower in the world , 113.2 metres ( 371 ft ) high , is the Mortegliano Bell Tower , in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region , Italy .",

The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe , an urban agglomeration of 9,245,438 people ( as of 2016 ) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario . Toronto is an international centre of business , finance , arts , and culture , and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world . People have travelled through and inhabited the Toronto area , located on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers , deep ravines , and urban forest , for more than 10,000 years . After the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase , when the Mississauga surrendered the area to the British Crown , the British established the town of York in 1793 and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada . During the War of 1812 , the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy damage by American troops . York was renamed and incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto . It was designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation . The city proper has since expanded past its original borders through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of 630.2 km2 ( 243.3 sq mi ) . The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada .

  "/wiki/Town_hall": "In local government , a city hall , town hall , civic centre ( in the UK or Australia ) , guildhall , Rathaus ( German ) , or ( more rarely ) a municipal building , is the chief administrative building of a city , town , or other municipality . It usually houses the city or town council , its associated departments , and their employees . It also usually functions as the base of the mayor of a city , town , borough , county or shire . By convention , until the middle of the 19th century , a single large open chamber ( or hall ) formed an integral part of the building housing the council . The hall may be used for council meetings and other significant events . This large chamber , the town hall ( and its later variant city hall ) has become synonymous with the whole building , and with the administrative body housed in it . The terms council chambers , municipal building or variants may be used locally in preference to town hall if no such large hall is present within the building . The local government may endeavor to use the building to promote and enhance the quality of life of the community . In many cases , town halls serve not only as buildings for government functions , but also have facilities for various civic and cultural activities . These may include art shows , stage performances , exhibits and festivals . Modern town halls or civic centres are often designed with a great variety and flexibility of purpose in mind . As symbols of local government , city and town halls have distinctive architecture , and the buildings may have great historical significance - for example the Guildhall , London .",

  "/wiki/Chimney": "A chimney is an architectural ventilation structure made of masonry , clay or metal that isolates hot toxic exhaust gases or smoke produced by a boiler , stove , furnace , incinerator or fireplace from human living areas . Chimneys are typically vertical , or as near as possible to vertical , to ensure that the gases flow smoothly , drawing air into the combustion in what is known as the stack , or chimney effect . The space inside a chimney is called the flue . Chimneys are adjacent to large industrial refineries , fossil fuel combustion facilities or part of buildings , steam locomotives and ships . In the United States , the term 'Smokestack industry ' refers to the environmental impacts of burning fossil fuels by industrial society including the electric industry during its earliest history . The term smokestack ( colloquially , stack ) is also used when referring to locomotive chimneys or ship chimneys , and the term funnel can also be used . The height of a chimney influences its ability to transfer flue gases to the external environment via stack effect . Additionally , the dispersion of pollutants at higher altitudes can reduce their impact on the immediate surroundings . The dispersion of pollutants over a greater area can reduce their concentrations and facilitate compliance with regulatory limits .",
  "/wiki/Royal_Bank_Tower_(Montreal)": "The Royal Bank Tower is a skyscraper at 360 Saint-Jacques Street in Montreal , Quebec . The 22-storey 121 m ( 397 ft ) neo-classical tower was designed by the firm of York and Sawyer with the bank 's Chief Architect Sumner Godfrey Davenport of Montreal . Upon completion in 1928 , it was the tallest building in the entire British Empire , the tallest structure in all of Canada and the first building in the city that was taller than Montr\u00e9al 's Notre-Dame Basilica built nearly a century before . The bank 's first official head office was at Hollis and George in Halifax in 1879 . In 1907 the Royal Bank of Canada moved its head office from Halifax to Montreal As the building at Saint-Jacques Street turned out to be too small , in 1926 the board of directors of the biggest bank in Canada hired New York architects York and Sawyer to build a prestigious new building a short distance westward on Saint-Jacques Street . Between 1920 and 1926 the bank had bought up all the property between Saint-Jacques , Saint-Pierre , Notre-Dame and Dollard Streets to demolish all the buildings there including the old Mechanics ' Institute and the ten-storey Bank of Ottawa building in order to make space for the new 22-storey building .

  "/wiki/Building": "A building , or edifice , is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place , such as a house or factory . Buildings come in a variety of sizes , shapes , and functions , and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors , from building materials available , to weather conditions , land prices , ground conditions , specific uses , and aesthetic reasons . To better understand the term building compare the list of nonbuilding structures . Buildings serve several societal needs - primarily as shelter from weather , security , living space , privacy , to store belongings , and to comfortably live and work . A building as a shelter represents a physical division of the human habitat ( a place of comfort and safety ) and the outside ( a place that at times may be harsh and harmful ) . Ever since the first cave paintings , buildings have also become objects or canvasses of much artistic expression . In recent years , interest in sustainable planning and building practices has also become an intentional part of the design process of many new buildings .",

It is the largest city in Northern Ontario by population , with a population of 161,531 at the 2016 Canadian Census . By land area , it is the largest in Ontario and the fifth largest in Canada . It is administratively a Unitary authority , and thus not part of any district , county , or regional municipality . The Sudbury region was inhabited by the Ojibwe people of the Algonquin group for thousands of years prior to the founding of Sudbury following the discovery of nickel ore in 1883 during the construction of the transcontinental railway . Greater Sudbury was formed in 2001 by merging the cities and towns of the former Regional Municipality of Sudbury with several previously unincorporated townships . Being located inland , the local climate is extremely seasonal with average January lows of around \u221218 \u00b0C ( 0 \u00b0F ) and average July highs of 25 \u00b0C ( 77 \u00b0F ) . The population resides in an urban core and many smaller communities scattered around 330 lakes and among hills of rock blackened by historical smelting activity . Sudbury was once a major lumber centre and a world leader in nickel mining . Mining and related industries dominated the economy for much of the 20th century . The two major mining companies which shaped the history of Sudbury were Inco , now Vale Limited , which employed more than 25% of the population by the 1970s , and Falconbridge , now Glencore . Sudbury has since expanded from its resource-based economy to emerge as the major retail , economic , health and educational centre for Northeastern Ontario .",

  "/wiki/Guyed_mast": "A guyed mast is a tall thin vertical structure that depends on guy lines for stability . The mast itself has the compressive strength to support its own weight , but does not have the shear strength to stand unsupported , and requires guy lines to resist lateral forces such as wind loads and keep it upright . Guy lines are diagonal tensioned cables attached to the ground , usually spaced at equal angles about the structure 's base . Guyed masts are frequently used for radio antennas . The mast can either support aerials ( for VHF and UHF ) mounted at its top , or the entire structure itself can function as an antenna ( for VLF , LF , MF ) ; this is called a mast radiator . In the latter case , the mast needs to be insulated from the ground . Guyed radio masts are typically tall enough that they require several sets of guy lines , 2 to 4 , attached at different heights on the mast , to prevent them from buckling . An exception was the Blaw-Knox tower , widely used during the 1930s , whose distinctive wide diamond ( rhomboidal ) shape gave it the shear strength that it only required one set of guys . Sailing masts , the masts that support the sails on sailboats , are also typically guyed masts . Guyed masts are sometimes also used for meteorological measurements at certain heights above ground level . Sometimes they are used as pylons , although their usage in agricultural areas is problematic because anchor foundations handicap ploughing . A partially guyed tower is a structure consisting of a guyed mast on top of a freestanding tower .",

  "/wiki/Cape_Race": "Cape Race is a point of land located at the southeastern tip of the Avalon Peninsula on the island of Newfoundland , in Newfoundland and Labrador , Canada . Its name is thought to come from the original Portuguese name for this cape , Raso , meaning flat or low-lying . The Cape appeared on early sixteenth century maps as Cabo Raso and its name may derive from a cape of the same name at the mouth of the Tagus River in Portugal . The cape was the location of the Cape Race LORAN-C transmitter until the system was decommissioned in 2010 . It is also home to the Cape Race Lighthouse , notable for having received the distress call from RMS Titanic .",

The province is Canada 's most linguistically homogeneous , with 97.0% of residents reporting English ( Newfoundland English ) as their mother tongue in the 2016 census . Historically , Newfoundland was also home to unique varieties of French and Irish , as well as the extinct Beothuk language . In Labrador , the indigenous languages Innu-aimun and Inuktitut are also spoken . Newfoundland and Labrador 's capital and largest city , St. John 's , is Canada 's 20th-largest census metropolitan area and is home to almost 40 per cent of the province 's population . St. John 's is the seat of government , home to the House of Assembly of Newfoundland and Labrador and to the highest court in the jurisdiction , the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal . A former colony and then dominion of the United Kingdom , Newfoundland gave up its independence in 1933 , following significant economic distress caused by the Great Depression and the aftermath of Newfoundland 's participation in World War I . It became the tenth province to enter the Canadian Confederation on 31 March 1949 , as Newfoundland . On 6 December 2001 , an amendment was made to the Constitution of Canada to change the province 's name to Newfoundland and Labrador .",
  "/wiki/Manitoba": "Manitoba ( /\u02ccm\u00e6n\u026a\u02c8to\u028ab\u0259/ ( listen ) ) is a province at the longitudinal centre of Canada . It is often considered one of the three prairie provinces ( with Alberta and Saskatchewan ) and is Canada 's fifth-most populous province with its estimated 1.369 million people . Manitoba covers 649,950 square kilometres ( 250,900 sq mi ) with a widely varied landscape , stretching from the northern oceanic coastline to the southern border with the United States . The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south . Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived on two major river systems , what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system . A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson 's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert 's Land . During the next 200 years , communities continued to grow and evolve , with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg . The assertion of M\u00e9tis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba . There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the M\u00e9tis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion . The resolution of the assertion of the right to representation led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 that created the province . Manitoba 's capital and largest city , Winnipeg , is the eighth-largest census metropolitan area in Canada .",

It is now the ninth tallest free-standing structure in the world and remains the tallest free-standing structure on land in the Western Hemisphere . In 1995 , the CN Tower was declared one of the modern Seven Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil Engineers . It also belongs to the World Federation of Great Towers . It is a signature icon of Toronto 's skyline and attracts more than two million international visitors annually .",
  "/wiki/Tower": "A tower is a tall structure , taller than it is wide , often by a significant factor . Towers are distinguished from masts by their lack of guy-wires and are therefore , along with tall buildings , self-supporting structures . Towers are specifically distinguished from buildings in that they are not built to be habitable but to serve other functions . The principal function is the use of their height to enable various functions to be achieved including : visibility of other features attached to the tower such as clock towers ; as part of a larger structure or device to increase the visibility of the surroundings for defensive purposes as in a fortified building such as a castle ; as a structure for observation for leisure purposes ; or as a structure for telecommunication purposes . Towers can be stand alone structures or be supported by adjacent buildings or can be a feature on top of a large structure or building ."
