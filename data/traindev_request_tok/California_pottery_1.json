  "/wiki/Art_pottery": "Pottery is the process of forming vessels and other objects with clay and other ceramic materials , which are fired at high temperatures to give them a hard , durable form . Major types include earthenware , stoneware and porcelain . The place where such wares are made by a potter is also called a pottery ( plural potteries ) . The definition of pottery used by the American Society for Testing and Materials ( ASTM ) , is all fired ceramic wares that contain clay when formed , except technical , structural , and refractory products . In archaeology , especially of ancient and prehistoric periods , pottery often means vessels only , and figures etc . of the same material are called terracottas . Clay as a part of the materials used is required by some definitions of pottery , but this is dubious .",

  "/wiki/Tile": "A tile is a thin object usually square or rectangular in shape . Tile is a manufactured piece of hard-wearing material such as ceramic , stone , metal , baked clay , or even glass , generally used for covering roofs , floors , walls , or other objects such as tabletops . Alternatively , tile can sometimes refer to similar units made from lightweight materials such as perlite , wood , and mineral wool , typically used for wall and ceiling applications . In another sense , a tile is a construction tile or similar object , such as rectangular counters used in playing games ( see tile-based game ) . The word is derived from the French word tuile , which is , in turn , from the Latin word tegula , meaning a roof tile composed of fired clay . Tiles are often used to form wall and floor coverings , and can range from simple square tiles to complex or mosaics . Tiles are most often made of ceramic , typically glazed for internal uses and unglazed for roofing , but other materials are also commonly used , such as glass , cork , concrete and other composite materials , and stone . Tiling stone is typically marble , onyx , granite or slate . Thinner tiles can be used on walls than on floors , which require more durable surfaces that will resist impacts .",

  "/wiki/Cookware": "Cookware and bakeware are types of food preparation containers , commonly found in a kitchen . Cookware comprises cooking vessels , such as saucepans and frying pans , intended for use on a stove or range cooktop . Bakeware comprises cooking vessels intended for use inside an oven . Some utensils are considered both cookware and bakeware . The choice of material for cookware and bakeware items has a significant effect on the item 's performance ( and cost ) , particularly in terms of thermal conductivity and how much food sticks to the item when in use . Some choices of material also require special pre-preparation of the surface - known as seasoning - before they are used for food preparation . Both the cooking pot and lid handles can be made of the same material but will mean that , when picking up or touching either of these parts , oven gloves will need to be worn . In order to avoid this , handles can be made of non-heat-conducting materials , for example bakelite , plastic or wood . It is best to avoid hollow handles because they are difficult to clean or to dry . A good cooking pot design has an overcook edge which is what the lid lies on . The lid has a dripping edge that prevents condensation fluid from dripping off when handling the lid ( taking it off and holding it 45\u00b0 ) or putting it down .",

  "/wiki/Insulator_(electrical)": "An electrical insulator is a material whose internal electric charges do not flow freely ; very little electric current will flow through it under the influence of an electric field . This contrasts with other materials , semiconductors and conductors , which conduct electric current more easily . The property that distinguishes an insulator is its resistivity ; insulators have higher resistivity than semiconductors or conductors . The most common examples are non-metals . A perfect insulator does not exist because even insulators contain small numbers of mobile charges ( charge carriers ) which can carry current . In addition , all insulators become electrically conductive when a sufficiently large voltage is applied that the electric field tears electrons away from the atoms . This is known as the breakdown voltage of an insulator . Some materials such as glass , paper and Teflon , which have high resistivity , are very good electrical insulators . A much larger class of materials , even though they may have lower bulk resistivity , are still good enough to prevent significant current from flowing at normally used voltages , and thus are employed as insulation for electrical wiring and cables . Examples include rubber-like polymers and most plastics which can be thermoset or thermoplastic in nature . Insulators are used in electrical equipment to support and separate electrical conductors without allowing current through themselves . An insulating material used in bulk to wrap electrical cables or other equipment is called insulation .",
