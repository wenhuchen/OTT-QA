  "/wiki/Society_for_Worldwide_Interbank_Financial_Telecommunication": "The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication ( SWIFT ) , legally S.W.I.F.T . SCRL , provides a network that enables financial institutions worldwide to send and receive information about financial transactions in a secure , standardized and reliable environment . SWIFT also sells software and services to financial institutions , much of it for use on the SWIFTNet network , and ISO 9362. Business Identifier Codes ( BICs , previously Bank Identifier Codes ) are popularly known as SWIFT codes . As of 2018 , around half all high-value cross-border payments worldwide used the SWIFT network . As of 2015 [ update ] , SWIFT linked more than 11,000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries and territories , who were exchanging an average of over 32 million messages per day ( compared to an average of 2.4 million daily messages in 1995 ) . SWIFT transports financial messages in a highly secure way but does not hold accounts for its members and does not perform any form of clearing or settlement . SWIFT does not facilitate funds transfer : rather , it sends payment orders , which must be settled by correspondent accounts that the institutions have with each other . Each financial institution , to exchange banking transactions , must have a banking relationship by either being a bank or affiliating itself with one ( or more ) so as to enjoy those particular business features . SWIFT has been criticized for its inefficiency , with the Financial Times observing in 2018 that transfers frequently pass through multiple banks before reaching their final destination , making them time-consuming , costly and lacking transparency on how much money will arrive at the other end . At the time its market dominance was described as being challenged by blockchain technology , such as Ripple , although SWIFT argued that the scalability issues of blockchain solutions remained unsolved , confining them to bilateral and intra-bank applications . SWIFT has introduced its own improved service , called Global Payments Innovation ( GPI ) , stating that as of 2018 it had been adopted by 165 banks , and was completing half of its payments in under 30 minutes . SWIFT is a cooperative society under Belgian law owned by its member financial institutions with offices around the world .",
