Named European Footballer of the Year in 1968 , he is regarded as one of the greatest players of all time . A highly skilful winger , considered by several pundits to be one of the greatest dribblers in the history of the sport , Best received plaudits for his playing style , which combined pace , skill , balance , feints , two-footedness , goalscoring and the ability to get past defenders . In international football , Best was capped 37 times for Northern Ireland between 1964 and 1977 . A combination of the team 's performance and his lack of fitness in 1982 meant that he never played in the finals of a major tournament . He considered his international career as being recreational football , with the expectations placed on a smaller nation in Northern Ireland being much less than with his club . He is regarded as one of the greatest players never to have played at a World Cup . The Irish Football Association described him as the greatest player to ever pull on the green shirt of Northern Ireland . With his good looks and playboy lifestyle , Best became one of the first media celebrity footballers , earning the nickname El Beatle in 1966 , but his extravagant life style led to various personal problems , most notably alcoholism , which he suffered from for the rest of his life . These issues affected him on and off the field , often causing controversy . Although conscious of his problems , he was publicly not contrite about them ; he said of his career : I spent a lot of money on booze , birds [ women ] and fast cars - the rest I just squandered .
