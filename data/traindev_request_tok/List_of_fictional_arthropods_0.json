  "/wiki/Spider": "Spiders ( order Araneae ) are air-breathing arthropods that have eight legs and chelicerae with fangs able to inject venom . They are the largest order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all orders of organisms . Spiders are found worldwide on every continent except for Antarctica , and have become established in nearly every habitat with the exceptions of air and sea colonization . As of July 2019 [ update ] , at least 48,200 spider species , and 120 families have been recorded by taxonomists . However , there has been dissension within the scientific community as to how all these families should be classified , as evidenced by the over 20 different classifications that have been proposed since 1900 . Anatomically , spiders differ from other arthropods in that the usual body segments are fused into two tagmata , the cephalothorax and abdomen , and joined by a small , cylindrical pedicel . Unlike insects , spiders do not have antennae . In all except the most primitive group , the Mesothelae , spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods , as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax . Unlike most arthropods , spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure . Their abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of glands . Spider webs vary widely in size , shape and the amount of sticky thread used . It now appears that the spiral orb web may be one of the earliest forms , and spiders that produce tangled cobwebs are more abundant and diverse than orb-web spiders .",
  "/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets": "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling and the second novel in the Harry Potter series . The plot follows Harry 's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , during which a series of messages on the walls of the school 's corridors warn that the Chamber of Secrets has been opened and that the heir of Slytherin would kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical families . These threats are found after attacks that leave residents of the school petrified . Throughout the year , Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione investigate the attacks . The book was published in the United Kingdom on 2 July 1998 by Bloomsbury and later in the United States on 2 June 1999 by Scholastic Inc . Although Rowling says she found it difficult to finish the book , it won high praise and awards from critics , young readers , and the book industry , although some critics thought the story was perhaps too frightening for younger children . Much like with other novels in the series , Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets triggered religious debates ; some religious authorities have condemned its use of magical themes , whereas others have praised its emphasis on self-sacrifice and the way one 's character is the result of one 's choices . Several commentators have noted that personal identity is a strong theme in the book and that it addresses issues of racism through the treatment of non-human , non-magical , and non-living people . Some commentators regard the diary as a warning against uncritical acceptance of information from sources whose motives and reliability can not be checked . Institutional authority is portrayed as self-serving and incompetent . The film adaptation of the novel , released in 2002 , became ( at that time ) the fifth highest-grossing film ever and received generally favourable reviews . Video games loosely based on Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets were also released for several platforms , and most obtained favourable reviews .",

Rowling , is a British author , film producer , television producer , screenwriter , and philanthropist . She is best known for writing the Harry Potter fantasy series , which has won multiple awards and sold more than 500 million copies , becoming the best-selling book series in history . The books are the basis of a popular film series , over which Rowling had overall approval on the scripts and was a producer on the final films . She also writes crime fiction under the name Robert Galbraith . Born in Yate , Gloucestershire , Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series while on a delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990 . The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother , birth of her first child , divorce from her first husband , and relative poverty until the first novel in the series , Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone , was published in 1997 . There were six sequels , of which the last , Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , was released in 2007 . Since then , Rowling has written five books for adult readers : The Casual Vacancy ( 2012 ) and - under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith - the crime fiction Cormoran Strike series , which consists of The Cuckoo 's Calling ( 2013 ) , The Silkworm ( 2014 ) , Career of Evil ( 2015 ) , and Lethal White ( 2018 ) .

The novel tells the story of a livestock pig named Wilbur and his friendship with a barn spider named Charlotte . When Wilbur is in danger of being slaughtered by the farmer , Charlotte writes messages praising Wilbur ( such as Some Pig ) in her web in order to persuade the farmer to let him live . Written in White 's dry , low-key manner , Charlotte 's Web is considered a classic of children 's literature , enjoyable to adults as well as children . The description of the experience of swinging on a rope swing at the farm is an often cited example of rhythm in writing , as the pace of the sentences reflects the motion of the swing . In 2000 , Publishers Weekly listed the book as the best-selling children 's paperback of all time . Charlotte 's Web was adapted into an animated feature by Hanna-Barbera Productions and Sagittarius Productions in 1973 .

  "/wiki/Louse": "Louse ( plural : lice ) is the common name for members of the order Phthiraptera , which contains nearly 5,000 species of wingless insect . Lice are obligate parasites , living externally on warm-blooded hosts which include every species of bird and mammal , except for monotremes , pangolins , and bats . Lice are vectors of diseases such as typhus . Chewing lice live among the hairs or feathers of their host and feed on skin and debris , while sucking lice pierce the host 's skin and feed on blood and other secretions . They usually spend their whole life on a single host , cementing their eggs , called nits , to hairs or feathers . The eggs hatch into nymphs , which moult three times before becoming fully grown , a process that takes about four weeks . Humans host two species of louse - the head louse and the body louse are subspecies of Pediculus humanus ; the pubic louse , Pthirus pubis . The body louse has the smallest genome of any known insect ; it has been used as a model organism and has been the subject of much research . Lice were ubiquitous in human society until at least the Middle Ages . They appear in folktales , songs such as The Kilkenny Louse House , and novels such as James Joyce 's Finnegans Wake . They commonly feature in the psychiatric disorder delusional parasitosis . A louse was one of the early subjects of microscopy , appearing in Robert Hooke 's 1667 book , Micrographia .",
  "/wiki/Flea": "Flea , the common name for the order Siphonaptera , includes 2,500 species of small flightless insects that survive as external parasites of mammals and birds . Fleas live by consuming blood , or hematophagy , from their hosts . Adult fleas grow to about 3 mm ( 0.12 in ) long , are usually brown , and have bodies that are flattened sideways or narrow , enabling them to move through their host 's fur or feathers . They lack wings , but have strong claws preventing them from being dislodged , mouthparts adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood , and hind legs extremely well adapted for jumping . They are able to leap a distance of some 50 times their body length , a feat second only to jumps made by another group of insects , the superfamily of froghoppers . Flea larvae are worm-like with no limbs ; they have chewing mouthparts and feed on organic debris left on their host 's skin . The Siphonaptera are most closely related to the snow scorpionflies , or snow fleas in the UK , formally the Boreidae , placing them within the Endopterygote insect order Mecoptera . Fleas arose in the early Cretaceous , most likely as ectoparasites of mammals , before moving on to other groups , including birds . Each species of flea is more or less a specialist with respect to its host animal species : many species never breed on any other host , though some are less selective . Some families of fleas are exclusive to a single host group ; for example , the Malacopsyllidae are found only on armadillos , the Ischnopsyllidae only on bats , and the Chimaeropsyllidae only on elephant shrews . The oriental rat flea , Xenopsylla cheopis , is a vector of Yersinia pestis , the bacterium which causes bubonic plague . The disease was spread to humans by rodents such as the black rat , which were bitten by infected fleas .",
  "/wiki/Fairy_tale": "A fairy tale , fairytale , wonder tale , magic tale , or M\u00e4rchen is an instance of a folklore genre that takes the form of a short story . Such stories typically feature entities such as dwarfs , dragons , elves , fairies , giants , gnomes , goblins , griffins , mermaids , talking animals , trolls , unicorns , or witches , and usually magic or enchantments . In most cultures , there is no clear line separating myth from folk or fairy tale ; all these together form the literature of preliterate societies . Fairy tales may be distinguished [ by whom ? ] from other folk narratives such as legends ( which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described ) and explicit moral tales , including beast fables . The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and , at least in recent centuries , mostly relates to children 's literature . In less technical contexts , the term is also used to describe something blessed with unusual happiness , as in fairy-tale ending ( a happy ending ) or fairy-tale romance . Colloquially , the term fairy tale or fairy story can also mean any far-fetched story or tall tale ; it is used especially of any story that not only is not true , but could not possibly be true . Legends are perceived [ by whom ? ] as real ; fairy tales may merge into legends , where the narrative is perceived both by teller and hearers as being grounded in historical truth . However , unlike legends and epics , fairy tales usually do not contain more than superficial references to religion and to actual places , people , and events ; they take place once upon a time rather than in actual times . Fairy tales occur both in oral and in literary form ; the name fairy tale ( conte de f\u00e9es in French ) was first ascribed to them by Madame d'Aulnoy in the late 17th century .",

They were among the first and best-known collectors of German and European folk tales , and popularized traditional oral tale types such as Cinderella ( Aschenputtel ) , The Frog Prince ( Der Froschk\u00f6nig ) , The Goose-Girl ( Die G\u00e4nsemagd ) , Hansel and Gretel ( H\u00e4nsel und Gretel ) , Rapunzel , Rumpelstiltskin ( Rumpelstilzchen ) , Sleeping Beauty ( Dornr\u00f6schen ) , and Snow White ( Schneewittchen ) . Their classic collection , Children 's and Household Tales ( Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen ) , was published in two volumes - the first in 1812 and the second in 1815 . The brothers were born in the town of Hanau in Hesse-Cassel ( now Germany ) and spent most of their childhood in the nearby town of Steinau . Their father 's death in 1796 impoverished the family and affected the brothers for many years after . They attended the University of Marburg where they began a lifelong dedication to researching the early history of German language and literature , including German folktales . The rise of Romanticism during the 18th century had revived interest in traditional folk stories , which to the Grimms and their colleagues represented a pure form of national literature and culture . The Brothers Grimm established a methodology for collecting and recording folk stories that became the basis for folklore studies . Between the first edition of 1812-1815 and the seventh ( and final ) edition of 1857 , they revised their collection many times , so that it grew from 156 stories to more than 200 . In addition to collecting and editing folk tales , the brothers compiled German legends . Individually , they published a large body of linguistic and literary scholarship . Together , in 1838 , they began work on a massive historical German dictionary ( Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch ) which , in their lifetimes , they completed only as far as the word Frucht ( 'fruit ' ) .",
  "/wiki/Bee": "Bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants , known for their role in pollination and , in the case of the best-known bee species , the western honey bee , for producing honey and beeswax . Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea and are presently considered a clade , called Anthophila . There are over 16,000 known species of bees in seven recognized biological families . They are found on every continent except Antarctica , in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants . Some species - including honey bees , bumblebees , and stingless bees - live socially in colonies . Bees are adapted for feeding on nectar and pollen , the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for protein and other nutrients . Most pollen is used as food for larvae . Bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially . The decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees . Bees range in size from tiny stingless bee species whose workers are less than 2 millimetres ( 0.08 in ) long , to Megachile pluto , the largest species of leafcutter bee , whose females can attain a length of 39 millimetres ( 1.54 in ) . The most common bees in the Northern Hemisphere are the Halictidae , or sweat bees , but they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies .

Insects of this order use only a single pair of wings to fly , the hindwings having evolved into advanced mechanosensory organs known as halteres , which act as high-speed sensors of rotational movement and allow dipterans to perform advanced aerobatics . Diptera is a large order containing an estimated 1,000,000 species including horse-flies , [ a ] crane flies , hoverflies and others , although only about 125,000 species have been described . Flies have a mobile head , with a pair of large compound eyes , and mouthparts designed for piercing and sucking ( mosquitoes , black flies and robber flies ) , or for lapping and sucking in the other groups . Their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight , and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces . Flies undergo complete metamorphosis ; the eggs are laid on the larval food-source and the larvae , which lack true limbs , develop in a protected environment , often inside their food source . The pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so ; flies mostly have short lives as adults . Diptera is one of the major insect orders and of considerable ecological and human importance . Flies are important pollinators , second only to the bees and their Hymenopteran relatives . Flies may have been among the evolutionarily earliest pollinators responsible for early plant pollination . Fruit flies are used as model organisms in research , but less benignly , mosquitoes are vectors for malaria , dengue , West Nile fever , yellow fever , encephalitis , and other infectious diseases ; and houseflies , commensal with humans all over the world , spread food-borne illnesses . Flies can be annoyances especially in some parts of the world where they can occur in large numbers , buzzing and settling on the skin or eyes to bite or seek fluids .",

  "/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings": "The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien . The story began as a sequel to Tolkien 's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit , but eventually developed into a much larger work . Written in stages between 1937 and 1949 , The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written , with over 150 million copies sold . The title of the novel refers to the story 's main antagonist , the Dark Lord Sauron , [ a ] who had in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of Middle-earth . From quiet beginnings in the Shire , a hobbit land not unlike the English countryside , the story ranges across Middle-earth , following the course of the War of the Ring through the eyes of its characters , most notably the hobbits Frodo , Sam , Merry and Pippin . Although generally known to readers as a trilogy , the work was initially intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set , the other to be The Silmarillion , but this idea was dismissed by his publisher . For economic reasons , The Lord of the Rings was published in three volumes over the course of a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955 . The three volumes were titled The Fellowship of the Ring , The Two Towers and The Return of the King . Structurally , the novel is divided internally into six books , two per volume , with several appendices of background material included at the end . Some editions combine the entire work into a single volume . The Lord of the Rings has since been reprinted numerous times and translated into 38 languages . Tolkien 's work has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes and origins .",
  "/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien": "John Ronald Reuel Tolkien CBE FRSL ( /ru\u02d0l \u02c8t\u0252lki\u02d0n/ ; [ a ] 3 January 1892 - 2 September 1973 ) was an English writer , poet , philologist , and academic , who authored the classic high fantasy works The Hobbit , The Lord of the Rings , and The Silmarillion . He served as the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and Fellow of Pembroke College , Oxford , from 1925 to 1945 and Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College , Oxford , from 1945 to 1959 . He was at one time a close friend of C. S. Lewis - they were both members of the informal literary discussion group known as the Inklings . Tolkien was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972 . After Tolkien 's death , his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father 's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts , including The Silmarillion . These , together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings , form a connected body of tales , poems , fictional histories , invented languages , and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda and Middle-earth [ b ] within it . Between 1951 and 1955 , Tolkien applied the term legendarium to the larger part of these writings . While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien , the great success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre . This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the father of modern fantasy literature - or , more precisely , of high fantasy . In 2008 , The Times ranked him sixth on a list of The 50 greatest British writers since 1945 . Forbes ranked him the fifth top-earning dead celebrity in 2009 .",
  "/wiki/Middle-earth": "Middle-earth is the fictional setting of much of British writer J. R. R. Tolkien 's legendarium . The term is equivalent to the term Midgard of Norse mythology , describing the human-inhabited world , that is , the central continent of the Earth in Tolkien 's imagined mythological past . [ T 1 ] Tolkien 's most widely read works , The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings , take place entirely in Middle-earth , and Middle-earth has also become a short-hand to refer to the legendarium and Tolkien 's fictional take on the world . Within his stories , Tolkien translated the name Middle-earth as Endor and Ennor in the Elvish languages Quenya and Sindarin respectively . Middle-earth is the north continent of Earth ( Arda ) in an imaginary period of the Earth 's past [ T 2 ] [ T 3 ] [ T 4 ] ( Tolkien placed the end of the Third Age at about 6,000 years before his own time ) , [ T 5 ] [ T 6 ] [ T 7 ] in the sense of a secondary or sub-creational reality . [ T 8 ] Tolkien 's Middle-earth stories mostly focus on the north-west of the continent . This part of Middle-earth is reminiscent of Europe , with the environs of the Shire intended to be reminiscent of England ( more specifically , the West Midlands , with Hobbiton set at the same latitude as Oxford ) .

  "/wiki/Legendarium": "Tolkien 's legendarium is the body of J. R. R. Tolkien 's mythopoeic writing that forms the background to his The Lord of the Rings , a high fantasy novel which is widely considered to be his magnum opus . Tolkien began to develop his legendarium in poems , paintings and nomenclature by 1914 , and composed the earliest drafts of its stories by 1916 ( published in 1983 's The Book of Lost Tales ) . He continued to work and re-work its components throughout his adult life , a period of more than 50 years . The canonical or mature form of Tolkien 's narrative is often referred to as Middle-earth after his term for the inhabited part of the world in which most of his published stories were set . The mythological and cosmological background of Tolkien 's published works was sketched in the posthumously published The Silmarillion ( 1977 ) , and in Tolkien studies , a field that has been developed since the 1980s .",

  "/wiki/The_Silmarillion": "The Silmarillion ( Quenya : [ silma\u02c8rilli\u0254n ] ) is a collection of mythopoeic works by English writer J. R. R. Tolkien , edited and published posthumously by his son , Christopher Tolkien , in 1977 , with assistance from Guy Gavriel Kay . The Silmarillion , along with J. R. R. Tolkien 's other works , forms an extensive , though incomplete , narrative that describes the universe of E\u00e4 in which are found the lands of Valinor , Beleriand , N\u00famenor , and Middle-earth , within which The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings take place . After the success of The Hobbit , Tolkien 's publisher requested a sequel . Tolkien sent them an early draft of The Silmarillion but they rejected the work as being obscure and too Celtic . The result was that Tolkien began work on A Long Expected Party , the first chapter of what he described at the time as a new story about Hobbits , which became The Lord of the Rings . The Silmarillion comprises five parts . The first part , Ainulindal\u00eb , tells of the creation of E\u00e4 , the world that is . Valaquenta , the second part , gives a description of the Valar and Maiar , the supernatural powers in E\u00e4 . The next section , Quenta Silmarillion , which forms the bulk of the collection , chronicles the history of the events before and during the First Age , including the wars over the Silmarils that gave the book its title . The fourth part , Akallab\u00eath , relates the history of the Downfall of N\u00famenor and its people , which takes place in the Second Age . The final part , Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age , is a brief account of the circumstances which led to and were presented in The Lord of the Rings . The five parts were initially separate works , but it was the elder Tolkien 's express wish that they be published together .",
  "/wiki/Tom_Bombadil": "Tom Bombadil is a character in J. R. R. Tolkien 's legendarium .

Bombadil is best known from his appearance as a supporting character in Tolkien 's high fantasy epic The Lord of the Rings , published in 1954 and 1955 . In the first volume , The Fellowship of the Ring , Frodo Baggins and company meet Bombadil in the Old Forest . This idea and an appearance by both Old Man Willow and the Barrow-wight were included in some of Tolkien 's earliest notes for a sequel to The Hobbit . Bombadil is mentioned but not seen near the end of The Return of the King , with Gandalf planning to pay him a long visit . A slightly expanded version of the original poem appeared in a collection of poems called The Adventures of Tom Bombadil and other verses from The Red Book .

It has the head of a human , body of a lion and a tail of venomous spines similar to porcupine quills , while other depictions have it with the tail of a scorpion . There are some accounts that the spines can be shot like arrows , thus making the manticore a lethal predator .

  "/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire": "A Song of Ice and Fire is a series of epic fantasy novels by the American novelist and screenwriter George R. R. Martin . He began the first volume of the series , A Game of Thrones , in 1991 , and it was published in 1996 . Martin , who initially envisioned the series as a trilogy , has published five out of a planned seven volumes . The fifth and most recent volume of the series , A Dance with Dragons , was published in 2011 and took Martin six years to write . He is currently writing the sixth novel , The Winds of Winter . A Song of Ice and Fire takes place on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos . The point of view of each chapter in the story is a limited perspective of a range of characters growing from nine in the first novel , to 31 characters by the fifth novel . Three main stories interweave : a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros , the rising threat of the supernatural Others in northernmost Westeros , and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen , the deposed king 's exiled daughter , to assume the Iron Throne . Martin 's inspirations included the Wars of the Roses and the French historical novels The Accursed Kings by Maurice Druon . A Song of Ice and Fire received praise for its diverse portrayal of women and religion , as well as its realism . An assortment of disparate and subjective points of view confronts the reader , and the success or survival of point-of-view characters is never assured . Within the often morally ambiguous world of A Song of Ice and Fire , questions concerning loyalty , pride , human sexuality , piety , and the morality of violence frequently arise .",
