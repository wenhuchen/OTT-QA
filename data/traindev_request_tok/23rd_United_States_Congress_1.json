  "/wiki/Virginia's_5th_congressional_district": "Virginias fifth congressional district is a United States congressional district in the commonwealth of Virginia . It is Virginia 's largest district with an area of 10,181.03 square miles ( 26,368.7 km2 ) and is larger in area than six US states ( Vermont , New Jersey , Rhode Island , Connecticut , Delaware , and New Hampshire ) . The 5th District contains counties located in the Piedmont and Blue Ridge Region stretching vertically across the state from the Virginia-North Carolina Border going 250 miles up to Fauquier County in Northern Virginia , West of Washington DC . The districts first representative in Congress was James Madison , who defeated James Monroe in the district 's first congressional election . Madison and Monroe would go on to serve as the 4th and 5th Presidents of the United States . The current Congressman is Republican Denver Riggleman . Historically , the 5th was one of the first districts of Virginia to turn Republican in Presidential elections - though unlike the 6th where the decisive factor was ticket-splitting by Byrd Organization Democrats , here the decisive factor was the growth of middle-class Republicanism in the Charlottesville metropolitan area . In the decade preceding the Voting Rights Act , these were joined by a significant proportion of Virginias limited and almost entirely white electorate who preferred GOP positions on black civil rights . The district was to be one of two in Virginia giving a plurality to segregationist George Wallace in 1968 , and has never supported a Democrat for President since Harry S. Truman . However , the district was continually represented in Congress by fairly conservative Democrats until Virgil H. Goode , Jr. switched parties , first to independent and then to Republican . In 2008 , Democrat Tom Perriello defeated Goode by running on a progressive platform . Perriello lost to Republican Robert Hurt in 2010 .",

He was also Minister to Russia under Andrew Jackson in 1830 . After serving as President Thomas Jefferson 's spokesman in the House , he broke with the president in 1805 as a result of what he saw as the dilution of traditional Jeffersonian principles as well as perceived mistreatment during the impeachment of Samuel Chase , in which Randolph served as chief prosecutor . Following this split , Randolph proclaimed himself the leader of the Old Republicans or Tertium Quids , a wing of the Democratic-Republican Party who wanted to restrict the role of the federal government . Specifically , Randolph promoted the Principles of '98 , which said that individual states could judge the constitutionality of central government laws and decrees , and could refuse to enforce laws deemed unconstitutional . A quick-thinking orator with a remarkable wit , he was committed to republicanism and advocated a commercial agrarian society throughout his three decades in Congress . Randolph 's conservative stance , displayed in his arguments against debt and for the rights of the landed gentry , have been attributed to his ties to his family estate and the elitist values of his native Southside Virginia [ citation needed ] . His belief in the importance of a landed gentry led him to oppose the abolition of entail and primogeniture : The old families of Virginia will form connections with low people , and sink into the mass of overseers ' sons and daughters . Randolph vehemently opposed the War of 1812 and the Missouri Compromise of 1820 ; he was active in debates about tariffs , manufacturing , and currency . With mixed feelings about slavery , he was one of the founders of the American Colonization Society in 1816 , to send free blacks to a colony in Africa . At the same time , he believed that slavery was a necessity in Virginia , saying , The question of slavery , as it is called , is to us a question of life and death . You will find no instance in history where two distinct races have occupied the soil except in the relation of master and slave .",

Calhoun sometime in May-December 1828 . The Nullifier Party was a states ' rights , pro-slavery party that supported the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions , holding that states could nullify federal laws within their borders and that slavery should remain legal . It narrowly missed claiming the unofficial title of being the first ever third party to be created within the United States - that title belongs to the Anti-Masonic Party , which was created in New York in February 1828 . The Nullifier Party had several members in both houses of the Congress between 1831 and 1839 . Calhoun outlined the principles of the party in his South Carolina Exposition and Protest ( 1828 ) , a reaction to the Tariff of Abominations passed by Congress and signed into law by President John Quincy Adams . The party supported Calhoun 's ally John Floyd of Virginia for President in the 1832 election and the state legislature gave Floyd South Carolina 's 11 electoral votes , even though Floyd was not a candidate and had himself unsuccessfully tried to convince Calhoun to run for President . As for the party 's candidate for Vice President , the Massachusetts based political economist Henry Lee was selected .

Democrats still hold most offices outside Republican-dominated York County . However , few of the area 's Democrats can be described as liberal by national standards ; most are fairly conservative on social issues , but less so on economics . The largest blocs of Republican voters are in the fast-growing suburbs of Charlotte , North Carolina and Cherokee County , which shares the Republican tilt of most of the rest of the Upstate . York County is by far the largest county in the district , with almost one-third of its population , and its Republican bent has pushed the district as a whole into the Republican column in recent years . In November 2010 , the Republican Mick Mulvaney defeated longtime Congressman John Spratt and became the first Republican since Robert Smalls and the end of Reconstruction to represent the district . Following Mulvaney 's confirmation as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget , a special election was held in 2017 to determine his successor .

In 1821 he published a pamphlet in which strict states ' rights were strongly denounced ; yet in 1832 he became one of the greater nullifiers . The change seems to have been gradual , and to have been determined in part by the influence of John C. Calhoun . When , after 1824 , the old Democratic-Republican party split into factions , he followed Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren in opposing the Panama Congress and the policy of making Federal appropriations for internal improvements . He did not hesitate , however , to differ from Jackson on the two chief issues of his administration : the Bank and nullification .

  "/wiki/Anti-Masonic_Party": "The Anti-Masonic Party , also known as the Anti-Masonic Movement , was the first third party in the United States . It strongly opposed Freemasonry as a single-issue party and later aspired to become a major party by expanding its platform to take positions on other issues . After emerging as a political force in the late 1820s , most of the Anti-Masonic Party 's members joined the Whig Party in the 1830s and the party disappeared after 1838 . The party was founded in the aftermath of the disappearance of William Morgan , a former Mason who had ultimately become a prominent critic of the Masonic organization . Many believed that the Masons had murdered Morgan for speaking out against Masonry and subsequently many churches and other groups condemned Masonry . As many Masons were prominent businessmen and politicians , the backlash against the Masons was also a form of anti-elitism . Mass opposition to Masonry eventually coalesced into a political party . Before and during the presidency of John Quincy Adams , there was a period of political realignment . The Anti-Masons emerged as an important third-party alternative to Andrew Jackson 's Democrats and Adams 's National Republicans . In New York , the Anti-Masons supplanted the National Republicans as the primary opposition to the Democrats . After experiencing unexpected success in the 1828 elections , the Anti-Masons began to adopt positions on other issues , most notably support for internal improvements and a protective tariff . Several Anti-Masons , including William A. Palmer and Joseph Ritner , won election to prominent positions .",
