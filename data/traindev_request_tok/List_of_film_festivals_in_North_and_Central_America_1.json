It is New York City 's most populous borough , with an estimated 2,504,700 residents in 2010 . Named after the Dutch village of Breukelen , it shares a land border with the borough of Queens at the western end of Long Island . Brooklyn has several bridge and tunnel connections to the borough of Manhattan across the East River , and the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge connects it with Staten Island .

If each borough were ranked as a city , Brooklyn would rank as the third-most populous in the U.S. , after Los Angeles and Chicago . Brooklyn was an independent incorporated city ( and previously an authorized village and town within the provisions of the New York State Constitution ) until January 1 , 1898 , when , after a long political campaign and public relations battle during the 1890s , according to the new Municipal Charter of Greater New York , Brooklyn was consolidated with the other cities , boroughs , and counties to form the modern City of New York , surrounding the Upper New York Bay with five constituent boroughs . The borough continues , however , to maintain a distinct culture . Many Brooklyn neighborhoods are ethnic enclaves . Brooklyn 's official motto , displayed on the Borough seal and flag , is Eendraght Maeckt Maght , which translates from early modern Dutch as Unity makes strength . In the first decades of the 21st century , Brooklyn has experienced a renaissance as an avant-garde destination for hipsters , with concomitant gentrification , dramatic house price increases and a decrease in housing affordability . Since the 2010s , Brooklyn has evolved into a thriving hub of entrepreneurship , high technology startup firms , postmodern art and design .",

  "/wiki/Rock_music": "Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as rock and roll in the United States in the early 1950s , and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later , particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom . It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll , a style which drew heavily from the genres of blues , rhythm and blues , and from country music . Rock music also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk , and incorporated influences from jazz , classical and other musical styles . Musically , rock has centered on the electric guitar , usually as part of a rock group with electric bass , drums , and one or more singers . Usually , rock is song-based music with a 4/4 time signature using a verse-chorus form , but the genre has become extremely diverse . Like pop music , lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political . By the late 1960s classic rock period , a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged , including hybrids like blues rock , folk rock , country rock , southern rock , raga rock , and jazz-rock , many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock , which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene . New genres that emerged included progressive rock , which extended the artistic elements ; glam rock , which highlighted showmanship and visual style ; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal , which emphasized volume , power , and speed . In the second half of the 1970s , punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down , energetic social and political critiques . Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave , post-punk and eventually alternative rock . From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge , Britpop , and indie rock . Further fusion subgenres have since emerged , including pop punk , electronic rock , rap rock , and rap metal , as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock 's history , including the garage rock/post-punk and techno-pop revivals at the beginning of the 2000s .",

  "/wiki/Christianity": "Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth . Its adherents , known as Christians , believe that Jesus is the Christ , whose coming as the messiah was prophesied in the Hebrew Bible , called the Old Testament in Christianity , and chronicled in the New Testament . It is the world 's largest religion with about 2.4 billion followers . Christianity began as a Second Temple Judaic sect in the 1st century in the Roman province of Judea . Jesus ' apostles and their followers spread around Syria , the Levant , Europe , Anatolia , Mesopotamia , Transcaucasia , Egypt , and Ethiopia , despite initial persecution . It soon attracted gentile God-fearers , which led to a departure from Jewish customs , and , after the Fall of Jerusalem , AD 70 which ended the Temple-based Judaism , Christianity slowly separated from Judaism . Emperor Constantine the Great converted to Christianity before his death ( 337 ) , and was baptized by bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia ; Constantine decriminalized Christianity in the Roman Empire by the Edict of Milan ( 313 ) , later convening the Council of Nicaea ( 325 ) where Early Christianity was consolidated into what would become the State church of the Roman Empire ( 380 ) . The early history of Christianity 's united church before major schisms is sometimes referred to as the Great Church . The Church of the East split after the Council of Ephesus ( 431 ) and Oriental Orthodoxy split after the Council of Chalcedon ( 451 ) over differences in Christology , while the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church separated in the East-West Schism ( 1054 ) , especially over the authority of the bishop of Rome . Similarly , Protestantism split in numerous denominations from the Latin Catholic Church in the Reformation era ( 16th century ) over theological and ecclesiological disputes , most predominantly on the issue of justification and the primacy of the bishop of Rome . Following the Age of Discovery ( 15th-17th century ) , Christianity was spread into the Americas , Oceania , sub-Saharan Africa , and the rest of the world via missionary work . Christianity remains culturally diverse in its Western and Eastern branches , as well as in its doctrines concerning justification and the nature of salvation , ecclesiology , ordination , and Christology .",
