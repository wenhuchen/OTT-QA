One dollar is divided into 100 cents ( Symbol : \u00a2 ) or 1000 mills ( for accounting purposes and for taxing . Symbol : \u20a5 ) . The Coinage Act of 1792 created a decimal currency by creating the following coins : tenth dollar , one-twentieth dollar , one-hundredth dollar . In addition the act created the dollar , half dollar , and quarter dollar coins . All of these coins are still minted in 2020 . In addition , several forms of paper money were introduced by Congress over the years . The latest of these , the Federal Reserve Note , was authorized by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , while all existing U.S. currency remains legal tender . Issuance of the previous form of the currency ( U.S. notes ) was discontinued in January 1971 . As a result , currently circulating paper money consists primarily of Federal Reserve Notes that are denominated in United States dollars ( 12 U.S.C . \u00a7 418 ) . Since the suspension in 1971 of convertibility of paper U.S. currency into any precious metal , the U.S. dollar is de facto fiat money .",

  "/wiki/Role-playing_game": "A role-playing game ( sometimes spelled roleplaying game ; abbreviated RPG ) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting . Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative , either through literal acting , or through a process of structured decision-making regarding character development . Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines . There are several forms of role-playing games . The original form , sometimes called the tabletop role-playing game ( TRPG ) , is conducted through discussion , whereas in live action role-playing ( LARP ) , players physically perform their characters ' actions . In both of these forms , an arranger called a game master ( GM ) usually decides on the rules and setting to be used , while acting as the referee ; each of the other players takes on the role of a single character . Several varieties of RPG also exist in electronic media , such as multiplayer text-based Multi-User Dungeons ( MUDs ) and their graphics-based successors , massively multiplayer online role-playing games ( MMORPGs ) . Role-playing games also include single-player role-playing video games in which players control a character , or team of characters , who undertake ( s ) quests , and may include player capabilities that advance using statistical mechanics . These electronic games sometimes share settings and rules with tabletop RPGs , but emphasize character advancement more than collaborative storytelling . This type of game is well-established , so some RPG-related game forms , such as trading/collectible card games ( CCGs ) and wargames , may not be included under the definition . Some amount of role-playing activity may be present in such games , but it is not the primary focus . The term role-playing game is also sometimes used to describe games involving roleplay simulation and exercises used in teaching , training , and academic research .",

  "/wiki/Video_game_developers": "A video game developer is a software developer that specializes in video game development - the process and related disciplines of creating video games . A game developer can range from one person who undertakes all tasks to a large business with employee responsibilities split between individual disciplines , such as programming , design , art , testing , etc . Most game development companies have video game publisher financial and usually marketing support . Self-funded developers are known as independent or indie developers and usually make indie games . A developer may specialize in a certain video game console ( such as Nintendo 's Nintendo Switch , Microsoft 's Xbox One , Sony 's PlayStation 4 ) , or may develop for a number of systems ( including personal computers and mobile devices ) . [ citation needed ] Video game developers specialize in certain types of games ( such as role-playing video games or first-person shooters ) . Some focus on porting games from one system to another , or translating games from one language to another . Less commonly , some do software development work in addition to games . Most video game publishers maintain development studios ( such as Electronic Arts 's EA Canada , Square Enix 's studios , Activision 's Radical Entertainment , Nintendo EAD and Sony 's Polyphony Digital and Naughty Dog ) . However , since publishing is still their primary activity they are generally described as publishers rather than developers . Developers may be private as well ( such as how Bungie was , the company which developed the Halo series exclusive to Microsoft 's Xbox ) .",

  "/wiki/Online": "In computer technology and telecommunications , online indicates a state of connectivity , and offline indicates a disconnected state . In modern terminology this usually refers to an Internet connection , but ( especially when expressed on line or on the line ) could refer to any piece of equipment or functional unit that is connected to a larger system . Being online means that the equipment or subsystem is connected , or that it is ready for use . Online has come to describe activities performed on and data available on the Internet , for example : online identity , online predator , online gambling , online shopping , online banking , and online learning . Similar meaning is also given by the prefixes cyber and e , as in the words cyberspace , cybercrime , email , and ecommerce .

The term offline is sometimes used interchangeably with the acronym IRL , meaning in real life .",
  "/wiki/Entertainment": "Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience or gives pleasure and delight . It can be an idea or a task , but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience 's attention . Although people 's attention is held by different things , because individuals have different preferences in entertainment , most forms are recognisable and familiar . Storytelling , music , drama , dance , and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures , were supported in royal courts , developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens . The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products . Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale , ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products ; to a banquet adapted for two ; to any size or type of party , with appropriate music and dance ; to performances intended for thousands ; and even for a global audience . The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement , so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter , although many entertainments have a serious purpose . This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony , celebration , religious festival , or satire for example . Hence , there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth . An important aspect of entertainment is the audience , which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment . The audience may have a passive role , as in the case of persons watching a play , opera , television show , or film ; or the audience role may be active , as in the case of games , where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed . Entertainment can be public or private , involving formal , scripted performance , as in the case of theatre or concerts ; or unscripted and spontaneous , as in the case of children 's games .",

The company was best known for the combat flight sim Air Warrior on the GEnie online service , one of the first graphical MMOGs , launched in 1987 . They also developed an ASCII-based MUD , Island of Kesmai , which ran on CompuServe . The company was acquired by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp. in 1994 . The company continued to develop massively multiplayer games such as Air Warrior 2 and Legends of Kesmai . They distributed their games through AOL and eventually a new gaming service formed with three other publishers , GameStorm . AOL purchased CompuServe in 1997 and retooled its AOL Games Channel in a way that placed Kesmai unfavorably compared to its own games division , WordPlay . Kesmai sued AOL for monopolistic practices . The suit was settled out of court with undisclosed terms . In 1999 , the company was sold to Electronic Arts , and the company 's studios were subsequently closed in 2001 . Upon closure a number of the Kesmai staff went to work for Lodestone Games , also located in Charlottesville , Virginia ; while others remained in the former Kesmai offices but became part of EA.com and later Maxis East . Flinn selected the name Kesmai from a set of names that were output by a random name generator that he wrote for in-game use .",
  "/wiki/Game_publisher": "A video game publisher is a company that publishes video games that have been developed either internally by the publisher or externally by a video game developer . They often finance the development , sometimes by paying a video game developer ( the publisher calls this external development ) and sometimes by paying an internal staff of developers called a studio . The large video game publishers also distribute the games they publish , while some smaller publishers instead hire distribution companies ( or larger video game publishers ) to distribute the games they publish . Other functions usually performed by the publisher include deciding on and paying for any licenses used by the game ; paying for localization ; layout , printing , and possibly the writing of the user manual ; and the creation of graphic design elements such as the box design . Some large publishers with vertical structure also own publishing subsidiaries ( labels ) . Large publishers may also attempt to boost efficiency across all internal and external development teams by providing services such as sound design and code packages for commonly needed functionality . Because the publisher often finances development , it usually tries to manage development risk with a staff of producers or project managers to monitor the progress of the developer , critique ongoing development , and assist as necessary . Most video games created by an external video game developer are paid for with periodic advances on royalties . These advances are paid when the developer reaches certain stages of development , called milestones .",

  "/wiki/Family": "In the context of human society , a family ( from Latin : familia ) is a group of people related either by consanguinity ( by recognized birth ) or affinity ( by marriage or other relationship ) . The purpose of families is to maintain the well-being of its members and of society . Ideally , families would offer predictability , structure , and safety as members mature and participate in the community . In most societies , it is within families that children acquire socialization for life outside the family . Additionally , as the basic unit for meeting the basic needs of its members , it provides a sense of boundaries for performing tasks in a safe environment , ideally builds a person into a functional adult , transmits culture , and ensures continuity of humankind with precedents of knowledge . Anthropologists generally classify most family organizations as matrifocal ( a mother and her children ) ; patrifocal ( a father and his children ) ; conjugal ( a wife , her husband , and children , also called the nuclear family ) ; avuncular ( for example , a grandparent , a brother , his sister , and her children ) ; or extended ( parents and children co-reside with other members of one parent 's family ) . Members of the immediate family may include spouses , parents , grandparents , brothers , sisters , sons , and daughters.Members of the extended family may include aunts , uncles , cousins , nephews , nieces , and siblings-in-law . Sometimes these are also considered members of the immediate family , depending on an individual 's specific relationship with them , and the legal definition of immediate family varies . Sexual relations with family members are regulated by rules concerning incest such as the incest taboo . The field of genealogy aims to trace family lineages through history . The family is also an important economic unit studied in family economics . The word families can be used metaphorically to create more inclusive categories such as community , nationhood , global village , and humanism .",

  "/wiki/Sports": "Sport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which , through casual or organised participation , at least in part aim to use , maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants , and in some cases , entertainment for spectators . Hundreds of sports exist , from those between single contestants , through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants , either in teams or competing as individuals . In certain sports such as racing , many contestants may compete , simultaneously or consecutively , with one winner ; in others , the contest ( a match ) is between two sides , each attempting to exceed the other . Some sports allow a tie or draw , in which there is no single winner ; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser . A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion . Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season , followed in some cases by playoffs . Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity , with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition , and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports . However , a number of competitive , but non-physical , activities claim recognition as mind sports . The International Olympic Committee ( through ARISF ) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports , and SportAccord , the international sports federation association , recognises five non-physical sports : bridge , chess , draughts ( checkers ) , Go and xiangqi , and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports . Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs , which serve to ensure fair competition , and allow consistent adjudication of the winner . Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first . It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance , including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression .",
