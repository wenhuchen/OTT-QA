  "/wiki/Bobby_Clarke": "Robert Earle Clarke OC ( born August 13 , 1949 ) , also known as Bob Clarke ( since retirement as a player ) and Bobby Clarke ( while active as a player ) , is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre who played his entire 15-year National Hockey League ( NHL ) career with the Philadelphia Flyers and is currently an executive with the team . Clarke is acknowledged by some as being one of the greatest hockey players and captains of all time . He was captain of the Flyers from 1973 to 1979 , winning the Stanley Cup with them in both 1974 and 1975 . He was again captain of the Flyers from 1982 to 1984 before retiring . A three-time Hart Trophy winner and 1987 Hockey Hall of Fame inductee , Clarke was rated number 24 on The Hockey News ' list of The Top 100 NHL Players of All-Time in 1998 . In 2017 Clarke was named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players ' in history . Clarke had three 100-point seasons , twice leading the league in assists , and was selected to play in nine NHL All-Star Games . He also won the Frank J. Selke Trophy in 1983 , as the league 's best defensive forward . Upon retiring at the end of the 1983-84 season with 358 goals and 852 assists for a total of 1,210 points in 1,144 career games , he immediately became general manager of the Flyers . He spent 19 of the following 23 seasons as a general manager of the Flyers , also briefly serving as general manager of the Minnesota North Stars and Florida Panthers , and reached the Stanley Cup Finals three times with the Flyers and once with Minnesota . His time as an NHL general manager had its share of controversy , perhaps none greater than the rift between him and star player Eric Lindros during the late 1990s and early 2000s . He resigned from the general manager position less than a month into the 2006-07 season and is currently the Flyers ' senior vice president .",
  "/wiki/1979\u201380_NHL_season": "The 1979-80 NHL season was the 63rd season of the National Hockey League . This season saw the addition of four teams from the disbanded World Hockey Association as expansion franchises . The Edmonton Oilers , Winnipeg Jets , New England Whalers ( later renamed Hartford Whalers at the insistence of the Boston Bruins ) , and Quebec Nordiques joined the NHL , bringing the total to 21 teams . The other two WHA teams ( Birmingham Bulls and Cincinnati Stingers ) were paid to disband . The New York Islanders won their first Stanley Cup , defeating the Philadelphia Flyers in six games , in the finals . The season also marked the eighth and final season for the Flames in Atlanta before the franchise relocated to Calgary . The NHL would return to the Georgia capital in 1999 with the Thrashers , but that team would ultimately relocate away from Atlanta as well becoming the second ( and current ) incarnation of the Winnipeg Jets . The collapse of the WHA also saw the much hyped super-star rookie Wayne Gretzky come to the NHL with the Edmonton Oilers . Gretzky would tie Marcel Dionne for the scoring lead with 137 points and capture the Hart Memorial Trophy as the most valuable player while Dionne took home the Art Ross Trophy as the leading scorer by virtue of having scored two more goals . Gretzky aside , many players made their debut in the NHL this season , both due to the WHA merger and to a change in the rules for the Entry Draft allowing eighteen- and nineteen-year-olds to be drafted for the first time ; no fewer than seven Hall of Famers ( Gretzky , Ray Bourque , Mark Messier , Mike Gartner , Michel Goulet , Mark Howe , and an undrafted Joe Mullen ) debuted this season , along with numerous other perennial stars . The big story of the regular season was the record-breaking undefeated streak compiled by the Philadelphia Flyers . After starting the season with a 5-2 win over the New York Islanders and a 9-2 loss to the Atlanta Flames , the Flyers did not lose again for nearly three months , earning at least one point in every game between a 4-3 win over Toronto on October 14 , 1979 , and a 4-2 win over Buffalo on January 6 , 1980 , earning a 35 game record of 25-0-10 .",
