  "/wiki/Alcatraz_Island": "Alcatraz Island ( /\u02c8\u00e6lk\u0259\u02cctr\u00e6z/ ) is located in San Francisco Bay , 1.25 miles ( 2.01 km ) offshore from San Francisco , California , United States . The small island was developed with facilities for a lighthouse , a military fortification , a military prison , and a federal prison from 1934 until 21 March 1963 . The water currents around the island were high at all times , which presumably decreased the chance of an inmate escaping . Beginning in November 1969 , the island was occupied for more than 19 months by a group of Native Americans from San Francisco , who were part of a wave of Native American activism across the U.S. , with public protests through the 1970s . In 1972 , Alcatraz became part of Golden Gate National Recreation Area and received designation as a National Historic Landmark in 1986 . Today , the island 's facilities are managed by the National Park Service as part of Golden Gate National Recreation Area ; it is open to tours . Visitors can reach the island in a little under 15 minutes by ferry ride from Pier 33 , located between the San Francisco Ferry Building and Fisherman 's Wharf , San Francisco . Hornblower Cruises and Events , operating under the name Alcatraz Cruises , is the official ferry provider to and from the island . Alcatraz Island is home to the abandoned prison , the site of the oldest operating lighthouse on the West Coast of the United States , early military fortifications , and natural features such as rock pools and a seabird colony ( mostly western gulls , cormorants , and egrets ) . According to a 1971 documentary on the history of Alcatraz , the island measures 1,675 feet ( 511 m ) by 590 feet ( 180 m ) and is 135 feet ( 41 m ) at highest point during mean tide . The total area of the island is reported to be 22 acres ( 8.9 ha ) . Landmarks on the island include the Main Cellhouse , Dining Hall , Lighthouse , the ruins of the Warden 's House and Social Hall , Parade Grounds , Building 64 , Water Tower , New Industries Building , Model Industries Building , and the Recreation Yard .",

  "/wiki/The_Beats": "The Beat Generation was a literary movement started by a group of authors whose work explored and influenced American culture and politics in the post-war era . The bulk of their work was published and popularized throughout the 1950s . The central elements of Beat culture are the rejection of standard narrative values , making a spiritual quest , the exploration of American and Eastern religions , the rejection of economic materialism , explicit portrayals of the human condition , experimentation with psychedelic drugs , and sexual liberation and exploration . Allen Ginsberg 's Howl ( 1956 ) , William S. Burroughs ' Naked Lunch ( 1959 ) and Jack Kerouac 's On the Road ( 1957 ) are among the best known examples of Beat literature . Both Howl and Naked Lunch were the focus of obscenity trials that ultimately helped to liberalize publishing in the United States . The members of the Beat Generation developed a reputation as new bohemian hedonists , who celebrated non-conformity and spontaneous creativity . The core group of Beat Generation authors - Herbert Huncke , Ginsberg , Burroughs , Lucien Carr , and Kerouac - met in 1944 in and around the Columbia University campus in New York City . Later , in the mid-1950s , the central figures , with the exception of Burroughs and Carr , ended up together in San Francisco , where they met and became friends of figures associated with the San Francisco Renaissance . In the 1960s , elements of the expanding Beat movement were incorporated into the hippie and larger counterculture movements . Neal Cassady , as the driver for Ken Kesey 's bus Further , was the primary bridge between these two generations . Ginsberg 's work also became an integral element of early 1960s hippie culture .",
