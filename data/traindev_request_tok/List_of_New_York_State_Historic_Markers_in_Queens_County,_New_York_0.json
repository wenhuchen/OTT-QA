  "/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Island": "The Battle of Long Island , also known as the Battle of Brooklyn and the Battle of Brooklyn Heights , was a military action of the American Revolutionary War fought on August 27 , 1776 , at the western edge of Long Island in the present-day borough of Brooklyn , New York . The British defeated the Americans and gained control of the strategically important Port of New York , which they held for the rest of the war . It was the first major battle to take place after the United States declared its independence on July 4 , 1776 , and in troop deployment and combat , it was the largest battle of the entire war . After defeating the British in the Siege of Boston on March 17 , 1776 , commander-in-chief George Washington relocated the Continental Army to defend the port city of New York , located at the southern end of Manhattan Island . Washington understood that the city 's harbor would provide an excellent base for the Royal Navy , so he established defenses there and waited for the British to attack . In July , the British , under the command of General William Howe , landed a few miles across the harbor on the sparsely populated Staten Island , where they were reinforced by a fleet of ships in Lower New York Bay during the next month and a half , bringing their total force to 32,000 troops . Washington knew the difficulty in holding the city with the British fleet in control of the entrance to the harbor at the Narrows , and accordingly moved the bulk of his forces to Manhattan , believing that it would be the first target . On August 22 , the British landed on the shores of Gravesend Bay in southwest Kings County , across the Narrows from Staten Island and more than a dozen miles south from the established East River crossings to Manhattan . After five days of waiting , the British attacked U.S. defenses on the Guan Heights . Unknown to the Americans , however , Howe had brought his main army around their rear and attacked their flank soon after . The Americans panicked , resulting in twenty percent losses through casualties and capture , although a stand by 400 Maryland and Delaware troops prevented a more substantial portion of the army from being lost . The remainder of the army retreated to the main defenses on Brooklyn Heights .",

Bowne was also the first President of 7th Ward Bank of New York City . He married Eliza Southgate in 1803 .
