  "/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling": "Ten-pin bowling is a type of bowling in which a bowler rolls a bowling ball down a wood or synthetic lane toward ten pins positioned in a tetractys ( equilateral triangle-based pattern ) at the far end of the lane . The objective is to knock down all ten pins on the first roll of the ball ( a strike ) , or failing that , on the second roll ( a spare ) . Behind a foul line is an approach approximately 15 feet ( 5 m ) long used to impart speed and apply rotation to the ball . The 41.5-inch-wide ( 105 cm ) , 60-foot-long ( 18 m ) lane is bordered along its length by gutters ( channels ) that collect errant balls . The lane 's long and narrow shape limits straight-line ball paths to angles that are smaller than optimum angles for achieving strikes ; accordingly , many advanced bowlers impart side rotation to hook ( curve ) the ball into the pins . Oil is applied in different patterns to approximately the first two-thirds of the lane 's length to add complexity and regulate challenge in the sport . Especially when coupled with technological developments in ball design since the early 1990s , easier oil patterns , commonly called house shots or typical house patterns ( THPs ) , enable many league bowlers to achieve scores rivaling those of professional bowlers who must bowl on more difficult patterns - a development that has caused substantial controversy . People approach bowling as either a demanding precision sport or as a simple recreational pastime . Following substantial declines since the 1980s in both professional tournament television ratings and amateur league participation , bowling centers have increasingly expanded to become diverse entertainment centers . In most parts of the world , the game is commonly referred to simply as bowling . In Canada and the New England region of the United States , the game is specifically called ten-pin bowling or big-ball bowling to distinguish it from sports with smaller balls such as candlepin bowling , duckpin bowling , and five-pin bowling . In the United Kingdom , it is formally referred to as ten-pin bowling , as bowling can also refer to bowls .",
