It is composed of three mountain ranges : ( from west to east ) the Lesser Luberon ( Petit Luberon ) , the Greater Luberon ( Grand Luberon ) and the Eastern Luberon ( Luberon oriental ) . The valleys north and south of them contain a number of towns and villages as well as agricultural land . The total number of inhabitants varies greatly between winter and summer , due to a massive influx of tourists during the warm season . It is a favourite destination for French high society and British and American visitors because of the pleasant and picturesque towns and villages , comfortable way of life , agricultural wealth , historical and cultural associations ( e.g. , Samuel Beckett lived in Cave Bonelly , a vineyard near to Roussillon , during World War II ) , and hiking trails . In the 1970s , people came from all over France to the Luberon in search of a communitarian ideal . The Force de frappe or French strategic nuclear arsenal used to be nearby , underground , on the Plateau d'Albion before being dismantled in the late 1980s . Now , the underground site where the missile controls were located is a public multidisciplinary laboratory of the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis , the Low Noise Underground Laboratory ( LSBB ) of Rustrel , Pays d'Apt . In the last two decades the Luberon has become known in the English-speaking world especially through a series of books by British author Peter Mayle chronicling his life as an expatriate settled in the Luberon village of M\u00e9nerbes . These are titled A Year in Provence , Toujours Provence , and Encore Provence . Another of Mayle 's books , a novel set in the Luberon , was made into a film called A Good Year ( 2006 ) directed by Ridley Scott , starring Russell Crowe and filmed in the region .",
