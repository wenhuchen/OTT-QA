  "/wiki/Baths_of_Trajan": "The Baths of Trajan were a massive thermae , a bathing and leisure complex , built in ancient Rome starting from 104 AD and dedicated during the Kalends of July in 109 . Commissioned by Emperor Trajan , the complex of baths occupied space on the southern side of the Oppian Hill on the outskirts of what was then the main developed area of the city , although still inside the boundary of the Servian Wall . The architect of the complex is said to be Apollodorus of Damascus . The baths were being utilized mainly as a recreational and social center by Roman citizens , both men and women , as late as the early 5th century . The complex seems to have been deserted soon afterwards as a cemetery dated to the 5th century ( which remained in use until the 7th century ) has been found in front of the northeastern exedra . The baths were thus no longer in use at the time of the siege of Rome by the Ostrogoths in 537 ; with the destruction of the Roman aqueducts , all thermae were abandoned , as was the whole of the now-waterless Mons Oppius . Early Christian writers misnamed the remains the 'Baths of Domitian ' .",
  "/wiki/Rome": "Rome ( Latin and Italian : Roma [ \u02c8ro\u02d0ma ] ( listen ) ) is the capital city and a special comune of Italy ( named Comune di Roma Capitale ) . Rome also serves as the capital of the Lazio region . With 2,879,728 residents in 1,285 km2 ( 496.1 sq mi ) , it is also the country 's most populated comune . It is the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits . It is the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome , which has a population of 4,355,725 residents , thus making it the second or third most populous metropolitan city in Italy depending on definition . Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula , within Lazio ( Latium ) , along the shores of the Tiber . Vatican City ( the smallest country in the world ) is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome , the only existing example of a country within a city ; for this reason Rome has sometimes been defined as the capital of two states . Rome 's history spans 28 centuries . While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC , the site has been inhabited for much longer , making it one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe . The city 's early population originated from a mix of Latins , Etruscans , and Sabines . Eventually , the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom , the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire , and is regarded by many as the first ever Imperial City and metropolis . It was first called The Eternal City ( Latin : Urbs Aeterna ; Italian : La Citt\u00e0 Eterna ) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC , and the expression was also taken up by Ovid , Virgil , and Livy .",
  "/wiki/Baths_of_Diocletian": "The Baths of Diocletian ( Latin : Thermae Diocletiani , Italian : Terme di Diocleziano ) were public baths in ancient Rome , in what is now Italy . Named after emperor Diocletian and built from 298 AD to 306 AD , they were the largest of the imperial baths . The project was originally commissioned by Maximian upon his return to Rome in the autumn of 298 and was continued after his and Diocletian 's abdication under Constantius , father of Constantine .",

  "/wiki/Santi_Cosma_e_Damiano": "The basilica of Santi Cosma e Damiano is a church in the Roman Forum , parts of which incorporate original Roman buildings . The circular building at the entrance onto the Forum ( not used today ) was built in the early 4th century as a Roman temple , thought to have been dedicated to Valerius Romulus , deified son of the emperor Maxentius . The main building was perhaps the library of an imperial forum . It became a church in 527 and contains important but much restored early Christian art , especially in its mosaics . Today it is one of the ancient churches called tituli , of which cardinals are patrons as cardinal-deacons : the current Cardinal Deacon of the Titulus Ss . Cosmae et Damiani is Beniamino Stella , created Cardinal on 22 February 2014 . The basilica , devoted to the two Arabian Christian brothers , doctors , martyrs and saints Cosmas and Damian , is located in the Forum of Vespasian , also known as the Forum of Peace .",
  "/wiki/Jerash": "Jerash ( Arabic : \u062c\u0631\u0634 ; Ancient Greek : \u0393\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1 ) is a city in northern Jordan . The city is the administrative center of the Jerash Governorate , and has a population of 50,745 as of 2015 . It is located 48 kilometres ( 30 mi ) north of the capital city Amman . The earliest evidence of settlement in Jerash is in a Neolithic site known as Tal Abu Sowan , where rare human remains dating to around 7500 BC were uncovered . Jerash flourished during the Greco and Roman periods until the mid-eighth century CE , when the 749 Galilee earthquake destroyed large parts of it , while subsequent earthquakes contributed to additional destruction . However , in the year 1120 , Zahir ad-Din Toghtekin , atabeg of Damascus ordered a garrison of forty men stationed in Jerash to convert the Temple of Artemis into a fortress . It was captured in 1121 by Baldwin II , King of Jerusalem , and utterly destroyed . Then , the Crusaders immediately abandoned Jerash and withdrew to Sakib ( Seecip ) ; the eastern border of the settlement . Jerash was then deserted until it reappeared by the beginning of the Ottoman rule in the early 16th century . In the census of 1596 , it had a population of 12 Muslim households . However , the archaeologists have found a small Mamluk hamlet in the Northwest Quarter which indicates that Jerash was resettled before the Ottoman era . The excavations conducted since 2011 have shed light on the Middle Islamic period as recent discoveries have uncovered a large concentration of Middle Islamic/Mamluk structures and pottery .",
  "/wiki/Bostra": "Bosra ( Arabic : \u0628\u0635\u0631\u0649 , romanized : Bu\u1e63r\u0101 ) , also spelled Bostra , Busrana , Bozrah , Bozra and officially known Busra al-Sham ( Arabic : \u0628\u0635\u0631\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0645 , romanized : Bu\u1e63r\u0101 al-Sh\u0101m ) is a town in southern Syria , administratively belonging to the Daraa District of the Daraa Governorate and geographically being part of the Hauran region .

  "/wiki/Pantheon,_Rome": "The Pantheon ( UK : /\u02c8p\u00e6n\u03b8i\u0259n/ , US : /-\u0252n/ ; Latin : Pantheum , [ nb 1 ] from Greek \u03a0\u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd Pantheion , [ temple ] of all the gods ) is a former Roman temple , now a Catholic church ( Basilica di Santa Maria ad Martyres or Basilica of St. Mary and the Martyrs ) , in Rome , Italy , on the site of an earlier temple commissioned by Marcus Agrippa during the reign of Augustus ( 27 BC - 14 AD ) . It was completed by the emperor Hadrian and probably dedicated about 126 AD . Its date of construction is uncertain , because Hadrian chose not to inscribe the new temple but rather to retain the inscription of Agrippa 's older temple , which had burned down . The building is cylindrical with a portico of large granite Corinthian columns ( eight in the first rank and two groups of four behind ) under a pediment . A rectangular vestibule links the porch to the rotunda , which is under a coffered concrete dome , with a central opening ( oculus ) to the sky . Almost two thousand years after it was built , the Pantheon 's dome is still the world 's largest unreinforced concrete dome . The height to the oculus and the diameter of the interior circle are the same , 43 metres ( 142 ft ) . It is one of the best-preserved of all Ancient Roman buildings , in large part because it has been in continuous use throughout its history and , since the 7th century , the Pantheon has been in use as a church dedicated to St. Mary and the Martyrs ( Latin : Sancta Maria ad Martyres ) but informally known as Santa Maria Rotonda . The square in front of the Pantheon is called Piazza della Rotonda . The Pantheon is a state property , managed by Italy 's Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism through the Polo Museale del Lazio ; in 2013 it was visited by over 6 million people . The Pantheon 's large circular domed cella , with a conventional temple portico front , was unique in Roman architecture . Nevertheless , it became a standard exemplar when classical styles were revived , and has been copied many times by later architects ."
