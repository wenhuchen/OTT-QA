It is the first of two Cup races held every year at Daytona , the second being the Coke Zero 400 , and one of three held in Florida , with the annual spring showdown Dixie Vodka 400 being held at Homestead south of Miami . It is one of the four tapered spacer races on the Cup schedule . The inaugural Daytona 500 was held in 1959 coinciding with the opening of the speedway and since 1982 , it has been the season-opening race of the Cup series . The Daytona 500 is regarded as the most important and prestigious race on the NASCAR calendar , carrying by far the largest purse . Championship points awarded are equal to that of any other NASCAR Cup Series race . It is also the series ' first race of the year ; this phenomenon is virtually unique in sports , which tend to have championships or other major events at the end of the season rather than the start . Since 1995 , U.S. television ratings for the Daytona 500 have been the highest for any auto race of the year , surpassing the traditional leader , the Indianapolis 500 which in turn greatly surpasses the Daytona 500 in in-track attendance and international viewing . The 2006 Daytona 500 attracted the sixth largest average live global TV audience of any sporting event that year with 20 million viewers . The race serves as the final event of Speedweeks and is sometimes known as The Great American Race or the Super Bowl of Stock Car Racing . Since its inception , the race has been held in mid-to-late February . From 1971 to 2011 , and again since 2018 , the event has been as associated with Presidents Day weekend , taking place on the Sunday before the third Monday in February .",

He is best known to the general public for his mass-energy equivalence formula E = m c 2 { \\displaystyle E=mc^ { 2 } } , which has been dubbed the world 's most famous equation . He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics , and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect , a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory . Near the beginning of his career , Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field . This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern ( 1902-1909 ) . He subsequently realized that the principle of relativity could be extended to gravitational fields , and published a paper on general relativity in 1916 introducing his theory of gravitation . He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory , which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules . He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation , the basis of laser , which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light . In 1917 , he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe . Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895 and renounced his German citizenship in 1896 . After being stateless for more than five years , he acquired Swiss citizenship in 1901 , which he kept for the rest of his life .",

Originally trained as a Catholic priest , Erasmus was an important figure in classical scholarship who wrote in a pure Latin style . Among humanists he enjoyed the sobriquet Prince of the Humanists , and has been called the crowning glory of the Christian humanists . Using humanist techniques for working on texts , he prepared important new Latin and Greek editions of the New Testament , which raised questions that would be influential in the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation . He also wrote On Free Will , In Praise of Folly , Handbook of a Christian Knight , On Civility in Children , Copia : Foundations of the Abundant Style , Julius Exclusus , and many other works . Erasmus lived against the backdrop of the growing European religious Reformation . While he was critical of the abuses within the Catholic Church and called for reform , he nonetheless kept his distance from Luther , Henry VIII , and John Calvin and continued to recognise the authority of the pope , emphasizing a middle way with a deep respect for traditional faith , piety and grace , and rejecting Luther 's emphasis on faith alone . Erasmus remained a member of the Catholic Church all his life , remaining committed to reforming the church and its clerics ' abuses from within . He also held to the doctrine of synergism , which some Reformers ( Calvinists ) rejected in favor of the doctrine of monergism . His middle road ( via media ) approach disappointed , and even angered , scholars in both camps . Erasmus died suddenly in Basel in 1536 while preparing to return to Brabant and was buried in Basel Minster , the former cathedral of the city . A bronze statue of Erasmus was erected in 1622 in his city of birth , replacing an earlier work in stone .",

His main discoveries include the principles underlying electromagnetic induction , diamagnetism and electrolysis . Although Faraday received little formal education , he was one of the most influential scientists in history . It was by his research on the magnetic field around a conductor carrying a direct current that Faraday established the basis for the concept of the electromagnetic field in physics . Faraday also established that magnetism could affect rays of light and that there was an underlying relationship between the two phenomena . He similarly discovered the principles of electromagnetic induction and diamagnetism , and the laws of electrolysis . His inventions of electromagnetic rotary devices formed the foundation of electric motor technology , and it was largely due to his efforts that electricity became practical for use in technology . As a chemist , Faraday discovered benzene , investigated the clathrate hydrate of chlorine , invented an early form of the Bunsen burner and the system of oxidation numbers , and popularised terminology such as anode , cathode , electrode and ion . Faraday ultimately became the first and foremost Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution , a lifetime position . Faraday was an excellent experimentalist who conveyed his ideas in clear and simple language ; his mathematical abilities , however , did not extend as far as trigonometry and were limited to the simplest algebra . James Clerk Maxwell took the work of Faraday and others and summarized it in a set of equations which is accepted as the basis of all modern theories of electromagnetic phenomena . On Faraday 's uses of lines of force , Maxwell wrote that they show Faraday to have been in reality a mathematician of a very high order - one from whom the mathematicians of the future may derive valuable and fertile methods .",

Two of his works , A Fable ( 1954 ) and his last novel The Reivers ( 1962 ) , each won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction . In 1998 , the Modern Library ranked his 1929 novel The Sound and the Fury sixth on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century ; also on the list were As I Lay Dying ( 1930 ) and Light in August ( 1932 ) . Absalom , Absalom ! ( 1936 ) appears on similar lists . [ citation needed ]",

  "/wiki/Enrico_Fermi": "Enrico Fermi ( Italian : [ en\u02c8ri\u02d0ko \u02c8fermi ] ; 29 September 1901 - 28 November 1954 ) was an Italian-American physicist and the creator of the world 's first nuclear reactor , the Chicago Pile-1 . He has been called the architect of the nuclear age and the architect of the atomic bomb . He was one of very few physicists to excel in both theoretical physics and experimental physics . Fermi held several patents related to the use of nuclear power , and was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity by neutron bombardment and for the discovery of transuranium elements . He made significant contributions to the development of statistical mechanics , quantum theory , and nuclear and particle physics . Fermi 's first major contribution involved the field of statistical mechanics . After Wolfgang Pauli formulated his exclusion principle in 1925 , Fermi followed with a paper in which he applied the principle to an ideal gas , employing a statistical formulation now known as Fermi-Dirac statistics . Today , particles that obey the exclusion principle are called fermions . Pauli later postulated the existence of an uncharged invisible particle emitted along with an electron during beta decay , to satisfy the law of conservation of energy . Fermi took up this idea , developing a model that incorporated the postulated particle , which he named the neutrino . His theory , later referred to as Fermi 's interaction and now called weak interaction , described one of the four fundamental interactions in nature . Through experiments inducing radioactivity with the recently discovered neutron , Fermi discovered that slow neutrons were more easily captured by atomic nuclei than fast ones , and he developed the Fermi age equation to describe this ."
