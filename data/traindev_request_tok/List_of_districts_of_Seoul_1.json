The river begins as two smaller rivers in the eastern mountains of the Korean peninsula , which then converge near Seoul , the capital of the country . The Han River and its surrounding area have played an important role in Korean history . The Three Kingdoms of Korea strove to take control of this land , where the river was used as a trade route to China ( via the Yellow Sea ) . However , the river is no longer actively used for navigation , because its estuary is located at the borders of the two Koreas , barred for entrance by any civilian . The river serves as a water source for over 12 million Koreans . In July 2000 , the United States military admitted to having dumped toxic chemicals in the river , causing protests . Currently , the lower stretches of the Han River are lined with pedestrian walkways , bicycle paths , public parks and restaurants , particularly in Seoul . In a 2011 survey conducted by Seoul Development Institute of 800 residents and 103 urban planning and architectural experts , 51.3 percent of residents and 68.9 percent of experts voted the river the second most scenic location in the city , following Mount Namsan in the top spot .",

There was no such practice as worshipping Guan Yu as a deity in Korea until Ming Dynasty military officers brought the custom during the military campaigns against Japan . As Neo-Confucian fundamentalists , Korean officers found it unacceptable to worship Guan Yu , but were unable to refuse the Chinese request for enshrinement . The construction was a burden to exhausted postwar Korea and the shrine was maintained only with concern for the relationship with China . Koreans remained indifferent toward these shrines for a long time . But during the reign of King Yeongjo ( 1724-1776 ) , Dongmyo and Nammyo ( another shrine constructed by Ming military official Zhen Yin ) were incorporated into state rituals for the purpose of Ming worship linked with hostility toward and contempt for Manchu Qing Dynasty .
