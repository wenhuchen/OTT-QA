  "/wiki/West_Germany": "West Germany was the informal name for the Federal Republic of Germany , a country in Western Europe , in the period between its formation on 23 May 1949 and German reunification on 3 October 1990 . During this Cold War period , the western portion of Germany was part of the Western Bloc . The Federal Republic was created during the Allied occupation of Germany after World War II , established from eleven states formed in the three Allied zones of occupation held by the United States , the United Kingdom and France . Its ( provisional ) capital was the city of Bonn . The Cold War era West Germany is also retrospectively designated the Bonn Republic . At the onset of the Cold War , Europe was divided among the Western and Eastern blocs . Germany was de facto divided into two countries and two special territories , the Saarland and a divided Berlin . Initially , the Federal Republic of Germany claimed an exclusive mandate for all of Germany , considering itself to be the sole democratically reorganised continuation of the 1871-1945 German Reich . It took the line that the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) was an illegally constituted puppet state . Though the GDR did hold regular elections , these were neither free nor fair . From the West German perspective , the GDR was therefore illegitimate . Three southwestern states of West Germany merged to form Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in 1952 , and the Saarland joined the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957 .",
  "/wiki/Kornelia_Ender": "Kornelia Ender ( later Matthes now Grummt , born 25 October 1958 in Plauen , Bezirk Karl-Marx-Stadt ) is a former East German swimmer who at the 1976 Summer Olympics became the first woman swimmer to win four gold medals at a single Olympic Games , all in world record times . It was later proven that the East German team doctors had systematically administered steroids to their athletes ( albeit without the athletes ' knowledge ) . As she had exhibited symptoms of steroid use in 1976 ( deep voice , overdeveloped body ) , strong suspicion was cast on the validity of Ender 's accomplishments . Ender trained from a young age and won her first Olympic medals as a 13-year-old at the 1972 Olympics in Munich : three silver medals , including one in the 200 m individual medley , finishing behind Australia 's Shane Gould . Over the following years she broke 32 world records in individual events , including the four at the Montreal Games . In 1991 , she addressed the long-held suspicions about her physical condition at the 1976 Games , acknowledging that team doctors and coaches had given her numerous injections of drugs over the preceding months ( cf . doping in East Germany ) . Ender said that she did not know at the time , nor had she ever subsequently found out , exactly what the drugs were . She said she was told only that the drugs would help her regenerate and recuperate and therefore , although she was surprised by the muscle mass she added , she nonetheless attributed it simply to her rigorous training . When she became suspicious and refused to take chlorodehydromethyltestosterone in 1977 she was banned from the team by the Marxist authorities . Ender was married for four years to East German backstroke swimmer and multiple Olympic champion Roland Matthes . She is now married to former East German - German track and field athlete and bobsledder Steffen Grummt .",
  "/wiki/East_Berlin": "East Berlin was the capital city of the German Democratic Republic from 1949 to 1990 . Formally , it was the Soviet sector of Berlin , established in 1945 . The American , British , and French sectors were known as West Berlin . From 13 August 1961 until 9 November 1989 , East Berlin was separated from West Berlin by the Berlin Wall . The Western Allied powers did not recognise East Berlin as the GDR 's capital , nor the GDR 's authority to govern East Berlin . On 3 October 1990 , the day Germany was officially reunified , East and West Berlin formally reunited as the city of Berlin .",

Commonly described as a communist state in English usage , it described itself as a socialist workers ' and peasants ' state . It consisted of territory that was administered and occupied by Soviet forces following the end of World War II - the Soviet occupation zone of the Potsdam Agreement , bounded on the east by the Oder-Neisse line . The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin but did not include it ; as a result , West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR . The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet zone , while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones . East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union . Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948 , and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949 . However , Soviet forces remained in the country throughout the Cold War . Until 1989 , the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party ( SED ) , though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation , the National Front . The SED made the teaching of Marxism-Leninism and the Russian language compulsory in schools . The economy was centrally planned and increasingly state-owned . Prices of housing , basic goods and services were set by central government planners rather than rising and falling through supply and demand ; and were heavily subsidised .",
