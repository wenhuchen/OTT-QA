The first playable version was completed on June 6 , 1984 , while he was working for the Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union in Moscow . He derived its name from combining the Greek numerical prefix tetra- ( the falling pieces contain 4 segments ) and tennis , Pajitnov 's favorite sport .

Tetris was the first game to be exported from the Soviet Union to the United States , where it was published by Spectrum HoloByte for the Commodore 64 and IBM PC . The game is a popular use of tetrominoes , the four-element case of polyominoes , which have been used in popular puzzles since at least 1907 .

Golomb in 1953 . ) The game , or one of its many variants , is available for nearly every video game console and computer operating system , as well as on devices such as graphing calculators , mobile phones , portable media players , PDAs , Network music players , and as an Easter egg on non-media products like oscilloscopes . It has inspired Tetris serving dishes , and it has even been played on the sides of various buildings .
