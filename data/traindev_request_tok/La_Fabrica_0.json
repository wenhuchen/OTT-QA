The Marinid and Saadi dynasties resisted foreign domination into the 17th century , allowing Morocco to remain the only northwest African country to avoid Ottoman occupation . The Alaouite dynasty , which rules to this day , seized power in 1631 . The country 's strategic location near the mouth of the Mediterranean attracted the interest of Europe , and in 1912 , Morocco was divided into French and Spanish protectorates , with an international zone in Tangier . It regained its independence in 1956 , and has since remained comparatively stable and prosperous by regional standards , with the fifth largest economy in Africa .",

All editions were official competitions of UEFA and CONMEBOL and indirectly also of FIFA . From its formation in 1960 to 1979 , the competition was contested over a two legged tie , with a playoff if necessary until 1968 , and penalty kicks later . During the 1970s , European participation in the Intercontinental Cup became a running question due to controversial events in the 1969 final , and some European Champions Club ' winner teams withdrew .

From 1980 the logistics organisation passed to the Japan Football Association but the competitions was always under the aegis of UEFA and CONMEBOL . All the winning teams were regarded by worldwide mass media and football 's community , FIFA included ( as News Center productions and not catalogued on the FIFA website as official entity documents ) , de facto as world champions until 2017 when FIFA Council officially ( de jure ) recognised all of them as club world champions with the same status to the FIFA Club World Cup winners , then as official world champions FIFA .
