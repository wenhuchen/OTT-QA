  "/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)": "The Outsiders is a coming-of-age novel by S. E. Hinton , first published in 1967 by Viking Press . Hinton was 15 when she started writing the novel but did most of the work when she was 16 and a junior in high school . Hinton was 18 when the book was published . The book details the conflict between two rival gangs divided by their socioeconomic status : the working-class greasers and the upper-class Socs ( pronounced /\u02c8so\u028a\u0283\u026az/ - short for Socials ) . The story is told in first-person perspective by teenaged protagonist Ponyboy Curtis . The story in the book takes place in Tulsa , Oklahoma , in 1965 , but this is never explicitly stated in the book . A film adaptation was produced in 1983 , and a little-known short-lived television series appeared in 1990 , picking up where the movie left off . A stage adaptation was written by Christopher Sergel and published in 1990 .",
  "/wiki/Novel": "A novel is a relatively long work of narrative fiction , normally written in prose form , and which is typically published as a book . The present English word for a long work of prose fiction derives from the Italian novella for new , news , or short story of something new , itself from the Latin novella , a singular noun use of the neuter plural of novellus , diminutive of novus , meaning new . Walter Scott made a distinction between the novel , in which ( as he saw it ) events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society and the romance , which he defined as a fictitious narrative in prose or verse ; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents . However , many such romances , including the historical romances of Scott , Emily Bront\u00eb 's Wuthering Heights and Herman Melville 's Moby-Dick , are also frequently called novels , and Scott describes romance as a kindred term . This sort of romance is in turn different from the genre fiction love romance or romance novel . Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel : a novel is le roman , der Roman , il romanzo , en roman . Most European languages use the word romance ( as in French , Dutch , Russian , Slovene , Serbo-Croatian , Romanian , Danish , Swedish and Norwegian roman ; Finnish romaani ; German Roman ; Portuguese romance and Italian romanzo ) for extended narratives . The novel constitutes a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years , with its origins in classical Greece and Rome , in medieval and early modern romance , and in the tradition of the Italian renaissance novella . ( Since the 18th century , the term novella , or novelle in German , has been used in English and other European languages to describe a long short story or a short novel . ) Murasaki Shikibu 's Tale of Genji , an early 11th-century Japanese text , has sometimes been described as the world 's first novel , but there is considerable debate over this - there were certainly long fictional works much earlier . Spread of printed books in China led to the appearance of classical Chinese novels by the Ming dynasty ( 1368-1644 ) . Parallel European developments occurred after the invention of the printing press .",
  "/wiki/Penguin_Books": "Penguin Books is a British publishing house . It was co-founded in 1935 by Sir Allen Lane with his brothers Richard and John , as a line of the publishers The Bodley Head , only becoming a separate company the following year .

Penguin 's success demonstrated that large audiences existed for serious books . Penguin also had a significant impact on public debate in Britain , through its books on British culture , politics , the arts , and science . Penguin Books is now an imprint of the worldwide Penguin Random House , an emerging conglomerate which was formed in 2013 by the merger with American publisher Random House .

  "/wiki/Children's_literature": "Children 's literature or juvenile literature includes stories , books , magazines , and poems that are made for children . Modern children 's literature is classified in two different ways : genre or the intended age of the reader . Children 's literature can be traced to stories and songs , part of a wider oral tradition , that adults shared with children before publishing existed . The development of early children 's literature , before printing was invented , is difficult to trace . Even after printing became widespread , many classic children 's tales were originally created for adults and later adapted for a younger audience . Since the fifteenth century much literature has been aimed specifically at children , often with a moral or religious message . The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are known as the Golden Age of Children 's Literature because many classic children 's books were published then .",

  "/wiki/Fantasy": "Fantasy is a genre of speculative fiction set in a fictional universe , often inspired by real world myth and folklore . Its roots are in oral traditions , which then became fantasy literature and drama . From the twentieth century it has expanded further into various media , including film , television , graphic novels , manga and video games . Fantasy is distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the absence of scientific or macabre themes respectively , though these genres overlap . In popular culture , the fantasy genre predominantly features settings of a medieval nature . In its broadest sense , however , fantasy consists of works by many writers , artists , filmmakers , and musicians from ancient myths and legends to many recent and popular works .",
  "/wiki/Horror_fiction": "Horror is a genre of speculative fiction which is intended to frighten , scare , disgust , or startle its readers by inducing feelings of horror and terror . Literary historian J . A. Cuddon defined the horror story as a piece of fiction in prose of variable length . which shocks , or even frightens the reader , or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing . It creates an eerie and frightening atmosphere . Horror is frequently supernatural , though it might be also non-supernatural .

  "/wiki/Short_story": "A short story is a piece of prose fiction that typically can be read in one sitting and focuses on a self-contained incident or series of linked incidents , with the intent of evoking a single effect or mood . A dictionary definition is an invented prose narrative shorter than a novel usually dealing with a few characters and aiming at unity of effect and often concentrating on the creation of mood rather than plot . The short story is a crafted form in its own right . Short stories make use of plot , resonance , and other dynamic components as in a novel , but typically to a lesser degree . While the short story is largely distinct from the novel or novella ( a shorter novel ) , authors generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques . Short story writers may define their works as part of the artistic and personal expression of the form . They may also attempt to resist categorization by genre and fixed formation . Short stories have deep roots and the power of short fiction has been recognised in modern society for hundreds of years . The short form is , conceivably , more natural to us than longer forms . We are drawn to short stories as the well-told story , and as William Boyd , the award-winning British author and short story writer has said :",
