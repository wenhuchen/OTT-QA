  "/wiki/William_Stoughton_(Massachusetts)": "William Stoughton ( 1631 - July 7 , 1701 ) was a colonial magistrate and administrator in the Province of Massachusetts Bay . He was in charge of what have come to be known as the Salem Witch Trials , first as the Chief Justice of the Special Court of Oyer and Terminer in 1692 , and then as the Chief Justice of the Superior Court of Judicature in 1693 . In these trials he controversially accepted spectral evidence ( based on supposed demonic visions ) . Unlike some of the other magistrates , he never admitted to the possibility that his acceptance of such evidence was in error . After graduating from Harvard College in 1650 , he continued religious studies in England , where he also preached . Returning to Massachusetts in 1662 , he chose to enter politics instead of the ministry . An adept politician , he served in virtually every government through the period of turmoil in Massachusetts that encompassed the revocation of its first charter in 1684 and the introduction of its second charter in 1692 , including the unpopular rule of Sir Edmund Andros in the late 1680s . He served as lieutenant governor of the province from 1692 until his death in 1701 , acting as governor ( in the absence of an appointed governor ) for about six years . He was one of the province 's major landowners , partnering with Joseph Dudley and other powerful figures in land purchases , and it was for him that the town of Stoughton , Massachusetts was named .",

  "/wiki/Massachusetts_Governor's_Council": "The Massachusetts Governor 's Council ( also known as the Executive Council ) is a governmental body that provides advice and consent in certain matters - such as judicial nominations , pardons , and commutations - to the Governor of Massachusetts . Councillors are elected by the general public and their duties are set forth in the Massachusetts Constitution . The Governor 's Council has gone through many different formations throughout its history . At times being simply a legal counsel , also serving as provincial magistrates and judges , sometimes acting as an executive in the absence of a Governor , to serving as an upper house of the Massachusetts General Court . Whether going by the name of Council of Assistants or Governor 's Council , the power of the council has ebbed and flowed , however it has remained a mainstay in New England politics from the earliest colonial days of Massachusetts Bay",

  "/wiki/Joseph_Dudley": "Joseph Dudley ( September 23 , 1647 - April 2 , 1720 ) was a colonial administrator , a native of Roxbury in Massachusetts Bay Colony , and the son of one of its founders . He had a leading role in the administration of the Dominion of New England ( 1686-1689 ) which was overthrown in the 1689 Boston revolt . He served briefly on the council of the Province of New York where he oversaw the trial which convicted Jacob Leisler , the ringleader of Leisler 's Rebellion . He then spent eight years in England in the 1690s as Lieutenant-Governor of the Isle of Wight , including one year as a Member of Parliament for Newtown ( Isle of Wight ) . In 1702 , he returned to New England after being appointed governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay and Province of New Hampshire , posts that he held until 1715 . His rule of Massachusetts was characterized by hostility and tension , with political enemies opposing his attempts to gain a regular salary and regularly making complaints about his official and private actions . Most of his tenure was dominated by the French and Indian Wars , in which the two provinces were on the front lines with New France and suffered from a series of major and minor French and Indian raids . He orchestrated an unsuccessful attempt to capture the Acadian capital of Port Royal in 1707 , raised provincial militia forces for its successful capture in 1710 , and directed an unsuccessful expedition against Quebec in 1711 . Dudley 's governorship initiated a hostility in Massachusetts toward royal governance , most frequently over the issue of the salaries of crown officials . The colonial legislature routinely challenged or disputed the prerogatives of the governor , and this hostility affected most of the governors of Massachusetts up to the American Revolutionary War and the end of British rule . Dudley 's rule of New Hampshire , however , was comparatively uncontroversial .",

  "/wiki/Samuel_Shute": "Samuel Shute ( January 12 , 1662 - April 15 , 1742 ) was an English military officer and royal governor of the provinces of Massachusetts and New Hampshire . After serving in the Nine Years ' War and the War of the Spanish Succession , he was appointed by King George I as governor of Massachusetts and New Hampshire in 1716 . His tenure was marked by virulent disagreements with the Massachusetts assembly on a variety of issues , and by poorly conducted diplomacy with respect to the Native American Wabanaki Confederacy of northern New England that led to Dummer 's War ( 1722-1725 ) . Although Shute was partly responsible for the breakdown in negotiations with the Wabanakis , he returned to England in early 1723 to procure resolutions to his ongoing disagreements with the Massachusetts assembly , leaving conduct of the war to Lieutenant Governor William Dummer . His protests resulted in the issuance in 1725 of the Explanatory Charter , essentially confirming his position in the disputes with the assembly . He did not return to New England , being replaced as governor in 1728 by William Burnet , and refused to be considered for reappointment after Burnet 's sudden death in 1729 . Thomas Hutchinson ( Massachusetts royal governor in the early 1770s ) , in his history of Massachusetts , described Shute 's tenure as governor as the most contentious since the Antinomian Controversy of the 1630s .",

Born in Salem , he was sent to England by his parents , where he read law at the Middle Temple . He was the first Chief Justice ( appointed associate 1712 , chief justice 1729 ) of the Massachusetts Superior Court of Judicature , the province 's highest court , to have formal training as a lawyer . Lynde 's family gave its name to the town of Lyndeborough , New Hampshire , established in an area where they had extensive land holdings .

  "/wiki/William_Burnet_(administrator)": "William Burnet ( March 1687/88 - 7 September 1729 ) was a British civil servant and colonial administrator who served as governor of New York and New Jersey ( 1720-1728 ) and Massachusetts and New Hampshire ( 1728-1729 ) . Born into a position of privilege ( his godfather became William III of England not long after his birth , and his father Gilbert Burnet was later Bishop of Salisbury ) , Burnet was well educated , tutored among others by Isaac Newton . Active for most of his life in intellectual pursuits ( he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1705/6 ) , he occupied no posts of importance until financial considerations and political connections brought him the governorships of New York and New Jersey . His tenure in New Jersey was without major controversies , although he set a precedent there for accepting what were effectively bribes in exchange for his assent to legislation . In New York he sought unsuccessfully to end the fur trade between Albany and Montreal in order to implement a colonial policy preferring direct trade with the Native Americans in central North America . His New York rule was marked by an increase in political divisions between land owners ( with whom Burnet sided ) and merchants . After the death of King George I , King George II appointed Burnet governor of New Hampshire and Massachusetts . Although his New Hampshire tenure was inconsequential , he engaged in a nasty dispute with the Massachusetts assembly over the issue of his salary , holding the legislative body in session for six months and relocating it away from Boston . The dispute held up other colonial business , and was ongoing in September 1729 when Burnet died ; his death was apparently caused by illness contracted after his carriage overturned and dumped him in water .",

Dudley was born in Roxbury , Massachusetts in 1675 . After graduating from the Roxbury Latin School and then , at the age of 15 , from Harvard in 1690 , he studied law at the Temple in London , and became Attorney General of Massachusetts from 1702 to 1718 .

  "/wiki/William_Shirley": "William Shirley ( 2 December 1694 - 24 March 1771 ) was a British colonial administrator who was the longest-serving governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay ( 1741-1749 and 1753-1756 ) and then Governor of the Bahamas ( 1760-1768 ) . He is best known for his role in organizing the 1745 Siege of Louisbourg during King George 's War , and for his role in military affairs during the French and Indian War . He spent most of his years in the colonial administration of North America working to defeat New France , but his lack of formal military training led to political difficulties and his eventual downfall . Politically well connected , Shirley began his career in Massachusetts as advocate general in the admiralty court , and quickly became an opponent of Governor Jonathan Belcher . He joined with Belcher 's other political enemies to bring about Belcher 's recall , and was appointed Governor of Massachusetts Bay in Belcher 's place . He successfully quieted political divisions within the province , and was able to bring about united action against New France when King George 's War began in 1744 . The successful Siege of Louisbourg , which Shirley had a major role in organizing , was one of the high points of his administration . After King George 's War Shirley became mired in disputes over funding and accounting for the war effort , and returned to England in 1749 to deal with political and legal matters arising from those disputes . He was then assigned to a commission established by Great Britain and France to determine the colonial borders in North America . His hard-line approach to these negotiations contributed to their failure , and he returned to Massachusetts in 1753 . Military matters again dominated Shirley 's remaining years in Massachusetts , with the French and Indian War beginning in 1754 . Shirley led a military expedition to reinforce Fort Oswego in 1755 , and became Commander-in-Chief , North America upon the death of General Edward Braddock .",
  "/wiki/Stephen_Sewall": "Stephen Sewall ( December 14 , 1702 - September 10 , 1760 ) was a judge in colonial Massachusetts . Born in Salem , Massachusetts , he was the son of Stephen Sewall , the clerk of court at the Salem witchcraft trials , and a nephew of Chief Justice Samuel Sewall , who presided at the witchcraft trials . He was the uncle of lawyer Jonathan Sewall and of the poet , lawyer and patriot , Jonathan Mitchell Sewall of Portsmouth , NH . Although never formally trained as a lawyer or admitted to the bar , he was appointed as Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Superior Court of Judicature , the highest court in the colony . He also served on the Massachusetts Governor 's Council , which was then the upper house of the Massachusetts General Court . He was generally respected by both friends ( the court party ) and foes ( the popular party ) of royal government . Sewall 's death in Boston in 1760 was followed by controversy . James Otis , Jr. believed that his father , James Otis , Sr. , had been promised the office of chief justice , but Governor Francis Bernard appointed Crown supporter Thomas Hutchinson instead , creating a political rift that would have important implications in the development of the American Revolution . While Sewall had expressed doubts about the legality of writs of assistance , which were controversial general search warrants , Hutchinson authorized them - over the objections of Otis - in the famous writs of assistance case of 1761 .",
  "/wiki/Thomas_Hutchinson_(governor)": "Thomas Hutchinson ( 9 September 1711 - 3 June 1780 ) was a businessman , historian , and a prominent Loyalist politician of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in the years before the American Revolution . He has been referred to as the most important figure on the loyalist side in pre-Revolutionary Massachusetts . He was a successful merchant and politician , and was active at high levels of the Massachusetts government for many years , serving as lieutenant governor and then governor from 1758 to 1774 . He was a politically polarizing figure who came to be identified by John Adams and Samuel Adams as a proponent of hated British taxes , despite his initial opposition to Parliamentary tax laws directed at the colonies . He was blamed by Lord North ( the British Prime Minister at the time ) for being a significant contributor to the tensions that led to the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War . Hutchinson 's Boston mansion was ransacked in 1765 during protests against the Stamp Act , damaging his collection of materials on early Massachusetts history . As acting governor in 1770 , he exposed himself to mob attack in the aftermath of the Boston massacre , after which he ordered the removal of troops from Boston to Castle William . Letters of his calling for abridgement of colonial rights were published in 1773 , further intensifying dislike of him in the colony . He was replaced as governor in May 1774 by General Thomas Gage , and went into exile in England , where he advised the government on how to deal with the Americans . Hutchinson had a deep interest in colonial history , collecting a large number of historical documents . He wrote a three-volume History of the Province of Massachusetts Bay whose last volume , published posthumously , covered his own period in office . Historian Bernard Bailyn wrote of Hutchinson , If there was one person in America whose actions might have altered the outcome [ of the protests and disputes preceding the American Revolutionary War ] , it was he .",

His uncompromising policies and harsh tactics in Massachusetts angered the colonists and were instrumental in the building of broad-based opposition within the province to the rule of Parliament in the events leading to the American Revolution . Appointed governor of New Jersey in 1758 , he oversaw the province 's participation in the later years of the French and Indian War , and had a generally positive relationship with its legislature . In 1760 he was given the governorship of Massachusetts , where he had a stormy relationship with the assembly . Early actions turned the colony 's populists against him , and his responses to protests against Parliament 's attempts to tax the colonies deepened divisions . After protests against the Townshend Acts in 1768 , Bernard sought British Army troops be stationed in Boston to oversee the colonists . He was recalled after the publication of letters in which he was critical of the colony . After returning to England , he continued to advise the British government on colonial matters , calling for hardline responses to ongoing difficulties in Massachusetts that culminated in the 1773 Boston Tea Party . He suffered a stroke in 1771 and died in 1779 , leaving a large family .",

Adams was a dedicated diarist and regularly corresponded with many important figures in early American history , including his wife and adviser Abigail Adams , and Thomas Jefferson . His letters and other papers serve as an important source of historical information about the era . A lawyer and political activist prior to the revolution , Adams was devoted to the right to counsel and presumption of innocence . He defied anti-British sentiment and successfully defended British soldiers against murder charges arising from the Boston Massacre . Adams was a Massachusetts delegate to the Continental Congress and became a principal leader of the Revolution . He assisted in drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and was its foremost advocate in Congress . As a diplomat in Europe , he helped negotiate the peace treaty with Great Britain and secured vital governmental loans . Adams was the primary author of the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780 , which influenced the United States ' own constitution , as did his earlier Thoughts on Government .

  "/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court": "The Supreme Court of the United States ( SCOTUS ) is the highest court in the federal judiciary of the United States . It has ultimate ( and largely discretionary ) appellate jurisdiction over all federal and state court cases that involve a point of federal law , and original jurisdiction over a narrow range of cases , specifically all Cases affecting Ambassadors , other public Ministers and Consuls , and those in which a State shall be Party . The Court holds the power of judicial review , the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the U.S. Constitution . It is also able to strike down presidential directives for violating either the Constitution or statutory law . However , it may act only within the context of a case in an area of law over which it has jurisdiction . The Court may decide cases having political overtones , but it has ruled that it does not have power to decide non-justiciable political questions . Established by Article III of the Constitution , the composition and procedures of the Supreme Court were initially established by the 1st Congress through the Judiciary Act of 1789 . As later set by the Judiciary Act of 1869 , the Court consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices . Each justice has lifetime tenure , meaning they remain on the Court until they resign , retire , die , or are removed from office . When a vacancy occurs , the president , with the advice and consent of the Senate , appoints a new justice . Each justice has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it . When in majority , the chief justice decides who writes the opinion of the court ; otherwise , the most senior justice in the majority assigns the task of writing the opinion .",

  "/wiki/John_Hancock": "John Hancock ( January 23 , 1737 [ O.S . January 12 , 1736 ] - October 8 , 1793 ) was an American merchant , statesman , and prominent Patriot of the American Revolution . He served as president of the Second Continental Congress and was the first and third Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts . He is remembered for his large and stylish signature on the United States Declaration of Independence , so much so that the term John Hancock has become a synonym in the United States for one 's signature . Before the American Revolution , Hancock was one of the wealthiest men in the Thirteen Colonies , having inherited a profitable mercantile business from his uncle . He began his political career in Boston as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Samuel Adams , an influential local politician , though the two men later became estranged . Hancock used his wealth to support the colonial cause as tensions increased between colonists and Great Britain in the 1760s . He became very popular in Massachusetts , especially after British officials seized his sloop Liberty in 1768 and charged him with smuggling . Those charges were eventually dropped ; he has often been described as a smuggler in historical accounts , but the accuracy of this characterization has been questioned . Hancock was one of Boston 's leaders during the crisis that led to the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in 1775 . He served more than two years in the Continental Congress in Philadelphia , and he was the first to sign the Declaration of Independence in his position as president of Congress .

He assisted in drafting the Massachusetts State Constitution in 1779 and served as a state senator and on the Massachusetts Governor 's Council before being elected to the inaugural United States Senate . A leading member of the Massachusetts Federalist Party , his political success delayed the decline of the Federalists in Massachusetts . A successful Northampton lawyer prior to 1774 , Strong was politically active in the rebel cause during the American Revolutionary War . He played an influential role in the development of the United States Constitution at the 1788 Philadelphia Convention , and , as a US Senator , in the passage of its 11th Amendment . He also played a leading role in the passage of the Judiciary Act of 1789 , which established the federal court system . Adept at moderating the sometimes harsh political conflict between Federalists and Democratic-Republicans and popular in Massachusetts , he navigated the state in a Federalist direction through the early years of the 19th century as the rest of the country became progressively more Republican . Although he sought to retire from politics after losing the 1807 governor 's race , the advent of the War of 1812 brought him back to the governor 's office as a committed opponent of the war . He refused United States Army requests that state militia be placed under army command , and in 1814 sought to engage Nova Scotia Governor John Coape Sherbrooke in peace talks . The state and federal government 's weak defense of Massachusetts ' northern frontier during Strong 's tenure contributed to the successful drive for Maine 's statehood , which was granted in 1820 .",

  "/wiki/Levi_Lincoln_Jr.": "Levi Lincoln Jr. ( October 25 , 1782 - May 29 , 1868 ) was an American lawyer and politician from Worcester , Massachusetts . He was the 13th Governor of Massachusetts ( 1825-1834 ) and represented the state in the U.S. Congress ( 1834-1841 ) . Lincoln 's nine-year tenure as governor is the longest consecutive service in state history ; only Michael Dukakis ( 12 years ) , John Hancock ( 11 years ) and Caleb Strong ( 10 years ) served more years , but they were not consecutive . Born to Levi Lincoln Sr. , a prominent Worcester lawyer , he studied law and entered the state legislature in 1812 as a Democratic-Republican . He supported the War of 1812 ( a minority position in Federalist-dominated Massachusetts ) and opposed the Hartford Convention . Over the next ten years his politics moderated , and he was elected governor in 1825 in a nonpartisan landslide after serving one year on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court . Lincoln oversaw significant economic development in Massachusetts during his tenure and issued the first-ever veto by a Massachusetts governor . Lincoln and Daniel Webster were leading forces in the foundation of the National Republican ( later Whig ) Party in Massachusetts , which dominated state politics until the 1850s . Lincoln was elected to Congress in 1835 , serving in the House of Representatives until 1841 , when President William Henry Harrison appointed him collector of the Port of Boston .

  "/wiki/Nathaniel_Prentice_Banks": "Nathaniel Prentice ( or Prentiss ) Banks ( January 30 , 1816 - September 1 , 1894 ) was an American politician from Massachusetts and a Union general during the Civil War . A millworker by background , Banks was prominent in local debating societies , and his oratorical skills were noted by the Democratic Party . However , his abolitionist views fitted him better for the nascent Republican Party , through which he became Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and Governor of Massachusetts in the 1850s . Always a political chameleon ( for which he was criticized by contemporaries ) , Banks was the first professional politician ( with no outside business or other interests ) to serve as Massachusetts Governor . At the outbreak of the Civil War , President Lincoln appointed Banks as one of the first 'political ' major generals , over the heads of West Point regulars , who initially resented him , but came to acknowledge his influence on the administration of the war . After suffering a series of inglorious setbacks in the Shenandoah River Valley at the hands of Stonewall Jackson , Banks replaced Benjamin Butler at New Orleans as commander of the Department of the Gulf , charged with administration of Louisiana and gaining control of the Mississippi River . But he failed to reinforce Grant at Vicksburg , and badly handled the Siege of Port Hudson , taking its surrender only after Vicksburg had fallen . He then launched the Red River Campaign , a failed attempt to occupy eastern Texas that prompted his recall . Banks was regularly criticized for the failures of his campaigns , notably in tactically important tasks including reconnaissance . Banks was also instrumental in early reconstruction efforts in Louisiana , intended by Lincoln as a model for later such activities . After the war , Banks returned to the Massachusetts political scene , serving in Congress , where he supported Manifest Destiny , influenced the Alaska Purchase legislation , and supported women 's suffrage . In his later years he adopted more liberal progressive causes , and served as a United States marshal for Massachusetts before suffering a decline in his mental faculties ."
