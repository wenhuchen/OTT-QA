  "/wiki/Uther_Pendragon": "Uther Pendragon ( /\u02c8ju\u02d0\u03b8\u0259r p\u025bn\u02c8dr\u00e6\u0261\u0259n , \u02c8u\u02d0\u03b8\u0259r/ ; Welsh : Uthyr Pendragon , Uthyr Bendragon ) , also known as King Uther , is a legendary king of sub-Roman Britain and the father of King Arthur . A few minor references to Uther appear in Old Welsh poems , but his biography was first written down by Geoffrey of Monmouth in his Historia Regum Britanniae ( History of the Kings of Britain ) , and Geoffrey 's account of the character was used in most later versions . He is a fairly ambiguous individual throughout the literature , but is described as a strong king and a defender of the people . According to Arthurian legend , Merlin magically disguises Uther to look like his enemy Gorlois , enabling Uther to sleep with Gorlois ' wife Lady Igraine . Thus Arthur , the once and future king , is an illegitimate child ( though later legend , as found in Malory , emphasises that the conception occurred after Gorlois 's death and that he was legitimated by Uther 's subsequent marriage to Igraine ) . This act of conception occurs the very night that Uther 's troops dispatch Gorlois . The theme of illegitimate conception is repeated in Arthur 's siring of Mordred by his own half-sister Morgause in the 13th century ad French prose cycles , which was invented by them ; it is Mordred who mortally wounds King Arthur in the Battle of Camlann .",
