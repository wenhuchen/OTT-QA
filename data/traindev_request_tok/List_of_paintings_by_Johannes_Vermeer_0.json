  "/wiki/Diana_and_Her_Companions": "Diana and Her Companions is a painting by Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer completed in the early to mid-1650s , now at the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague . Although the exact year is unknown , the work may be the earliest painting of the artist still extant , with some art historians placing it before Christ in the House of Martha and Mary and some after . The painting 's solemn mood is unusual for a scene depicting the goddess Diana , and the nymph washing the central figure 's feet has captured the attention of critics and historians , both for her activity and contemporary clothing . Rather than directly illustrating one of the dramatic moments in well-known episodes from myths about Diana , the scene shows a woman and her attendants quietly at her toilette . The theme of a woman in a private , reflective moment would grow stronger in Vermeer 's paintings as his career progressed . Nothing of the work 's history before the mid-19th century is known , and the painting was not widely accepted as one of Vermeer 's until the early 20th century , when its similarities with Mary and Martha were noticed . About one ninth of the painting 's width has been removed from the right side , and it was not discovered until 1999 or 2000 was that the sky in the upper right-hand corner had been added in the 19th century .",

  "/wiki/Buckingham_Palace": "Buckingham Palace ( UK : /\u02c8b\u028ck\u026a\u014b\u0259m/ ) is the London residence and administrative headquarters of the monarchy of the United Kingdom . [ a ] Located in the City of Westminster , the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality . It has been a focal point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and mourning . Originally known as Buckingham House , the building at the core of today 's palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years . It was acquired by King George III in 1761 as a private residence for Queen Charlotte and became known as The Queen 's House . During the 19th century it was enlarged , principally by architects John Nash and Edward Blore , who constructed three wings around a central courtyard . Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837 . The last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , including the East Front , which contains the well-known balcony on which the royal family traditionally congregates to greet crowds . A German bomb destroyed the palace chapel during World War II ; the Queen 's Gallery was built on the site and opened to the public in 1962 to exhibit works of art from the Royal Collection . The original early 19th-century interior designs , many of which survive , include widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis , on the advice of Sir Charles Long . King Edward VII oversaw a partial redecoration in a Belle \u00c9poque cream and gold colour scheme . Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese regency style with furniture and fittings brought from the Royal Pavilion at Brighton and from Carlton House .",
  "/wiki/England": "England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It shares land borders with Wales to the west and Scotland to the north . The Irish Sea lies west of England and the Celtic Sea to the southwest . England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south . The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain , which lies in the North Atlantic , and includes over 100 smaller islands , such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight . It is the largest country of British Isles . The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula , who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries . England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law - the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world - developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations . The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England , transforming its society into the world 's first industrialised nation . England 's terrain is chiefly low hills and plains , especially in central and southern England . However , there is upland and mountainous terrain in the north ( for example , the Lake District and Pennines ) and in the west ( for example , Dartmoor and the Shropshire Hills ) .",
  "/wiki/Woman_with_a_Lute": "Woman with a Lute , also known as Woman with a Lute Near a Window , is a painting created about 1662-1663 by Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer and now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York . The painting depicts a young woman wearing an ermine-trimmed jacket and enormous pearl earrings as she eagerly looks out a window , presumably expecting a male visitor . A musical courtship is suggested by the viola da gamba on the floor in the foreground and by the flow of songbooks across the tabletop and onto the floor , according to a web page about the work at the Metropolitan Museum of Art website . The tuning of a lute was recognized by contemporary viewers as a symbol of the virtue of temperance . The oil on canvas work is 20\u00bc inches high and 18 inches wide ( 51.4 \u00d7 45.7 cm ) . The painting 's canvas was almost certainly cut from the same bolt as that used for Lady Writing a Letter with her Maid . The work likely was painted shortly after Young Woman with a Water Pitcher , and it shares with that painting its framing of the figure within rectangular motifs . But the painting has more muted tones , reflecting a shift in that direction by Vermeer in the mid- to late 1660s . At this time , Vermeer began using shadows and soft contours to further evoke an atmosphere of intimacy . The impression of spatial recession and atmosphere is somewhat diminished by darkening with age of the objects in the foreground and by abrasion of the paint surface , mostly in the same area , according to the Metropolitan Museum of Art web page . The painting was given to the museum in 1900 by a bequest of railroad industrialist Collis P. Huntington .",

Founded after the American Revolution as the seat of government of the newly independent country , Washington was named after George Washington , the first president of the United States and a Founding Father . As the seat of the United States federal government and several international organizations , Washington is an important world political capital . The city , located on the Potomac River bordering Maryland and Virginia , is one of the most visited cities in the world , with more than 20 million tourists annually . The signing of the Residence Act on July 16 , 1790 , approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River on the country 's East Coast . The U.S. Constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress , and the District is therefore not a part of any U.S. state . The states of Maryland and Virginia each donated land to form the federal district , which included the pre-existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria . The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital . In 1846 , Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia , including the city of Alexandria ; in 1871 , it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the District . Washington had an estimated population of 702,455 as of July 2018 [ update ] , making it the 20th most populous city in the United States . Commuters from the surrounding Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city 's daytime population to more than one million during the workweek . Washington 's metropolitan area , the country 's sixth largest ( including parts of Maryland , Virginia and West Virginia ) , had a 2017 estimated population of 6.2 million residents .",
  "/wiki/A_Lady_Writing_a_Letter": "A Lady Writing a Letter ( also known as A Lady Writing ; Dutch : Schrijvend meisje ) is an oil painting attributed to 17th century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer . It is believed to have been completed around 1665 . The Lady is seen to be writing a letter and has been interrupted , so gently turns her head to see what is happening . She wears twelve pearls ( 10 on the necklace and two earrings ) . Many of the objects seen in the painting , such as the woman 's coat , the cloth on the table , and the string of pearls , also appear in other Vermeer works . This has led to speculation that he or his family members owned the objects , and even that the subjects of the paintings are his relatives . It has often been suggested that in his paintings , Vermeer sought to grant to his models that which he could not endow to his wife and family : calm and affluence . A Lady Writing a Letter was donated to the National Gallery of Art in Washington , D.C. in 1962 by Harry Waldron Havemeyer and Horace Havemeyer . In its first loan to the Norton Simon Museum , the National Gallery of Art agreed to lend the painting for exhibition at the Pasadena , California museum from November 7 , 2008 through February 9 , 2009 . In Blue Balliett 's 2004 children 's book , Chasing Vermeer , A Lady Writing is stolen on its way from the National Gallery of Art to Chicago , causing the main conflict of the story .",
