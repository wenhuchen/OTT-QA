  "/wiki/WKLT": "WKLT 97.5 Kalkaska and WKLZ-FM 98.9 Petoskey , Michigan , are Classic rock-leaning mainstream rock stations simulcasting as KLT The Rock Station . The station serves the Traverse City radio markets . The station was started by Roy Henderson in April 1979 at 97.7 , playing a CHR/Top 40 format as Kilt 98 . Due to its limited signal , the station found it difficult to compete with the high-powered WJML-FM and WKHQ , and so in 1981 the station changed format to automated country as Country 98 . The station added an AM station at 1420 in 1982 , which simulcasted the FM 's format . The AM station , WKLT , was a 500-watt daytimer . In 1982 , WKLT became the Grand Traverse region 's first AOR station , when Roy Henderson moved to Texas full-time , selling WKLT to a Pepsi-Cola distribution company based in North Dakota . ( Northern Broadcast , a division of Northern Bottling , also owns Classic Hits WFCX 92.5/94.3 The Fox and News/Talk WSRT 106.7/105.5 , formerly WKPK , 106.7 The Peak . ) The new AOR format was the first of its kind in northern Michigan and gave listeners an alternative to the Top 40 fare played on WJML and WKHQ . It was during this period that WKLT would be known to its listeners as 98 Rock . In 1991 , WKLT moved to 97.5 , boosting power to 32,000 watts and the company purchased WJML in Petoskey ( which by that time had shifted to an Adult Contemporary format in response to competition from WKHQ and WKPK ) . The company spun off WJML/1110 to local broadcaster Rick Stone ( who still owns the station with a news/talk format ) and WKLT to the Kalkaska School system , who has since shut the station down for good .",
