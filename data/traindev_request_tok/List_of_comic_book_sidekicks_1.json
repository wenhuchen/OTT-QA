He appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics , as well as in a number of movies , television shows , and video game adaptations set in the Marvel Universe . In the stories , Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker , an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker were killed in a plane crash . Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues , and accompanied him with many supporting characters , such as J.

His origin story has him acquiring spider-related abilities after a bite from a radioactive spider ; these include clinging to surfaces , shooting spider-webs from wrist-mounted devices , and detecting danger with his spider-sense . When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s , teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist . The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker , a high school student from Queens behind Spider-Man 's secret identity and with whose self-obsessions with rejection , inadequacy , and loneliness young readers could relate . While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick , unlike previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin , Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman ; he thus had to learn for himself that with great power there must also come great responsibility - a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian , the late Uncle Ben . Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series , the first and longest-lasting of which is The Amazing Spider-Man .
