  "/wiki/Asia": "Asia ( /\u02c8e\u026a\u0292\u0259 , \u02c8e\u026a\u0283\u0259/ ( listen ) ) is Earth 's largest and most populous continent , located primarily in the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres . It shares the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe and the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa . Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometres ( 17,212,000 sq mi ) , about 30% of Earth 's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth 's total surface area . The continent , which has long been home to the majority of the human population , was the site of many of the first civilizations . Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population , but also dense and large settlements , as well as vast barely populated regions . Its 4.5 billion people ( as of June 2019 [ update ] ) constitute roughly 60% of the world 's population , more than all other continents combined . In general terms , Asia is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean , on the south by the Indian Ocean , and on the north by the Arctic Ocean . The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and cultural construct , as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them . It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity . The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East-West cultural , linguistic , and ethnic differences , some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line . The most commonly accepted boundaries place Asia to the east of the Suez Canal separating it from Africa ; and to the east of the Turkish Straits , the Ural Mountains and Ural River , and to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black Seas , separating it from Europe . China and India alternated in being the largest economies in the world from 1 to 1800 CE .",
  "/wiki/Beat_'em_up": "Beat 'em up ( also known as brawler ) is a video game genre featuring hand-to-hand combat between the protagonist and an improbably large number of opponents . Traditional beat 'em ups take place in scrolling , two-dimensional ( 2D ) levels , though some later games feature more open three-dimensional ( 3D ) environments with yet larger numbers of enemies . These games are noted for their simple gameplay , a source of both critical acclaim and derision . Two-player cooperative gameplay and multiple player characters are also hallmarks of the genre . Most of these games take place in urban settings and feature crime-fighting and revenge-based plots , though some games may employ historical , science fiction or fantasy themes . The first beat 'em up was 1984 's Kung-Fu Master , with 1986 's Renegade introducing the urban settings and underworld revenge themes employed extensively by later games . The genre then saw a period of high popularity between the release of Double Dragon in 1987 , which defined the two-player cooperative mode central to classic beat 'em ups , and led to 1991 's Street Fighter II , which drew gamers towards one-on-one fighting games . Games such as Streets of Rage , Final Fight , Golden Axe and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are other classics to emerge from this period . The genre has been less popular since the emergence of 3D-based mass-market games , but still some beat 'em ups adapted the simple formula to utilize large-scale 3D environments . In recent years , the genre has seen a resurgence in Asia , with the success of South Korean online beat 'em up Dungeon Fighter Online ( 2004 ) .",

  "/wiki/Versus_fighting_game": "A fighting game is a video game genre based around close combat between a limited number of characters , in a stage in which the boundaries are fixed . The characters fight each others until they defeat their opponents or the time expires . The matches typically consist of several rounds , in an arena , with each player character having different abilities but each is relatively viable to choose . Players must master techniques such as blocking , counter-attacking , and chaining attacks together into combos . Starting in the early 1990s , most fighting games allowed the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations . The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups , which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player . The first game to feature fist fighting was Heavyweight Champ in 1976 , but it was Karate Champ which popularized one-on-one martial arts games in arcades in 1984 . The following year , Yie Ar Kung-Fu featured antagonists with differing fighting styles , while The Way of the Exploding Fist further popularized the genre on home systems . In 1987 , Street Fighter introduced hidden special attacks . In 1991 , Capcom 's highly successful Street Fighter II refined and popularized many of the conventions of the genre . The fighting game subsequently became the preeminent genre for competitive video gaming in the early to mid-1990s , particularly in arcades .
