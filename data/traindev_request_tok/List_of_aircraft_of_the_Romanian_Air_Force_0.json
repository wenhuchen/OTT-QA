  "/wiki/Airco_DH.9": "The Airco DH.9 ( from de Havilland 9 ) - also known after 1920 as the de Havilland DH.9 - was a British single-engined biplane bomber developed and deployed during the First World War . The DH.9 was a development of Airco 's earlier successful DH.4 , with which it shared many components . These were mated to an all-new fuselage and the BHP/Galloway Adriatic engine , which promised increased performance . Anticipating its usefulness , the type was ordered in very large numbers for Britain 's Royal Flying Corps ( RFC ) . Upon entering service , the DH.9 's performance was found to be unsatisfactory . The Adriatic engine was unreliable and failed to provide the expected power , which gave the DH.9 poorer performance than the aircraft it had been meant to replace . The performance deficit was blamed for the heavy losses they suffered over the Western Front . The redesigned DH.9A was fitted with a more powerful and reliable American Liberty L-12 engine which rectified the shortcomings of the original DH.9 model .",

  "/wiki/Avia_BH-25": "The Avia BH-25 was a biplane airliner built in Czechoslovakia in 1926 . Typical of airliners of its time , it seated five passengers within its fuselage , whilst the pilots sat in an open cockpit above . Of conventional configuration , it was a single-bay bi-plane of equal span and unstaggered wings , with fixed tailskid landing gear . Originally designed for a Lorraine-Dietrich engine , this was changed to a Bristol Jupiter in service . After their withdrawal from airline use in 1936 , some were used by the military for a while before finally becoming training targets .",

  "/wiki/Bristol_Blenheim": "The Bristol Blenheim is a British light bomber aircraft designed and built by the Bristol Aeroplane Company ( Bristol ) which was used extensively in the first two years and in some cases throughout the Second World War . The aircraft was developed as Type 142 , a civil airliner , in response to a challenge from Lord Rothermere to produce the fastest commercial aircraft in Europe . The Type 142 first flew in April 1935 , and the Air Ministry , impressed by its performance , ordered a modified design as the Type 142M for the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) as a bomber . Deliveries of the newly named Blenheim to RAF squadrons commenced on 10 March 1937 . A development of the Type 142M was the Type 149 which Bristol named the Bolingbroke , retrospectively changed by the Air Ministry to Blenheim Mk IV and the Type 142M to the Blenheim Mk I. Fairchild Canada built the Type 149 under licence as the Bolingbroke . Blenheims Mk I and the Mk IV were adapted as fighters by the addition of a gun pack of four Browning .303 machine guns in the bomb bay . The Mk IV was used as a long range fighter and as a maritime patrol aircraft ; both aircraft were used as bomber/gunnery trainers . The Blenheim was one of the first British aircraft with an all-metal stressed-skin construction , retractable landing gear , flaps , a powered gun turret and variable-pitch propellers . The Mk I was faster than most fighters in the late 1930s but the advance in development of monoplane fighters made all bombers more vulnerable particularly if flown in daylight , though it proved successful as a night fighter . The Blenheim was effective as a bomber but many were shot down . Both Blenheim types were used by overseas operators , being licence built in Yugoslavia and Finland .",

  "/wiki/De_Havilland_Dragon_Rapide": "During summer 1933 , the de Havilland aircraft company commenced work upon an aircraft to meet an Australian requirement , producing a four-engined faster passenger aircraft capable of seating ten passengers , the DH.86 Dragon Express . An important feature of the DH.86 was the newly developed and powerful Gipsy Six engine , a six-cylinder variant of the four cylinder Gipsy Major engine . The DH.86 would serve as the a key starting point for the later DH.89 . During late 1933 , a team at de Havilland , led by aircraft designer Arthur Ernest Hagg , began working on a new design , intended to be a faster and more comfortable successor to the earlier DH.84 Dragon . The new aircraft was , in effect , a twin-engined , scaled-down version of the four-engined DH.86 Express . It shared many common features with the earlier DH.86 Express , including its tapered wings , streamlined fairings and fuselage , as well as the same Gipsy Six engines . However , the DH.89 demonstrated none of the operational vices of the Express . On 17 April 1934 , the prototype conducted its maiden flight at Hatfield Aerodrome , Hertfordshire . Flown by senior de Havilland test pilot H.S . Broad , it was powered by a pair of 200 horsepower ( 150 kW ) Gypsy Six engines . Even prior to the prototype 's first flight , plans to proceed with serial production of DH.89 had already received the go-ahead from management . During May 1934 , airworthiness trials commenced at RAF Martlesham Heath using the prototype ; during one such flight , upon attaining a speed of roughly 175 miles per hour ( 282 km/h ) , the tip of the aircraft 's nose buckled .",

  "/wiki/Focke-Wulf_Fw_190": "The Focke-Wulf Fw 190 W\u00fcrger ( English : Shrike ) is a German single-seat , single-engine fighter aircraft designed by Kurt Tank in the late 1930s and widely used during World War II . Along with its well-known counterpart , the Messerschmitt Bf 109 , the Fw 190 became the backbone of the Luftwaffe 's Jagdwaffe ( Fighter Force ) . The twin-row BMW 801 radial engine that powered most operational versions enabled the Fw 190 to lift larger loads than the Bf 109 , allowing its use as a day fighter , fighter-bomber , ground-attack aircraft and , to a lesser degree , night fighter . The Fw 190A started flying operationally over France in August 1941 , and quickly proved superior in all but turn radius to the Royal Air Force 's main front-line fighter , the Spitfire Mk . V , particularly at low and medium altitudes . The 190 maintained superiority over Allied fighters until the introduction of the improved Spitfire Mk . IX . In November/December 1942 , the Fw 190 made its air combat debut on the Eastern Front , finding much success in fighter wings and specialised ground attack units called Schlachtgeschwader ( Battle Wings or Strike Wings ) from October 1943 onwards . The Fw 190A series ' performance decreased at high altitudes ( usually 6,000 m ( 20,000 ft ) and above ) , which reduced its effectiveness as a high-altitude interceptor . From the Fw 190 's inception , there had been ongoing efforts to address this with a turbosupercharged BMW 801 in the B model , the much longer-nosed C model with efforts to also turbocharge its chosen Daimler-Benz DB 603 inverted V12 powerplant , and the similarly long-nosed D model with the Junkers Jumo 213 . Problems with the turbocharger installations on the -B and -C subtypes meant only the D model entered service in September 1944 . These high-altitude developments eventually led to the Focke-Wulf Ta 152 , which was capable of extreme speeds at medium to high altitudes ( 755 km/h ( 408 kn ; 469 mph ) at 13,500 m ( 44,300 ft ) ) .",

  "/wiki/Glider_aircraft": "A glider is a fixed-wing aircraft that is supported in flight by the dynamic reaction of the air against its lifting surfaces , and whose free flight does not depend on an engine . Most gliders do not have an engine , although motor-gliders have small engines for extending their flight when necessary by sustaining the altitude ( normally a sailplane is on a continuously descending slope ) with some being powerful enough to take off self-launch . There is a wide variety of types differing in the construction of their wings , aerodynamic efficiency , location of the pilot , controls and intended purpose . Most exploit meteorological phenomena to maintain or gain height . Gliders are principally used for the air sports of gliding , hang gliding and paragliding . However some spacecraft have been designed to descend as gliders and in the past military gliders have been used in warfare . Some simple and familiar types of glider are toys such as the paper plane and balsa wood glider ."
