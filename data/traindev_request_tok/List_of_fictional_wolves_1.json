  "/wiki/Agoge": "The ag\u014dg\u0113 ( Greek : \u1f00\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03ae in Attic Greek , or \u1f00\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03ac , ag\u014dg\u00e1 in Doric Greek ) was the rigorous education and training program mandated for all male Spartan citizens , except for the firstborn son in the ruling houses , Eurypontid and Agiad . The training involved cultivating loyalty to the Spartan group , military training ( e.g. , pain tolerance ) , hunting , dancing , singing , and social ( communicating ) preparation . The word ag\u014dg\u0113 meant rearing in ancient Greek , but in this context generally meant leading , guidance , or training . According to folklore , ag\u014dg\u0113 was introduced by the semi-mythical Spartan law-giver Lycurgus but its origins are thought to be between the 7th and 6th centuries BC when the state trained male citizens from the ages of seven to twenty-one . The aim of the system was to produce strong and capable warriors to serve in the Spartan army . It encouraged conformity and the importance of the Spartan state over one 's personal interest and generated the future elites of Sparta . The men would become the walls of Sparta because Sparta was the only Greek city with no defensive walls after they had been demolished at the order of Lycurgus . Discipline was strict and the males were encouraged to fight amongst themselves to determine the strongest member of the group . The ag\u014dg\u0113 was prestigious throughout the Greek world , and many aristocratic families from other cities vied to send their sons to Sparta to participate in the ag\u014dg\u0113 for varying periods of time . The Spartans were very selective in which young men they would permit to enroll . Such honors were usually awarded to the pr\u00f3xenoi ( \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03be\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 ) of Sparta in other cities and to a few other families of supreme ancestry and importance .",
