  "/wiki/Ian_Browne_(cyclist)": "Ian Browne , also known as Joey Browne ( born 22 June 1931 ) is a former Australian track cyclist who along with Tony Marchant won the 2000 m tandem event at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne . Unusually tall and strongly built for a cyclist , Browne had little formal training and won his first Australian title in 1953 in the 10 mile event . Browne did not team up with Marchant until early in 1956 and they promptly won the tandem event at the national championships to earn national selection . The pair were eliminated after losing their first two races but were given a reprieve when the Soviet Union pair were hospitalised in a crash and forced to withdraw . Thereafter Marchant and Browne were unbeaten and progressed to an unlikely Olympic gold . Browne 's combination with Marchant was broken after the Olympics when the latter retired . In 1958 , Browne won the 10 mile event at the national titles and went on to win the event at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games . Browne went on to compete in the 1960 and 1964 Olympics in the tandem event , both times with new partners , but both times he was eliminated in the repechage round . In 1964 , he became the oldest ever track cyclist to represent Australia at the Olympics at the age of 33 . He won the last of his national titles at the age of 37 in 1968 in the tandem event but was overlooked for Olympic selection by Australian officials . He retired and later was involved in cycling administration .",
  "/wiki/Olympic_Games": "The modern Olympic Games or Olympics ( French : Jeux olympiques ) are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions . The Olympic Games are considered the world 's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating . The Olympic Games are held every four years , with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart . Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games ( Ancient Greek : \u1f48\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u1f08\u03b3\u1ff6\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 ) , which were held in Olympia , Greece , from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD . Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) in 1894 , leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896 . The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement , with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority . The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games . Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports , the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability , the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18 , the five Continental games ( Pan American , African , Asian , European , and Pacific ) , and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games . The Deaflympics and Special Olympics are also endorsed by the IOC . The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic , political , and technological advancements . The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism , as envisioned by Coubertin , to allowing participation of professional athletes . The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games .",

Athletes with a disability are also included as full members of their national teams , making the Commonwealth Games as the first fully inclusive international multi-sport event . It is also the world 's first multi-sport event which inducts equal number of womens and mens medal events and was implemented recently in the 2018 Commonwealth Games . With such unique features , the World Economic Forum called the event inspiring and significant . Their creation was inspired by the Inter-Empire Championships , as a part of the Festival of Empire , which were held in London , United Kingdom in 1911 . Melville Marks Robinson founded the games as the British Empire Games which were first hosted in Hamilton in 1930 . During the 20th and 21st centuries , the evolution of the games movement has resulted in several changes to the Commonwealth Games . Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Commonwealth Winter Games for snow and ice sports for the commonwealth athletes , the Commonwealth Paraplegic Games for commonwealth athletes with a disability and the Commonwealth Youth Games for commonwealth athletes aged 14 to 18 . The first edition of the winter games and paraplegic games were held in 1958 and 1962 respectively , with their last edition held in 1966 and 1974 respectively and the first youth games were held in 2000 .

A professional bodybuilder may be one who earns his or her primary income from bodybuilding . It is possible , though difficult except at the highest level , to earn a reasonable income purely from competition winnings . [ citation needed ] It is much more likely that a particular athlete will be sponsored by local companies and supplement manufacturers . Many bodybuilders use their newfound fame and knowledge to pursue business ventures such as higher-level personal training or opening their own gyms . Guest posing and public appearances also support income . In 1946 , Canadian brothers Joe and Ben Weider created the International Federation of BodyBuilders ( IFBB ) . In 1965 , Joe went on to start the Mr. Olympia - the first IFBB professional competition . Originally , Mr. Universe was known as the most prestigious and elite of competitions ; however , an individual could only win this contest twice , whereas the Olympia was created to be won as many times as possible . The IFBB and the Olympia were created as a way for elite amateur athletes to further their competitive career and earn money . In 1966 , Larry Scott received $ 1,000 for his Mr. Olympia win . In 2006 , there were over 40 IFBB professional competitions and the total prize money topped $ 1.6 million .",

  "/wiki/Basketball": "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams , most commonly of five players each , opposing one another on a rectangular court , compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball ( approximately 9.4 inches ( 24 cm ) in diameter ) through the defender 's hoop ( a basket 18 inches ( 46 cm ) in diameter mounted 10 feet ( 3.048 m ) high to a backboard at each end of the court ) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop . A field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three-point line , when it is worth three . After a foul , timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws . The team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated . Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running ( dribbling ) or by passing it to a teammate , both of which require considerable skill . On offense , players may use a variety of shots - the lay-up , the jump shot , or a dunk ; on defense , they may steal the ball from a dribbler , intercept passes , or block shots ; either offense or defense may collect a rebound , that is , a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard . It is a violation to lift or drag one 's pivot foot without dribbling the ball , to carry it , or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling . The five players on each side at a time fall into five playing positions the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach 's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) . Informally , players may play three-on-three , two-on-two , and one-on-one . Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield , Massachusetts , United States , basketball has evolved to become one of the world 's most popular and widely viewed sports . The National Basketball Association ( NBA ) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity , salaries , talent , and level of competition .

  "/wiki/Pole_vault": "Pole vaulting is a track and field event in which a person uses a long flexible pole ( which today is usually made either of fiberglass or carbon fiber ) as an aid to jump over a bar . Pole jumping competitions were known to the ancient Greeks , Cretans and Celts . It has been a full medal event at the Olympic Games since 1896 for men and since 2000 for women . It is typically classified as one of the four major jumping events in athletics , alongside the high jump , long jump and triple jump . It is unusual among track and field sports in that it requires a significant amount of specialised equipment in order to participate , even at a basic level . A number of elite pole vaulters have had backgrounds in gymnastics , including world record breakers Yelena Isinbayeva and Brian Sternberg , reflecting the similar physical attributes required for the sports . Running speed , however , may be the most dominant factor . Physical attributes such as speed , agility and strength are essential to pole vaulting effectively , but technical skill is an equally if not more important element .

Players commonly use sticks made out of wood , carbon fibre , fibre glass or a combination of carbon fibre and fibre glass in different quantities ( with the higher carbon fibre stick being more expensive and less likely to break ) to hit a round , hard , plastic hockey ball . The length of the hockey stick is based on the player 's individual height , the top of the stick usually comes to the players hip , taller players typically have taller sticks . The sticks have a round side and a flat side only the flat face of the stick is allowed to be used , if the other side is used it results in a foul . Goalies often have a different kind of stick , however they can also use an ordinary field hockey stick . The specific goal-keeping sticks have another curve at the end of the stick , this is to give them more surface area to save the ball . The uniform consists of shin guards , shoes , shorts or a skirt , a mouthguard and a jersey . Today , the game is played globally , mainly in parts of Western Europe , South Asia , Southern Africa , Australia , New Zealand , Argentina , and parts of the United States ( primarily New England and the Mid-Atlantic states ) .

  "/wiki/Rowing_(sport)": "Rowing , sometimes referred to as crew in the United States , is a sport whose origins reach back to Ancient Egyptian times . It involves propelling a boat ( racing shell ) on water using oars . By pushing against the water with an oar , a force is generated to move the boat . The sport can be either recreational for enjoyment or fitness , or competitive , when athletes race against each other in boats . There are a number of different boat classes in which athletes compete , ranging from an individual shell ( called a single scull ) to an eight-person shell with a coxswain ( called a coxed eight ) . Modern rowing as a competitive sport can be traced to the early 17th century when races ( regattas ) were held between professional watermen on the River Thames in London , United Kingdom . Often prizes were offered by the London Guilds and Livery Companies . Amateur competition began towards the end of the 18th century with the arrival of boat clubs at the British public schools of Eton College , Shrewsbury School , Durham School , and Westminster School . Similarly , clubs were formed at the University of Oxford , with a race held between Brasenose College and Jesus College in 1815 . At the University of Cambridge the first recorded races were in 1827 . Public rowing clubs were beginning at the same time ; in England Leander Club was founded in 1818 , in Germany Der Hamburger und Germania Ruder Club was founded in 1836 and in the United States Narragansett Boat Club was founded in 1838 and Detroit Boat Club was founded in 1839 .

The NFL 's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December , with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week . Following the conclusion of the regular season , six teams from each conference ( four division winners and two wild card teams ) advance to the playoffs , a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl , which is usually held on the first Sunday in February and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC . The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season . After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings , a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966 . Following an agreement to merge the NFL with the American Football League ( AFL ) , the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 to determine a champion between the best teams from the two leagues and has remained as the final game of each NFL season since the merger was completed in 1970 . Today , the NFL has the highest average attendance ( 67,591 ) of any professional sports league in the world and is the most popular sports league in the United States .

The franchise has made it to the Super Bowl eight times , tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Denver Broncos for second most Super Bowl appearances in history , just behind the New England Patriots record eleven Super Bowl appearances . This has also corresponded to eight NFC championships , most in the NFC . The Cowboys have won five of those Super Bowl appearances , tying them with their NFC rivals , the San Francisco 49ers ; both are second to Pittsburgh 's and New England 's record six Super Bowl championships . The Cowboys are the only NFL team to record 20 straight winning seasons ( 1966-85 ) , in which they missed the playoffs only twice ( 1974 and 1984 ) .

  "/wiki/Race_walker": "Racewalking , or race walking , is a long-distance discipline within the sport of athletics . Although it is a foot race , it is different from running in that one foot must appear to be in contact with the ground at all times . This is assessed by race judges . Typically held on either roads or on running tracks , common distances range from 3,000 metres ( 1.9 mi ) up to 100 kilometres ( 62.1 mi ) . There are two racewalking distances contested at the Summer Olympics : the 20 kilometres race walk ( men and women ) and 50 kilometres race walk ( men only ) . Both are held as road events . The biennial World Athletics Championships also features these three events , in addition to a 50 km walk for women . The IAAF World Race Walking Cup , first held in 1961 , is a stand-alone global competition for the discipline and it has 10 kilometres race walks for junior athletes , in addition to the Olympic-standard events . The IAAF World Indoor Championships featured 5000 m and 3000 m race walk variations , but these were discontinued after 1993 . Top level athletics championships and games typically feature 20 km racewalking events . The sport emerged from a British culture of long-distance competitive walking known as pedestrianism , which began to develop the ruleset that is the basis of the modern discipline around the mid-19th century . Since the mid-20th century onwards , Russian and Chinese athletes have been among the most successful on the global stage , with Europe and parts of Latin America producing most of the remaining top level walkers .",

Founded in 1860 , it was originally held annually at Prestwick Golf Club , Scotland , before evolving to being rotated between a select group of coastal links golf courses in the United Kingdom , under the authority of The R & A . The Open is one of the four major golf tournaments , the others being the Masters Tournament , the PGA Championship and the U.S. Open . Since the PGA Championship moved to May in 2019 , the Open has been chronologically the fourth and final major tournament of the year . The tournament traditionally takes place over four days in summer , starting the day before the third Friday in July . It is called the Open , because it is in theory open to all , i.e . professional and amateur golfers . In practice , the current event is a professional tournament in which a small number of the world 's leading amateurs also play , by invitation or qualification . The success of the tournament has led to many other open golf tournaments to be introduced around the world . The current champion is Shane Lowry , who won the 148th Open at Royal Portrush Golf Club in Northern Ireland with a score of 269 . It was also held at Portrush in 1951 , the first occasion that it had not been held in Scotland or England .",

  "/wiki/Jews": "Jews or Jewish people are an ethnoreligious group and a nation , originating from the Israelites and Hebrews of historical Israel and Judah . Jewish ethnicity , nationhood , and religion are strongly interrelated , as Judaism is the ethnic religion of the Jewish people , while its observance varies from strict observance to complete nonobservance . Jews originated as an ethnic and religious group in the Middle East during the second millennium BCE , in the part of the Levant known as the Land of Israel . The Merneptah Stele appears to confirm the existence of a people of Israel somewhere in Canaan as far back as the 13th century BCE ( Late Bronze Age ) . The Israelites , as an outgrowth of the Canaanite population , consolidated their hold with the emergence of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah . Some consider that these Canaanite sedentary Israelites melded with incoming nomadic groups known as 'Hebrews ' . Though few sources mention the exilic periods in detail , the experience of diaspora life , from the Ancient Egyptian rule over the Levant , to Assyrian captivity and exile , to Babylonian captivity and exile , to Seleucid Imperial rule , to the Roman occupation and exile , and the historical relations between Jews and their homeland thereafter , became a major feature of Jewish history , identity and memory . Prior to World War II , the worldwide Jewish population reached a peak of 16.7 million , representing around 0.7% of the world population at that time . Approximately 6 million Jews were systematically murdered during the Holocaust . Since then the population has slowly risen again , and as of 2018 [ update ] was estimated at 14.6-17.8 million by the Berman Jewish DataBank , less than 0.2% of the total world population . [ note 1 ] The modern State of Israel is the only country where Jews form a majority of the population . It defines itself as a Jewish and democratic state in the Basic Laws , Human Dignity and Liberty in particular , which is based on the Declaration of Independence ."
