Other iconic games from this era include Pac-Man , Defender , Galaga , Donkey Kong , and Centipede .",

David Ramsey , writing for the Oxford American in 2006 , described Mitchell as probably the greatest arcade video game player of all time . Twin Galaxies and Guinness World Records recognized Mitchell as the holder of several records on classic games , but in 2018 Twin Galaxies determined that two of Mitchell 's previously accepted scores for Donkey Kong were invalid because they were not from an original Donkey Kong arcade circuit board . As a result , Twin Galaxies and Guinness World Records vacated all of Mitchell 's previous scores and banned him from submitting future scores . Mitchell has appeared in several documentaries on competitive gaming and retrogaming , including Chasing Ghosts : Beyond the Arcade ( 2007 ) , The King of Arcades ( 2014 ) , and Man vs Snake : The Long and Twisted Tale of Nibbler ( 2015 ) . The King of Kong : A Fistful of Quarters ( 2007 ) follows his attempts to maintain his high score on Donkey Kong after it was threatened by newcomer Steve Wiebe . A tape that Mitchell gave Twin Galaxies during the documentary 's filming proved instrumental in the 2018 investigation into Mitchell 's scores , with the team that led the investigation citing the DVD extras as crucial evidence . Mitchell owns the Rickey 's World Famous Restaurant chain based in Hollywood , Florida , and sells Rickey 's World Famous Sauces .",

Hiroshi Yamauchi , Nintendo 's president at the time , assigned the project to a first-time video game designer named Shigeru Miyamoto . Drawing from a wide range of inspirations , including Popeye , Beauty and the Beast , and King Kong , Miyamoto developed the scenario and designed the game alongside Nintendo 's chief engineer , Gunpei Yokoi . The two men broke new ground by using graphics as a means of characterization , including cutscenes to advance the game 's plot and integrating multiple stages into the gameplay . Although Nintendo 's American staff was initially apprehensive , Donkey Kong succeeded commercially and critically in North America and Japan . Nintendo licensed the game to Coleco , who developed home console versions for numerous platforms . Other companies cloned Nintendo 's hit and avoided royalties altogether .",

The game is designed to have the player experience the low and high moments of this period in the style of a point-and-click adventure game , using the medium 's interactivity and immersion to relate the tale in ways that a film can not .

Alongside the game , a documentary , Thank You for Playing , documenting both the last few years of Joel 's life and the development of the game , was aired in 2016 . That Dragon , Cancer was initially aimed for release as a time-limited exclusive for the Ouya , whose makers helped to fund the game 's development . With expanded funding and a larger scope to the game , the developers engaged in a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter , in association with Ouya , to secure additional funds to complete the game and assuring simultaneous release on other platforms including Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X . The game was released on January 12 , 2016 for these systems , on what would have been Joel 's seventh birthday . An iOS version was released in October 2016 . The game was praised for being a raw autobiographical experience from the parents ' view , making the player deal with the difficult emotions and the strength of the Greens ' faith ."
