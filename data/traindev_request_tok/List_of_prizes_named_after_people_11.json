  "/wiki/American_football": "American football , referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron , [ nb 1 ] is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end . The offense , the team with possession of the oval-shaped football , attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it , while the defense , the team without possession of the ball , aims to stop the offense 's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves . The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays ; if they fail , they turn over the football to the defense , but if they succeed , they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive . Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins . American football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of soccer and rugby . The first American football match was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the Father of American Football , established the snap , the line of scrimmage , eleven-player teams , and the concept of downs . Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game ( although their rules were developed independently from that of Camp 's ) . Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football . The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football .",

Originally known as the Victorian Football League ( VFL ) , it was founded in 1896 as a breakaway competition from the Victorian Football Association ( VFA ) , with its inaugural season commencing the following year . The VFL , aiming to become a national competition , began expanding beyond Victoria to other Australian states in the 1980s , and changed its name to the AFL in 1990 . The league currently consists of 18 teams spread over five of Australia 's six states ( Tasmania being the exception ) . Matches have been played in all states and mainland territories of Australia , as well as in New Zealand and China to promote the sport abroad .

  "/wiki/Minor_premiership": "A minor premiership is the name of the title given to the team which finishes a sporting competition first in the league standings after the regular season but prior to commencement of the playoffs in several Australian sports leagues . The etymology of the term was based on terminology in Australia from the end of the 19th century , where the regular season was referred to as the minor rounds , and the playoffs or finals were referred to as the major rounds ( this terminology is still used in South Australia , but has fallen into disuse in other parts of the country ) . Emerging from this terminology came the minor premiership , for the top-ranked team in the minor rounds , and the major premiership , often shortened simply to premiership , for the winner of the finals series . The term was important in the early finals systems of the Victorian Football League , an Australian rules football league , where the minor premier had the right to a challenge match for the major premiership if it were eliminated at any stage during the finals . The term is used widely throughout Australian sports , and there is often a separate trophy presented for it . The National Rugby League awards the J. J. Giltinan Shield , the Australian Ice Hockey League awards the H. Newman Reid Trophy and the Australian Football League has ( since 1991 ) awarded the Dr Wm . C. McClelland Trophy . The National Basketball League recognises the minor premiers but no official trophy or award is given . Australia 's premier association football competition , the A-League , officially refers to the minor premiership as the premiership , and the major premiership as the championship , which is more common with other association football competitions , but minor premiership is still used colloquially in the sports media even though it is incorrect terminology with regard to the A-League . Although the concept of a minor premiership exists in North America , and a separate award is often presented for the best record in the regular season , the term minor premiership is not used . The Presidents ' Trophy is awarded by the National Hockey League to the team which finishes first in the standings at the end of the season , as are the Supporters ' Shield in Major League Soccer and the NWSL Shield in the National Women 's Soccer League .",

  "/wiki/Tight_end": "The tight end ( TE ) is a position in American football , arena football , and formerly Canadian football , on the offense . The tight end is often seen as a hybrid position with the characteristics and roles of both an offensive lineman and a wide receiver . Like offensive linemen , they are usually lined up on the offensive line and are large enough to be effective blockers . On the other hand , unlike offensive linemen , they are eligible receivers adept enough to warrant a defense 's attention when running pass patterns . Because of the hybrid nature of the position , the tight end 's role in any given offense depends on the tactical preferences and philosophy of the head coach . In some systems , the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman , rarely going out for passes . Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver , frequently taking advantage of the tight end 's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary . Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking on running plays while using a tight end with better pass-catching skills in obvious passing situations . Offensive formations may have as few as zero or as many as three tight ends at one time .",
