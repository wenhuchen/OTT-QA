  "/wiki/British_nuclear_tests_at_Maralinga": "British nuclear tests at Maralinga were conducted between 1956 and 1963 at the Maralinga site , part of the Woomera Prohibited Area in South Australia about 800 kilometres ( 500 mi ) north west of Adelaide . A total of seven nuclear tests were performed , with approximate yields ranging from 1 to 27 kilotonnes of TNT ( 4 to 100 TJ ) . Two major test series were conducted at the Maralinga site : Operation Buffalo in 1956 and Operation Antler the following year . Operation Buffalo consisted of four tests ; One Tree ( 12.9 kilotonnes of TNT ( 54 TJ ) ) and Breakaway ( 10.8 kilotonnes of TNT ( 45 TJ ) ) were detonated on towers , Marcoo ( 1.4 kilotonnes of TNT ( 5.9 TJ ) ) at ground level , and the Kite ( 2.9 kilotonnes of TNT ( 12 TJ ) ) was released by a Royal Air Force ( RAF ) Vickers Valiant bomber from a height of 11,000 metres ( 35,000 ft ) . This was the first drop of a British nuclear weapon from an aircraft . Operation Buffalo was followed by Operation Antler in 1957 , which tested new , light-weight nuclear weapons . Three tests were conducted in this series : Tadje ( 0.93 kilotonnes of TNT ( 3.9 TJ ) , Biak 5.67 kilotonnes of TNT ( 23.7 TJ ) and Taranak 26.6 kilotonnes of TNT ( 111 TJ ) . The first two were conducted from towers , while the last was suspended from balloons . Tadje used cobalt pellets as a tracer for determining yield , resulting in rumours that Britain was developing a cobalt bomb . Between 1956 and 1963 , the Maralinga site was also used for minor trials , tests of nuclear weapons components not involving nuclear explosions . Kittens were trials of neutron initiators ; Rats and Tims measured how the fissile core of a nuclear weapon was compressed by the high explosive shock wave ; and Vixens investigated the effects of fire or non-nuclear explosions on atomic weapons . Ultimately , the minor trials generated more contamination than the major tests .",
  "/wiki/Nuclear_testing": "Nuclear weapons tests are experiments carried out to determine the effectiveness , yield , and explosive capability of nuclear weapons . Testing nuclear weapons offers practical information about how the weapons function , as well as how detonations are affected by different conditions ; and how personnel , structures , and equipment are affected when subjected to nuclear explosions . However , nuclear testing has often been used as an indicator of scientific and military strength , and many tests have been overtly political in their intention ; most nuclear weapons states publicly declared their nuclear status by means of a nuclear test . The first nuclear device was detonated as a test by the United States at the Trinity site on July 16 , 1945 , with a yield approximately equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT . The first thermonuclear weapon technology test of an engineered device , codenamed Ivy Mike , was tested at the Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands on November 1 , 1952 ( local date ) , also by the United States . The largest nuclear weapon ever tested was the Tsar Bomba of the Soviet Union at Novaya Zemlya on October 30 , 1961 , with the largest yield ever seen , an estimated 50-58 megatons . In 1963 , three ( UK , US , Soviet Union ) of the four nuclear states and many non-nuclear states signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty , pledging to refrain from testing nuclear weapons in the atmosphere , underwater , or in outer space . The treaty permitted underground nuclear testing . France continued atmospheric testing until 1974 , and China continued until 1980 . Neither has signed the treaty . Underground tests in the United States continued until 1992 ( its last nuclear test ) , the Soviet Union until 1990 , the United Kingdom until 1991 , and both China and France until 1996 . In signing the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 1996 , these states have pledged to discontinue all nuclear testing ; the treaty has not yet entered into force because of failure to be ratified by eight countries .",
  "/wiki/South_Australia": "South Australia ( abbreviated as SA ) is a state in the southern central part of Australia . It covers some of the most arid parts of the country . With a total land area of 983,482 square kilometres ( 379,725 sq mi ) , it is the fourth-largest of Australia 's states and territories by area , and fifth largest by population . It has a total of 1.7 million people , and its population is the second most highly centralised in Australia , after Western Australia , with more than 77 percent of South Australians living in the capital , Adelaide , or its environs . Other population centres in the state are relatively small ; Mount Gambier , the second largest centre , has a population of 28,684 . South Australia shares borders with all of the other mainland states , and with the Northern Territory ; it is bordered to the west by Western Australia , to the north by the Northern Territory , to the north-east by Queensland , to the east by New South Wales , to the south-east by Victoria , and to the south by the Great Australian Bight . The state comprises less than 8 percent of the Australian population and ranks fifth in population among the six states and two territories . The majority of its people reside in greater Metropolitan Adelaide . Most of the remainder are settled in fertile areas along the south-eastern coast and River Murray . The state 's colonial origins are unique in Australia as a freely settled , planned British province , rather than as a convict settlement . Colonial government commenced on 28 December 1836 , when the members of the council were sworn in near the Old Gum Tree .

  "/wiki/Radioactive_contamination": "Radioactive contamination , also called radiological contamination , is the deposition of , or presence of radioactive substances on surfaces or within solids , liquids or gases ( including the human body ) , where their presence is unintended or undesirable ( from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) definition ) . Such contamination presents a hazard because of the radioactive decay of the contaminants , which produces such harmful effects as ionising radiation ( namely \u03b1 , \u03b2 , and \u03b3 rays ) and free neutrons . The degree of hazard is determined by the concentration of the contaminants , the energy of the radiation being emitted , the type of radiation , and the proximity of the contamination to organs of the body . It is important to be clear that the contamination gives rise to the radiation hazard , and the terms radiation and contamination are not interchangeable . The sources of radioactive pollution can be classified into two groups : natural and man made . Following an atmospheric nuclear weapon discharge or a nuclear reactor containment beach , the air , soil , people , plants , and animals in the vicinity will become contaminated by nuclear fuel and fission products . A spilled vial of radioactive material like uranyl nitrate may contaminate the floor and any rags used to wipe up the spill . Cases of widespread radioactive contamination include the Bikini Atoll , the Rocky Flats Plant in Colorado , the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster , the Chernobyl disaster , and the area around the Mayak facility in Russia .",
  "/wiki/Uranium_mining_in_Australia": "Radioactive ores were first extracted in South Australia at Radium Hill in 1906 and Mount Painter in 1911 . 2,000 tons of ore were treated to recover radium for medical use . Several hundred kilograms of uranium were also produced for use in ceramic glazes . In 2017 , of the world 's estimated uranium resources ( 6,142,600 tonnes ) , 30% were in Australia ( 1,673,000 tonnes ) , ahead of the second largest , Kazakhstan ( 14% or 842,200 tonnes ) . In terms of production , Canada is the largest supplier , followed by Kazakhstan and Australia . Australia exported 64,488 tonnes ( 140 million pounds ) of uranium in the ten years to 2017 . Following the Japanese Fukushima nuclear disaster in early 2011 , many countries scaled back their nuclear power production , with some setting deadlines for a complete shutdown of all nuclear power reactors , with a resultant impact on demand for uranium . As of 2013 uranium prices have been very low . New mine developments have received State government approval in Western Australia and Queensland , although it is unlikely that new projects will enter active development until the uranium market price improves . For several decades uranium mining has been a major part of the Australian political discussion , with opposition groups citing the wide ranging environmental impacts , indigenous land access and nuclear proliferation as reasons for ceasing or restricting the industry . The debate has resulted in limitations on mining and export activities , with Federal and State governments occasionally backflipping on public policy . As of 2017 , there were three operational uranium mine sites : Olympic Dam ( BHP ) , Ranger ( ERA ) , and Beverley Four Mile ( Heathgate Resources ) .",
  "/wiki/Uranium_mining": "Uranium mining is the process of extraction of uranium ore from the ground . The worldwide production of uranium in 2015 amounted to 60,496 tonnes . Kazakhstan , Canada , and Australia are the top three producers and together account for 70% of world uranium production . Other important uranium producing countries in excess of 1,000 tons per year are Niger , Russia , Namibia , Uzbekistan , China , the United States and Ukraine . Uranium from mining is used almost entirely as fuel for nuclear power plants . Uranium ores are normally processed by grinding the ore materials to a uniform particle size and then treating the ore to extract the uranium by chemical leaching . The milling process commonly yields dry powder-form material consisting of natural uranium , yellowcake , which is sold on the uranium market as U3O8 .",
  "/wiki/Radioactive": "Radioactive decay ( also known as nuclear decay , radioactivity , radioactive disintegration or nuclear disintegration ) is the process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by radiation . A material containing unstable nuclei is considered radioactive . Three of the most common types of decay are alpha decay , beta decay , and gamma decay , all of which involve emitting one or more particles or photons . Radioactive decay is a stochastic ( i.e . random ) process at the level of single atoms . According to quantum theory , it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay , regardless of how long the atom has existed . However , for a significant number of identical atoms , the overall decay rate can be expressed as a decay constant or as half-life . The half-lives of radioactive atoms have a huge range ; from nearly instantaneous to far longer than the age of the universe . The decaying nucleus is called the parent radionuclide ( or parent radioisotope [ note 1 ] ) , and the process produces at least one daughter nuclide . Except for gamma decay or internal conversion from a nuclear excited state , the decay is a nuclear transmutation resulting in a daughter containing a different number of protons or neutrons ( or both ) . When the number of protons changes , an atom of a different chemical element is created .",
  "/wiki/Ranger_mine": "The Ranger Uranium Mine is a uranium mine in the Northern Territory of Australia . It is surrounded by , but separate from Kakadu National Park , 230 km east of Darwin . The orebody was discovered in late 1969 , and the mine commenced operation in 1980 , reaching full production of uranium oxide in 1981 . It is operated by Energy Resources of Australia , a 68% subsidiary of Rio Tinto Group . Uranium mined at Ranger is sold for use in nuclear power stations in Asia , Europe and North America . The original orebody was completely mined out by the end of 1995 , although some ore remains stockpiled . A second orebody ( Ranger 3 ) began mining in 1997 . Both have been open-pit mines . Open cut mining finished at Ranger in late 2012 and the mine is now processing stockpiled ore. As of 2013 , the ageing Ranger mine has been incurring financial losses as a result of the continuing market slump which has followed the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster .

  "/wiki/Franklin_Dam": "The Franklin Dam or Gordon-below-Franklin Dam project was a proposed dam on the Gordon River in Tasmania , Australia , that was never constructed . The movement that eventually led to the project 's cancellation became one of the most significant environmental campaigns in Australian history . The dam was proposed for the purpose of generating hydroelectricity . The resulting new electricity generation capacity would have been 180 megawatts ( 240,000 hp ) . The proposed construction would have subsequently impacted upon the environmentally sensitive Franklin River , which joins the Gordon nearby . During the campaign against the dam , both areas were listed on the UNESCO World Heritage Area register . The campaign that followed led to the consolidation of the small green movement that had been born out of the non-violent protest [ verification needed ] campaign against the building of three dams on Lake Pedder in the late 1960s and early 1970s . Over the five years between the announcement of the dam proposal in 1978 and the axing of the plans in 1983 , there was vigorous debate between the pro- and anti-dam lobbies , with large protests from both sides . In December 1982 , the dam site was occupied by protesters , leading to widespread arrests and greater publicity . The dispute became a federal issue the following March , when a campaign in the national print media , assisted by the pictures of photographer Peter Dombrovskis , helped bring down the government of Malcolm Fraser at the 1983 election . The new government , under Bob Hawke , had promised to stop the dam from being built . A legal battle between the federal government and Tasmanian Government followed , resulting in a landmark High Court ruling in the federal government 's favour .",
  "/wiki/Damming": "A dam is a barrier that stops or restricts the flow of water or underground streams . Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for activities such as irrigation , human consumption , industrial use , aquaculture , and navigability . Hydropower is often used in conjunction with dams to generate electricity . A dam can also be used to collect water or for storage of water which can be evenly distributed between locations . Dams generally serve the primary purpose of retaining water , while other structures such as floodgates or levees ( also known as dikes ) are used to manage or prevent water flow into specific land regions . The earliest known dam is the Jawa Dam in Jordan , dating to 3,000 BC . The word dam can be traced back to Middle English , and before that , from Middle Dutch , as seen in the names of many old cities . The first known appearance of dam occurs in 1165 . However , there is one village , Obdam , that is already mentioned in 1120 . The word seems to be related to the Greek word taphos , meaning grave or grave hill . [ citation needed ] So the word should be understood as dike from dug out earth . The names of more than 40 places ( with minor changes ) from the Middle Dutch era ( 1150-1500 CE ) such as Amsterdam ( founded as 'Amstelredam ' in the late 12th century ) and Rotterdam , also bear testimony to the use of the word in Middle Dutch at that time .",

The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania , the 26th-largest island in the world , and the surrounding 334 islands . The state has a population of around 533,308 as of March 2019 [ update ] . Just over forty percent of the population resides in the Greater Hobart precinct , which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city , Hobart . Tasmania 's area is 68,401 km2 ( 26,410 sq mi ) , of which the main island covers 64,519 km2 ( 24,911 sq mi ) . It is promoted as a natural state , and protected areas of Tasmania cover about 42% of its land area , which includes national parks and World Heritage Sites . Tasmania was the founding place of the first environmental political party in the world . The island is believed to have been occupied by indigenous peoples for 30,000 years before British colonisation . It is thought Aboriginal Tasmanians were separated from the mainland Aboriginal groups about 10,000 years ago when the sea rose to form Bass Strait . The Aboriginal population is estimated to have been between 3,000 and 7,000 at the time of colonisation , but was almost wiped out within 30 years by a combination of violent guerrilla conflict with settlers known as the Black War , intertribal conflict , and from the late 1820s , the spread of infectious diseases to which they had no immunity . The conflict , which peaked between 1825 and 1831 , and led to more than three years of martial law , cost the lives of almost 1,100 Aboriginals and settlers .",
  "/wiki/Australian_Greens": "The Australian Greens , commonly known as The Greens , are a green political party in Australia . As of the 2019 federal election , the Greens are currently the third largest political party in Australia by vote . The leader of the party is Adam Bandt , and the party 's co-deputy leaders are Larissa Waters and Nick McKim . The party was formed in 1992 and is a confederation of eight state and territorial parties . The party cites four core values : ecological sustainability , social justice , grassroots democracy and peace and non-violence . Party constituencies can be traced to various origins - notably the early environmental movement in Australia and the formation of the United Tasmania Group ( UTG ) , one of the first green parties in the world , but also the nuclear disarmament movement in Western Australia and sections of the industrial left in New South Wales . Co-ordination between environmentalist groups occurred in the 1980s with various significant protests . Key people involved in these campaigns included Bob Brown and Christine Milne who went on to contest and win seats in the Tasmanian Parliament and eventually form the Tasmanian Greens ; both Brown and Milne subsequently became leaders of the federal party . The Australian Greens ' policies cover a wide range of issues . Most notably , the party favours environmentalism , including expansion of recycling facilities ; phasing out single-use plastics ; conservation efforts ; better water management ; and addressing species extinction , habitat loss and deforestation in Australia . The Greens strongly support efforts to address climate change based on scientific evidence , by transitioning away from the burning of fossil fuels to renewable energy production in the next decade , as well as reintroducing a carbon price . The party supports lowering household electricity prices through the creation of a publicly-owned renewable energy provider , and building thousands of new jobs in renewable energy generation .",

  "/wiki/Logging": "Logging is the cutting , skidding , on-site processing , and loading of trees or logs onto trucks or skeleton cars . Logging is the process of cutting trees , processing them , and moving them to a location for transport . It is the beginning of a supply chain that provides raw material for many products societies worldwide use for housing , construction , energy , and consumer paper products . Logging systems are also used to manage forests , reduce the risk of wildfires , and restore ecosystem functions . In forestry , the term logging is sometimes used narrowly to describe the logistics of moving wood from the stump to somewhere outside the forest , usually a sawmill or a lumber yard . In common usage , however , the term may cover a range of forestry or silviculture activities . Illegal logging refers to what in forestry might be called timber theft by the timber mafia . It can also refer to the harvesting , transportation , purchase , or sale of timber in violation of laws . The harvesting procedure itself may be illegal , including the use of corrupt means to gain access to forests ; extraction without permission or from a protected area ; the cutting of protected species ; or the extraction of timber in excess of agreed limits . Clearcut logging is not necessarily considered a type of logging but a harvesting or silviculture method and is simply called clearcutting or block cutting . In the forest products industry logging companies may be referred to as logging contractors , with the smaller , non-union crews referred to as gyppo loggers . Cutting trees with the highest value and leaving those with lower value , often diseased or malformed trees , is referred to as high grading .",
  "/wiki/Victoria,_Australia": "Victoria ( abbreviated as Vic ) is a state in south-eastern Australia . Victoria is Australia 's smallest mainland state and its second-most populous state ( after New South Wales ) , making it the most densely populated state . Most of its population lives concentrated in the area surrounding Port Phillip Bay , which includes the metropolitan area of its state capital and largest city , Melbourne , Australia 's second-largest city . Victoria is bordered by Bass Strait and Tasmania to the south , [ note 1 ] New South Wales to the north , the Tasman Sea ( a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean ) to the east , and South Australia to the west . The area that is now known as Victoria is the home of many Aboriginal people groups , including the Boon wurrung , the Bratauolung , the Djadjawurrung , the Gunai/Kurnai , the Gunditjmara , the Taungurong , the Wathaurong , the Wurundjeri , and the Yorta Yorta . There were more than 30 Aboriginal languages spoken in the area prior to the European settlement of Australia . The Kulin nation is an alliance of five Aboriginal nations which makes up much of the central part of the state . With Great Britain having claimed the half of the Australian continent that is east of the 135th meridian east in 1788 , Victoria formed part of the wider colony of New South Wales . The first European settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay , and much of what is now Victoria was included in 1836 in the Port Phillip District , an administrative division of New South Wales . Named in honour of Queen Victoria , who signed the division 's separation from New South Wales , the colony was officially established in 1851 and achieved self government in 1855 . The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony , and by the time of the Federation of Australia in 1901 , Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in Australasia . Melbourne served as federal capital of Australia until the construction of Canberra in 1927 , with the Federal Parliament meeting in Melbourne 's Parliament House and all principal offices of the federal government being based in Melbourne .",

  "/wiki/Deforestation": "Deforestation , clearance , clearcutting or clearing is the removal of a forest or stand of trees from land which is then converted to a non-forest use . Deforestation can involve conversion of forest land to farms , ranches , or urban use . The most concentrated deforestation occurs in tropical rainforests . About 31% of Earth 's land surface is covered by forests . Deforestation has many causes : trees can be cut down to be used for building or sold as fuel ( sometimes in the form of charcoal or timber ) , while cleared land can be used as pasture for livestock and plantation . Disregard of ascribed value , lax forest management , and deficient environmental laws are some of the factors that lead to large-scale deforestation . In many countries , deforestation - both naturally occurring and human-induced - is an ongoing issue . Between 2000 and 2012 , 2.3 million square kilometres ( 890,000 sq mi ) of forests around the world were cut down . As of 2005 , net deforestation rates had ceased to increase in countries with a per capita GDP of at least US $ 4,600 . The removal of trees without sufficient reforestation has resulted in habitat damage , biodiversity loss , and aridity . Deforestation causes extinction , changes to climatic conditions , desertification , and displacement of populations , as observed by current conditions and in the past through the fossil record . Deforestation also has adverse impacts on biosequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide , increasing negative feedback cycles contributing to global warming .",

  "/wiki/Wonthaggi_desalination_plant": "The Victorian Desalination Plant ( also referred to as the Victorian Desalination Project or Wonthaggi desalination plant ) is a water desalination plant in Dalyston , on the Bass Coast in southern Victoria , Australia . The project was announced by Premier Steve Bracks in June 2007 , at the height of the crippling millennium drought when Melbourne 's water storage levels dropped to 28.4% , a drop of more than 20% from the previous year . Increased winter-spring rains after mid-2007 took water storage levels above 40% , but it was not until 2011 that storages returned to pre-2006 levels . The plant was completed in December 2012 , and was the largest addition to Melbourne 's water system since the Thomson River Dam was completed in 1983 . However , at the time , Melbourne 's reservoirs were at 81% capacity , and the plant was immediately put into standby mode . The first water released for public use was in March 2017 via Cardinia Reservoir . As a rainfall-independent source of water the desalination plant complements Victoria 's existing drainage basins , being a useful resource in times of drought . It is a controversial part of Victoria 's water system , with ongoing costs of $ 608 million a year , equivalent to .16% of Melbourne 's FY2019 GDP . Construction commenced in mid-2009 . While the project will supply water for Melbourne , it is being managed by the Department of Sustainability & Environment ( DSE ) as a public-private partnership ( PPP ) . DSE awarded the tender for design , build and operation to another company that will in turn supply the water to Melbourne Water , that makes payments to the plant owners and operators , Aquasure ( Thiess Contractors/Suez ) . Melbourne Water pays the owner of the plant , even if no water is ordered , $ 608 million a year .",
  "/wiki/Desalination": "Desalination is a process that takes away mineral components from saline water . More generally , desalination refers to the removal of salts and minerals from a target substance , as in soil desalination , which is an issue for agriculture . Saltwater is desalinated to produce water suitable for human consumption or irrigation . The by-product of the desalination process is brine . Desalination is used on many seagoing ships and submarines . Most of the modern interest in desalination is focused on cost-effective provision of fresh water for human use . Along with recycled wastewater , it is one of the few rainfall-independent water sources . Due to its energy consumption , desalinating sea water is generally more costly than fresh water from rivers or groundwater , water recycling and water conservation . However , these alternatives are not always available and depletion of reserves is a critical problem worldwide . Desalination processes are usually driven by either thermal ( in the case of distillation ) or electrical ( e.g. , photovoltaic or wind power ) as the primary energy types . Currently , approximately 1% of the world 's population is dependent on desalinated water to meet daily needs , but the UN expects that 14% of the world 's population will encounter water scarcity by 2025 . Desalination is particularly relevant in dry countries such as Australia , which traditionally have relied on collecting rainfall behind dams for water .",
  "/wiki/Port_Phillip_Channel_Deepening_Project": "The Port Phillip Channel Deepening Project ( CDP ) began on 8 February 2008 to deepen the shipping channels leading to Melbourne , Australia . The project was to deepen channels in Port Phillip to 14 metres ( 46 ft ) draught allow greater access for container ships . An estimated A $ 969 million was to be spent on the works , with $ 150 million funded by taxpayers . The dredging works were conducted by Dutch company Royal Boskalis Westminster for the Port of Melbourne Corporation ( PoMC ) , a statutory body established by the Victorian Government responsible for the running of the port , at a cost of $ 500 million and was expected to be completed before 31 December 2009 , pending auditor reports and various legal actions against the project . The project was to be conducted under a controversial Public-Private-Partnership . Operating almost 24 hours a day , the project involved the removal of approximately 22.9 million m3 ( 810 million cu ft ) of sand , fine river silt ( including about around 3 million m3 ( 110 million cu ft ) of contaminated sediment ) . The material removed was transported to designated dump sites . According to numerous scientists , community representatives , environmental and community groups , the dredging would disturb marine plant , animal and microbial life through large areas of the bay . The project caused significant controversy among many communities throughout the Victorian population , and was strongly opposed by scientists such as biologists and geologists , the CSIRO , university academics and scientists including Monash University , and many groups representing the community including the Dive Industry of Victoria , the Victorian Greens , the Australian Peak Shippers ' Association , and the Victorian National Parks Association . The amalgamated community group Blue Wedges held public rallies and several pickets from 2004-2008 , involving surfers , canoes , kayaks , boats and yachts who put themselves in the path of the dredging ship Queen of the Netherlands , which delayed the project for a time . The project eventually began , although under limited conditions , after Blue Wedges won a reprieve in the Federal Court . The limited conditions were stripped from 28 March 2008 after ensuing legal proceedings saw the Blue Wedges case dismissed .",
  "/wiki/Dredging": "Dredging is the operation of excavating material from a water environment ( sometimes temporarily created ) for the purpose of improving existing water features ; reshaping land and water features to alter drainage , navigability , and commercial use ; construct dams , dikes , and other controls for streams and shorelines ; and to recover valuable mineral deposits or marine life having commercial value . In all but a few situations the excavation is undertaken by a specialist floating plant , known as a dredger . Dredging is carried out in many different locations and for many different purposes , but the main objectives are usually to recover material of value or use , or to create a greater depth of water . All dredges can generally be classified as suction or mechanical .",
  "/wiki/Heavy_metals": "Heavy metals are generally defined as metals with relatively high densities , atomic weights , or atomic numbers . The criteria used , and whether metalloids are included , vary depending on the author and context . In metallurgy , for example , a heavy metal may be defined on the basis of density , whereas in physics the distinguishing criterion might be atomic number , while a chemist would likely be more concerned with chemical behaviour . More specific definitions have been published , but none of these have been widely accepted . The definitions surveyed in this article encompass up to 96 out of the 118 known chemical elements ; only mercury , lead and bismuth meet all of them . Despite this lack of agreement , the term ( plural or singular ) is widely used in science . A density of more than 5 g/cm3 is sometimes quoted as a commonly used criterion and is used in the body of this article . The earliest known metals - common metals such as iron , copper , and tin , and precious metals such as silver , gold , and platinum - are heavy metals . From 1809 onward , light metals , such as magnesium , aluminium , and titanium , were discovered , as well as less well-known heavy metals including gallium , thallium , and hafnium . Some heavy metals are either essential nutrients ( typically iron , cobalt , and zinc ) , or relatively harmless ( such as ruthenium , silver , and indium ) , but can be toxic in larger amounts or certain forms . Other heavy metals , such as cadmium , mercury , and lead , are highly poisonous . Potential sources of heavy metal poisoning include mining , tailings , industrial wastes , agricultural runoff , occupational exposure , paints and treated timber .",
  "/wiki/Blue_Wedges": "Blue Wedges is a conservation organisation in conflict with Australia 's Victorian government policy to deepen shipping channels in Port Phillip and the large scale development of Ramsar listed Westernport . The Blue Wedges is a coalition of over 65 environmental and bay user groups opposed to development in the Melbourne Bays that they deem to be unsustainable , such as the Port of Melbourne Corporation 's Channel Deepening Project . The Blue Wedges Coalition includes angling groups and peak bodies , professional fishing associations , diving and charter operators along with the more traditional coastal protection groups and bayside industry sectors . [ citation needed ] The Blue Wedges Coalition is supported in its goal to protect the bays by other environmental entities including the Victorian National Parks Association , Australian Conservation Foundation , Friends of the Earth , The Wilderness Society , Environment Victoria , Port Phillip Conservation Council and Western Region Environment Centre under a joint statement issued by these groups opposing the project and calling for action to stop the project from the Victorian Government .

  "/wiki/Adani_coal_mine": "The Carmichael coal mine is a thermal coal mine in the north of the Galilee Basin in Central Queensland , Australia , approved by the Queensland and federal Australian governments . Mining was planned to be conducted by both open-cut and underground methods . The mine is proposed by Adani Mining , a wholly owned subsidiary of India 's Adani Group . The development was initially intended to represent an AUD $ 16.5 billion investment , however , after being refused financing by over 30 financial institutions worldwide , Adani announced in 2018 that the mining operation would be downsized and self-funded to AUD $ 2bn . As of November 2019 [ update ] , Adani is set to receive a seven-year royalty deferral worth $ 900m , and over $ 4.4 billion in total tax exemptions , deferrals and capital subsidies from Queensland taxpayers for the life of the Carmichael mine . At peak capacity the mine would produce ( as of 2017 ) 60 million tonnes of coal a year , much of it low quality , high ash . In court , Adani said in 2015 it expects the mine to produce 2.3 billion tonnes over 60 years . It would be the largest coal mine in Australia and one of the largest in the world . The mine would be the first of some large mines proposed for the Galilee Basin . Exports are to leave the country via port facilities at Hay Point and Abbot Point after being transported to the coast via rail . The proposal includes a new 189 km rail line to connect with the existing Goonyella railway line . Most of the exported coal is planned to be shipped to India .",
  "/wiki/Coal_mining": "Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground . Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s , has been widely used to generate electricity . Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production . In the United Kingdom and South Africa , a coal mine and its structures are a colliery , a coal mine - a pit , and the above-ground structures - a pit head . In Australia , colliery generally refers to an underground coal mine . In the United States , colliery has been used [ when ? ] to describe a coal mine operation , but this usage is less common today . Coal mining has had many developments over the recent years , from the early days of men tunneling , digging , and manually extracting the coal on carts to large open cut and long wall mines . Mining at this scale requires the use of draglines , trucks , conveyors , hydraulic jacks and shearers .",
  "/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef": "The Great Barrier Reef is the world 's largest coral reef system composed of over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands stretching for over 2,300 kilometres ( 1,400 mi ) over an area of approximately 344,400 square kilometres ( 133,000 sq mi ) . The reef is located in the Coral Sea , off the coast of Queensland , Australia . The Great Barrier Reef can be seen from outer space and is the world 's biggest single structure made by living organisms . This reef structure is composed of and built by billions of tiny organisms , known as coral polyps . It supports a wide diversity of life and was selected as a World Heritage Site in 1981 . CNN labelled it one of the seven natural wonders of the world . The Queensland National Trust named it a state icon of Queensland . A large part of the reef is protected by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park , which helps to limit the impact of human use , such as fishing and tourism . Other environmental pressures on the reef and its ecosystem include runoff , climate change accompanied by mass coral bleaching , dumping of dredging sludge and cyclic population outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish . According to a study published in October 2012 by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the reef has lost more than half its coral cover since 1985 . The Great Barrier Reef has long been known to and used by the Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander peoples , and is an important part of local groups ' cultures and spirituality . The reef is a very popular destination for tourists , especially in the Whitsunday Islands and Cairns regions .",
  "/wiki/Groundwater": "Groundwater is the water present beneath Earth 's surface in soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations . A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water . The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table . Groundwater is recharged from the surface ; it may discharge from the surface naturally at springs and seeps , and can form oases or wetlands . Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural , municipal , and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells . The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology , also called groundwater hydrology . Typically , groundwater is thought of as water flowing through shallow aquifers , but , in the technical sense , it can also contain soil moisture , permafrost ( frozen soil ) , immobile water in very low permeability bedrock , and deep geothermal or oil formation water . Groundwater is hypothesized to provide lubrication that can possibly influence the movement of faults . It is likely that much of Earth 's subsurface contains some water , which may be mixed with other fluids in some instances . Groundwater may not be confined only to Earth . The formation of some of the landforms observed on Mars may have been influenced by groundwater . There is also evidence that liquid water may also exist in the subsurface of Jupiter 's moon Europa .",
  "/wiki/Carbon_emissions": "A greenhouse gas ( sometimes abbreviated GHG ) is a gas that absorbs and emits radiant energy within the thermal infrared range . Greenhouse gases cause the greenhouse effect on planets . The primary greenhouse gases in Earth 's atmosphere are water vapor ( H2O ) , carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , methane ( CH4 ) , nitrous oxide ( N2O ) , and ozone ( O3 ) . Without greenhouse gases , the average temperature of Earth 's surface would be about \u221218 \u00b0C ( 0 \u00b0F ) , rather than the present average of 15 \u00b0C ( 59 \u00b0F ) . The atmospheres of Venus , Mars and Titan also contain greenhouse gases . Human activities since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution ( around 1750 ) have produced a 45% increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide , from 280 ppm in 1750 to 415 ppm in 2019 . This increase has occurred despite the uptake of more than half of the emissions by various natural sinks involved in the carbon cycle . The vast majority of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions come from combustion of fossil fuels , principally coal , oil , and natural gas , with additional contributions coming from deforestation , changes in land use , soil erosion and agriculture ( including livestock ) . The leading source of anthropogenic methane emissions is animal agriculture , followed by fugitive emissions from gas , oil , coal and other industry , solid waste , wastewater and rice production . At current emission rates , temperatures could increase by 2 \u00b0C , which the United Nations ' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) designated as the upper limit to avoid dangerous levels , by 2036 ."
