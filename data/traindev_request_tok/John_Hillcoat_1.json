In 2003 , he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . In 2004 , Rolling Stone ranked Costello number 80 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time . Costello began his career as part of London 's pub rock scene in the early 1970s and later became associated with the first wave of the British punk and new wave movement that emerged in the mid-to-late 1970s . His critically acclaimed debut album My Aim Is True was released in 1977 . Shortly after recording it , he formed the Attractions as his backing band . His second album This Year 's Model was released in 1978 , and was ranked number 11 by Rolling Stone on its list of the best albums from 1967 to 1987 . His third album Armed Forces was released in 1979 , and features his highest-charting single , Oliver 's Army ( number 2 in the UK ) . His first three albums all appeared on Rolling Stone 's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time . Costello and the Attractions toured and recorded together for the better part of a decade , though differences between them caused a split by 1986 . Much of Costello 's work since has been as a solo artist , though reunions with members of the Attractions have been credited to the group over the years .",

In 2004 , Entertainment Weekly voted it one of Costello 's top ten greatest tunes . The song focuses on an older woman who has experienced severe memory loss . Costello 's inspiration for this song was his grandmother , who suffered from Alzheimer 's . When talking about the song on a VH1 interview , Costello reminisced about his grandmother having terrifying moments of lucidity and how this was the inspiration for Veronica . In his 2015 autobiography , Unfaithful Music & Disappearing Ink , Costello wrote of his collaboration with McCartney , I 'd brought an early version of Veronica that you would have recognized [ \u2026 ] All the words I 'd already written were about my paternal grandmother , Molly , or more formally , Mabel Josephine Jackson . In fact , her Catholic confirmation name , Veronica , provided the very title of the song . Veronica was also Costello 's highest-charting Top 40 hit in the United States , peaking at No . 19 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart , No . 1 on its Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart , and No . 10 on its Mainstream Rock Tracks chart .",
