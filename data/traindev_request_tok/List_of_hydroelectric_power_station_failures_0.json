Since its formation , the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history . In particular , it played a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign , the Battle of Britain . The RAF 's mission is to support the objectives of the British Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) , which are to provide the capabilities needed to ensure the security and defence of the United Kingdom and overseas territories , including against terrorism ; to support the Government 's foreign policy objectives particularly in promoting international peace and security . The RAF describes its mission statement as .

  "/wiki/Avro_Lancaster": "The Avro Lancaster is a British Second World War heavy bomber . It was designed and manufactured by Avro as a contemporary of the Handley Page Halifax , both bombers having been developed to the same specification , as well as the Short Stirling , all three aircraft being four-engined heavy bombers adopted by the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) during the same wartime era . The Lancaster has its origins in the twin-engine Avro Manchester which had been developed during the late 1930s in response to the Air Ministry Specification P.13/36 for a capable medium bomber for world-wide use . Originally developed as an evolution of the Manchester ( which had proved troublesome in service and was retired in 1942 ) , the Lancaster was designed by Roy Chadwick and powered by four Rolls-Royce Merlins and in one version , Bristol Hercules engines . It first saw service with RAF Bomber Command in 1942 and as the strategic bombing offensive over Europe gathered momentum , it was the main aircraft for the night-time bombing campaigns that followed . As increasing numbers of the type were produced , it became the principal heavy bomber used by the RAF , the RCAF and squadrons from other Commonwealth and European countries serving within the RAF , overshadowing the Halifax and Stirling . A long , unobstructed bomb bay meant that the Lancaster could take the largest bombs used by the RAF , including the 4,000 lb ( 1,800 kg ) , 8,000 lb ( 3,600 kg ) and 12,000 lb ( 5,400 kg ) blockbusters , loads often supplemented with smaller bombs or incendiaries . The Lanc , as it was known colloquially , became one of the most heavily used of the Second World War night bombers , delivering 608,612 long tons of bombs in 156,000 sorties . The versatility of the Lancaster was such that it was chosen to equip 617 Squadron and was modified to carry the Upkeep Bouncing bomb designed by Barnes Wallis for Operation Chastise , the attack on German Ruhr valley dams . Although the Lancaster was primarily a night bomber , it excelled in many other roles , including daylight precision bombing , for which some Lancasters were adapted to carry the 12,000 lb ( 5,400 kg ) Tallboy and then the 22,000 lb ( 10,000 kg ) Grand Slam earthquake bombs ( also designed by Wallis ) .

  "/wiki/Niagara_Gorge": "Niagara Gorge is an 11 km ( 6.8 mi ) gorge carved by the Niagara River along the Canada-United States border , between the U.S. state of New York and the Canadian province of Ontario . It begins at the base of Niagara Falls and ends at the Niagara Escarpment near Queenston , Ontario , where the Falls originated about 12,500 years ago . The Falls have receded upstream toward Lake Erie by slow erosion of hard Lockport Dolomite ( a dolomitic limestone or dolomite , which is the surface rock of the escarpment ) , combined with rapid erosion of the relatively soft layers beneath it . The force of the river current in the gorge is one of the most powerful in the world ; because of the dangers this presents , kayaking the gorge has generally been prohibited . On multiple occasions , the rapids of the gorge have claimed the lives of people attempting to run them . However , on isolated occasions , world class experts have been permitted to navigate the stretch .

It forms part of the border between the province of Ontario in Canada ( on the west ) and the state of New York in the United States ( on the east ) . There are differing theories as to the origin of the river 's name . According to Iroquoian scholar Bruce Trigger , Niagara is derived from the name given to a branch of the locally residing native Neutral Confederacy , who are described as being called the Niagagarega people on several late-17th-century French maps of the area . According to George R. Stewart , it comes from the name of an Iroquois town called Ongniaahra , meaning point of land cut in two . The river , which is occasionally described as a strait , is about 58 kilometres ( 36 mi ) long and includes Niagara Falls in its course . The falls have moved approximately 11 kilometres ( 6.8 mi ) upstream from the Niagara Escarpment in the last 12,000 years , resulting in a gorge below the falls . Today , the diversion of the river for electrical generation has significantly reduced the rate of erosion . The total drop in elevation along the river is 99 metres ( 325 ft ) . The Niagara Gorge extends downstream from the Falls and includes the Niagara Whirlpool and another section of rapids . Power plants on the river include the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Power Stations ( built in 1922 and 1954 ) on the Canadian side , and the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant ( built in 1961 ) on the American side .

  "/wiki/Vajont_Dam": "The Vajont Dam ( or Vaiont Dam ) is a disused dam , completed in 1959 in the valley of the Vajont River under Monte Toc , in the municipality of Erto and Casso , 100 km ( 60 miles ) north of Venice , Italy . One of the tallest dams in the world , it is 262 metres ( 860 ft ) high , 27 metres ( 89 ft ) wide and 22.11 metres ( 72 ft 6 in ) thick at the base and 191 metres ( 627 ft ) wide and 3.4 metres ( 11 ft 2 in ) thick at the top . The dam was conceived in the 1920s , designed by Carlo Semenza , and eventually built between 1957 and 1960 by Societ\u00e0 Adriatica di Elettricit\u00e0 ( SADE , or EDIS ) ( English : Adriatic Energy Corporation ) , the electricity supply and distribution monopoly in northeastern Italy , which was owned by Giuseppe Volpi di Misurata . In 1962 the dam was nationalized and came under the control of ENEL as part of the Italian Ministry for Public Works . It was described as 'the tallest dam in the world ' , intended to meet the growing demands of industrialization , and as of 2010 is still one of the tallest in the world . On 9 October 1963 , during initial filling , a massive landslide caused a man-made megatsunami in the lake in which 50 million cubic metres of water overtopped the dam in a wave of 250 metres ( 820 ft ) , leading to the complete destruction of several villages and towns , and 1,917 deaths . This event occurred when the company and the Italian government dismissed evidence and concealed reports describing the geological instability of Monte Toc on the southern side of the basin , and other early warning signs reported prior to the disaster . Numerous warnings , signs of danger , and negative appraisals had been disregarded , and the eventual attempt to safely control the landslide into the lake by lowering its level came when the landslide was almost imminent and was too late to prevent it . Although the dam itself remained almost intact , and two-thirds of the water was retained behind it , the landslide was much larger than expected and the impact brought massive flooding and destruction to the Piave valley below . Although the wave only contained a third of the dam 's contents , it was still ten times higher than calculations had predicted . [ citation needed ]",

China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty . China , as a whole , was ravaged by feudal warlordism and Japan during World War II .",

The state 's capital and largest city is Boise . Idaho prior to European settlement was inhabited by Native American peoples , some of whom still live in the area . In the early 19th century , Idaho was considered part of the Oregon Country , an area disputed between the U.S. and the United Kingdom . It officially became U.S. territory with the signing of the Oregon Treaty of 1846 , but a separate Idaho Territory was not organized until 1863 , instead being included for periods in Oregon Territory and Washington Territory . Idaho was eventually admitted to the Union on July 3 , 1890 , becoming the 43rd state . Forming part of the Pacific Northwest ( and the associated Cascadia bioregion ) , Idaho is divided into several distinct geographic and climatic regions . The state 's north , the relatively isolated Idaho Panhandle , is closely linked with Eastern Washington with which it shares the Pacific Time Zone - the rest of the state uses the Mountain Time Zone .

By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin .

Victoria is bordered by Bass Strait and Tasmania to the south , [ note 1 ] New South Wales to the north , the Tasman Sea ( a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean ) to the east , and South Australia to the west . The area that is now known as Victoria is the home of many Aboriginal people groups , including the Boon wurrung , the Bratauolung , the Djadjawurrung , the Gunai/Kurnai , the Gunditjmara , the Taungurong , the Wathaurong , the Wurundjeri , and the Yorta Yorta . There were more than 30 Aboriginal languages spoken in the area prior to the European settlement of Australia . The Kulin nation is an alliance of five Aboriginal nations which makes up much of the central part of the state . With Great Britain having claimed the half of the Australian continent that is east of the 135th meridian east in 1788 , Victoria formed part of the wider colony of New South Wales . The first European settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay , and much of what is now Victoria was included in 1836 in the Port Phillip District , an administrative division of New South Wales . Named in honour of Queen Victoria , who signed the division 's separation from New South Wales , the colony was officially established in 1851 and achieved self government in 1855 . The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony , and by the time of the Federation of Australia in 1901 , Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in Australasia .

Although it is one of only two landlocked countries in South America ( the other is Bolivia ) , the country has coasts , beaches and ports on the Paraguay and Paran\u00e1 rivers that give exit to the Atlantic Ocean through the Paran\u00e1-Paraguay Waterway . Due to its central location in South America , it is sometimes referred to as Coraz\u00f3n de Sudam\u00e9rica ( Heart of South America ) . Spanish conquistadores arrived in 1524 after navigating northwards from the R\u00edo de la Plata to the Paran\u00e1 River , and finally up the Paraguay River . In 1537 , they established the city of Asunci\u00f3n , which was the first capital of the Governorate of Paraguay and R\u00edo de la Plata . Paraguay was the epicenter of the Jesuit Missions , where the Guaran\u00ed people were educated and introduced to Christianity and European culture under the direction of the Society of Jesus in Jesuit reductions , mainly during the 17th century . However , after the expulsion of the Jesuits from Spanish territories in 1767 , Paraguay increasingly became a peripheral colony , with few urban centers and settlers . Following independence from Spain at the beginning of the 19th century , Paraguay was ruled by a series of authoritarian governments who generally implemented nationalist , isolationist and protectionist policies . This period ended with the disastrous Paraguayan War , during which Paraguay lost at least 50% of its prewar population and around 25-33% of its territory to the Triple Alliance of Argentina , Brazil and Uruguay .

Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants , the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century . In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire , beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium . Rus ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states , until it was finally reunified by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th century .

  "/wiki/2013_North_India_floods": "In June 2013 , a multi-day cloudburst centered on the North Indian state of Uttarakhand caused devastating floods and landslides becoming the country 's worst natural disaster since the 2004 tsunami . The reason the floods occurred was that the rainfall received was on a larger scale than the regular rainfall the state usually received . The debris blocked up the rivers , causing major overflow . The main day of the flood was 16 June 2013 . Though some parts of Himachal Pradesh , Haryana , Delhi and Uttar Pradesh in India experienced the heavy rainfall , some regions of Western Nepal , and some parts of Western Tibet also experienced heavy rainfall , over 89% of the casualties occurred in Uttarakhand . As of 16 July 2013 [ update ] , according to figures provided by the Government of Uttarakhand , more than 5,700 people were presumed dead . This total included 934 local residents . Destruction of bridges and roads left about 300,000 pilgrims and tourists trapped in the valleys leading to three of the four Hindu Chota Char Dham pilgrimage sites . The Indian Air Force , the Indian Army , and paramilitary troops evacuated more than 110,000 people from the flood ravaged area .",

  "/wiki/Oroville_Dam": "Oroville Dam is an earthfill embankment dam on the Feather River east of the city of Oroville , California , in the Sierra Nevada foothills east of the Sacramento Valley . At 770 feet ( 235 m ) high , it is the tallest dam in the U.S. and serves mainly for water supply , hydroelectricity generation and flood control . The dam impounds Lake Oroville , the second largest man-made lake in the state of California , capable of storing more than 3.5 million acre feet ( 1.1 trillion US gallons ; 4.3 trillion litres ) . Built by the California Department of Water Resources ( DWR ) , Oroville Dam is one of the key features of the California State Water Project ( SWP ) , one of two major projects passed that set up California 's statewide water system . Construction was initiated in 1961 , and despite numerous difficulties encountered during its construction , including multiple floods and a major train wreck on the rail line used to transport materials to the dam site , the embankment was topped out in 1967 and the entire project was ready for use in 1968 . The dam began to generate electricity shortly afterwards with completion of the Edward Hyatt Pump-Generating Plant , then the country 's largest underground power station . Since its completion in 1968 , the Oroville Dam has allocated the flow of the Feather River from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta into the State Water Project 's California Aqueduct , which provides a major supply of water for irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley as well as municipal and industrial water supplies to coastal Southern California , and has prevented large amounts of flood damage to the area - more than $ 1.3 billion between the years of 1987 and 1999 . The dam has confined fish migration up the Feather River and the controlled flow of the river as a result of the Oroville Dam has affected riparian habitat . Multiple attempts at trying to counter the dam 's impacts on fish migration have included the construction of a salmon/steelhead fish incubator on the river , which began shortly after the dam was completed . In February 2017 , the main and emergency spillways threatened to fail , leading to the evacuation of 188,000 people living near the dam . After deterioration of the main spillway largely stabilized and the water level of the dam 's reservoir dropped below the top of the emergency spillway , the evacuation order was lifted .",
