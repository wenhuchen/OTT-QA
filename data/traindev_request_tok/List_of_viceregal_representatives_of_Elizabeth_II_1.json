The Territory was formed on 3 March 1962 , although the UK 's claim to this portion of the Antarctic dates back to letters patent of 1908 and 1917 . The area now covered by the Territory includes three regions which , before 1962 , were administered by the British as separate dependencies of the Falkland Islands : Graham Land , the South Orkney Islands , and the South Shetland Islands . The United Kingdom 's claim to the region has been suspended since the Antarctic Treaty came into force in 1961 , Article 4 of which states No acts or activities taking place while the present Treaty is in force shall constitute a basis for asserting , supporting or denying a claim to territorial sovereignty in Antarctica . No new claim , or enlargement of an existing claim , to territorial sovereignty , shall be asserted while the present Treaty is in force .

The territory comprises the seven atolls of the Chagos Archipelago with over 1,000 individual islands - many very small - amounting to a total land area of 60 square kilometres ( 23 sq mi ) . The largest and most southerly island is Diego Garcia , 27 km2 ( 10 sq mi ) , the site of a joint military facility of the United Kingdom and the United States . The only inhabitants are US and British military personnel and associated contractors , who collectively number around 2,500 ( 2012 figures ) . The removal of Chagossians from the Chagos Archipelago occurred between 1968 and 1973 . The Chagossians , then numbering about 2,000 people , were expelled by the British government to Mauritius and Seychelles to allow the United States to build a joint UK/US military base there . Today , the exiled Chagossians are still trying to return , arguing that the forced expulsion and dispossession was illegal . The islands are off-limits to Chagossians , casual tourists , and the media . Since the 1980s the government of Mauritius has sought to regain control over the Chagos Archipelago , which was separated from the British Colony of Mauritius by the UK in 1965 to form the British Indian Ocean Territory . On 23 June 2017 , the United Nations General Assembly ( UNGA ) voted in favour of referring the territorial dispute between Mauritius and the UK to the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) in order to clarify the legal status of the Chagos Islands archipelago in the Indian Ocean .

It has an area of 6.7 km2 ( 2.6 sq mi ) and is bordered to the north by Spain . The landscape is dominated by the Rock of Gibraltar at the foot of which is a densely populated town area , home to over 32,000 people , primarily Gibraltarians . In 1704 , Anglo-Dutch forces captured Gibraltar from Spain during the War of the Spanish Succession on behalf of the Habsburg claim to the Spanish throne . The territory was ceded to Great Britain in perpetuity under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 . During World War II it was an important base for the Royal Navy as it controlled the entrance and exit to the Mediterranean Sea , the Strait of Gibraltar , which is only 14.3 km ( 8.9 mi ) wide at this naval choke point . It remains strategically important , with half the world 's seaborne trade passing through the strait . Today Gibraltar 's economy is based largely on tourism , online gambling , financial services and cargo ship refuelling .

Montserrat is nicknamed The Emerald Isle of the Caribbean both for its resemblance to coastal Ireland and for the Irish ancestry of many of its inhabitants . On 18 July 1995 , the previously dormant Soufri\u00e8re Hills volcano , in the southern part of the island , became active . Eruptions destroyed Montserrat 's Georgian era capital city of Plymouth . Between 1995 and 2000 , two-thirds of the island 's population was forced to flee , primarily to the United Kingdom , leaving fewer than 1,200 people on the island in 1997 ( rising to nearly 5,000 by 2016 ) . The volcanic activity continues , mostly affecting the vicinity of Plymouth , including its docking facilities , and the eastern side of the island around the former W. H. Bramble Airport , the remnants of which were buried by flows from volcanic activity on 11 February 2010 . An exclusion zone , encompassing the southern half of the island to as far north as parts of the Belham Valley , was imposed because of the size of the existing volcanic dome and the resulting potential for pyroclastic activity . Visitors are generally not permitted entry into the exclusion zone , but a view of the destruction of Plymouth can be seen from the top of Garibaldi Hill in Isles Bay .

  "/wiki/Commissioner_of_South_Georgia_and_the_South_Sandwich_Islands": "The Commissioner for South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands is the representative of the British monarch in the United Kingdom 's overseas territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . The post is held in conjunction with the Governorship of the Falkland Islands . The post was created in 1985 when South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands was split from the Falkland Islands Dependencies to create a new overseas territory . As the territory has no native inhabitants , and the only population is the visiting military garrisons , and scientists from the British Antarctic Survey , there was no appointment of a governor . Instead the post of Commissioner was created , the normal practice for uninhabited territory . The post was to be held by the current Governor of the Falkland Islands , as that is the nearest inhabited overseas territory to SGSSI , and the presence of the Royal Navy in the South Atlantic allows the Commissioner to be transported to the territory relatively quickly if necessary . The Commissioner retains the same powers as a Governor , and is responsible for domestic affairs within the territory . The British Government retains responsibility for defence and international relations . The Commissioner has his own flag for the territory , a Union Flag defaced with the territory 's coat of arms . The arms were authorised for the Commissioner on 14 February 1992 .",
