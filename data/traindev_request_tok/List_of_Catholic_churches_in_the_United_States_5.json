  "/wiki/St._Joseph's_Roman_Catholic_Church_of_Denver": "St. Joseph 's Roman Catholic Church of Denver , also known as St. Joseph 's Redemptorist Church , is a historic church at 600 Galapago in Denver , Colorado . It was built in 1888 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 . The church was deemed significant in part as an example of the style of institutional architecture which was predominant in Denver during the 1880s - 90s . The architecture takes on greater significance because of one feature of the building - the stained glass windows . All of them are American-made , an apparently unusual circumstance for the time , as the common conception of the people at the time St. Joseph 's was built was that church windows had to be imported from Europe . The stained glass windows are also unique in that they contain clear prisms . St Joseph 's was the site of a mass excommunication of more than 100 parishioners , after it was found that Father Malone had embezzled a large sum of money . 637 Galapago ( also known as the Samsonite house ) , across the street from the church was built for the sum of $ 12,000 in the name of Father Malone 's mother . The embezzled sum was also $ 12,000 . 637 Galapago was sold the day before an archbishop was brought in from New Mexico to investigate the matter .",
