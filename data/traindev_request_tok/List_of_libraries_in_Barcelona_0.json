  "/wiki/Freethought": "Freethought ( or free thought ) is an epistemological viewpoint which holds that positions regarding truth should be formed only on the basis of logic , reason , and empiricism , rather than authority , tradition , revelation , or dogma . According to the Oxford English Dictionary , a freethinker is a person who forms their own ideas and opinions rather than accepting those of other people , especially in religious teaching . In some contemporary thought in particular , freethought is strongly tied with rejection of traditional social or religious belief systems . The cognitive application of freethought is known as freethinking , and practitioners of freethought are known as freethinkers . Modern freethinkers consider freethought as a natural freedom from all negative and illusive thoughts acquired from the society . The term first came into use in the 17th century in order to indicate people who inquired into the basis of traditional religious beliefs . In practice , freethinking is most closely linked with secularism , atheism , agnosticism , anti-clericalism , and religious critique . The Oxford English Dictionary defines freethinking as , The free exercise of reason in matters of religious belief , unrestrained by deference to authority ; the adoption of the principles of a free-thinker . Freethinkers hold that knowledge should be grounded in facts , scientific inquiry , and logic . The skeptical application of science implies freedom from the intellectually limiting effects of confirmation bias , cognitive bias , conventional wisdom , popular culture , prejudice , or sectarianism .",
