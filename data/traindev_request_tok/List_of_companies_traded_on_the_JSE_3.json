  "/wiki/Information_technology": "Information technology ( IT ) is the use of computers to store , retrieve , transmit , and manipulate data or information . IT is typically used within the context of business operations as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies . IT is considered to be a subset of information and communications technology ( ICT ) . An information technology system ( IT system ) is generally an information system , a communications system or , more specifically speaking , a computer system - including all hardware , software and peripheral equipment - operated by a limited group of users . Humans have been storing , retrieving , manipulating , and communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC , but the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review ; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented that the new technology does not yet have a single established name . We shall call it information technology ( IT ) . Their definition consists of three categories : techniques for processing , the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making , and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs . The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks , but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones . Several products or services within an economy are associated with information technology , including computer hardware , software , electronics , semiconductors , internet , telecom equipment , and e-commerce . [ a ] Based on the storage and processing technologies employed , it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT development : pre-mechanical ( 3000 BC - 1450 AD ) , mechanical ( 1450-1840 ) , electromechanical ( 1840-1940 ) , and electronic ( 1940-present ) . This article focuses on the most recent period ( electronic ) .",
  "/wiki/Business_services": "Corporate services are activities that combine or consolidate certain enterprise-wide needed support services , provided based on specialized knowledge , best practices , and technology to serve internal ( and sometimes external ) customers and business partners . The term corporate services providers ( CSPs ) is also used . In the United Kingdom , the public audit agencies produced a report in May 2007 called Value for Money in public sector corporate services . This provides performance indicators in five categories : Finance , Human Resources , Information & Communication Technology , Procurement , and Estates Management .",
  "/wiki/Internet_service_provider": "An Internet service provider ( ISP ) is an organization that provides services for accessing , using , or participating in the Internet . Internet service providers can be organized in various forms , such as commercial , community-owned , non-profit , or otherwise privately owned . Internet services typically provided by ISPs include Internet access , Internet transit , domain name registration , web hosting , Usenet service , and colocation .",
  "/wiki/Telecommunications": "Telecommunication is the transmission of signs , signals , messages , words , writings , images and sounds or information of any nature by wire , radio , optical or other electromagnetic systems . Telecommunication occurs when the exchange of information between communication participants includes the use of technology . It is transmitted through a transmission medium , such as over physical media , for example , over electrical cable , or via electromagnetic radiation through space such as radio or light . Such transmission paths are often divided into communication channels which afford the advantages of multiplexing . Since the Latin term communicatio is considered the social process of information exchange , the term telecommunications is often used in its plural form because it involves many different technologies . Early means of communicating over a distance included visual signals , such as beacons , smoke signals , semaphore telegraphs , signal flags and optical heliographs . Other examples of pre-modern long-distance communication included audio messages such as coded drumbeats , lung-blown horns , and loud whistles . 20th- and 21st-century technologies for long-distance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies , such as telegraph , telephone , and teleprinter , networks , radio , microwave transmission , optical fiber , and communications satellites . A revolution in wireless communication began in the first decade of the 20th century with the pioneering developments in radio communications by Guglielmo Marconi , who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1909 , and other notable pioneering inventors and developers in the field of electrical and electronic telecommunications . These included Charles Wheatstone and Samuel Morse ( inventors of the telegraph ) , Alexander Graham Bell ( inventor of the telephone ) , Edwin Armstrong and Lee de Forest ( inventors of radio ) , as well as Vladimir K. Zworykin , John Logie Baird and Philo Farnsworth ( some of the inventors of television ) .",

  "/wiki/Computer_networking": "A computer network is a digital telecommunications network for sharing resources between nodes , which are computing devices that use a common telecommunications technology . Data transmission between nodes is supported over data links consisting of physical cable media , such as twisted pair or fibre-optic cables , or by wireless methods , such as Wi-Fi , microwave transmission , or free-space optical communication . Network nodes are network computer devices that originate , route and terminate data communication . They are generally identified by network addresses , and can include hosts such as personal computers , phones , and servers , as well as networking hardware such as routers and switches . Two such devices can be said to be networked when one device is able to exchange information with the other device , whether or not they have a direct connection to each other . In most cases , application-specific communications protocols are layered ( i.e . carried as payload ) over other more general communications protocols . Computer networks support many applications and services , such as access to the World Wide Web , digital video , digital audio , shared use of application and storage servers , printers , and fax machines , and use of email and instant messaging applications . Computer networks may be classified by many criteria , for example , the transmission medium used to carry their signals , bandwidth , communications protocols to organize network traffic , the network 's size , topology , traffic control mechanism , and organizational intent . The best-known computer network is the Internet .",

Financial services companies are present in all economically developed geographic locations and tend to cluster in local , national , regional and international financial centers such as London , New York City , and Tokyo .",
  "/wiki/Stock_market": "A stock market , equity market or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers ( a loose network of economic transactions , not a physical facility or discrete entity ) of stocks ( also called shares ) , which represent ownership claims on businesses ; these may include securities listed on a public stock exchange , as well as stock that is only traded privately , such as shares of private companies which are sold to investors through equity crowdfunding platforms . Investment in the stock market is most often done via stockbrokerages and electronic trading platforms . Investment is usually made with an investment strategy in mind . Stocks can be categorized by the country where the company is domiciled . For example , Nestl\u00e9 and Novartis are domiciled in Switzerland and traded on the SIX Swiss Exchange , so they may be considered as part of the Swiss stock market , although the stocks may also be traded on exchanges in other countries , for example , as American depository receipts ( ADRs ) on U.S. stock markets .",
  "/wiki/Risk_management": "Risk management is the identification , evaluation , and prioritization of risks ( defined in ISO 31000 as the effect of uncertainty on objectives ) followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize , monitor , and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events or to maximize the realization of opportunities . Risks can come from various sources including uncertainty in financial markets , threats from project failures ( at any phase in design , development , production , or sustaining of life-cycles ) , legal liabilities , credit risk , accidents , natural causes and disasters , deliberate attack from an adversary , or events of uncertain or unpredictable root-cause . There are two types of events i.e . negative events can be classified as risks while positive events are classified as opportunities . Risk management standards have been developed by various institutions , including the Project Management Institute , the National Institute of Standards and Technology , actuarial societies , and ISO standards . Methods , definitions and goals vary widely according to whether the risk management method is in the context of project management , security , engineering , industrial processes , financial portfolios , actuarial assessments , or public health and safety . Strategies to manage threats ( uncertainties with negative consequences ) typically include avoiding the threat , reducing the negative effect or probability of the threat , transferring all or part of the threat to another party , and even retaining some or all of the potential or actual consequences of a particular threat , and the opposites for opportunities ( uncertain future states with benefits ) . Certain risk management standards have been criticized for having no measurable improvement on risk , whereas the confidence in estimates and decisions seems to increase . For example , one study found that one in six IT projects were black swans with gigantic overruns ( cost overruns averaged 200% , and schedule overruns 70% ) .",
  "/wiki/South_Africa": "South Africa , officially the Republic of South Africa ( RSA ) , is the southernmost country in Africa . It is bounded to the south by 2,798 kilometres ( 1,739 mi ) of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans ; to the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia , Botswana , and Zimbabwe ; and to the east and northeast by Mozambique and Eswatini ( Swaziland ) ; and it surrounds the enclaved country of Lesotho . South Africa is the largest country in Southern Africa and the 24th-largest country in the world by land area and , with over 58 million people , is also the world 's 24th-most populous nation . It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere . About 80 percent of South Africans are of Bantu ancestry , divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different African languages , nine of which have official status . The remaining population consists of Africa 's largest communities of European , Asian ( Indian ) , and multiracial ( Coloured ) ancestry . South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures , languages , and religions . Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution 's recognition of 11 official languages , which is the fourth-highest number in the world . Two of these languages are of European origin : Afrikaans developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most coloured and white South Africans ; English reflects the legacy of British colonialism , and is commonly used in public and commercial life , though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language . The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'\u00e9tat , and regular elections have been held for almost a century . However , the vast majority of black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994 . During the 20th century , the black majority sought to claim more rights from the dominant white minority , with this struggle playing a large role in the country 's recent history and politics .",

  "/wiki/Switzerland": "Switzerland , officially the Swiss Confederation , is a country situated in the confluence of western , central , and southern Europe . [ note 4 ] It is a federal republic composed of 26 cantons , with federal authorities seated in Bern . [ note 1 ] Switzerland is a landlocked country bordered by Italy to the south , France to the west , Germany to the north , and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east . It is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau , the Alps , and the Jura , spanning a total area of 41,285 km2 ( 15,940 sq mi ) , and land area of 39,997 km2 ( 15,443 sq mi ) . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory , the Swiss population of approximately 8.5 million is concentrated mostly on the plateau , where the largest cities are located , among them the two global cities and economic centres of Z\u00fcrich and Geneva . The establishment of the Old Swiss Confederacy dates to the late medieval period , resulting from a series of military successes against Austria and Burgundy . Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire was formally recognized in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 . The Federal Charter of 1291 is considered the founding document of Switzerland which is celebrated on Swiss National Day . Since the Reformation of the 16th century , Switzerland has maintained a strong policy of armed neutrality ; it has not fought an international war since 1815 and did not join the United Nations until 2002 . Nevertheless , it pursues an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace-building processes around the world . Switzerland is the birthplace of the Red Cross , one of the world 's oldest and best known humanitarian organisations , and is home to numerous international organisations , including the second largest UN office .

The country has two main landmasses - the North Island ( Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui ) , and the South Island ( Te Waipounamu ) - and around 600 smaller islands . It has a total land area of 268,000 square kilometres ( 103,500 sq mi ) . New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 mi ) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres ( 600 mi ) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal , fungal , and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , and its most populous city is Auckland . Sometime between 1250 and 1300 , Polynesians settled in the islands and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture . In 1642 , Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight New Zealand . In 1840 , representatives of the United Kingdom and M\u0101ori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi , which declared British sovereignty over the islands . In 1841 , New Zealand became a colony within the British Empire and in 1907 it became a dominion ; it gained full statutory independence in 1947 and the British monarch remained the head of state .",
  "/wiki/Fan_(mechanical)": "A fan is a powered machine used to create flow within a fluid , typically a gas such as air . A fan consists of a rotating arrangement of vanes or blades which act on the air . The rotating assembly of blades and hub is known as an impeller , rotor , or runner . Usually , it is contained within some form of housing or case . This may direct the airflow or increase safety by preventing objects from contacting the fan blades . Most fans are powered by electric motors , but other sources of power may be used , including hydraulic motors , handcranks , and internal combustion engines . Mechanically , a fan can be any revolving vane or vanes used for producing currents of air . Fans produce air flows with high volume and low pressure ( although higher than ambient pressure ) , as opposed to compressors which produce high pressures at a comparatively low volume . A fan blade will often rotate when exposed to an air fluid stream , and devices that take advantage of this , such as anemometers and wind turbines , often have designs similar to that of a fan .",
  "/wiki/Light_emitting_diodes": "A light-emitting diode ( LED ) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it . Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes , releasing energy in the form of photons . The color of the light ( corresponding to the energy of the photons ) is determined by the energy required for electrons to cross the band gap of the semiconductor . White light is obtained by using multiple semiconductors or a layer of light-emitting phosphor on the semiconductor device . Appearing as practical electronic components in 1962 , the earliest LEDs emitted low-intensity infrared light . Infrared LEDs are used in remote-control circuits , such as those used with a wide variety of consumer electronics . The first visible-light LEDs were of low intensity and limited to red . Modern LEDs are available across the visible , ultraviolet , and infrared wavelengths , with high light output . Early LEDs were often used as indicator lamps , replacing small incandescent bulbs , and in seven-segment displays . Recent developments have produced high-output white light LEDs suitable for room and outdoor area lighting . LEDs have led to new displays and sensors , while their high switching rates are useful in advanced communications technology . LEDs have many advantages over incandescent light sources , including lower energy consumption , longer lifetime , improved physical robustness , smaller size , and faster switching .",
  "/wiki/Diamond": "Diamond is a solid form of the element carbon with its atoms arranged in a crystal structure called diamond cubic . At room temperature and pressure , another solid form of carbon known as graphite is the chemically stable form , but diamond almost never converts to it . Diamond has the highest hardness and thermal conductivity of any natural material , properties that are utilized in major industrial applications such as cutting and polishing tools . They are also the reason that diamond anvil cells can subject materials to pressures found deep in the Earth . Because the arrangement of atoms in diamond is extremely rigid , few types of impurity can contaminate it ( two exceptions being boron and nitrogen ) . Small numbers of defects or impurities ( about one per million of lattice atoms ) color diamond blue ( boron ) , yellow ( nitrogen ) , brown ( defects ) , green ( radiation exposure ) , purple , pink , orange or red . Diamond also has relatively high optical dispersion ( ability to disperse light of different colors ) . Most natural diamonds have ages between 1 billion and 3.5 billion years . Most were formed at depths between 150 and 250 kilometres ( 93 and 155 mi ) in the Earth 's mantle , although a few have come from as deep as 800 kilometres ( 500 mi ) . Under high pressure and temperature , carbon-containing fluids dissolved minerals and replaced them with diamonds . Much more recently ( tens to hundreds of million years ago ) , they were carried to the surface in volcanic eruptions and deposited in igneous rocks known as kimberlites and lamproites . Synthetic diamonds can be grown from high-purity carbon under high pressures and temperatures or from hydrocarbon gas by chemical vapor deposition ( CVD ) .",
  "/wiki/Mining": "Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth , usually from an ore body , lode , vein , seam , reef or placer deposit . These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner . Ores recovered by mining include metals , coal , oil shale , gemstones , limestone , chalk , dimension stone , rock salt , potash , gravel , and clay . Mining is required to obtain any material that can not be grown through agricultural processes , or feasibly created artificially in a laboratory or factory . Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum , natural gas , or even water . Mining of stones and metal has been a human activity since pre-historic times . Modern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies , analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine , extraction of the desired materials , and final reclamation of the land after the mine is closed . Mining operations usually create a negative environmental impact , both during the mining activity and after the mine has closed . Hence , most of the world 's nations have passed regulations to decrease the impact . Work safety has long been a concern as well , and modern practices have significantly improved safety in mines . Levels of metal recycling are generally low . Unless future end-of-life recycling rates are stepped up , some rare metals may become unavailable for use in a variety of consumer products .",

  "/wiki/Insurance": "Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss . It is a form of risk management , primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss . An entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer , insurance company , insurance carrier or underwriter . A person or entity who buys insurance is known as an insured or as a policyholder . The insurance transaction involves the insured assuming a guaranteed and known relatively small loss in the form of payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurer 's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss . The loss may or may not be financial , but it must be reducible to financial terms , and usually involves something in which the insured has an insurable interest established by ownership , possession , or pre-existing relationship . The insured receives a contract , called the insurance policy , which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insurer will compensate the insured . The amount of money charged by the insurer to the policyholder for the coverage set forth in the insurance policy is called the premium . If the insured experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy , the insured submits a claim to the insurer for processing by a claims adjuster . The insurer may hedge its own risk by taking out reinsurance , whereby another insurance company agrees to carry some of the risk , especially if the primary insurer deems the risk too large for it to carry .",

The consumption of alcohol plays an important social role in many cultures . Most countries have laws regulating the production , sale , and consumption of alcoholic beverages . Some countries ban such activities entirely , but alcoholic drinks are legal in most parts of the world . The global alcoholic drink industry exceeded $ 1 trillion in 2018 . Alcohol is a depressant , which in low doses causes euphoria , reduces anxiety , and improves sociability . In higher doses , it causes drunkenness , stupor , unconsciousness , or death . Long-term use can lead to alcohol abuse , cancer , physical dependence , and alcoholism . Alcohol is one of the most widely used recreational drugs in the world , with about 33% of people being current drinkers . As of 2016 [ update ] , women on average drink 0.7 drinks and males 1.7 drinks a day .

  "/wiki/Metallurgy": "Metallurgy is a domain of materials science and engineering that studies the physical and chemical behavior of metallic elements , their inter-metallic compounds , and their mixtures , which are called alloys . Metallurgy encompasses both the science and the technology of metals . That is , the way in which science is applied to the production of metals , and the engineering of metal components used in products for both consumers and manufacturers . Metallurgy is distinct from the craft of metalworking . Metalworking relies on metallurgy in a similar manner to how medicine relies on medical science for technical advancement . A specialist practitioner of metallurgy is known as a Metallurgist . The science of metallurgy is subdivided into two broad categories : chemical metallurgy and physical metallurgy . Chemical metallurgy is chiefly concerned with the reduction and oxidation of metals , and the chemical performance of metals . Subjects of study in chemical metallurgy include mineral processing , the extraction of metals , thermodynamics , electrochemistry , and chemical degradation ( corrosion ) . In contrast , physical metallurgy focuses on the mechanical properties of metals , the physical properties of metals , and the physical performance of metals . Topics studied in physical metallurgy include crystallography , material characterization , mechanical metallurgy , phase transformations , and failure mechanisms . Historically , metallurgy has predominately focused on the production of metals .",

  "/wiki/Transmission_(mechanics)": "A transmission is a machine in a power transmission system , which provides controlled application of the power . Often the term transmission refers simply to the gearbox that uses gears and gear trains to provide speed and torque conversions from a rotating power source to another device . In British English , the term transmission refers to the whole drivetrain , including clutch , gearbox , prop shaft ( for rear-wheel drive ) , differential , and final drive shafts . In American English , however , the term refers more specifically to the gearbox alone , and detailed usage differs . [ note 1 ] The most common use is in motor vehicles , where the transmission adapts the output of the internal combustion engine to the drive wheels . Such engines need to operate at a relatively high rotational speed , which is inappropriate for starting , stopping , and slower travel . The transmission reduces the higher engine speed to the slower wheel speed , increasing torque in the process . Transmissions are also used on pedal bicycles , fixed machines , and where different rotational speeds and torques are adapted . Often , a transmission has multiple gear ratios ( or simply gears ) with the ability to switch between them as speed varies . This switching may be done manually ( by the operator ) or automatically . Directional ( forward and reverse ) control may also be provided . Single-ratio transmissions also exist , which simply change the speed and torque ( and sometimes direction ) of motor output .",
  "/wiki/Wheel": "In its primitive form , a wheel is a circular block of a hard and durable material at whose center has been bored a circular hole through which is placed an axle bearing about which the wheel rotates when a moment is applied by gravity or torque to the wheel about its axis , thereby making together one of the six simple machines . When placed vertically under a load-bearing platform or case , the wheel turning on the horizontal axle makes it possible to transport heavy loads ; when placed horizontally , the wheel turning on its vertical axle makes it possible to control the spinning motion used to shape materials ( e.g . a potter 's wheel ) ; when mounted on a column connected to a rudder or a chassis mounted on other wheels , one can control the direction of a vessel or vehicle ( e.g . a ship 's wheel or steering wheel ) ; when connected to a crank or engine , a wheel can store , release , or transmit energy ( e.g . the flywheel ) .",
  "/wiki/Gears": "A gear or cogwheel is a rotating machine part having cut teeth or , in the case of a cogwheel , inserted teeth ( called cogs ) , which mesh with another toothed part to transmit torque . Geared devices can change the speed , torque , and direction of a power source . Gears almost always produce a change in torque , creating a mechanical advantage , through their gear ratio , and thus may be considered a simple machine . The teeth on the two meshing gears all have the same shape . Two or more meshing gears , working in a sequence , are called a gear train or a transmission . A gear can mesh with a linear toothed part , called a rack , producing translation instead of rotation . The gears in a transmission are analogous to the wheels in a crossed , belt pulley system . An advantage of gears is that the teeth of a gear prevent slippage . When two gears mesh , if one gear is bigger than the other , a mechanical advantage is produced , with the rotational speeds , and the torques , of the two gears differing in proportion to their diameters . In transmissions with multiple gear ratios - such as bicycles , motorcycles , and cars - the term gear as in first gear refers to a gear ratio rather than an actual physical gear . The term describes similar devices , even when the gear ratio is continuous rather than discrete , or when the device does not actually contain gears , as in a continuously variable transmission .",
  "/wiki/Forge": "A forge is a type of hearth used for heating metals , or the workplace ( smithy ) where such a hearth is located . The forge is used by the smith to heat a piece of metal to a temperature where it becomes easier to shape by forging , or to the point where work hardening no longer occurs . The metal ( known as the workpiece ) is transported to and from the forge using tongs , which are also used to hold the workpiece on the smithy 's anvil while the smith works it with a hammer . Sometimes , such as when hardening steel or cooling the work so that it may be handled with bare hands , the workpiece is transported to the slack tub , which rapidly cools the workpiece in a large body of water . However , depending on the metal type , it may require an oil quench or a salt brine instead ; many metals require more than plain water hardening . The slack tub also provides water to control the fire in the forge .",

  "/wiki/Gold": "Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au ( from Latin : aurum ) and atomic number 79 , making it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally . In its purest form , it is a bright , slightly reddish yellow , dense , soft , malleable , and ductile metal . Chemically , gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element . It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions . Gold often occurs in free elemental ( native ) form , as nuggets or grains , in rocks , in veins , and in alluvial deposits . It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver ( as electrum ) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium . Less commonly , it occurs in minerals as gold compounds , often with tellurium ( gold tellurides ) . Gold is resistant to most acids , though it does dissolve in aqua regia , a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid , which forms a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion . Gold is insoluble in nitric acid , which dissolves silver and base metals , a property that has long been used to refine gold and to confirm the presence of gold in metallic objects , giving rise to the term acid test . Gold also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide , which are used in mining and electroplating . Gold dissolves in mercury , forming amalgam alloys , but this is not a chemical reaction . A relatively rare element , gold is a precious metal that has been used for coinage , jewelry , and other arts throughout recorded history .",
  "/wiki/Trade": "Trade involves the transfer of goods or services from one person or entity to another , often in exchange for money . Economists refer to a system or network that allows trade as a market . An early form of trade , barter , saw the direct exchange of goods and services for other goods and services . [ need quotation to verify ] Barter involves trading things without the use of money . When either bartering party started to involve precious metals , these gained symbolic as well as practical importance . [ citation needed ] Modern traders generally negotiate through a medium of exchange , such as money . As a result , buying can be separated from selling , or earning . The invention of money ( and later of credit , paper money and non-physical money ) greatly simplified and promoted trade . Trade between two traders is called bilateral trade , while trade involving more than two traders is called multilateral trade . In one modern view , trade exists due to specialization and the division of labor , a predominant form of economic activity in which individuals and groups concentrate on a small aspect of production , but use their output in trades for other products and needs . Trade exists between regions because different regions may have a comparative advantage ( perceived or real ) in the production of some trade-able commodity - including production of natural resources scarce or limited elsewhere . For example : different regions ' sizes may encourage mass production .",
  "/wiki/Electrical_cable": "An electrical cable is an assembly of one or more wires running side by side or bundled , which is used to carry electric current . A cable assembly is the composition of one or more electrical cables and their corresponding connectors . A cable assembly is not necessarily suitable for connecting two devices but can be a partial product ( e.g . to be soldered onto a printed circuit board with a connector mounted to the housing ) . Cable assemblies can also take the form of a cable tree or cable harness , used to connect many terminals together ."
