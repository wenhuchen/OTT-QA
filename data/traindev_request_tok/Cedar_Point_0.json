  "/wiki/Arrow_Dynamics": "Arrow Dynamics was an American manufacturing and engineering company that specialized in designing and building amusement park rides , especially roller coasters . Based in Clearfield , Utah , the company was the successor to Arrow Development ( 1946-1981 ) and Arrow Huss ( 1981-1986 ) , which were responsible for several influential advancements in the amusement and theme park industries . Among the most significant was tubular steel track , which provided a smoother ride than the railroad style rails commonly used prior to the 1960s on wooden roller coasters . The Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland , built in 1959 , was Arrow 's first roller coaster project . In 1975 , Arrow Development introduced the first corkscrew style track Corkscrew , at Knott 's Berry Farm that sent riders through a series of corkscrews . Arrow created several other firsts over the years , introducing the first suspended roller coaster in almost a century , The Bat , in 1981 , and the world 's first hypercoaster , Magnum XL-200 , which opened in 1989 . They built the first 4th Dimension roller coaster , X2 , which was designed by Alan Schilke in 2002 . Arrow Development 's ownership changed three times between the 1950s and 1980s . Arrow Dynamics would eventually survive two bankruptcies and spin off a sister company , Fabriweld , primarily to build track , by 1988 . Arrow Dynamics eventually closed on December 3 , 2001 . S & S Worldwide purchased part of Arrow 's remaining assets on October 28 , 2002 , and the remainder of the company was dissolved . In 2012 , Sansei Yusoki Co. of Osaka , Japan , acquired a 77.3% interest in S & S - Arrow .",
  "/wiki/Mine_train_roller_coaster": "A mine train roller coaster is a steel roller coaster whose trains often depict a set of mine carts , with the forward-most car or portions of it sometimes resembling a small steam locomotive . Most mine train roller coasters are themed in the style of a mine , a Western scene , or simply a mountain range . Traditional mine train roller coaster track elements include several banked turns and helices . There are sometimes level straightaway sections , but few large drops . Most include more than one lift hill . Often , a mine train roller coaster will make its way through trees , tunnels , rock formations , and over small bodies of water . Some feature scenes with animatronic figures . The first mine train roller coaster of its kind was Runaway Mine Train ( Run-A-Way Mine Train until 1995 ) at Six Flags Over Texas . Built by Arrow Development in 1966 , Mine Train is the oldest roller coaster in the park . With Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland ( built in 1959 also by Arrow ) , it is one of the first roller coasters with tubular steel tracks .

  "/wiki/Accelerator_Coaster": "An Accelerator Coaster is a hydraulically launched roller coaster model from Intamin . The model usually consists of a long , straight launch track , a top hat tower element , and magnetic brakes that smoothly stop the train without making contact . The technology was developed by Intamin engineers as an alternative to electromagnetic launch systems , such as the Linear Induction Motor ( LIM ) and Linear Synchronous Motor ( LSM ) , that are found on earlier launched roller coasters like the Flight of Fear and The Joker 's Jinx . Unlike the earlier linear induction motors , the Accelerator Coaster 's launch system exhibits constant acceleration and is capable of reaching greater speeds . Accelerator Coasters with the top hat element are known to perform an occasional rollback - when the train is unable to complete the top hat element and rolls back to the starting point - which can occur due to a number of different factors . Despite this , Accelerator Coasters have a great track record for safety and are extremely power efficient , especially compared to older technologies such as the classic chain lift found on most roller coasters .

  "/wiki/Dive_Coaster": "The Dive Coaster is a steel roller coaster model developed and engineered by Bolliger & Mabillard . The design features one or more near-vertical drops that are approximately 90 degrees , which provide a moment of free-falling for passengers . The experience is enhanced by unique trains that seat up to ten riders per row , spanning only two or three rows total . Unlike traditional train design , this distinguishing aspect gives all passengers virtually the same experience throughout the course of the ride . Another defining characteristic of Dive Coasters is the holding brake at the top of the lift hill that stops the train momentarily right as it enters the first drop , suspending some passengers with a view looking straight down and releasing suddenly moments later . Development of the Dive Coaster began between 1994 and 1995 with Oblivion at Alton Towers opening on March 14 , 1998 , making it the world 's first Dive Coaster . The trains for this type of coaster are relatively short consisting of two to three cars . B & M also uses floorless trains on this model to enhance the experience .
