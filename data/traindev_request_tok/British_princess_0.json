  "/wiki/George_I_of_Great_Britain": "George I ( George Louis ; German : Georg Ludwig ; 28 May 1660 - 11 June 1727 ) [ a ] was King of Great Britain and Ireland from 1 August 1714 and ruler of the Duchy and Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg ( Hanover ) in the Holy Roman Empire from 23 January 1698 until his death in 1727 . He was the first British monarch of the House of Hanover . Born in Hanover to its Elector Ernest Augustus and Electress Sophia , George inherited the titles and lands of the Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg from his father and uncles . A succession of European wars expanded his German domains during his lifetime ; he was ratified as prince-elector of Hanover in 1708 . After the deaths in 1714 of his mother and his second cousin Anne , Queen of Great Britain ( r. 1702-1714 ) , George ascended the British throne as Anne 's closest living Protestant relative under the Act of Settlement 1701 . Jacobites attempted , but failed , to depose George and replace him with James Francis Edward Stuart , Anne 's Catholic half-brother . During George 's reign , the powers of the monarchy diminished and Britain began a transition to the modern system of cabinet government led by a prime minister . Towards the end of his reign , actual political power was held by Robert Walpole , now recognised as Britain 's first de facto prime minister . George died of a stroke on a trip to his native Hanover , where he was buried . He is the most recent British monarch to be buried outside the United Kingdom .",

It was de facto dissolved by an emergency decree transferring powers of the Prussian government to German Chancellor Franz von Papen in 1932 and de jure by an Allied decree in 1947 . For centuries , the House of Hohenzollern ruled Prussia , successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army . Prussia , with its capital first in K\u00f6nigsberg and then , in 1701 , in Berlin , decisively shaped the history of Germany . In 1871 , most German states ( notably excluding Austria and Switzerland ) united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership . In November 1918 , the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 1918-19 . The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republic - the Free State of Prussia , a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933 . From 1933 , Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup , when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its Gleichschaltung laws in pursuit of a unitary state . With the end of the Nazi regime , in 1945 , the division of Germany into Allied occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the Oder-Neisse line , which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union , the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto . Prussia existed de jure until its formal abolition by the Allied Control Council Enactment No . 46 of 25 February 1947 . The name Prussia derives from the Old Prussians ; in the 13th century , the Teutonic Knights - an organized Catholic medieval military order of German crusaders - conquered the lands inhabited by them .",

George is the most recent British monarch born outside Great Britain : he was born and brought up in northern Germany .

After the deaths of Sophia and Anne , Queen of Great Britain , in 1714 , his father , the Elector of Hanover , became George I of Great Britain . In the first years of his father 's reign as king , George was associated with opposition politicians , until they rejoined the governing party in 1720 .

As elector , he spent twelve summers in Hanover , where he had more direct control over government policy . He had a difficult relationship with his eldest son , Frederick , who supported the parliamentary opposition . During the War of the Austrian Succession , George participated at the Battle of Dettingen in 1743 , and thus became the last British monarch to lead an army in battle .",

The Danish Monarchy is constitutional and as such , the role of the monarch is defined and limited by the Constitution of Denmark . According to the constitution , the ultimate executive authority over the government of Denmark is still by and through the monarch 's royal reserve powers ; in practice these powers are only used according to laws enacted in Parliament or within the constraints of convention .

He was a monarch of the House of Hanover , but unlike his two predecessors , he was born in Great Britain , spoke English as his first language , and never visited Hanover . George 's life and reign , which were longer than those of any of his predecessors , were marked by a series of military conflicts involving his kingdoms , much of the rest of Europe , and places farther afield in Africa , the Americas , and Asia . Early in his reign , Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years ' War , becoming the dominant European power in North America and India .

  "/wiki/Princess_Royal": "Princess Royal is a substantive title customarily ( but not automatically ) awarded by a British monarch to his or her eldest daughter . There have been seven Princesses Royal . Princess Anne is the current Princess Royal . Queen Elizabeth II was never known as the Princess Royal because her aunt , Princess Mary , was in possession of the title . The title Princess Royal came into existence when Queen Henrietta Maria ( 1609-1669 ) , daughter of Henry IV , King of France , and wife of King Charles I ( 1600-1649 ) , wanted to imitate the way the eldest daughter of the King of France was styled Madame Royale . Thus Princess Mary ( born 1631 ) , the daughter of Henrietta Maria and Charles , became the first Princess Royal in 1642 . Princess Mary ( later Queen Mary II ) ( 1662-1694 ) , eldest daughter of King James II and VII , and Princess Sophia Dorothea ( 1687-1757 ) , only daughter of King George I , were eligible for this honour but did not receive it . At the time she became eligible for the title , Princess Mary was already Princess of Orange , while Sophia Dorothea was already Queen in Prussia when she became eligible for the title . Princess Louisa Maria ( 1692-1712 ) , the youngest daughter of King James II ( died 1701 ) , born after he lost his crown in the Glorious Revolution of 1688-1689 , was considered to be Princess Royal during James 's exile by Jacobites at Saint-Germain-en-Laye and was so called by Jacobites , even though she was not James 's eldest living daughter at any time during her life . Even before the title of Princess Royal came into use in England , the eldest daughter of the King or Queen of England had a special status in law . For instance , according to Magna Carta , the barons of the realm owed aids to finance the first wedding of the king 's eldest daughter , and by a statute of the 25th year of King Edward III , sleeping with the king 's eldest daughter before her marriage constitutes an act of high treason punishable by death .",

The princesses were well-educated but raised in a rigidly strict household . Though he disliked the idea of matrimony for his daughters , King George had intended to find them suitable husbands when they came of age . However , the King 's recurring bouts of madness , as well as the Queen 's desire to have her daughters live their lives as her companions , stopped would-be suitors from offering for most of the princesses . As a result , Sophia and all but one of her sisters grew up in their mother 's cloistered household , which they frequently referred to as a Nunnery . Though she never wed , rumours spread that Sophia became pregnant by Thomas Garth , an equerry of her father 's , and gave birth to an illegitimate son in the summer of 1800 . Other gossip declared the child was the product of rape by her elder brother the Duke of Cumberland , who was deeply unpopular . Historians are divided on the validity of these stories , as some believe she gave birth to Garth 's child while others call them tales spread by the Royal Family 's political enemies .

Although William did not engage in politics as much as his brother or his father , he was the last monarch to appoint a British prime minister contrary to the will of Parliament . He granted his German kingdom a short-lived liberal constitution .
