  "/wiki/Smilodon": "Smilodon is a genus of the extinct machairodont subfamily of the felids . It is one of the most famous prehistoric mammals , and the best known saber-toothed cat . Although commonly known as the saber-toothed tiger , it was not closely related to the tiger or other modern cats . Smilodon lived in the Americas during the Pleistocene epoch ( 2.5 mya - 10,000 years ago ) . The genus was named in 1842 , based on fossils from Brazil . Three species are recognized today : S. gracilis , S. fatalis , and S. populator . The two latter species were probably descended from S. gracilis , which itself probably evolved from Megantereon . The hundreds of individuals obtained from the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles constitute the largest collection of Smilodon fossils . Overall , Smilodon was more robustly built than any extant cat , with particularly well-developed forelimbs and exceptionally long upper canine teeth . Its jaw had a bigger gape than that of modern cats , and its upper canines were slender and fragile , being adapted for precision killing . S. gracilis was the smallest species at 55 to 100 kg ( 120 to 220 lb ) in weight . S. fatalis had a weight of 160 to 280 kg ( 350 to 620 lb ) and height of 100 cm ( 39 in ) .",

  "/wiki/Bobcat": "The bobcat ( Lynx rufus ) is a medium-sized North American cat that first appeared during the Irvingtonian stage around 1.8 million years ago ( AEO ) . Containing two recognized subspecies , it ranges from southern Canada to central Mexico , including most of the contiguous United States . The bobcat is an adaptable predator that inhabits wooded areas , as well as semidesert , urban edge , forest edge , and swampland environments . It remains in some of its original range , but populations are vulnerable to local extinction ( extirpation ) by coyotes and domestic animals . With a gray to brown coat , whiskered face , and black-tufted ears , the bobcat resembles the other species of the midsized genus Lynx . It is smaller on average than the Canada lynx , with which it shares parts of its range , but is about twice as large as the domestic cat . It has distinctive black bars on its forelegs and a black-tipped , stubby ( or bobbed ) tail , from which it derives its name . Though the bobcat prefers rabbits and hares , it hunts insects , chickens , geese and other birds , small rodents , and deer . Prey selection depends on location and habitat , season , and abundance . Like most cats , the bobcat is territorial and largely solitary , although with some overlap in home ranges . It uses several methods to mark its territorial boundaries , including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces . The bobcat breeds from winter into spring and has a gestation period of about two months .",

The tiger , lion , leopard , and jaguar are the only cat species with the anatomical structure that enables them to roar . The primary reason for this was formerly assumed to be the incomplete ossification of the hyoid bone .

It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator , requiring large contiguous areas of habitat , which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring . Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years , before they become independent and leave their mother 's home range to establish their own . The tiger once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin , and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda islands .

Today 's tiger range is fragmented , stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent and Sumatra .

Most of the films were written and directed by Blake Edwards , with theme music composed by Henry Mancini . Elements and characters inspired by the films were adapted into other media , including books , comic books and animated series .

Mascots are also used as fictional , representative spokespeople for consumer products , such as the rabbit used in advertising and marketing for the General Mills brand of breakfast cereal , Trix . In the world of sports , mascots are also used for merchandising . Team mascots are often related to their respective team nicknames . This is especially true when the team 's nickname is something that is a living animal and/or can be made to have humanlike characteristics . For more abstract nicknames , the team may opt to have an unrelated character serve as the mascot . For example , the athletic teams of the University of Alabama are nicknamed the Crimson Tide , while their mascot is an elephant named Big Al . Team mascots may take the form of a logo , person , live animal , inanimate object , or a costumed character , and often appear at team matches and other related events , sports mascots are often used as marketing tools for their teams to children . Since the mid-20th century , costumed characters have provided teams with an opportunity to choose a fantasy creature as their mascot , as is the case with the Philadelphia Phillies ' mascot , the Phillie Phanatic , and the Philadelphia Flyers ' mascot , Gritty . Costumed mascots are commonplace , and are regularly used as goodwill ambassadors in the community for their team , company , or organization such as the U.S. Forest Service 's Smokey Bear .",
  "/wiki/Wildcat": "The wildcat is a species complex comprising two small wild cat species , the European wildcat ( Felis silvestris ) and the African wildcat ( F. lybica ) . The European wildcat inhabits forests in Europe and the Caucasus , while the African wildcat inhabits semi-arid landscapes and steppes in Africa , the Arabian Peninsula , Central Asia , into western India and western China . The wildcat species differ in fur pattern , tail , and size : the European wildcat has long fur and a bushy tail with a rounded tip ; the smaller African wildcat is more faintly striped , has short sandy-gray fur and a tapering tail ; the Asiatic wildcat ( F. lybica ornata ) is spotted . The wildcat and the other members of the cat family had a common ancestor about 10-15 million years ago . The European wildcat evolved during the Cromerian Stage about 866,000 to 478,000 years ago ; its direct ancestor was Felis lunensis . The silvestris and lybica lineages probably diverged about 173,000 years ago . The wildcat has been categorized as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2002 , since it is widely distributed , and the global population is considered stable and exceeding 20,000 mature individuals . However , in some range countries both wildcat species are considered threatened by introgressive hybridisation with the domestic cat ( F. catus ) and transmission of diseases . Localized threats include being hit by vehicles , and persecution . The association of African wildcats and humans appears to have developed along with the establishment of settlements during the Neolithic Revolution , when rodents in grain stores of early farmers attracted wildcats . This association ultimately led to it being tamed and domesticated : the domestic cat is the direct descendant of the African wildcat . It was one of the revered cats in ancient Egypt .",
