  "/wiki/Municipalities_of_Albania": "Municipalities ( ) are the second-level administrative divisions of Albania . Prior to 2015 , there were two types of municipalities in Albania : municipalities with an urban character called bashki , and municipalities with a rural character called komun\u00eb ( commune ) . Municipalities are all divided into at least two administrative units ( nj\u00ebsi administrative ) , which are sometimes referred to as municipal units or units of local governance . Administrative units are composed of one or more cities , villages , or neighbourhoods and constitute the third- and final-level administrative divisions of Albania . In 2014 , the government introduced a new administrative scheme that was implemented in June 2015 with local elections , whereby municipalities were reduced to 61 in total and rural komuna were abolished . Most defunct municipalities are now administrative units and may also be cities , villages , or neighbourhoods .",
