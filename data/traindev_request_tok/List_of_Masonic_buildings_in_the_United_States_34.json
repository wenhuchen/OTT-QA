  "/wiki/Contributing_property": "In the law regulating historic districts in the United States , a contributing property or contributing resource is any building , object , or structure which adds to the historical integrity or architectural qualities that make the historic district , listed locally or federally , significant . Government agencies , at the state , national , and local level in the United States , have differing definitions of what constitutes a contributing property but there are common characteristics . Local laws often regulate the changes that can be made to contributing structures within designated historic districts . The first local ordinances dealing with the alteration of buildings within historic districts was in Charleston , South Carolina in 1931 . Properties within a historic district fall into one of two types of property : contributing and non-contributing . A contributing property , such as a 19th-century mansion , helps make a historic district historic , while a non-contributing property , such as a modern medical clinic , does not . The contributing properties are key to a historic district 's historic associations , historic architectural qualities , or archaeological qualities . A property can change from contributing to non-contributing and vice versa if significant alterations take place .",

A Colonial Revival structure built in 1890 , it has played important parts both in the city 's industry and in its society . The house was constructed for a Mr. Goodwin , a leader in the pottery industry . At this time , pottery was East Liverpool 's dominant industry ; potters began to exploit favorable types of clay soil in the 1830s , and several decades later , it was a deep part of the city 's identity as well as its economy . :5 Like most buildings in the city 's central business district , :2 the house is a masonry structure : its foundation is stone , and its walls are built primarily of brick . After Goodwin left the house , it became the home of his nephew , Homer Knowles , who was likewise a major figure in the city 's pottery industry . Knowles only lived in the house for a short time , selling it to the city 's Masonic lodge in 1910 . Soon after buying the house , the Masons modified the house for their purposes : they enclosed the front porch and expanded the overall facade of the building to provide more interior room for their meetings . These modifications were carried out in the spirit of the original construction : the same types of materials were used as when the house was erected , and additions such as the extended roof and new dormers were built to appear identical to the original features . In 1985 , the Godwin-Knowles House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places , due to its significance in local history . Due to the care exercised by the Masons in their 1910s renovations and few changes after that date , it closely resembles the grand mansion constructed in 1890 .

  "/wiki/Colonial_Revival_architecture": "The Colonial Revival architectural style seeks to revive elements of American colonial architecture . The beginnings of the Colonial Revival style are often attributed to the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 , which reawakened Americans to the architectural traditions of their colonial past . Fairly small numbers of Colonial Revival homes were built c. 1880-1910 , a period when Queen Anne-style architecture was dominant in the United States . From 1910-1930 , the Colonial Revival movement was ascendant , with about 40% of U.S. homes built during this period in the Colonial Revival style . In the immediate post-war period ( c. 1950s-early 1960s ) , Colonial Revival homes continued to be constructed , but in simplified form . In the present-day , many New Traditional homes draw from Colonial Revival styles . While the dominant influences in Colonial Revival style are Georgian and Federal architecture , Colonial Revival homes also draw , to a lesser extent , from the Dutch Colonial style and post-medieval English styles . Colonial Revival homes are often eclectic in style , freely combining aspects from several of these prototypes . Although associated with the architectural movement , Colonial Revival also refers to historic preservation , landscape architecture and garden design , and decorative arts movements that emulate or draw inspiration from colonial forms . Cyril M. Harris 's American Architecture : An Illustrated Encyclopedia noted that Colonial Revival houses are usually the result of a rather free interpretation of their prototypes ; they tend to be larger , may differ significantly from the houses they seek to emulate , and often exaggerate architectural details .",

Under the broad designation Renaissance architecture nineteenth-century architects and critics went beyond the architectural style which began in Florence and central Italy in the early 15th century as an expression of Renaissance humanism ; they also included styles we would identify as Mannerist or Baroque . Self-applied style designations were rife in the mid- and later nineteenth century : Neo-Renaissance might be applied by contemporaries to structures that others called Italianate , or when many French Baroque features are present ( Second Empire ) . The divergent forms of Renaissance architecture in different parts of Europe , particularly in France and Italy , has added to the difficulty of defining and recognizing Neo-Renaissance architecture . A comparison between the breadth of its source material , such as the English Wollaton Hall , Italian Palazzo Pitti , the French Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord , and the Russian Palace of Facets - all deemed Renaissance - illustrates the variety of appearances the same architectural label can take ."
