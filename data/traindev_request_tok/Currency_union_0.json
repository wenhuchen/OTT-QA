On 18 July 1995 , the previously dormant Soufri\u00e8re Hills volcano , in the southern part of the island , became active . Eruptions destroyed Montserrat 's Georgian era capital city of Plymouth . Between 1995 and 2000 , two-thirds of the island 's population was forced to flee , primarily to the United Kingdom , leaving fewer than 1,200 people on the island in 1997 ( rising to nearly 5,000 by 2016 ) .

  "/wiki/Economic_and_monetary_union": "An economic and monetary union ( MCU ) is a type of trade bloc that features a combination of a common market , customs union , and monetary union . Established via a trade pact , an MCU constitutes the sixth of seven stages in the process of economic integration . An MCU agreement usually combines a customs union with a common market . A typical MCU establishes free trade and a common external tariff throughout its jurisdiction . It is also designed to protect freedom in the movement of goods , services , and people . This arrangement is distinct from a monetary union ( e.g. , the Latin Monetary Union ) , which does not usually involve a common market . As with the economic and monetary union established among the 28 member states of the European Union ( EU ) , an MCU may affect different parts of its jurisdiction in different ways . Some areas are subject to separate customs regulations from other areas subject to the MCU . These various arrangements may be established in a formal agreement , or they may exist on a de facto basis . For example , not all EU member states use the Euro established by its currency union , and not all EU member states are part of the Schengen Area .

With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia .

Since its independence , Latvia has been referred to as one of the Baltic states . It is bordered by Estonia to the north , Lithuania to the south , Russia to the east , Belarus to the southeast , and shares a maritime border with Sweden to the west . Latvia has 1,957,200 inhabitants and a territory of 64,589 km2 ( 24,938 sq mi ) . The country has a temperate seasonal climate . The Baltic Sea moderates climate , although it has four distinct seasons and snowy winters . After centuries of Swedish , Polish and Russian rule , a rule mainly executed by the Baltic German aristocracy , the Republic of Latvia was established on 18 November 1918 when it broke away from the Russian Empire and declared independence in the aftermath of World War I . However , by the 1930s the country became increasingly autocratic after the coup in 1934 establishing an authoritarian regime under K\u0101rlis Ulmanis . The country 's de facto independence was interrupted at the outset of World War II , beginning with Latvia 's forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union , followed by the invasion and occupation by Nazi Germany in 1941 , and the re-occupation by the Soviets in 1944 ( Courland Pocket in 1945 ) to form the Latvian SSR for the next 45 years . The peaceful Singing Revolution , starting in 1987 , called for Baltic emancipation from Soviet rule and condemning the Communist regime 's illegal takeover . It ended with the Declaration on the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia on 4 May 1990 and restoring de facto independence on 21 August 1991 . Latvia is a democratic sovereign state , parliamentary republic and a very highly developed country according to the United Nations Human Development Index .",
  "/wiki/Lithuania": "The first known record of the name of Lithuania ( Lithuanian : Lietuva ) is in a 9 March 1009 story of Saint Bruno in the Quedlinburg Chronicle . The Chronicle recorded a Latinized form of the name Lietuva : Litua ( pronounced [ litua ] ) . Due to the lack of reliable evidence , the true meaning of the name is unknown . Nowadays , scholars still debate the meaning of the word and there are a few plausible versions . Since Lietuva has a suffix ( -uva ) , the original word should have no suffix . [ citation needed ] A likely candidate is Liet\u0101 . Because many Baltic ethnonyms originated from hydronyms , linguists have searched for its origin among local hydronyms . Usually , such names evolved through the following process : hydronym \u2192 toponym \u2192 ethnonym . Lietava , a small river not far from Kernav\u0117 , the core area of the early Lithuanian state and a possible first capital of the eventual Grand Duchy of Lithuania , is usually credited as the source of the name . However , the river is very small and some find it improbable that such a small and local object could have lent its name to an entire nation . On the other hand , such naming is not unprecedented in world history . Art\u016bras Dubonis proposed another hypothesis , that Lietuva relates to the word lei\u010diai ( plural of leitis ) .",

Its capital , Luxembourg City , is one of the four official capitals of the European Union ( together with Brussels , Frankfurt , and Strasbourg ) and the seat of the European Court of Justice , the highest judicial authority in the EU . Its culture , people , and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbours , making it essentially a mixture of French and German cultures , as evident by the nation 's three official languages : French , German , and the national language of Luxembourgish . The repeated invasions by Germany , especially in World War II , resulted in the country 's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and , among other things , led to the foundation of the European Union .

  "/wiki/Malta": "The origin of the name Malta is uncertain , and the modern-day variation is derived from the Maltese language . The most common etymology is that the word Malta is derived from the Greek word \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9 , meli , honey . The ancient Greeks called the island \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 ( Melit\u0113 ) meaning honey-sweet , possibly for Malta 's unique production of honey ; an endemic subspecies of bees live on the island . The Romans called the island Melita , which can be considered either a latinisation of the Greek \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 or the adaptation of the Doric Greek pronunciation of the same word \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b1 . In 1525 William Tyndale used the transliteration Melite in Acts 28:1 for \u039a\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03c9\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5 \u1f10\u03c0\u03ad\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u1f45\u03c4\u03b9 \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 \u1f21 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 as found in his translation of The New Testament that relied on Greek texts instead of Latin . Melita is the spelling used in the Authorized ( King James ) Version of 1611 and in the American Standard Version of 1901 . Malta is widely used in more recent versions , such as The Revised Standard Version of 1946 and The New International Version of 1973 . Another conjecture suggests that the word Malta comes from the Phoenician word Maleth , a haven , or 'port ' in reference to Malta 's many bays and coves .

The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia 's Riau Islands , its northern , western , and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia , and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east . It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south , and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans , being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east . The country 's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets , the combined area of which has increased by almost 25% since the country 's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects . Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history , modern Singapore , then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate , was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles , a British colonial officer , established a trading post of the East India Company on the island . In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond .

Christmas Island is located in the Indian Ocean , around 350 kilometres ( 220 mi ) south of Java and Sumatra and around 1,550 kilometres ( 960 mi ) north-west of the closest point on the Australian mainland . It has an area of 135 square kilometres ( 52 sq mi ) . Christmas Island had a population of 1,843 residents as of 2016 [ update ] , the majority of whom live in settlements on the northern tip of the island . The main settlement is Flying Fish Cove . Historically , Asian Australians of Chinese , Malay , and Indian descent collectively formed the vast majority of the population . Today , around two-thirds of the island 's population is estimated to have Malaysian Chinese or Singaporean Chinese origin ( though just 21.2% of the population declared a Chinese ancestry in 2016 ) , with significant numbers of Malays and European Australians and smaller numbers of Malaysian Indians and Eurasians . Several languages are in use , including English , Malay , and various Chinese dialects . Islam and Buddhism are major religions on the island , though a vast majority of the population does not declare a formal religious affiliation and may be involved in ethnic Chinese religion . [ original research ? ] The first European to sight the island was Richard Rowe of the Thomas in 1615 .

It is part of Southeast Asia and is in the Southern Hemisphere . The territory 's dual name ( official since the islands incorporation into Australia in 1955 ) reflects that the islands have historically been known as either the Cocos Islands or the Keeling Islands . The territory consists of two atolls made up of 27 coral islands , of which only two - West Island and Home Island - are inhabited . The population of around 600 people consists mainly of Cocos Malays , who mostly practise Sunni Islam and speak a dialect of Malay as their first language . The territory is administered by the Australian federal government 's Department of Infrastructure , Regional Development and Cities , and together with Christmas Island ( which is about 960 kilometres ( 600 mi ) to the east ) forms the Australian Indian Ocean Territories administrative unit . However , the islanders do have a degree of self-government through the local shire council . Many public services - including health , education , and policing - are provided by the state of Western Australia , and Western Australian law applies except where the federal government has determined otherwise . The islands were first discovered in 1609 by William Keeling , but no settlement occurred until the early 19th century . One of the first settlers was John Clunies-Ross , a Scottish merchant ; much of the island 's current population is descended from the Malay workers he brought in to work his copra plantation . The Clunies-Ross family ruled the islands as a private fiefdom for almost 150 years , with the head of the family usually recognised as resident magistrate . The British formally annexed the islands in 1857 , and for the next century they were officially administered from either Ceylon or Singapore .",

The island country lies east-northeast of the Santa Cruz Islands ( which belong to the Solomon Islands ) , southeast of Nauru , south of Kiribati , west of Tokelau , northwest of Samoa and Wallis and Futuna , and north of Fiji . It is composed of three reef islands and six true atolls spread out between the latitude of 5\u00b0 to 10\u00b0 south and longitude of 176\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 , west of the International Date Line . Tuvalu has a population of 11,192 ( 2017 census ) . The total land area of the islands of Tuvalu is 26 square kilometres ( 10 sq mi ) . The first inhabitants of Tuvalu were Polynesians . The origins of the people of Tuvalu are addressed in the theories regarding migration into the Pacific that began about three thousand years ago . During pre-European-contact times there was frequent canoe voyaging between the islands as Polynesian navigation skills are recognised to have allowed deliberate journeys on double-hull sailing canoes or outrigger canoes . The pattern of settlement that is believed to have occurred is that the Polynesians spread out from Samoa and Tonga into the Tuvaluan atolls , with Tuvalu providing a stepping stone to further migration into the Polynesian outliers in Melanesia and Micronesia . In 1568 , Spanish navigator \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a was the first European to sail through the archipelago , sighting the island of Nui during his expedition in search of Terra Australis . The island of Funafuti was named Ellice 's Island in 1819 ; the name Ellice was applied to all of the nine islands after the work of English hydrographer Alexander George Findlay . The Ellice Islands came into Great Britain 's sphere of influence in the late 19th century , as the result of a treaty between Great Britain and Germany relating to the demarcation of the spheres of influence in the Pacific Ocean .",

The landscape is dominated by the Rock of Gibraltar at the foot of which is a densely populated town area , home to over 32,000 people , primarily Gibraltarians . In 1704 , Anglo-Dutch forces captured Gibraltar from Spain during the War of the Spanish Succession on behalf of the Habsburg claim to the Spanish throne . The territory was ceded to Great Britain in perpetuity under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 . During World War II it was an important base for the Royal Navy as it controlled the entrance and exit to the Mediterranean Sea , the Strait of Gibraltar , which is only 14.3 km ( 8.9 mi ) wide at this naval choke point . It remains strategically important , with half the world 's seaborne trade passing through the strait . Today Gibraltar 's economy is based largely on tourism , online gambling , financial services and cargo ship refuelling . The sovereignty of Gibraltar is a point of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations because Spain asserts a claim to the territory .

It is the second-closest of the Channel Islands to France , after Alderney . Jersey was part of the Duchy of Normandy , whose dukes went on to become kings of England from 1066 . After Normandy was lost by the kings of England in the 13th century , and the ducal title surrendered to France , Jersey and the other Channel Islands remained attached to the English crown .

Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin .

Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal , fungal , and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , and its most populous city is Auckland .

The territory of Russia extends from the Baltic Sea in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east , and from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea and the Caucasus in the south . With 146.7 million inhabitants living in the country 's 85 federal subjects as of 2020 , Russia is the most populous nation in Europe and the ninth-most populous nation in the world . Russia 's capital and largest city is Moscow ; other major urban areas include Saint Petersburg , Novosibirsk , Yekaterinburg , Nizhny Novgorod , Kazan and Chelyabinsk . The East Slavs emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD . Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants , the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century . In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire , beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium . Rus ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states , until it was finally reunified by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th century . By the 18th century , the nation had greatly expanded through conquest , annexation , and exploration to become the Russian Empire , which was the third largest empire in history , stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east . Following the Russian Revolution , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) became the largest and leading constituent of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR/Soviet Union ) , the world 's first constitutionally socialist state .",

It lies in the South Caucasus on the eastern coast of the Black Sea , south of the Greater Caucasus mountains in northwestern Georgia . It covers 8,660 square kilometres ( 3,340 sq mi ) and has a population of around 240,000 . Its capital is Sukhumi . The status of Abkhazia is a central issue of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict and Georgia-Russia relations . The polity is recognised as a state by Russia , Venezuela , Nicaragua , Nauru and Syria . While Georgia lacks control over Abkhazia , the Georgian government and most United Nations member states consider Abkhazia legally part of Georgia , whose constitution designates the area as the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia . The region had autonomy within Soviet Georgia at the time when the Soviet Union began to disintegrate in the late 1980s . Simmering ethnic tensions between the Abkhaz - the region 's titular ethnicity - and Georgians - the largest single ethnic group at that time - culminated in the 1992-1993 War in Abkhazia which resulted in Georgia 's loss of control of most of Abkhazia , the de facto independence of Abkhazia , and the ethnic cleansing of Georgians from Abkhazia . Despite the 1994 ceasefire agreement and years of negotiations , the dispute remains unresolved . The long-term presence of a United Nations Observer Mission and a Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) peacekeeping force failed to prevent the flare-up of violence on several occasions . In August 2008 , Abkhaz and Russian forces fought a war against Georgian forces , which led to the formal recognition of Abkhazia by Russia , the annulment of the 1994 ceasefire agreement , and the termination of the UN mission .",

It has a population of 53,000 people who live in an area of 3,900 km2 , south of the Russian Caucasus , with 30,000 living in Tskhinvali . The separatist polity , Republic of South Ossetia ( or the State of Alania ) , is recognized as a state by Russia , Venezuela , Nicaragua , Nauru , and Syria . While Georgia lacks control over South Ossetia , the Georgian government and most members of the United Nations consider the territory part of Georgia , whose constitution designates the area as the former autonomous district of South Ossetia , in reference to the former Soviet autonomous oblast disbanded in 1990 . Georgia does not recognize the existence of South Ossetia as a political entity , and therefore its territory does not correspond to any Georgian administrative area ( although Provisional Administration of South Ossetia was created by the Georgian authorities as a transitional measure leading to the settlement of South Ossetia 's status ) , with most of the territory included into Shida Kartli region . The area is often informally referred to as the legally undefined Tskhinvali Region [ nb 1 ] in Georgia and in international organisations when neutrality is deemed necessary . South Ossetia declared independence from the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1991 . The Georgian government responded by abolishing South Ossetia 's autonomy and trying to re-establish its control over the region by force . The crisis escalation led to the 1991-92 South Ossetia War . Georgian fighting against those controlling South Ossetia occurred on two other occasions , in 2004 and 2008 . The latter conflict led to the Russo-Georgian War , during which Ossetian and Russian forces gained full de facto control of the territory of the former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast . In the wake of the 2008 war , Georgia and a significant part of the international community consider South Ossetia to be occupied by the Russian military .",

The remaining population consists of Africa 's largest communities of European , Asian ( Indian ) , and multiracial ( Coloured ) ancestry . South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures , languages , and religions . Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution 's recognition of 11 official languages , which is the fourth-highest number in the world . Two of these languages are of European origin : Afrikaans developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most coloured and white South Africans ; English reflects the legacy of British colonialism , and is commonly used in public and commercial life , though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language . The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'\u00e9tat , and regular elections have been held for almost a century . However , the vast majority of black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994 .
