  "/wiki/Hurricane_Manuel": "Hurricane Manuel ( ) was the most destructive eastern Pacific tropical cyclone on record . Manuel brought widespread flooding across much of Mexico in September 2013 , along with Hurricane Ingrid , which hit the opposite side of the nation the same day as Manuel , the first such occurrence since 1958 . The fifteenth named storm and seventh hurricane of the annual hurricane season , Manuel originated from a strong area of low pressure south of Acapulco on September 13 . Within favorable conditions aloft , the storm intensified into a tropical storm as it tracked northward . The following day , Manuel curved westward and strengthened to a point just shy of hurricane intensity before making its first landfall at that intensity on September 15 . Due to interaction with land , the tropical storm quickly weakened , and its center dissipated over western Mexico on September 16 . However , the storm 's remnants continued to track northwestward into the Gulf of California , where they reorganized into a tropical cyclone the next day . Manuel regained tropical storm status on September 18 as it began to curve northeastward . Shortly thereafter , Manuel attained Category 1 hurricane intensity , before making its final landfall just west of Culiac\u00e1n at peak intensity . Over land , Manuel quickly weakened due to interaction with Mexico 's high terrain , and the storm dissipated early on September 20 . Due to the impending threat of Manuel , several Mexican municipalities were put under disaster alerts . Upon making its first landfall , Manuel caused extreme flooding in southern Mexico .",
  "/wiki/2013_Pacific_hurricane_season": "The 2013 Pacific hurricane season was the costliest Pacific hurricane season on record , with a total of about $ 4.56 billion in damages , most of which was attributed to Hurricane Manuel of that year . The season was also the first to see twenty named storms since 2009 , although many of the storms were weak . The season officially began on May 15 , 2013 in the Eastern Pacific and started on June 1 , 2013 in the Central Pacific . Both ended on November 30 , 2013 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the eastern Pacific basin . However , the formation of a storm is possible at any time . The second storm of the season , Hurricane Barbara , brought widespread heavy rains to much of Southwestern Mexico and Central America . Damage estimates from the storm range from $ 50 to $ 356 million ( 2013 USD ) ; four people were killed and four others are reportedly missing . In addition to Barbara , Hurricane Cosme killed three people despite remaining far offshore the Mexican coast . Hurricane Erick also brought slight effects to the region as well , killing two people . Later that month , Tropical Storm Flossie threatened to become the first storm to strike Hawaii in 20 years , causing minimal damage . Ivo and Juliette both threatened Baja California Sur , and the former triggered flash floods across the Southwestern United States .",
  "/wiki/Hurricane_Iniki": "Hurricane Iniki ( ; Hawaiian : iniki meaning strong and piercing wind ) was the most powerful hurricane to strike the U.S. state of Hawaii in recorded history . Forming on September 5 , 1992 , during the strong 1990-1995 El Ni\u00f1o , Iniki was one of eleven Central Pacific tropical cyclones during that season . It attained tropical storm status on September 8 and further intensified into a hurricane the next day . After turning north , Iniki struck the island of Kauai on September 11 at peak intensity ; it had winds of 145 mph and reached Category 4 status on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale . It had recorded wind gusts of 225 as evidenced by an anemometer that was found blown into the forest during clean up . It was the first hurricane to hit the state since Hurricane Iwa in the 1982 season , and the first major hurricane since Hurricane Dot in 1959 . Iniki dissipated on September 13 about halfway between Hawaii and Alaska . Iniki caused around $ 3.1 billion ( 1992 USD ) in damage and six deaths , making it the second-costliest Pacific hurricane on record . At the time , Iniki was among the costliest United States hurricanes . The storm struck just weeks after Hurricane Andrew , the costliest tropical cyclone ever at the time , struck Florida . The Central Pacific Hurricane Center ( CPHC ) failed to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches 24 hours in advance . Despite the lack of early warning , only six deaths ensued .",
  "/wiki/1992_Pacific_hurricane_season": "The 1992 Pacific hurricane season is the most active Pacific hurricane season on record , featuring 27 named storms , and the second-costliest Pacific hurricane season in history , behind the 2013 season . The season also produced the second-highest ACE value on record in the basin , only surpassed by the 2018 season . The season officially started on May 15 in the eastern Pacific , and on June 1 in the central Pacific , and lasted until November 30 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean . However , these bounds were easily exceeded when Hurricane Ekeka formed on January 28 and again a couple months later with Tropical Storm Hali . The most notable storm was Hurricane Iniki , which caused billions of dollars of damage to the Hawaiian Islands , primarily in Kauai , along with six casualties . Hurricanes Lester , Virgil , Winifred , and Orlene also made landfall and killed several people , but were significantly less destructive . Hurricane Darby and Tropical Storm Agatha brought rains and more destruction to Mexico , without making landfall . Hurricane Tina was , in addition to being the strongest storm of the year , the longest-lasting Pacific hurricane at the time .",
  "/wiki/Hurricane_Odile_(2014)": "Hurricane Odile is tied for the most intense landfalling tropical cyclone in the Baja California Peninsula during the satellite era and the seventh-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2014 . Sweeping across the peninsula in September 2014 , Odile inflicted widespread damage , particularly in the state of Baja California Sur , in addition to causing lesser impacts on the Mexican mainland and Southwestern United States . The precursor to Odile developed into a tropical depression south of Mexico on September 10 and quickly reached tropical storm strength . After meandering for several days , Odile began to track northwestward , intensifying to hurricane status before rapidly reaching its Category 4 hurricane peak intensity on September 14 . The cyclone slightly weakened before making landfall near Cabo San Lucas with winds of 125 mph ( 205 km/h ) . Odile gradually weakened as it tracked across the length of the Baja California Peninsula , briefly crossing into the Gulf of California before degenerating into a remnant system on September 17 . These remnants tracked northeastward across the Southwestern United States before they were no longer identifiable on September 19 . Initially , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) forecast that Odile would track westward and avoid land as it would curve out to sea . Accordingly , the local governments of southwestern Mexico initially posted minor weather alerts . Precautionary measures on the Baja California Peninsula began in earnest after Odile unexpectedly took a direct course towards the peninsula . Several municipalities declared a state of emergency , opening 164 shelters with a total capacity of 30,000 people . Due to the unanticipated threat of Odile , approximately 26,000 foreign tourists were stranded on the peninsula at the time of landfall .",
  "/wiki/2014_Pacific_hurricane_season": "The 2014 Pacific hurricane season was the fifth-busiest season since reliable records began in 1949 , alongside the 2016 season . The season officially started on May 15 in the East Pacific Ocean , and on June 1 in the Central Pacific ; they both ended on November 30 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Pacific basin . Entering the season , expectations of tropical activity were high , with most weather agencies predicting a near or above average season . The season began with an active start , with three tropical cyclones developing before June 15 , including two Category 4 hurricanes , of which one became the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in May in the East Pacific . After a less active period in late June and early July , activity once again picked up in late July . Activity increased in August , which featured four major hurricanes , and persisted throughout September and October . However , activity finally waned by early November . Overall , the 22 tropical storms marked the highest total in 22 years . In addition , a record-tying 16 hurricanes developed . Furthermore , there were total of nine major hurricanes , Category 3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale , including a then-record-tying eight in Eastern Pacific proper ( east of 140\u00b0W ) . The active season resulted in numerous records and highlights .",
  "/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Agatha": "Tropical Storm Agatha was a weak but catastrophic tropical cyclone that brought widespread floods to much of Central America , and was the deadliest tropical cyclone in the eastern Pacific since Hurricane Pauline in 1997 . The first storm of the 2010 Pacific hurricane season , Agatha originated from the Intertropical Convergence Zone , a region of thunderstorms across the tropics . It developed into a tropical depression on May 29 and tropical storm later , it was dissipated on May 30 , reaching top winds of 45 mph ( and a lowest pressure of 1000 mbar ( hPa ; 29.53 inHg ) . It made landfall near the Guatemala-Mexico border on the evening of May 29 . Agatha produced torrential rain all across Central America , which resulted in the death of one person in Nicaragua . In Guatemala , 152 people were killed and 100 left missing by landslides . Thirteen deaths also occurred in El Salvador . Agatha soon dissipated over Guatemala . As of June 15 , officials in Guatemala have stated that 165 people were killed and 113 others are missing . In all , Agatha caused at least 204 fatalities , and roughly $ 1.1 billion in damage throughout Central America . After the season the name Agatha was not retired , and therefore was used again in the 2016 season .",

It officially started on May 15 , 2010 for the eastern Pacific , and June 1 for the central Pacific , and officially ended on November 30 . Unlike the previous season , the first storm of the season , Agatha , formed during the month of May . Agatha developed on May 29 near the coast of Guatemala . In the second week of June , a sudden spree of tropical cyclones developed , and between June 16 and 22 , four cyclones formed , including the two major hurricanes of the season , Celia and Darby , the first of which reached Category 5 intensity . However , following the record active June , July saw zero named storms . In August and September only 2 tropical storms and one hurricane formed . Tropical Depression Eleven-E caused a great deal of flooding in southern Mexico , causing millions of dollars in damage , as well as causing over 50 deaths and $ 500 million in damage in areas of Oaxaca and Guatemala . Tropical Storm Omeka was a rare off-season storm .",
  "/wiki/Hurricane_Willa": "Hurricane Willa was the fifth costliest Pacific hurricane on record , as well as the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall in the Mexican state of Sinaloa since Lane in 2006 . The twenty-fifth tropical cyclone , twenty-second named storm , thirteenth hurricane , tenth major hurricane , and record-tying third Category 5 hurricane of the 2018 Pacific hurricane season , Willa originated from a tropical wave that the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) first began monitoring for tropical cyclogenesis in the southwestern Caribbean Sea , on October 14 . The system subsequently crossed over Central America into the East Pacific , without significant organization . The NHC continued to track the disturbance until it developed into a tropical depression on October 20 , off the coast of southwestern Mexico . Later in the day , the system became a tropical storm as it began to rapidly intensify . On October 21 , Willa became a Category 4 major hurricane , before strengthening further to Category 5 intensity on the next day . Afterward , a combination of an eyewall replacement cycle and increasing wind shear weakened the hurricane , and early on October 24 , Willa made landfall as a marginal Category 3 hurricane , in Sinaloa of the northwestern Mexico . Following landfall , Willa rapidly weakened , dissipating later on the same day over northeastern Mexico . Up to its landfall , Willa prompted the issuance of hurricane and tropical storm watches and warnings for western Mexico . The hurricane killed six people , and caused $ 825 million ( 2018 USD ) in damages , mostly around the area where it moved ashore .",

The season officially began on May 15 in the eastern Pacific , and on June 1 in the central Pacific ; they both ended on November 30 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Pacific basin . However , tropical cyclone formation is possible at any time of the year , as illustrated when the first tropical depression formed on May 10 , five days prior to the official start of the season . The second named storm of the season , Hurricane Bud , struck Baja California Sur in mid-June , causing minor damage . Tropical Storm Carlotta stalled offshore of the Mexican coastline , where it also caused minor damage . In early August , Hurricane Hector became one of the few tropical cyclones to cross into the Western Pacific from the Eastern Pacific , while also affecting Hawaii . A few weeks later , Hurricane Lane obtained Category 5 intensity while also becoming Hawaii 's wettest tropical cyclone on record , and the second wettest tropical cyclone in US history , only behind Hurricane Harvey of the previous year . Hurricane Olivia also struck Hawaii , resulting in slight damage . In late September , Hurricanes Rosa and Sergio formed , both of which eventually brought thunderstorms and flash flooding to the Baja California Peninsula and the Southwestern United States .",
  "/wiki/Hurricane_Madeline_(1998)": "Hurricane Madeline was the final tropical cyclone of the 1998 Pacific hurricane season . Madeline originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the coast of Africa on September 25 , 1998 . The wave traversed the Atlantic Ocean and crossed over Central America on October 5 or 6 . Gradually , the system intensified and was classified as a tropical depression on October 16 , a tropical storm later that day , and a hurricane on October 17 . The storm reached peak winds of about southwest of San Blas , Nayarit , and after 18 hours it subsequently began to weaken . Although Madeline never made landfall , numerous rainbands affected the Mexican coast causing no known damage or fatalities . The remnant moisture moved north and contributed to flooding in central Texas , which killed 31 people and caused $ 750 million ( 1998 USD ) in damage .",

The season officially started on May 15 in the eastern Pacific and on June 1 in the central Pacific , and ended on November 30 ; these dates conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in that region . The first tropical cyclone developed on June 11 , about ten days later than the normal start of the season . The final storm of the year , Hurricane Madeline , dissipated on October 20 . Storm activity in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's warning zone was low , with just one tropical depression observed in the region . Two tropical cyclones from the eastern Pacific ( Darby and Estelle ) also entered the central Pacific ; the former did so as a hurricane . The most notable tropical cyclone of the year was Hurricane Isis , which killed fourteen people when it made landfall on southern Baja California Sur and coastal Sinaloa in Mexico . Isis caused considerable damage in the nation while destroying more than 700 homes and damaging dozens of cars . It later produced sporadic rainfall in the southwestern United States , leading to some traffic accidents . In addition to Isis , Tropical Storm Javier moved ashore the coast of Jalisco in Mexico ; the nation experienced indirect effects from four other storms , all of which remained offshore . One tropical cyclone , Hurricane Lester , affected Central America , causing two deaths in Guatemala .",
  "/wiki/Hurricane_Rosa_(1994)": "Hurricane Rosa was the only Pacific hurricane to make landfall during the above-average 1994 Pacific hurricane season . It killed at least 4 people in Mexico . Moisture from the hurricane was a factor in widespread flooding in the U.S. state of Texas that killed 22 people and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage in October 1994 . The pre-Rosa tropical depression formed on October 8 before degenerating the next day . It reformed on October 10 and steadily strengthened as it approached Mexico . Ultimately peaking as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale right before landfall , Rosa was the final hurricane , nineteenth tropical storm , and second-last tropical cyclone of the 1994 Pacific hurricane season .",

The first tropical cyclone formed on June 18 , while the last system dissipated on October 26 . This season , twenty-two tropical cyclones formed in the north Pacific Ocean east of the dateline , with all but two becoming tropical storms or hurricanes . A total of 10 hurricanes occurred , including five major hurricanes . The above average activity in 1994 was contributed to the ongoing 1990-95 El Ni\u00f1o at the time . Of note in this season is an unusual spree of very intense storms ; the season was the first on record to see three Category 5 hurricanes , later tied in 2002 and 2018 . Hurricanes Emilia , Gilma , John , and Olivia all reached a pressure below 930 millibars . Longevity-wise , no tropical cyclone of any basin had previously persisted for as long as Hurricane John , which lasted 31 days .

The sixteenth named storm and tenth hurricane of the 1982 Pacific hurricane season , Paul developed as a tropical depression just offshore Central America on September 18 . The depression briefly moved inland two days later just before heading westward out to sea . The storm changed little in strength for several days until September 25 , when it slowly intensified into a tropical storm . Two days later , Paul attained hurricane status , and further strengthened to Category 2 intensity after turning northward . The hurricane then accelerated toward the northeast , reaching peak winds of 110 mph ( 175 km/h ) . Paul made landfall over Baja California Sur on September 29 , and subsequently moved ashore in Sinaloa the next day . Prior to making landfall near the El Salvador-Guatemala border as a tropical depression , the precursor disturbance dropped heavy rainfall over the region , which later continued after landfall . Many rivers in the region burst their banks after five days of rainfall , causing severe flooding and multiple mudslides . Throughout Central America , at least 1,363 people were killed , with most of the fatalities occurring in El Salvador , although some occurred in Guatemala . Another 225 deaths were attributed to floods from the depression in southern Mexico . In addition , Paul was responsible for 24 fatalities and moderate damage in northwestern Mexico , where it made landfall at hurricane strength .",

The remnants of Hurricane Olivia brought heavy rain to a wide swath of the western United States .",
  "/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Octave_(1983)": "Tropical Storm Octave was considered the worst tropical cyclone in the history of Arizona . The origins of Tropical Storm Octave were from a tropical disturbance that formed south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec on September 23 , 1983 . Steered by a deep layer high over Mexico , the disturbance moved west for four days before becoming a tropical depression on September 27 off the southwest coast of Mexico . Over an area of warm sea surface temperatures , it was able to quickly strengthen to peak winds of 50 mph ( 85 km/h ) , through wind shear prevented much further development . By September 30 , Octave was accelerating to the northeast , steadily weakening due to cooler waters . That day it weakened to tropical depression status , and on October 2 , Octave dissipated . In Arizona , the highest rainfall total was at Mount Graham . In Tucson , flood waters were reportedly 8 ft ( 2.4 m ) high . Throughout the state , excessive rainfall caused many rivers to overflow . After the rain ended , the Santa Cruz , Rillito , and Gila rivers experienced their highest crests on record . Five towns - Clifton , Duncan , Winkelman , Hayden , and Marana - were almost completely flooded . In Marana , many homes were submerged , forcing residents to be evacuated .",

And eight of the storms reached major hurricane status , or Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale ( SSHWS ) . The decaying 1982-83 El Ni\u00f1o event likely contributed to this level of activity . That same El Ni\u00f1o influenced a very quiet Atlantic hurricane season . The first storm of the season , Hurricane Adolph became the southernmost-forming east Pacific tropical cyclone on record after forming at a latitude of 7.1\u00b0N . After a slow start , activity picked up in July , when Hurricane Gil moved through the Hawaiian Islands , resulting in moderate damage . In early August , Hurricane Ismael was responsible for three deaths and $ 19 million ( 1983 USD ) in damage .",
  "/wiki/Hurricane_Norman_(1978)": "Hurricane Norman was the most recent tropical system to make landfall in California . The 14th named storm , 11th hurricane , and 6th major hurricane of the 1978 Pacific hurricane season , Norman evolved from a tropical disturbance noted southeast of Acapulco on the afternoon of August 29 , 1978 . The system moved westward and developed into a tropical depression on August 30 . Modest strengthening ensued , and the cyclone became a tropical storm that evening and a hurricane on the evening of August 31 as it turned to the west-northwest . Late on the night of September 1 , Norman became a major hurricane with an eye wide , and a nearby ship reported seas of . The center grazed the northeast side of Socorro Island on the afternoon of September 2 . Moving over cooler waters west of Baja California , the cyclone slowly weakened . By early on September 4 , moisture from the hurricane spread north into California initiating rains in the Golden State . A developing trough to its west caused the initial influx of moisture and Norman 's turn to the north as a weakening tropical storm . Eventually turning north-northeast towards southern California , the cyclone did eventually turn north-northeast towards southern California , and the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression as it passed the 30th parallel . Hurricane Norman made landfall in California on September 5 , as a minimal tropical depression . The tropical cyclone became a remnant low shortly after California landfall , and the final advisory was issued at 00:00 GMT , on September 6 .",
