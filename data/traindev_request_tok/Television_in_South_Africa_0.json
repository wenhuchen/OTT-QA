It is owned by black empowerment group eMedia Investments ( Formerly Hosken Consolidated Investments ) and Remgro , a part of the Rupert business empire . The consortium has had many changes in ownership , however the dominant player has always been HCI : it had bought out minority black shareholders who had failed to repay loans they used to purchase the Midi TV stake . Warner Bros. sold their 25% shareholding of the channel in 2001 , concerned that they would never be able to exercise full ownership : South African media ownership law restricts foreign entities to owning no more than 25% of a television channel . Marcel Golding , a former trade unionist , was controversially forced to resign as the station 's CEO in late October 2014 following the controversial purchase of shares he made in South African electronics equipment maker Ellies . HCI had insisted in court documents that the purchase of the R24 million stake in the electronics maker , which also produces digital set-top boxes , was without authorisation . Golding had in court documents , challenging his removal as CEO , stated that attempts to get rid of him was due to the ANC government wanting to control the station 's news output through direct interference .",
