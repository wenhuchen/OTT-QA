  "/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board": "The Entertainment Software Rating Board ( ESRB ) is an American self-regulatory organization that assigns age and content ratings to consumer video games . The ESRB was established in 1994 by the Entertainment Software Association ( ESA , formerly the Interactive Digital Software Association ( IDSA ) ) , in response to criticism of controversial video games with excessively violent or sexual content , particularly after the 1993 congressional hearings following the releases of Mortal Kombat and Night Trap for home consoles . The industry , pressured with potential government oversight of video game ratings from these hearings , established both the IDSA and the ESRB within it to create a voluntary ratings system based on the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system with additional considerations for video game interactivity . The board assigns ratings to games based on their content , using judgment similar to the motion picture rating systems used in many countries , using a combination of six age-based levels intended to aid consumers in determining a game 's content and suitability , along with a system of content descriptors which detail specific types of content present in a particular game . More recently , the ratings also include descriptors for games with online interactivity or in-game monetization . The ratings are determined by a combination of material provided by the game 's publisher in both questionnaires and video footage of the game , and a review of this material by a panel of reviewers who assign it a rating . The ratings are designed towards parents so they can make informed decisions about purchasing games for their children . Once a game is rated , the ESRB maintains a code of ethics for the advertising and promotion of video games - ensuring that marketing materials for games are targeted to appropriate audiences . The ESRB ratings system is enforced via the voluntary leverage of the North American video game and retail industries for physical releases ; most stores require customers to present photo identification when purchasing games carrying the ESRB 's highest age ratings , and do not stock games which have not been rated . Additionally , major console manufacturers will not license games for their systems unless they carry ESRB ratings , while console manufacturers and most stores will refuse to stock games that the ESRB has rated as being appropriate for adults only . More recently , the ESRB began offering a system to automatically assign ratings for digitally-distributed games and mobile apps , which utilizes a survey answered by the product 's publisher as opposed to a manual assessment by ESRB staff , allowing online storefronts to filter and restrict titles based on the ESRB . Through the International Age Rating Coalition ( IARC ) , this method can generate equivalent ratings for other territories .",

The gameplay is similar to that of earlier Super Mario games : Players control Mario or his brother Luigi through a series of levels in which the goal is to reach the flagpole at the end .

EarthBound had a lengthy development period that spanned five years . Its returning staff from Mother ( 1989 ) included writer/director Shigesato Itoi and lead programmer Satoru Iwata , as well as composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka , who incorporated a diverse range of styles into the soundtrack , including salsa , reggae , and dub .

Originally scheduled for release in January 1993 , the game was completed around May 1994 . Themed around an idiosyncratic portrayal of Americana and Western culture , EarthBound subverted popular role-playing game traditions by featuring a real world setting while parodying numerous staples of the genre . Itoi wanted the game to reach non-gamers with its intentionally goofy tone ; for example , the player uses items such as the Pencil Eraser to remove pencil statues , experiences in-game hallucinations , and battles piles of vomit , taxi cabs , and walking nooses . For its American release , the game was marketed with a $ 2 million promotional campaign that sardonically proclaimed this game stinks . Additionally , the game 's puns and humor were reworked by localizer Marcus Lindblom , and the title was changed from Mother 2 to avoid confusion about what it was a sequel to .

Unlike the SNES version of the first game , Final Fight 2 supports two-player simultaneous play and has a total of three playable characters . The only playable character from the first game to return is Mike Haggar . Two new player characters were introduced : Carlos Miyamoto and Maki Genryusai . In the game 's plot , the three battle the resurgent Mad Gear gang at various locations around Asia and Europe to rescue Maki 's sister and father , who are also the fianc\u00e9e and teacher respectively of Guy from the first Final Fight . Capcom followed up the game with another SNES-exclusive sequel , Final Fight 3 , which saw the return of Guy to the series . None of the new characters from Final Fight 2 returned , although Maki made appearances in various Capcom fighting games years later .",
  "/wiki/Final_Fight_3": "Final Fight 3 , released in Japan as Final Fight Tough ( Japanese : \u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30ca\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30c8 \u30bf\u30d5 , Hepburn : Fainaru Faito Tafu ) , is a side-scrolling beat 'em up by Capcom originally released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1995 . It is the second sequel to Final Fight released for the Super NES , following Final Fight 2 , and like its predecessor , it was produced by Capcom 's consumer division with no preceding arcade version released . The game features the return of the protagonist Guy along with Haggar and also introduces new characters Lucia and Dean . The game 's plot takes them through their efforts to rid Metro City of the new Skull Cross gang . Final Fight 3 introduced new moves , as well as branching paths during gameplay and multiple endings . Also available is the option to fight alongside a CPU-controlled partner . However , most critics felt these changes did too little in the way of expanding and improving upon the original Final Fight , and the game was released to little fanfare . The next Final Fight game released , Final Fight Revenge , eschewed the side-scrolling beat'em up gameplay in favor of a one-on-one 3D fighting game format ."
