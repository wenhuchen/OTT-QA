  "/wiki/MSNBC": "MSNBC is an American cable television channel that provides NBC News coverage as well as its own reporting and political commentary on current events . MSNBC is owned by the NBCUniversal News Group , a unit of the NBCUniversal Broadcast , Cable , Sports and News division of NBCUniversal ( all of which are ultimately owned by Comcast ) . MSNBC and its website were founded in 1996 under a partnership between Microsoft and General Electric 's NBC unit , hence the network 's naming . Although they had the same name , msnbc.com and MSNBC maintained separate corporate structures and news operations . msnbc.com was headquartered on the Microsoft campus in Redmond , Washington , while MSNBC operated out of NBC 's headquarters in New York City . Microsoft divested itself of its stakes in the MSNBC channel in 2005 and in msnbc.com in July 2012 . The general news site was rebranded as NBCNews.com , and a new msnbc.com was created as the online home of the cable channel . In the late summer of 2015 , MSNBC revamped its programming ; the moves were in sharp contrast to previous programming decisions at the network . MSNBC sought to sharpen its news image by entering into a dual editorial relationship with its organizational parent NBC News . MSNBC Live , the network 's flagship daytime news platform , was expanded to cover over eight hours of the day . Phil Griffin is the president and director of day-to-day operations at MSNBC . As of September 2018 , approximately 87 million households in the United States ( 90.7 percent of pay television subscribers ) were receiving MSNBC .",
  "/wiki/30_Rock": "30 Rock is an American satirical sitcom television series created by Tina Fey that originally aired on NBC from October 11 , 2006 to January 31 , 2013 . The series , based on Fey 's experiences as head writer for Saturday Night Live , takes place behind the scenes of a fictional live sketch comedy show depicted as airing on NBC . The series 's name refers to 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City , the address of the Comcast Building , where the NBC Studios are located and where Saturday Night Live is written , produced , and performed . This series was produced by Broadway Video and Little Stranger , Inc. , in association with NBCUniversal . 30 Rock episodes were produced in a single-camera setup ( with the exception of the two live episodes that were produced in the multiple-camera setup ) , and were filmed in New York . The pilot episode premiered on October 11 , 2006 , and seven seasons followed . The series stars Fey with a supporting cast that includes Alec Baldwin , Tracy Morgan , Jane Krakowski , Jack McBrayer , Scott Adsit , Judah Friedlander , Katrina Bowden , Keith Powell , Lonny Ross , John Lutz , Kevin Brown , Grizz Chapman , and Maulik Pancholy . Tonally , 30 Rock uses surreal humor to parody the complex corporate structure of NBC and its then parent company General Electric . A critic for The A.V . Club once remarked that it usually adopts the manic pacing of a live-action cartoon . The show was influential in its extensive use of cutaways : sudden , short cuts to unrelated scenes showing something the characters are briefly discussing . 30 Rock also became known for its dedication to making sets extremely elaborate , once showing a set that took three days to build for only six seconds of video .",
