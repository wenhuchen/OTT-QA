  "/wiki/World_Series_of_Poker_bracelet": "The World Series of Poker ( WSOP ) bracelet is considered the most coveted non-monetary prize a poker player can win . Since 1976 , a bracelet has been awarded to the winner of every event at the annual WSOP . Even if the victory occurred before 1976 , WSOP championships are now counted as bracelets . During the first years of the WSOP only a handful of bracelets were awarded each year . In 1990 , there were only 14 bracelet events . By 2000 , that number increased to 24 . As the popularity of poker has increased during the 2000s , the number of events has likewise increased . In 2011 , 58 bracelets were awarded at the WSOP , seven at the World Series of Poker Europe ( WSOPE ) , and one to the WSOP National Circuit Champion . This brought the total number of bracelets awarded up to 959 . Five additional bracelets were awarded for the first time in April 2013 at the inaugural World Series of Poker Asia-Pacific ( WSOP APAC ) in Melbourne , Australia . In 2017 , 74 for bracelets were awarded at the WSOP and an additional 11 will be awarded at the WSOPE in Czech Republic .
