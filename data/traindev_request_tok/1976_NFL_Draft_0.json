On the other hand , unlike offensive linemen , they are eligible receivers adept enough to warrant a defense 's attention when running pass patterns . Because of the hybrid nature of the position , the tight end 's role in any given offense depends on the tactical preferences and philosophy of the head coach . In some systems , the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman , rarely going out for passes . Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver , frequently taking advantage of the tight end 's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary . Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking on running plays while using a tight end with better pass-catching skills in obvious passing situations .

  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",

During the 1974-75 through 1981-82 seasons , the ECC enjoyed a consistent membership of 12 teams . That stability was rocked when St. Joseph 's , Temple , and West Chester departed in the summer of 1982 , while Towson was added , trimming the league to 10 programs . Over the next two years , La Salle and American also said goodbye , cutting the roster to 8 . The winds of realignment would sweep across intercollegiate athletics in full force as the next decade dawned . Bucknell , Lafayette , and Lehigh left to help form the Patriot League in 1990 , while Delaware and Drexel headed to the North Atlantic Conference in 1991 . Attempting to stem the tide , the ECC added UMBC and Central Connecticut in 1990 , followed by Division I newcomers Buffalo and Brooklyn in 1991 . More erosion ensued as Rider , Towson , and UMBC moved to other leagues after the 1991-92 campaign , while Brooklyn suspended its entire athletic department .",

  "/wiki/1976_Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers_season": "The 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season was the franchise 's 1st season in the National Football League the 1st playing their home games at Tampa Stadium and the 1st under head coach John McKay . The Buccaneers gained infamy as the first team to play an entire 14-game season without winning or tying a single game ( including five games where they never even scored ) . They did not score until their third game and did not score a touchdown until their fourth . They lost by more than a touchdown eleven times . Colorful , maverick former USC coach John McKay , whose wisecracking remarks occasionally agitated fans and the league , led the team . Lee Roy Selmon , the Buccaneers first Hall of Fame representative , made his rookie debut in an injury-plagued season . The expansion draft was largely made up of aging veterans , giving the Buccaneers little basis for success . The lack of medical information provided on players in the expansion draft contributed heavily to the team 's problems , as they finished the season with 17 players on injured reserve . They were last in the league in points scored , touchdowns , and rushing touchdowns . After a 19-point 4th-quarter performance brought them within striking distance of a victory in week 8 against the Kansas City Chiefs , they were blown out of every game the rest of the season . Subsequent expansion teams were given a more generous allotment of draft picks and expansion draft opportunities , in part to avoid a repeat of the Buccaneers difficulties .",

For most of its history , the core members of the conference were Texas-based schools plus one in Arkansas : Rice University , Southern Methodist University , Texas A & M University , Texas Christian University , Baylor University , the University of Arkansas , and the University of Texas . After a long period of stability , the conference 's overall athletic prowess began to decline throughout the 1980s , due in part to numerous member schools violating NCAA recruiting rules , culminating in the suspension of the entire SMU football program ( death penalty ) for the 1987 and 1988 seasons . Arkansas , after years of feeling like an outsider in the conference , left after the 1990-91 school year to join the Southeastern Conference , although they did compete in the SWC in football for the 1991 season . Five years later , the conference precipitously broke up as Baylor , Texas , Texas A & M , and Texas Tech ( which had entered in 1956 ) combined with the members of the former Big Eight Conference to form a new league , the Big 12 Conference , while Rice , SMU , TCU , and Houston ( which entered the SWC in 1976 ) found homes in less prominent conferences ( although TCU later joined the Big 12 ) .",
