  "/wiki/Defensive_Tackle": "A defensive tackle ( DT ) is typically the largest and strongest of the defensive players in American football . The defensive tackle typically lines up opposite one of the offensive guards . Depending on a team 's individual defensive scheme , a defensive tackle may be called upon to fill several different roles . These roles may include merely holding the point of attack by refusing to be moved or penetrating a certain gap between offensive linemen to break up a play in the opponent 's backfield . If a defensive tackle reads a pass play , his primary responsibility is to pursue the quarterback , or simply knock the pass down at the line if it is within arm 's reach . Other responsibilities of the defensive tackle may be to pursue the screen pass or drop into coverage in a zone blitz scheme . In a traditional 4-3 defense , there is no nose tackle . Instead there is a left and right defensive tackle . Some teams , especially in the National Football League ( NFL ) , do have a nose tackle in this scheme , but most of them do not .",

  "/wiki/Defensive_Lineman": "In gridiron football , a lineman is a player who specializes in play at the line of scrimmage . The linemen of the team currently in possession of the ball are the offensive line , while linemen on the opposing team are the defensive line . A number of NFL rules specifically address restrictions and requirements for the offensive line , whose job is to help protect the quarterback from getting sacked for a loss , or worse , fumbling . The defensive line is covered by the same rules that apply to all defensive players . Linemen are usually the largest players on the field in both height and weight , since their positions usually require less running and more strength than skill positions .",
  "/wiki/Virginia_Cavaliers_football": "The Virginia Cavaliers football team represents the University of Virginia in the sport of American football . Established in 1888 , Virginia plays its home games at Scott Stadium , capacity 61,500 , featured prominently at the center of its campus near the Academical Village . UVA played an outsized role in the shaping of the modern game 's ethics and eligibility rules as well as its safety rules , after a Georgia fullback died fighting the tide of a lopsided Virginia victory in 1897 . Quickly asserting itself as the South 's first great program with 28 straight winning seasons from its first in 1888 , Virginia football claimed 12 southern championships and was the first program outside the Northeast to defeat perennial power ( 26-time national champions ) Yale , on the first attempt in 1915 . [ a ] During those early days , Virginia established long-lasting rivalries that still continue on : particularly the South 's Oldest Rivalry with North Carolina and a heated rivalry with VPI ( now Virginia Tech ) . Virginia has also played William & Mary annually or biennially for extended stretches since 1908 . [ b ] Virginia lost its mantle as the region 's mark of success between World War I and World War II , but soon thereafter Art Guepe had Virginia winning big again . To avoid the trappings of big-time football , [ c ] university president Colgate Darden reduced scholarship and recruiting support , argued against joining the ACC , and declined an invite for Virginia to play unbeaten Georgia Tech in the 1952 Orange Bowl . [ d ] The Board of Visitors voted to join the ACC anyway , but Guepe left for Vanderbilt and Virginia soon embarked on a 28-game losing streak from 1958 to 1960 as Darden retired . Virginia became the worst ACC football team of the 1970s . [ e ] George Welsh led a dramatic turnaround effort from 1982 , and took Virginia to its first dozen bowl games and even its first AP No . 1 rankings throughout October 1990 .",

  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",

  "/wiki/Fullback_(American_football)": "A fullback ( FB ) is a position known as the best position in the game of football , in the offensive backfield in gridiron football , and is one of the two running back positions along with the halfback . Typically , fullbacks are larger than halfback and in most offensive schemes their duties are split between power running , pass catching , and blocking for both the quarterback and the other running back . Many great runners in the history of American football have been fullbacks , including Jim Brown , Marion Motley , Jim Taylor , Franco Harris , Larry Csonka , John Riggins , Christian Okoye , and Levi Jackson . However , many of these runners would retroactively be labeled as halfbacks , due to their position as the primary ball carrier ; they were primarily listed as fullbacks due to their size and did not often perform the run-blocking duties expected of modern fullbacks . Examples of players who have excelled at the hybrid running-blocking-pass catching role include Mike Alstott , Daryl Johnston , and Lorenzo Neal .",
