The rail line was built by three private companies over public lands provided by extensive US land grants . Construction was financed by both state and US government subsidy bonds as well as by company issued mortgage bonds . [ N 1 ] The Western Pacific Railroad Company built 132 mi ( 212 km ) of track from the road 's western terminus at Alameda/Oakland to Sacramento , California . The Central Pacific Railroad Company of California ( CPRR ) constructed 690 mi ( 1,110 km ) eastward from Sacramento to Promontory Summit , Utah Territory . The Union Pacific built 1,085 mi ( 1,746 km ) from the road 's eastern terminus at Council Bluffs near Omaha , Nebraska westward to Promontory Summit . The railroad opened for through traffic between Sacramento and Omaha on May 10 , 1869 , when CPRR President Leland Stanford ceremonially tapped the gold Last Spike ( later often referred to as the Golden Spike ) with a silver hammer at Promontory Summit . In the following six months , the last leg from Sacramento to San Francisco Bay was completed . The resulting coast-to-coast railroad connection revolutionized the settlement and economy of the American West . It brought the western states and territories into alignment with the northern Union states and made transporting passengers and goods coast-to-coast considerably quicker , safer and less expensive . Paddle steamers linked Sacramento to the cities and their harbor facilities in the San Francisco Bay until late 1869 , when the CPRR completed and opened the Western Pacific portion ( which the CPRR had acquired control of in 1867-68 [ N 2 ] [ N 3 ] ) to Alameda first and then to Oakland .
