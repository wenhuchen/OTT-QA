  "/wiki/Mount_Etna": "Mount Etna , or Etna ( Italian : Etna [ \u02c8\u025btna ] or Mongibello [ mond\u0292i\u02c8b\u025bllo ] ; Sicilian : Mungibeddu [ m\u028and\u0292\u026ab\u02c8b\u025b\u0256\u0256\u028a ] or a Muntagna ; Latin : Aetna ; Greek : \u0391\u03af\u03c4\u03bd\u03b1 ) , is an active stratovolcano on the east coast of Sicily , Italy , in the Metropolitan City of Catania , between the cities of Messina and Catania . It lies above the convergent plate margin between the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate . It is the highest active volcano in Europe outside the Caucasus and the highest peak in Italy south of the Alps with a current height of 3,326 m ( 10,912 ft ) , though this varies with summit eruptions . Etna covers an area of 1,190 km2 ( 459 sq mi ) with a basal circumference of 140 km ( 87 miles ) . This makes it by far the largest of the three active volcanoes in Italy , being about two and a half times the height of the next largest , Mount Vesuvius . Only Mount Teide on Tenerife in the Canary Islands surpasses it in the whole of the European-North-African region west of the Black Sea . In Greek Mythology , the deadly monster Typhon was trapped under this mountain by Zeus , the god of the sky and thunder and king of gods , and the forges of Hephaestus were said also to be underneath it . Mount Etna is one of the world 's most active volcanoes and is in an almost constant state of activity . The fertile volcanic soils support extensive agriculture , with vineyards and orchards spread across the lower slopes of the mountain and the broad Plain of Catania to the south . Due to its history of recent activity and nearby population , Mount Etna has been designated a Decade Volcano by the United Nations . In June 2013 , it was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites .",
  "/wiki/Italy": "Italy ( Italian : Italia [ i\u02c8ta\u02d0lja ] ( listen ) ) , officially the Italian Republic ( Italian : Repubblica Italiana [ re\u02c8pubblika ita\u02c8lja\u02d0na ] ) , is a European country consisting of a peninsula delimited by the Alps and surrounded by several islands . Italy is located in south-central Europe , and it is also considered a part of Western Europe . The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino . Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",
  "/wiki/Sicily": "Sicily ( Italian : Sicilia [ si\u02c8t\u0283i\u02d0lja ] ; Sicilian : Sicilia [ s\u026a\u02c8\u0283i\u02d0lja ] ) is the largest island in the Mediterranean Sea and one of the 20 regions of Italy . It is one of the five Italian autonomous regions and is officially referred to as Regione Siciliana . Sicily is located in the central Mediterranean Sea , south of the Italian Peninsula , from which it is separated by the narrow Strait of Messina . Its most prominent landmark is Mount Etna , the tallest active volcano in Europe , and one of the most active in the world , currently 3,329 m ( 10,922 ft ) high . The island has a typical Mediterranean climate . The earliest archaeological evidence of human activity on the island dates from as early as 12,000 BC . By around 750 BC , Sicily had three Phoenician and a dozen Greek colonies and it was later the site of the Sicilian Wars and the Punic Wars . After the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD , Sicily was ruled during the Early Middle Ages by the Vandals , the Ostrogoths , the Byzantine Empire , and the Emirate of Sicily . The Norman conquest of southern Italy led to the creation of the Kingdom of Sicily , which was subsequently ruled by the Hohenstaufen , the Capetian House of Anjou , Spain , and the House of Habsburg . It was unified under the House of Bourbon with the Kingdom of Naples as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies . It became part of Italy in 1860 following the Expedition of the Thousand , a revolt led by Giuseppe Garibaldi during the Italian unification , and a plebiscite . Sicily was given special status as an autonomous region on 15 May 1946 , 18 days before the Italian constitutional referendum of 1946 .",

[ XIII ] The metropolitan area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea , and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean . It is bordered by Belgium , Luxembourg and Germany to the northeast , Switzerland and Italy to the east , and Andorra and Spain to the south . The overseas territories include French Guiana in South America and several islands in the Atlantic , Pacific and Indian oceans . The country 's 18 integral regions ( five of which are situated overseas ) span a combined area of 643,801 square kilometres ( 248,573 sq mi ) and a total population of 67.02 million ( as of July 2019 [ update ] ) . France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris , the country 's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre . Other major urban areas include Lyon , Marseille , Toulouse , Bordeaux , Lille and Nice . France , including its overseas territories , has the most number of time zones of any country , with a total of 12 . During the Iron Age , what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls , a Celtic people . Rome annexed the area in 51 BC , holding it until the arrival of Germanic Franks in 476 , who formed the Kingdom of Francia . The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned Francia into East Francia , Middle Francia and West Francia . West Francia , which became the Kingdom of France in 987 , emerged as a major European power in the Late Middle Ages , following its victory in the Hundred Years ' War ( 1337-1453 ) .",
  "/wiki/Corsica": "Corsica ( /\u02c8k\u0254\u02d0rs\u026ak\u0259/ ; French : Corse [ k\u0254\u0281s ] ; Corsica in Corsican and Italian , pronounced [ \u02c8korsiga ] and [ \u02c8k\u0254rsika ] respectively ) is an island in the Mediterranean Sea and one of the 18 regions of France . It is located southeast of the French mainland and west of the Italian Peninsula , with the nearest land mass being the Italian island of Sardinia to the immediate south . A single chain of mountains makes up two-thirds of the island . The island is an administrative region of France ( with the regional capital being Ajaccio ) , divided in two administrative departments , Haute-Corse and Corse-du-Sud . The corresponding regional and departmental territorial collectivities , however , merged on 1 January 2018 , forming the single territorial collectivity of Corsica . As a single territorial collectivity , Corsica enjoys a greater degree of autonomy than other French regional collectivities ; for example , the Corsican Assembly is able to exercise limited executive powers . Bastia , the prefecture city of Haute-Corse , is the second largest town in Corsica . After being ruled by the Republic of Genoa since 1284 , in 1755 Corsica became a self-proclaimed Italian-speaking Republic , until it was officially ceded by Genoa to Louis XV as part of a pledge for debts and subsequently annexed to France in 1769 . Napoleon Bonaparte was born the same year in Ajaccio , and his ancestral home ( Maison Bonaparte ) is today a significant visitor attraction and museum . Due to Corsica 's historical ties with the Italian peninsula , the island retains many Italian cultural elements , and the native tongue is recognized as a regional language by the French government .",

It is the highest peak in mainland Italy outside of the Alps , and the second highest peak in the entire country outside the Alps , after Mount Etna in Sicily . Despite an extreme altitude drop on the north side , the mountain 's south side is less elevated than the adjacent Campo Imperatore plateau . The northern corrie of Corno Grande holds one of the southernmost glaciers in Europe , the Calderone glacier , being slightly to the north only compared to Snezhnika ( latitude of 41\u00b046\u203209\u2033 N ) and Banski Suhodol Glaciers in Pirin Mountain in Bulgaria . The first recorded ascent of Corno Grande was made in 1573 by the Bolognese captain Francesco De Marchi alongside Francesco Di Domenico .

It is the second-largest island in the Mediterranean Sea after Sicily , and is located west of the Italian Peninsula , north of Tunisia , and to the immediate south of the French island of Corsica . The region of Sardinia is one of the five in Italy that enjoy some degree of domestic autonomy , granted by a specific Statute . Its official name is Regione Autonoma della Sardegna ( Sardinian : Regione Aut\u00f2noma de Sardigna , lit . Autonomous Region of Sardinia ) . It is divided into four provinces and a metropolitan city , with Cagliari being the region 's capital and also its largest city . Sardinia 's indigenous language and the other minority languages ( Sassarese , Gallurese , Algherese Catalan and Ligurian Tabarchino ) spoken on the island are recognized by the regional law and enjoy equal dignity with Italian . Sardinia has been inhabited since the Paleolithic . The island 's most iconic civilization is the indigenous Nuragic one , which lasted from the 18th century BC to either 238 BC or the 2nd century AD in some areas and to the 6th century AD in the region known as Barbagia . After a period under a political and economic alliance between the Nuragic Sardinians and the Phoenicians , the island was partly conquered by Carthage and Rome , in the late 6th century BC and in 238 BC respectively ; the Roman occupation lasted for 700 years , followed in the Early Middle Ages by the Vandals and the Byzantines . Since the island was finding itself disconnected from Byzantium 's scope of territorial influence , the Sardinians provided themselves with a self-ruling political organization , leading to the birth of the four Judicates . As the Italian maritime republics of Pisa and Genoa struggled to exercise increasing political interference upon the indigenous states , the Crown of Aragon subsumed the island as the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1324 .",
