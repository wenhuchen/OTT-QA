  "/wiki/Rhodes_Scholar": "The Rhodes Scholarship is an international postgraduate award for students to study at the University of Oxford . It was established in 1902 , making it the first large-scale programme of international scholarship . The Rhodes Scholarship was founded by English businessman and politician Cecil John Rhodes , to promote unity between English-speaking nations and instill a sense of civic-minded leadership and moral fortitude in future leaders irrespective of their chosen career paths . Although initially restricted to male applicants from countries which are today within the British Commonwealth , as well as Germany and the United States , today the scholarship is open to applicants from all backgrounds and from across the globe . Since its creation , controversy has surrounded both its former exclusion of women ( thus leading to the establishment of the co-educational Marshall Scholarship ) , and Rhodes ' white supremacist beliefs and legacy of colonialism . Prominent recipients of the Rhodes Scholarship include politicians , academics , scientists , authors and entrepreneurs . Notable American politicians include former president of the United States Bill Clinton , former United States national security advisor and United States ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice , former governor of Louisiana Piyush Bobby Jindal , former United States secretary of the Air Force and former congresswoman Heather Wilson , and former United States secretary of health and human services Sylvia Matthews Burwell . President of Pakistan Wasim Sajjad ; former prime minister of Malta Dom Mintoff ; former Australian prime ministers Tony Abbott , Bob Hawke and Malcolm Turnbull ; and the current deputy prime minister of Canada , Chrystia Freeland are also Rhodes Scholars . Other notable Rhodes Scholars include journalist and American television host Rachel Maddow , author Naomi Wolf , former 2020 presidential candidate and New Jersey senator Cory Booker , 2020 presidential candidate and former mayor of South Bend Pete Buttigieg , former president of Planned Parenthood Leana Wen , Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ronan Farrow , and president of the Walmart Foundation Kathleen McLaughlin .

  "/wiki/Analytical_geometry": "In classical mathematics , analytic geometry , also known as coordinate geometry or Cartesian geometry , is the study of geometry using a coordinate system . This contrasts with synthetic geometry . Analytic geometry is widely used in physics and engineering , and also in aviation , rocketry , space science , and spaceflight . It is the foundation of most modern fields of geometry , including algebraic , differential , discrete and computational geometry . Usually the Cartesian coordinate system is applied to manipulate equations for planes , straight lines , and squares , often in two and sometimes in three dimensions . Geometrically , one studies the Euclidean plane ( two dimensions ) and Euclidean space ( three dimensions ) . As taught in school books , analytic geometry can be explained more simply : it is concerned with defining and representing geometrical shapes in a numerical way and extracting numerical information from shapes ' numerical definitions and representations . That the algebra of the real numbers can be employed to yield results about the linear continuum of geometry relies on the Cantor-Dedekind axiom .",

The theory of plane and space curves and surfaces in the three-dimensional Euclidean space formed the basis for development of differential geometry during the 18th century and the 19th century . Since the late 19th century , differential geometry has grown into a field concerned more generally with the geometric structures on differentiable manifolds . Differential geometry is closely related to differential topology and the geometric aspects of the theory of differential equations . The differential geometry of surfaces captures many of the key ideas and techniques endemic to this field .",
  "/wiki/Algebraic_geometry": "Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics , classically studying zeros of multivariate polynomials . Modern algebraic geometry is based on the use of abstract algebraic techniques , mainly from commutative algebra , for solving geometrical problems about these sets of zeros . The fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry are algebraic varieties , which are geometric manifestations of solutions of systems of polynomial equations . Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are : plane algebraic curves , which include lines , circles , parabolas , ellipses , hyperbolas , cubic curves like elliptic curves , and quartic curves like lemniscates and Cassini ovals . A point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation . Basic questions involve the study of the points of special interest like the singular points , the inflection points and the points at infinity . More advanced questions involve the topology of the curve and relations between the curves given by different equations . Algebraic geometry occupies a central place in modern mathematics and has multiple conceptual connections with such diverse fields as complex analysis , topology and number theory . Initially a study of systems of polynomial equations in several variables , the subject of algebraic geometry starts where equation solving leaves off , and it becomes even more important to understand the intrinsic properties of the totality of solutions of a system of equations , than to find a specific solution ; this leads into some of the deepest areas in all of mathematics , both conceptually and in terms of technique . In the 20th century , algebraic geometry split into several subareas .",
  "/wiki/Savilian_Professor_of_Geometry": "The position of Savilian Professor of Geometry was established at the University of Oxford in 1619 .

He appointed Henry Briggs as the first professor . Edward Titchmarsh ( professor 1931-63 ) said when applying that he was not prepared to lecture on geometry , and the requirement was removed from the duties of the post to enable his appointment , although the title of the chair was not changed . The two Savilian chairs have been linked with professorial fellowships at New College , Oxford since the late 19th century . Before then , for over 175 years until the middle of the 19th century , the geometry professors had an official residence adjoining the college in New College Lane . There have been 20 professors ; Frances Kirwan , the current ( as of 2019 [ update ] ) and first female holder of the chair , was appointed in 2017 . The post has been held by a number of distinguished mathematicians . Briggs helped to develop the common logarithm , described as one of the most useful systems for mathematics . The third professor , John Wallis , introduced the use of \u221e { \\displaystyle \\infty } for infinity , and was regarded as one of the leading mathematicians of his time .
