  "/wiki/Programming_language": "A programming language is a formal language , which comprises a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output . Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms . Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers . There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions , rather than general programming languages . Early ones preceded the invention of the digital computer , the first probably being the automatic flute player described in the 9th century by the brothers Musa in Baghdad , during the Islamic Golden Age . Since the early 1800s , programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms , music boxes and player pianos . The programs for these machines ( such as a player piano 's scrolls ) did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions . Thousands of different programming languages have been created , and more are being created every year . Many programming languages are written in an imperative form ( i.e. , as a sequence of operations to perform ) while other languages use the declarative form ( i.e . the desired result is specified , not how to achieve it ) . The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax ( form ) and semantics ( meaning ) . Some languages are defined by a specification document ( for example , the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard ) while other languages ( such as Perl ) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference .",
  "/wiki/BbPress": "WordPress ( WordPress.org ) is a free and open-source content management system ( CMS ) written in PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database . Features include a plugin architecture and a template system , referred to within WordPress as Themes . WordPress was originally created as a blog-publishing system but has evolved to support other types of web content including more traditional mailing lists and forums , media galleries , membership sites , learning management systems ( LMS ) and online stores . WordPress is used by more than 60 million websites , including 33.6% of the top 10 million websites as of April 2019 [ update ] , WordPress is one of the most popular content management system solutions in use . WordPress has also been used for other application domains such as pervasive display systems ( PDS ) . WordPress was released on May 27 , 2003 , by its founders , American developer Matt Mullenweg and English developer Mike Little , as a fork of b2/cafelog . The software is released under the GPLv2 ( or later ) license . To function , WordPress has to be installed on a web server , either part of an Internet hosting service like WordPress.com or a computer running the software package WordPress.org in order to serve as a network host in its own right . A local computer may be used for single-user testing and learning purposes .",
  "/wiki/PHP": "PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development . It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 ; the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group . PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page , but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP : Hypertext Preprocessor . PHP code may be executed with a command line interface ( CLI ) , embedded into HTML code , or used in combination with various web template systems , web content management systems , and web frameworks . PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in a web server or as a Common Gateway Interface ( CGI ) executable . The web server outputs the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code , which may be any type of data , such as generated HTML code or binary image data . PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context , such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control . The standard PHP interpreter , powered by the Zend Engine , is free software released under the PHP License . PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform , free of charge . The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014 , with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations aimed to follow . Since 2014 , work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification . As of February 2020 [ update ] , over half of sites on the web using PHP are still on discontinued/EOLed version 5.6 or older ; and over 55% of all websites in the world run versions prior to 7.2 , that are neither officially supported by The PHP Development Team , while security support is provided by third parties , such as Debian ( up to June 2020 for PHP 5 ) .",
  "/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License": "The GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL or GPL ) is a widely used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run , study , share , and modify the software . The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms . This is in distinction to permissive software licenses , of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples . GPL was the first copyleft license for general use . Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF . Developers can omit it when licensing their software ; the Linux kernel , for instance , is licensed under GPLv2 without the any later version clause .",

  "/wiki/Discourse_(software)": "Discourse is an open source Internet forum and mailing list management software application founded in 2013 by Jeff Atwood , Robin Ward , and Sam Saffron . Discourse received funding from First Round Capital and Greylock Partners . The application is written with Ember.js and Ruby on Rails . PostgreSQL serves as its back-end database management system . From a usability perspective , Discourse breaks with existing forum software by including features recently popularized by large social networks , such as infinite scrolling , live updates , expanding links , and drag and drop attachments . However , the stated goals of the project are social rather than technical , to improve online discussion quality through improved forum software . The source code is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2 . Therefore Discourse can be self-hosted by anyone . Alternatively , hosting service can be bought from the company of the founders . As of October 2017 , more than 700 businesses or instances have chosen this option . On May 2017 , co-founder Jeff Atwood said in an interview that the company is generating approximately 120,000 dollars per month at that time . With the money the company pays salary for its full-time employees who maintain the software and develop new features which benefits those who are self-hosting the open source software , too .",

  "/wiki/JavaScript": "JavaScript ( /\u02c8d\u0292\u0251\u02d0v\u0259\u02ccskr\u026apt/ ) , often abbreviated as JS , is an interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification . JavaScript is high-level , often just-in-time compiled , and multi-paradigm . It has curly-bracket syntax , dynamic typing , prototype-based object-orientation , and first-class functions . Alongside HTML and CSS , JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web . JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications . The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior , and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it . As a multi-paradigm language , JavaScript supports event-driven , functional , and imperative programming styles . It has application programming interfaces ( APIs ) for working with text , dates , regular expressions , standard data structures , and the Document Object Model ( DOM ) . However , the language itself does not include any input/output ( I/O ) , such as networking , storage , or graphics facilities , as the host environment ( usually a web browser ) provides those APIs . Originally used only in web browsers , JavaScript engines are also now embedded in server-side website deployments and non-browser applications . Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java , including language name , syntax , and respective standard libraries , the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design .",

This ambiguity of free can cause issues where the distinction is important , as it often is in dealing with laws concerning the use of information , such as copyright and patents . The terms gratis and libre may be used to categorise intellectual property , particularly computer programs , according to the licenses and legal restrictions that cover them , in the free software and open source communities , as well as the broader free culture movement . For example , they are used to distinguish freeware ( software gratis ) from free software ( software libre ) .

  "/wiki/Perl": "Perl is a family of two high-level , general-purpose , interpreted , dynamic programming languages . Perl refers to Perl 5 , but from 2000 to 2019 it also referred to its redesigned sister language , Perl 6 , before the latter 's name was officially changed to Raku in October 2019 . Though Perl is not officially an acronym , there are various backronyms in use , including Practical Extraction and Reporting Language . Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier . Since then , it has undergone many changes and revisions . Raku , which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000 , eventually evolved into a separate language . Both languages continue to be developed independently by different development teams and liberally borrow ideas from one another . The Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages including C , shell script ( sh ) , AWK , and sed ; Wall also alludes to BASIC and Lisp in the introduction to Learning Perl ( Schwartz & Christiansen ) and so on . They provide text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix command line tools , facilitating manipulation of text files . Perl 5 gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language , in part due to its unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities . In addition to CGI , Perl 5 is used for system administration , network programming , finance , bioinformatics , and other applications , such as for GUIs . It has been nicknamed the Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages because of its flexibility and power , and also its ugliness .",

Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine ( JVM ) regardless of the underlying computer architecture . The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++ , but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them . As of 2019 [ update ] , Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub , particularly for client-server web applications , with a reported 9 million developers . Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems ( which has since been acquired by Oracle ) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems ' Java platform . The original and reference implementation Java compilers , virtual machines , and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses . As of May 2007 , in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process , Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License . Meanwhile , others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies , such as the GNU Compiler for Java ( bytecode compiler ) , GNU Classpath ( standard libraries ) , and IcedTea-Web ( browser plugin for applets ) .
