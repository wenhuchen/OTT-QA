  "/wiki/Programming_language": "A programming language is a formal language , which comprises a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output . Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms . Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers . There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions , rather than general programming languages . Early ones preceded the invention of the digital computer , the first probably being the automatic flute player described in the 9th century by the brothers Musa in Baghdad , during the Islamic Golden Age . Since the early 1800s , programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms , music boxes and player pianos . The programs for these machines ( such as a player piano 's scrolls ) did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions . Thousands of different programming languages have been created , and more are being created every year . Many programming languages are written in an imperative form ( i.e. , as a sequence of operations to perform ) while other languages use the declarative form ( i.e . the desired result is specified , not how to achieve it ) . The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax ( form ) and semantics ( meaning ) . Some languages are defined by a specification document ( for example , the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard ) while other languages ( such as Perl ) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference .",
  "/wiki/PHP": "PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development . It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 ; the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group . PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page , but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP : Hypertext Preprocessor . PHP code may be executed with a command line interface ( CLI ) , embedded into HTML code , or used in combination with various web template systems , web content management systems , and web frameworks . PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in a web server or as a Common Gateway Interface ( CGI ) executable . The web server outputs the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code , which may be any type of data , such as generated HTML code or binary image data . PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context , such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control . The standard PHP interpreter , powered by the Zend Engine , is free software released under the PHP License . PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform , free of charge . The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014 , with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations aimed to follow . Since 2014 , work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification . As of February 2020 [ update ] , over half of sites on the web using PHP are still on discontinued/EOLed version 5.6 or older ; and over 55% of all websites in the world run versions prior to 7.2 , that are neither officially supported by The PHP Development Team , while security support is provided by third parties , such as Debian ( up to June 2020 for PHP 5 ) .",
  "/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License": "The GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL or GPL ) is a widely used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run , study , share , and modify the software . The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms . This is in distinction to permissive software licenses , of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples . GPL was the first copyleft license for general use . Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF . Developers can omit it when licensing their software ; the Linux kernel , for instance , is licensed under GPLv2 without the any later version clause .",
  "/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)": "Ruby is an interpreted , high-level , general-purpose programming language . It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro Matz Matsumoto in Japan . Ruby is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection . It supports multiple programming paradigms , including procedural , object-oriented , and functional programming . According to the creator , Ruby was influenced by Perl , Smalltalk , Eiffel , Ada , Basic , and Lisp .",
  "/wiki/JavaScript": "JavaScript ( /\u02c8d\u0292\u0251\u02d0v\u0259\u02ccskr\u026apt/ ) , often abbreviated as JS , is an interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification . JavaScript is high-level , often just-in-time compiled , and multi-paradigm . It has curly-bracket syntax , dynamic typing , prototype-based object-orientation , and first-class functions . Alongside HTML and CSS , JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web . JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications . The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior , and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it . As a multi-paradigm language , JavaScript supports event-driven , functional , and imperative programming styles . It has application programming interfaces ( APIs ) for working with text , dates , regular expressions , standard data structures , and the Document Object Model ( DOM ) . However , the language itself does not include any input/output ( I/O ) , such as networking , storage , or graphics facilities , as the host environment ( usually a web browser ) provides those APIs . Originally used only in web browsers , JavaScript engines are also now embedded in server-side website deployments and non-browser applications . Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java , including language name , syntax , and respective standard libraries , the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design .",

  "/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre": "The English adjective free is commonly used in one of two meanings : for free ( gratis ) and with little or no restriction ( libre ) . This ambiguity of free can cause issues where the distinction is important , as it often is in dealing with laws concerning the use of information , such as copyright and patents . The terms gratis and libre may be used to categorise intellectual property , particularly computer programs , according to the licenses and legal restrictions that cover them , in the free software and open source communities , as well as the broader free culture movement . For example , they are used to distinguish freeware ( software gratis ) from free software ( software libre ) . Richard Stallman summarised the difference in a slogan : Think free as in free speech , not free beer .",
  "/wiki/Perl": "Perl is a family of two high-level , general-purpose , interpreted , dynamic programming languages . Perl refers to Perl 5 , but from 2000 to 2019 it also referred to its redesigned sister language , Perl 6 , before the latter 's name was officially changed to Raku in October 2019 . Though Perl is not officially an acronym , there are various backronyms in use , including Practical Extraction and Reporting Language . Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier . Since then , it has undergone many changes and revisions . Raku , which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000 , eventually evolved into a separate language . Both languages continue to be developed independently by different development teams and liberally borrow ideas from one another . The Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages including C , shell script ( sh ) , AWK , and sed ; Wall also alludes to BASIC and Lisp in the introduction to Learning Perl ( Schwartz & Christiansen ) and so on . They provide text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix command line tools , facilitating manipulation of text files . Perl 5 gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language , in part due to its unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities . In addition to CGI , Perl 5 is used for system administration , network programming , finance , bioinformatics , and other applications , such as for GUIs . It has been nicknamed the Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages because of its flexibility and power , and also its ugliness .",
  "/wiki/Invision_Power_Services": "Invision Community ( previously known as IPS Community Suite ) is primarily an Internet community software produced by Invision Power Services , Inc . It is written in PHP and uses MySQL as a database management system . Invision Power Services sell applications that each can be bought and installed separately in addition to the Suite , the most widely known being the Internet forum software Invision Power Board . Invision Community refers to the combined collection of applications provided by Invision Power Services and is the core of the framework . Invision Community originated from Invision Power Board , one of the applications that can now be bought separately and requires IP.Suite . Up until version 3.4 of Invision Power Board the staff at Invision Power Services had gradually expanded their product line with additional community-centered applications like IP.Blog , IP.Gallery and IP.Content . However , IP.Board was always required as many aspects of the core and other applications relied on it . Starting with IP.Suite 4 they decided to abandon IP.Board as their flagship-product and unify the version numbering and release schedule for all their applications . The software also provides tools and documentation to let the community create their own applications , themes and other things that can also be shared for free or sold to other customers through Invision Power Services own community .",
  "/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License": "The GNU Lesser General Public License ( LGPL ) is a free-software license published by the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) . The license allows developers and companies to use and integrate a software component released under the LGPL into their own ( even proprietary ) software without being required by the terms of a strong copyleft license to release the source code of their own components . However , any developer who modifies an LGPL-covered component is required to make their modified version available under the same LGPL license . For proprietary software , code under the LGPL is usually used in the form of a shared library , so that there is a clear separation between the proprietary and LGPL components . The LGPL is primarily used for software libraries , although it is also used by some stand-alone applications . The LGPL was developed as a compromise between the strong copyleft of the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) and more permissive licenses such as the BSD licenses and the MIT License . The word Lesser in the title shows that the LGPL does not guarantee the end user 's complete freedom in the use of software ; it only guarantees the freedom of modification for components licensed under the LGPL , but not for any proprietary components .",

  "/wiki/I2P": "The Invisible Internet Project ( I2P ) is an anonymous network layer ( implemented as a Mix Network ) that allows for censorship-resistant , peer to peer communication . Anonymous connections are achieved by encrypting the user 's traffic ( by using end-to-end encryption ) , and sending it through a volunteer-run network of roughly 55,000 computers distributed around the world . Given the high number of possible paths the traffic can transit , a third party watching a full connection is unlikely . The software that implements this layer is called an I2P router , and a computer running I2P is called an I2P node . I2P is free and open source , and is published under multiple licenses .",
  "/wiki/Java_(programming_language)": "Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based , object-oriented , and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible . It is intended to let application developers write once , run anywhere ( WORA ) , meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation . Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine ( JVM ) regardless of the underlying computer architecture . The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++ , but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them . As of 2019 [ update ] , Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub , particularly for client-server web applications , with a reported 9 million developers . Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems ( which has since been acquired by Oracle ) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems ' Java platform . The original and reference implementation Java compilers , virtual machines , and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses . As of May 2007 , in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process , Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License . Meanwhile , others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies , such as the GNU Compiler for Java ( bytecode compiler ) , GNU Classpath ( standard libraries ) , and IcedTea-Web ( browser plugin for applets ) . The latest versions are Java 13 , released in September 2019 , and Java 11 , a currently supported long-term support ( LTS ) version , released on September 25 , 2018 ; Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use , while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020 . Oracle ( and others ) highly recommend uninstalling older versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues . Since Java 9 ( and 10 and 12 ) is no longer supported , Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the latest version ( currently Java 13 ) or an LTS release .",
  "/wiki/MIT_License": "The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) in the late 1980s . As a permissive license , it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has , therefore , reasonable license compatibility . It is compatible because it can be re-licensed under other licenses . The MIT license is compatible with many copyleft licenses , such as the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) ; MIT licensed software can be re-licensed as GPL software , and integrated with other GPL software , but not the other way around . The MIT license also permits reuse within proprietary software , provided that either all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the copyright notice , or the software is re-licensed to remove this requirement . MIT-licensed software can also be re-licensed as proprietary software , which distinguishes it from copyleft software licenses . As of 2015 [ update ] , MIT was the most popular software license on GitHub , ahead of any GPL variant and other free and open-source software ( FOSS ) licenses . Notable projects that use the MIT License include the X Window System , Ruby on Rails , and Node.js .",
