He swam for Bulgaria at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics . Alexandrov has been swimming for the USA since 2009 . Alexandrov , who has dual Bulgarian/USA citizenship , swam for the USA 's Northwestern University from 2003 to 2007 , . In March 2007 he set a USA National Record in the 100 yard breaststroke ( 51.56 ) at the NCAA Division I Swimming and Diving Championships , while swimming for Northwestern . This was despite the fact that he had not swum internationally for the US at that time and that he was viewed as a Bulgarian swimmer . The USA Swimming rules at the time allowed for the USA National mark to be set by a swimmer who could represent the US in international competition ( his dual citizenship allowed for this ) and who at the time of the swim was not representing another country ( he was swimming for the country-neutral Northwestern University at the time of the swim ) . USA Swimming 's rules have subsequently been altered so that only swimmers currently representing the USA internationally can set the American Record . Alexandrov 's record was broken in 2012 by Kevin Cordes . Alexandrov now works as a personal trainer in the Los Angeles area where he also coaches swimming . In 2017 Alexandrov was suspended for 12 months after he failed a drug test .",
