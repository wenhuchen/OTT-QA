Today , giant tortoises exist on only two remote archipelagos : the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands 1000 km due west of mainland Ecuador ; and Aldabrachelys gigantea of Aldabra in the Indian Ocean , 700 km east of Tanzania . The Gal\u00e1pagos tortoises are native to seven of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands , a volcanic archipelago about 1,000 km ( 620 mi ) west of the Ecuadorian mainland . With lifespans in the wild of over 100 years , it is one of the longest-lived vertebrates . A captive individual lived at least 170 years . Spanish explorers , who discovered the islands in the 16th century , named them after the Spanish gal\u00e1pago , meaning tortoise . Shell size and shape vary between populations . On islands with humid highlands , the tortoises are larger , with domed shells and short necks ; on islands with dry lowlands , the tortoises are smaller , with saddleback shells and long necks . Charles Darwin 's observations of these differences on the second voyage of the Beagle in 1835 , contributed to the development of his theory of evolution . Tortoise numbers declined from over 250,000 in the 16th century to a low of around 3,000 in the 1970s . This decline was caused by overexploitation of the species for meat and oil , habitat clearance for agriculture , and introduction of non-native animals to the islands , such as rats , goats , and pigs .",
