The period is named after the capital city of Heian-ky\u014d , or modern Ky\u014dto . It is the period in Japanese history when Buddhism , Taoism and other Chinese influences were at their height . The Heian period is also considered the peak of the Japanese imperial court and noted for its art , especially poetry and literature . Although the Imperial House of Japan had power on the surface , the real power was in the hands of the Fujiwara clan , a powerful aristocratic family who had intermarried with the imperial family . Many emperors actually had mothers from the Fujiwara family . Heian ( \u5e73\u5b89 ) means peace in Japanese .",
  "/wiki/Sh\u014den": "A sh\u014den ( \u8358\u5712 or \u5e84\u5712 , sh\u014den ) was a field or manor in Japan . The Japanese term comes from the Tang dynasty Chinese term \u838a\u5712 ( Mandarin : zhu\u0101ngyu\u00e1n , Cantonese : zong1 jyun4 ) . Sh\u014den , from about the 8th to the late 15th century , describes any of the private , tax-free , often autonomous estates or manors whose rise undermined the political and economic power of the emperor and contributed to the growth of powerful local clans . The estates developed from land tracts assigned to officially sanctioned Shint\u014d shrines or Buddhist temples or granted by the emperor as gifts to the Imperial family , friends , or officials . As these estates grew , they became independent of the civil administrative system and contributed to the rise of a local military class . With the establishment of the Kamakura shogunate , or military dictatorship , in 1192 , centrally appointed stewards weakened the power of these local landlords . The sh\u014den system passed out of existence around the middle of the 15th century , when villages became self-governing units , owing loyalty to a feudal lord ( daimy\u014d ) who subdivided the area into fiefs and collected a fixed tax . After the decay of the ritsury\u014d system , a feudal system of manors developed . Landowners or nameholders commended shares of the revenue produced ( called shiki ) to more powerful leaders often at the court , in order to be exempted from taxes and to subvert the Chinese-style equal fields system , whereby land was redistributed after certain periods of time . In the Kamakura period a hierarchy of nameholder , manor stewards ( jit\u014d ) , shugo ( military provincial governor ) , and the sh\u014dgun in Kamakura had evolved . These sh\u014den were completely free from interference from the government , which therefore had no say or control of what occurred within the sh\u014den 's boundaries . By the end of the Heian period virtually all Japanese land had become sh\u014den and continued to be through the \u014cnin War until the Sengoku period .",
