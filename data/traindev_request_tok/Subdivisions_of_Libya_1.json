Its people were ancestors of the modern Libyan . They occupied the area for thousands of years before the beginning of human records in ancient Egypt . Climate changes affected the locations of the settlements . More narrowly , Libya could also refer to the country immediately west of Egypt , viz Marmarica ( Libya Inferior ) and Cyrenaica ( Libya Superior ) . The Libyan Sea or Mare Libycum was the part of the Mediterranean Sea south of Crete , between Cyrene and Alexandria . In the Hellenistic period , the Berbers were known as Libyans , a Greek term for the inhabitants of the Berber world . Their lands were called Libya and extended from modern Morocco to the western borders of ancient Egypt . Modern Egypt contains the Siwa Oasis , which was part of ancient Libya .

  "/wiki/Ancient_Persia": "The history of Iran , which was commonly known until the mid-20th century as Persia in the Western world , is intertwined with the history of a larger region , also to an extent known as Greater Iran , comprising the area from Anatolia , the Bosphorus , and Egypt in the west to the borders of Ancient India and the Syr Darya in the east , and from the Caucasus and the Eurasian Steppe in the north to the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman in the south . Iran is home to one of the world 's oldest continuous major civilizations , with historical and urban settlements dating back to 7000 BC . The south-western and western part of the Iranian Plateau participated in the traditional Ancient Near East with Elam , from the Early Bronze Age , and later with various other peoples , such as the Kassites , Mannaeans , and Gutians . Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel calls the Persians the first Historical People . The Medes unified Iran as a nation and empire in 625 BC . The Achaemenid Empire ( 550-330 BC ) , founded by Cyrus the Great , was the first true global superpower state and it ruled from the Balkans to North Africa and also Central Asia , spanning three continents , from their seat of power in Persis ( Persepolis ) . It was the largest empire yet seen and the first world empire . The Achaemenid Empire was the only civilization in all of history to connect over 40% of the global population , accounting for approximately 49.4 million of the world 's 112.4 million people in around 480 BC . They were succeeded by the Seleucid , Parthian , and Sasanian Empires , who successively governed Iran for almost 1,000 years and made Iran once again as a leading power in the world . Persia 's arch-rival was the Roman Empire and its successor , the Byzantine Empire . The Iranian Empire proper begins in the Iron Age , following the influx of Iranian peoples . Iranian people gave rise to the Medes , the Achaemenid , Parthian , and Sasanian Empires of classical antiquity .",

  "/wiki/Ancient_Greece": "Ancient Greece ( Greek : \u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 , romanized : Hell\u00e1s ) was a civilization belonging to a period of Greek history from the Greek Dark Ages of the 12th-9th centuries BC to the end of antiquity ( c. AD 600 ) . Immediately following this period was the beginning of the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine era . Roughly three centuries after the Late Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece , Greek urban poleis began to form in the 8th century BC , ushering in the Archaic period and colonization of the Mediterranean Basin . This was followed by the period of Classical Greece , an era that began with the Greco-Persian Wars , lasting from the 5th to 4th centuries BC . Due to the conquests by Alexander the Great of Macedon , Hellenistic civilization flourished from Central Asia to the western end of the Mediterranean Sea . The Hellenistic period came to an end with the conquests and annexations of the eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic , which established the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece , and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire . Classical Greek culture , especially philosophy , had a powerful influence on ancient Rome , which carried a version of it to many parts of the Mediterranean Basin and Europe . For this reason , Classical Greece is generally considered to be the seminal culture which provided the foundation of modern Western culture and is considered the cradle of Western civilization . Classical Greek culture gave great importance to knowledge . Science and religion were not separate and getting closer to the truth meant getting closer to the gods . In this context , they understood the importance of mathematics as an instrument for obtaining more reliable ( divine ) knowledge . Greek culture , in a few centuries and with a limited population , managed to explore and make progress in many fields of science , mathematics , philosophy and knowledge in general .",

When King Cambyses II of Persia conquered Egypt , the king of Cyrene , Arcesilaus III , sided with Persia . When he was killed trying to maintain power , Queen Pheretima invited the Persians to take Cyrene . The satrap of Egypt , Aryandes , accepted , sending an army under two Persians to support Pheretime .

As a polity it included large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe , North Africa and West Asia ruled by emperors . From the accession of Caesar Augustus to the military anarchy of the third century , it was a principate with Italy as metropole of the provinces and its city of Rome as sole capital ( 27 BC - 286 AD ) . Although fragmented briefly during the military crisis , the empire was forcibly reassembled , then ruled by multiple emperors who shared rule over the Western Roman Empire ( based in Milan and later in Ravenna ) and over the Eastern Roman Empire ( based in Nicomedia and later in Constantinople ) . Rome remained the nominal capital of both parts until 476 AD , when it sent the imperial insignia to Constantinople ( Byzantium - Ancient Greek : \u0392\u03c5\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd , Byz\u00e1ntion ) following the capture of Ravenna by the barbarians of Odoacer and the subsequent deposition of Romulus Augustus . The fall of the Western Roman Empire to Germanic kings , along with the hellenization of the Eastern Roman Empire into the Byzantine Empire , conventionally marks the end of Ancient Rome and the beginning of the Middle Ages . The predecessor state of the Roman Empire , the Roman Republic ( which had replaced Rome 's monarchy in the 6th century BC ) became severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflicts . In the mid-1st century BC Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC . Civil wars and proscriptions continued , culminating in the victory of Octavian , Caesar 's adopted son , over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC . The following year Octavian conquered Ptolemaic Egypt , ending the Hellenistic period that had begun with the conquests of Alexander the Great of Macedon in the 4th century BC . Octavian 's power then became unassailable , and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title Augustus , effectively making him the first Roman emperor . The first two centuries of the Empire saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana ( Roman Peace ) .",

Although initially the dynasty was of Turkic origin , it was Persianised in terms of language , culture , literature and habits .

The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror .

The genesis of the Italian colonial empire was the purchase in 1869 of Assab Bay on the Red Sea by an Italian navigation company which intended to establish a coaling station at the time the Suez Canal was being opened to navigation . This was taken over by the Italian government in 1882 , becoming modern Italy 's first overseas territory . Over the next two decades , the pace of European acquisitions in Africa increased , causing the so-called Scramble for Africa . By the start of the First World War in 1914 , Italy had acquired in Africa the colony of Eritrea on the Red Sea coast , a large protectorate and later colony in Somalia , and authority in formerly Ottoman Tripolitania and Cyrenaica ( gained after the Italo-Turkish War ) which were later unified in the colony of Libya . Outside Africa , Italy possessed the Dodecanese Islands off the coast of Turkey ( following the Italo-Turkish War ) and a concession in Tianjin in China ( following the Boxer War ) . During the First World War , Italy occupied southern Albania to prevent it from falling to Austria-Hungary . In 1917 , it established a protectorate over Albania , which remained in place until 1920 . The Fascist government that came to power with Benito Mussolini in 1922 sought to increase the size of the Italian empire and to satisfy the claims of Italian irredentists . In its second invasion of Ethiopia in 1935-36 , Italy was successful and it merged its new conquest with its older east African colonies to create Italian East Africa . In 1939 , Italy invaded Albania and incorporated it into the Fascist state . During the Second World War ( 1939-1945 ) , Italy occupied British Somaliland , parts of south-eastern France , western Egypt and most of Greece , but then lost those conquests and its African colonies , including Ethiopia , to the invading allied forces by 1943 .",

  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire . War in the Balkans , the aerial Battle of Britain , the Blitz , and the long Battle of the Atlantic followed .",

In 1970 , after the 1 September 1969 Free Officers Movement coup , there was an administrative reorganization which gave local authorities more power to implement policies of the national government , and redesignated some of the names and boundaries of the ten governorates . In February 1975 , Libya issued a law that abolished the governorates and their service directorates , however they continued to operate until they were fully replaced in 1983 by the baladiyat system districts .

  "/wiki/History_of_modern_Libya": "Muammar Gaddafi became the de facto leader of Libya on 1 September 1969 after leading a group of young Libyan military officers against King Idris I in a bloodless coup d'\u00e9tat . After the king had fled the country , the Libyan Revolutionary Command Council ( RCC ) headed by Gaddafi abolished the monarchy and the old constitution and established the Libyan Arab Republic , with the motto freedom , socialism and unity . After coming to power , the RCC government initiated a process of directing funds toward providing education , health care and housing for all . Public education in the country became free and primary education compulsory for both sexes . Medical care became available to the public at no cost , but providing housing for all was a task the RCC government was not able to complete . Under Gaddafi , per capita income in the country rose to more than US $ 11,000 , the fifth highest in Africa . The increase in prosperity was accompanied by a controversial foreign policy , and there was increased domestic political repression . During the 1980s and 1990s , Gaddafi , in alliance with the Eastern Bloc and Fidel Castro 's Cuba , openly supported rebel movements like Nelson Mandela 's African National Congress , the Palestine Liberation Organization , the Irish Republican Army and the Polisario Front ( Western Sahara ) . Gaddafi 's government was either known to be or suspected of participating in or aiding terrorist acts by these and other proxy forces . Additionally , Gaddafi undertook several invasions of neighboring states in Africa , notably Chad in the 1970s and 1980s . All of his actions led to a deterioration of Libya 's foreign relations with several countries , mostly Western states , and culminated in the 1986 United States bombing of Libya . Gaddafi defended his government 's actions by citing the need to support anti-imperialist and anti-colonial movements around the world .",

He was initially ideologically committed to Arab nationalism and Arab socialism but later ruled according to his own Third International Theory . Born near Sirte , Italian Libya , to a poor Bedouin family , Gaddafi became an Arab nationalist while at school in Sabha , later enrolling in the Royal Military Academy , Benghazi . Within the military , he founded a revolutionary group which deposed the Western-backed Senussi monarchy of Idris in a 1969 coup . Having taken power , Gaddafi converted Libya into a republic governed by his Revolutionary Command Council . Ruling by decree , he deported Libya 's Italian and Jewish populations and ejected its Western military bases . Strengthening ties to Arab nationalist governments - particularly Gamal Abdel Nasser 's Egypt - he unsuccessfully advocated pan-Arab political union . An Islamic modernist , he introduced sharia as the basis for the legal system and promoted Islamic socialism . He nationalized the oil industry and used the increasing state revenues to bolster the military , fund foreign revolutionaries , and implement social programs emphasizing house-building , healthcare and education projects .
