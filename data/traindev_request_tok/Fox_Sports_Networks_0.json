  "/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers": "The Los Angeles Clippers ( branded as the LA Clippers ) are an American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles . The Clippers compete in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) as a member of the Pacific Division in the league 's Western Conference . The Clippers play their home games at the Staples Center , an arena they share with fellow NBA team the Los Angeles Lakers , as well as the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women 's National Basketball Association ( WNBA ) , and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . The franchise was founded in 1970 as the Buffalo Braves , and were one of three expansion teams to join the NBA that year , along with the Cleveland Cavaliers and Portland Trail Blazers . The Braves saw some success and reached the playoffs three times , led by league Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) Bob McAdoo . Conflicts with the Canisius Golden Griffins over the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium and the sale of the franchise led to their relocating from Buffalo , New York , to San Diego , California . In 1978 , upon relocating , the franchise was rebranded to be known as the San Diego Clippers , in reference to the sailing ships that can be seen in the San Diego Bay . The franchise saw limited success on the court in its six years in San Diego despite the acquisition of star center Bill Walton , who missed nearly three full seasons due to injury upon his arrival . In 1981 , the franchise was acquired by Los Angeles-based real estate mogul Donald Sterling . In 1984 , the franchise was controversially relocated to Los Angeles by Sterling without the approval of the NBA . Despite fines and a lawsuit brought on against franchise ownership by the NBA seeking to return the franchise to San Diego , the team was ultimately permitted to remain in Los Angeles , where they failed to see significant regular season or playoff success . They were frequently seen as an example of a perennial loser in American professional sports , drawing unfavorable comparisons to their historically successful city-rivals , the Lakers .",

Their highlights in those years included the strong goaltending of Rogie Vachon , and the Triple Crown Line of Charlie Simmer , Dave Taylor and Hall of Fame player Marcel Dionne , who had a famous upset of the uprising Edmonton Oilers in a 1982 playoff game known as the Miracle on Manchester . In 1988 , the Kings traded with the Oilers to get their captain Wayne Gretzky , leading to a successful phase of the franchise that raised hockey 's popularity in Los Angeles , and helped raise the sport 's profile in the American Sun Belt region . Gretzky , fellow Hall of Famer Luc Robitaille and defenseman Rob Blake led the Kings to the franchise 's sole division title in 1990-91 , and the Kings ' first Stanley Cup Final appearance in 1993 . After the 1993 Finals , the Kings entered financial problems , with a bankruptcy in 1995 , which led to the franchise being acquired by Philip Anschutz ( owner of Anschutz Entertainment Group , operators of Staples Center ) and Edward P. Roski . A period of mediocrity ensued , with the Kings only resurging as they broke a six-year playoff drought in the 2009-10 season , with a team that included goaltender Jonathan Quick , defenseman Drew Doughty , and forwards Dustin Brown , Anze Kopitar and Justin Williams . Under coach Darryl Sutter , who was hired early in the 2011-12 season , the Kings won two Stanley Cups in three years : 2012 , over the New Jersey Devils , and 2014 , against the New York Rangers while Quick and Williams respectively won the Conn Smythe Trophy .",
