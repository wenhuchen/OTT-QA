  "/wiki/Big_East_Conference_(1979\u20132013)": "The Big East Conference was a collegiate athletics conference that consisted of as many as 16 universities in the eastern half of the United States from 1979 to 2013 . The conference 's members participated in 24 NCAA sports . The conference had a history of success at the national level in basketball throughout its history , while its shorter ( 1991 to 2013 ) football program , created by inviting one college and four other associate members ( their football programs only ) into the conference , resulted in two national championships . In basketball , Big East teams made 18 Final Four appearances and won seven NCAA Championships ( UConn with three , Villanova , Georgetown , Syracuse , and Louisville with one each ) . Of the Big East 's full members , all but South Florida attended the Final Four , the most of any conference , though Marquette , DePaul , Notre Dame , Rutgers , Cincinnati , and Pittsburgh made all their trips before joining the Big East . In 2011 , the Big East set the record for the most teams sent to the NCAA Division I Men 's Basketball Championship by a single conference with eleven out of their sixteen teams qualifying . In football , the Big East entered competition as a conference in 1991 , after inviting five football colleges to become members of the Big East , joining three teams from the Big East whose football teams were competing as Division I independents ( Boston College , Pittsburgh and Syracuse ) to form a new Division I football league . The strength of this league earned the Big East an automatic berth in the Bowl Championship Series , when that series was created in 1998 . The Big East won two national football championships , both by University of Miami . Between 2005 and 2012 , four of the more successful football schools left the Big East for other conferences , starting a process that led to a complete realignment of the Big East in 2013 . On July 1 , 2013 , the non-football playing schools ( also known collectively as the secular Catholic 7 ) formed a non-football playing conference that retains the Big East Conference name . The remaining six football-playing members , three of whom had only joined the Big East in 2005 when the earlier exodus had started , joined with four schools from other conferences to become the American Athletic Conference ( The American ) , which is the Big East 's legal successor .",
