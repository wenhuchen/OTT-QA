Among his real estate projects , he is the developer of the rebuilt World Trade Center complex in lower Manhattan as well as one of New York 's tallest residential towers at 30 Park Place , where he owns a home . His worth has been estimated at $ 3.5 billion as of 2016 . Silverstein was born in Brooklyn , and became involved in real estate , together with his father , establishing Silverstein Properties . Silverstein separated from his business partner , Bernard Mendik , in 1977 , and bought a number of large office buildings in Midtown and Lower Manhattan in the late 1970s . In 1980 , Silverstein won a bid from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to construct 7 World Trade Center on Vesey Street , just north of the main World Trade Center site . Silverstein was interested in acquiring the original World Trade Center complex , and put in a bid when the Port Authority put it up for lease in 2000 . Silverstein won the bid when a deal between the initial winner and the Port Authority fell through , and he signed the lease on July 24 , 2001 . Soon after the September 11 attacks , in 2001 , Silverstein declared his intent to rebuild , though he and his insurers became embroiled in a multi-year dispute over whether the attacks had constituted one event or two under the terms of the insurance policy , which provided for a maximum of $ 3.55 billion coverage per event . A settlement was reached in 2007 , with insurers agreeing to pay out $ 4.55 billion , which was not as much as Silverstein had sought . Silverstein also ran into multiple disputes with other parties in the rebuilding effort , including with the Port Authority . In an agreement reached in April 2006 , Silverstein retained rights to build three office towers ( 150 Greenwich Street , 175 Greenwich Street , and 200 Greenwich Street ) , while One World Trade Center ( previously referred to as the Freedom Tower ) would be owned by the Port Authority , as would Tower Five , which it would have the option of leasing to a different private developer and having redesigned as a residential building .",

The West Side Line formerly extended south to a railroad terminal at Spring Street , just north of Canal Street , and north to 35th Street at the site of the Javits Center .

Following what was then the largest bank acquisition in history , the Bank of America Corporation was founded .
