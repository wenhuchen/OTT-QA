Bledlow lies to the west and Monks Risborough to the east . It lies at the foot of the Chiltern Hills , at the north end of a gap or pass through the Chilterns , the south end of which is at West Wycombe . The A4010 road follows this route from West Wycombe through the town and then on to Aylesbury . Historically it was both a manor and an ecclesiastical parish , of the same extent as the manor , which comprised the present ecclesiastical parish of Princes Risborough ( excluding Ilmer ) and also the present ecclesiastical parish of Lacey Green , which became a separate parish in the 19th century . It was long and narrow ( a strip parish ) , taking in land below the Chiltern scarp , the slope of the scarp itself and also land above the scarp extending into the Chiltern hills . The manor and the parish extended from Longwick in the north through Alscot , the town of Princes Risborough , Loosley Row and Lacey Green to Speen and Walters Ash in the south . Since 1934 the civil parish of Princes Risborough ( formerly the same as the ecclesiastical parish ) has included the town of Princes Risborough , the village of Monks Risborough ( but not the outlying parts ) and part of Horsenden but has excluded Longwick . It is within the Wycombe district of Buckinghamshire and operates as a town council within Wycombe district . The town is overlooked by the Whiteleaf Cross , carved in the chalk of the hillside , though the cross itself is in Monks Risborough .",

It also has a private health club with swimming pool which opened in October 2003 . The civil parish for Fairford Leys is Coldharbour which is an Aylesbury Vale district . Its northern portion is home to a modern industrial area . The development is an example of an urban village , which is a town planning concept started in the UK in the late 1990s , with its roots in new urbanism and garden city ideals . The emphasis for this type of development is to focus on pedestrians over cars and other forms of community interaction . Fairford Leys is one of the first examples of a development planned using a Design Code , championed by John Prescott and the Labour government of the late 1990s . The aim of the code was to create an urban village development and it sets out design rules during , and also after , the construction phase , to ensure the individual developers all build to the same standard and to create cohesion to the design and appearance of the development as a whole . The driving force behind this was the original landowner , the Ernest Cook Trust . The architecture is inspired by traditional Aylesbury housing styles and pastiche Victorian lamp posts and railings . The centre of the estate is surrounded by the city wall , a concept originating from the masterplanner John Simpson and inspired by medieval city walls , such as York .",
