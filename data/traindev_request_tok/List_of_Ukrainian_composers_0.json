  "/wiki/Marcin_Leopolita": "Marcin Leopolita ( also Marcin z Lwowa ; Lw\u00f3w , now Lviv , Ukraine , 1537 - ca . 1584 ) was one of the most eminent Polish composers of the sixteenth century . He attended the Krak\u00f3w University ( Collegium Maius ) and may have studied under Sebastian z Felsztyna and/or Jan Jelen of Tuchola . By the age of 20 he was already a member of the royal music ensemble at the court of King Zygmunt August , apparently becoming court composer there in 1560 . Only a few compositions of Leopolita survive today . Four Latin motets ( Cibavit eos , Mihi autem , Resurgente Christo and Spiritus Domini ) are preserved only in organ tablature , and of these only Cibavit Eos can be restored with confidence to its original vocal form . All four of these works are known from a single source : a tablature formerly belonging to the Warsaw Musicological Society which now only survives as a photographic copy , the original having been destroyed during World War Two . This tablature was probably written around 1580 and has been known as the Tablature of Martin Leopolita , although while Leopolita himself was indeed an organist his connection with the manuscript is uncertain . Leopolita 's five-part mass Missa paschalis is the only sixteenth-century Polish mass to survive intact , and the Agnus Dei , which adds a sixth voice ( a second Cantus ) has the distinction of being the earliest extant example of six-part Polish polyphony . It is based on themes from four Polish vernacular Easter songs ( hence the designation 'Paschalis ' ) of which Chrystus Pan zmartwychwsta\u0142 is the most prominent .",

  "/wiki/Lutenist": "A lute ( /lju\u02d0t/ or /lu\u02d0t/ ) is any plucked string instrument with a neck ( either fretted or unfretted ) and a deep round back enclosing a hollow cavity , usually with a sound hole or opening in the body . More specifically , the term lute can refer to an instrument from the family of European lutes . The term also refers generally to any string instrument having the strings running in a plane parallel to the sound table ( in the Hornbostel-Sachs system ) . The strings are attached to pegs or posts at the end of the neck , which have some type of turning mechanism to enable the player to tighten the tension on the string or loosen the tension before playing ( which respectively raise or lower the pitch of a string ) , so that each string is tuned to a specific pitch ( or note ) . The lute is plucked or strummed with one hand while the other hand frets ( presses down ) the strings on the neck 's fingerboard . By pressing the strings on different places of the fingerboard , the player can shorten or lengthen the part of the string that is vibrating , thus producing higher or lower pitches ( notes ) . The European lute and the modern Near-Eastern oud descend from a common ancestor via diverging evolutionary paths . The lute is used in a great variety of instrumental music from the Medieval to the late Baroque eras and was the most important instrument for secular music in the Renaissance . During the Baroque music era , the lute was used as one of the instruments which played the basso continuo accompaniment parts . It is also an accompanying instrument in vocal works . The lute player either improvises ( realizes ) a chordal accompaniment based on the figured bass part , or plays a written-out accompaniment ( both music notation and tablature ( tab ) are used for lute ) . As a small instrument , the lute produces a relatively quiet sound .",

  "/wiki/Opera": "Opera is a form of theatre in which music has a leading role and the parts are taken by singers , but is distinct from musical theater . Such a work ( the literal translation of Italian word opera ) is typically a collaboration between a composer and a librettist and incorporates a number of the performing arts , such as acting , scenery , costume , and sometimes dance or ballet . The performance is typically given in an opera house , accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble , which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor . Opera is a key part of the Western classical music tradition . Originally understood as an entirely sung piece , in contrast to a play with songs , opera has come to include numerous genres , including some that include spoken dialogue such as musical theater , Singspiel and Op\u00e9ra comique . In traditional number opera , singers employ two styles of singing : recitative , a speech-inflected style , and self-contained arias . The 19th century saw the rise of the continuous music drama . Opera originated in Italy at the end of the 16th century ( with Jacopo Peri 's mostly lost Dafne , produced in Florence in 1598 ) and soon spread through the rest of Europe : Heinrich Sch\u00fctz in Germany , Jean-Baptiste Lully in France , and Henry Purcell in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century . In the 18th century , Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe ( except France ) , attracting foreign composers such as George Frideric Handel . Opera seria was the most prestigious form of Italian opera , until Christoph Willibald Gluck reacted against its artificiality with his reform operas in the 1760s . The most renowned figure of late 18th-century opera is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian comic operas , especially The Marriage of Figaro ( Le nozze di Figaro ) , Don Giovanni , and Cos\u00ec fan tutte , as well as Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail ( The Abduction from the Seraglio ) , and The Magic Flute ( Die Zauberfl\u00f6te ) , landmarks in the German tradition . The first third of the 19th century saw the high point of the bel canto style , with Gioachino Rossini , Gaetano Donizetti and Vincenzo Bellini all creating works that are still performed .",
  "/wiki/Symphony": "A symphony is an extended musical composition in Western classical music , most often written by composers for orchestra . Although the term has had many meanings from its origins in the ancient Greek era , by the late 18th century the word had taken on the meaning common today : a work usually consisting of multiple distinct sections or movements , often four , with the first movement in sonata form . Symphonies are almost always scored for an orchestra consisting of a string section ( violin , viola , cello , and double bass ) , brass , woodwind , and percussion instruments which altogether number about 30 to 100 musicians . Symphonies are notated in a musical score , which contains all the instrument parts . Orchestral musicians play from parts which contain just the notated music for their own instrument .
