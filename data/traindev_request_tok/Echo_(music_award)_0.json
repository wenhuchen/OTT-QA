  "/wiki/Flora_und_Botanischer_Garten_K\u00f6ln": "The Flora und Botanischer Garten K\u00f6ln ( 11.5 hectares ) is a municipal formal park and botanical garden located adjacent to Cologne Zoological Garden at Amsterdamer Stra\u00dfe 34 , Cologne , North Rhine-Westphalia , Germany . It is open daily without charge . The garden dates to 1863 when a private company was organized to create Flora park ( 5.5 hectares ) as a replacement for the city 's older botanical garden near the Cologne Cathedral , which in 1857 was destroyed for construction of the central railway station . This new park was designed by Peter Joseph Lenn\u00e9 in 1864 in a mixed German style , incorporating French Baroque , Italian Renaissance , and English landscape garden elements . In its center is a glass palace ( orangery ) structure of cast iron and glass patterned upon the Crystal Palace ( London ) and Jardin d'hiver ( Paris ) , which served as an exhibition site through the late 19th century , including horticultural exhibitions in 1875 and 1888 , and an industrial exhibition in 1889 . Frauen-Rosenhof , an art nouveau garden , was added in 1906 . Between 1912-1914 , as it suffered financial problems , the garden was acquired by the city , which in 1914 built an adjacent botanical garden ( 4.5 hectares ) . These two gardens were united in 1920 , with new glasshouses and exhibition houses for exotic and tropical plants added in the 1950s . Flora park was restored in 1987 , and today contains an Italian Renaissance garden with hornbeam pergolas , cascade , and the ( since a couple of years restored ) Flora Temple , surrounded by gardens in the English landscape style , as well as a heather garden , fern garden , fragrance garden , Mediterranean garden , and pond . It also contains a number of notable trees , some dating to the garden 's establishment ; more than 60 specimens have been designated natural monuments . The botanical garden cultivates nearly 10,000 types of plants , including approximately 2000 species in its alpine garden . It also contains good collections of magnolias , rhododendrons , coniferous trees , maples , and Hamamelidaceae , as well as a medicinal plant garden and farmer 's garden of local crops .",

The name was taken on by a theatre in Potsdamer Stra\u00dfe in 1992 .",
