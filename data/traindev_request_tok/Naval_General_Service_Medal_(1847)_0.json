  "/wiki/Glorious_First_of_June": "The Glorious First of June ( also known as the Fourth Battle of Ushant or , in France , as the Bataille du 13 prairial an 2 or Combat de Prairial ) [ Note A ] of 1794 was the first and largest fleet action of the naval conflict between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the First French Republic during the French Revolutionary Wars . The action was the culmination of a campaign that had criss-crossed the Bay of Biscay over the previous month in which both sides had captured numerous merchant ships and minor warships and had engaged in two partial , but inconclusive , fleet actions . The British Channel Fleet under Admiral Lord Howe attempted to prevent the passage of a vital French grain convoy from the United States , which was protected by the French Atlantic Fleet , commanded by Rear-Admiral Villaret-Joyeuse . The two forces clashed in the Atlantic Ocean , some 400 nautical miles ( 700 km ) west of the French island of Ushant on 1 June 1794 . During the battle , Howe defied naval convention by ordering his fleet to turn towards the French and for each of his vessels to rake and engage their immediate opponent . This unexpected order was not understood by all of his captains , and as a result his attack was more piecemeal than he intended . Nevertheless , his ships inflicted a severe tactical defeat on the French fleet . In the aftermath of the battle both fleets were left shattered ; in no condition for further combat , Howe and Villaret returned to their home ports . Despite losing seven of his ships of the line , Villaret had bought enough time for the French grain convoy to reach safety unimpeded by Howe 's fleet , securing a strategic success . However , he was also forced to withdraw his battle fleet back to port , leaving the British free to conduct a campaign of blockade for the remainder of the war . In the immediate aftermath both sides claimed victory and the outcome of the battle was seized upon by the press of both nations as a demonstration of the prowess and bravery of their respective navies . The Glorious First of June demonstrated a number of the major problems inherent in the French and British navies at the start of the Revolutionary Wars .",
  "/wiki/HMS_Romney_(1762)": "HMS Romney was a 50-gun fourth rate of the Royal Navy . She served during the American War of Independence , and the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars in a career that spanned forty years . Five ships of the Royal Navy have been named HMS Romney . The origins of the name are from the town of New Romney , although it may be that the name entered the Royal Navy in honour of Henry Sydney , 1st Earl of Romney . Launched in 1762 , Romney spent most of her early career in North American waters , serving on the Newfoundland station , often as the flagship of the commander-in-chief . The ship was involved in the tensions leading up to the American Revolution when she was sent to support the Boston commissioners enforcing the Townshend Acts in 1768 . Her actions involved impressing local sailors , confiscating a vessel belonging to John Hancock and providing a refuge for the unpopular commissioners when rioting broke out . She remained in American waters for part of the ensuing war , but towards the end operated in European waters after the French entry to the conflict . Romney was laid up in ordinary or under repair for most of the subsequent years of peace , but returned to active service on the outbreak of war with Revolutionary France . She was in the Mediterranean supporting Lord Hood 's occupation of Toulon in 1793 , and remained there for several years . During this time she captured the 44-gun French Sibylle .

  "/wiki/Naval_Battle_of_Genoa_(1795)": "The Battle of Genoa ( also known as the Battle of Cape Noli and in French as Bataille de G\u00eanes ) was a naval battle fought between French and allied Anglo-Neapolitan forces on 14 March 1795 in the Gulf of Genoa , a large bay in the Ligurian Sea off the coast of the Republic of Genoa , during the French Revolutionary Wars . The French fleet was led by Contre-amiral Pierre Martin and comprised 14 ( later 13 ) ships of the line while the British Royal Navy and Neapolitan fleet , under Vice-Admiral William Hotham mustered 13 ships of the line . The battle ended with a minor British-Neapolitan victory and the capture of two French ships . The battle was part of a naval campaign in the spring of 1795 , during which Martin sought to assert French control over the waters off Southern France . These had been effectively ceded to the British 18 months earlier when the British captured the French Mediterranean naval base of Toulon . Although it was recaptured at an ensuing siege , the main French Mediterranean fleet had been burned in the harbour . Only half the fleet was salvageable and as repairs continued in Toulon , the British used their dominance to invade and capture the island of Corsica during 1794 . By the start of 1795 enough French ships were in fighting condition that Martin felt able to make limited cruises in the Ligurian Sea . At the start of March 1795 he sailed for Genoa , encountering and capturing a British ship of the line en route . Off Genoa Martin found himself pursued by Hotham 's fleet and , after two days of manoeuvres in calm weather , the French admiral turned back towards the French coast . Hotham pursued , and on 13 March his leading ships caught the French rearguard . For two days Martin 's rearmost ships fought a series of running engagements with the British fleet in which several ships from both sides were badly damaged .",

  "/wiki/Cornwallis's_Retreat": "Cornwallis 's Retreat was a naval engagement during the French Revolutionary Wars in which a British Royal Navy squadron of five ships of the line and two frigates was attacked by a much larger French Navy fleet of 12 ships of the line and 11 frigates . The action took place in the waters off the west coast of Brittany on 16-17 June 1795 ( 28-29 Prairial an III of the French Republican Calendar ) . A British naval squadron under Vice-Admiral William Cornwallis began operating off Brittany on 7 June ; in the following week he attacked a French merchant convoy and captured several ships . In response , Vice-amiral Villaret de Joyeuse led the main French fleet out of port to attack the British , who were spotted on 16 June . Heavily outnumbered , Cornwallis turned away from the French and attempted to escape into open water , with the French fleet in pursuit . After a full day 's chase the British squadron lost speed , due to poorly loaded holds on two of their ships , and the French vanguard pulled within range on the morning of 17 June . Unwilling to abandon his rearguard , Cornwallis counter-attacked with the rest of his squadron . A fierce combat developed , culminating in Cornwallis interposing his flagship HMS Royal Sovereign between the British and French forces . Cornwallis 's determined resistance , and his squadron 's signals to a group of unknown ships spotted in the distance , led Villaret de Joyeuse to believe that the main British Channel Fleet was approaching . Villaret therefore broke off the battle on the evening of 17 June and ordered his ships to withdraw . This allowed Cornwallis to escape ; he returned to port at Plymouth with his squadron battered but intact . Villaret withdrew to an anchorage off Belle \u00cele , close to the naval base at Brest .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Groix": "The first two years of the French Revolutionary Wars had seen the French Atlantic Fleet , based principally at the Breton harbour of Brest , suffer a series of setbacks . The tense atmosphere in France following the French Revolution was reflected in the fleet , which suffered a mutiny in September 1793 followed by a purge of suspected anti-republicans which resulted in the death or imprisonment of a number of experienced commanders . In May 1794 , the French fleet sallied into the Atlantic to protect an incoming grain convoy from the United States and was attacked by the British Channel Fleet at the battle of the Glorious First of June , losing seven ships , although the convoy was saved . In the winter of 1794-1795 , five more French ships were lost in a disastrous sortie in the middle of the Atlantic winter storm season known as the Croisi\u00e8re du Grand Hiver . By the spring of 1795 , the British Channel Fleet was in the ascendancy , enforcing a distant blockade of the French fleet in Brest . In May 1795 , with much of the winter 's damage repaired , the French commander Vice-amiral Villaret de Joyeuse sent a squadron of three ships of the line and several frigates under Contre-amiral Jean Gaspard Vence to Bordeaux with orders to escort a convoy of merchant ships carrying wine and brandy to Brest . On 8 June , as Vence 's convoy passed the fortified island of Belle \u00cele on the southern Breton coast they were discovered by a British battle squadron of five ships of the line and two frigates under Vice-Admiral William Cornwallis . Vence ordered his outnumbered ships to shelter under the batteries of Belle \u00cele , and after a brief skirmish Cornwallis withdrew his forces with eight captured merchant ships . While Cornwallis was escorting his prizes to the mouth of the Channel , Vence sailed out of the Belle \u00cele anchorage and discovered on 15 June that the main force of the Atlantic fleet had sailed to rescue him , a mission ordered by government over the objections of the fleet 's officers that Vence would be able to easily extricate himself from the anchorage due to the proximity of the port of Lorient . On the morning of 16 June Cornwallis returned to the region , hunting for Vence , and instead discovered Villaret de Joyeuse with an overwhelming force . This time Cornwallis was forced to retreat , heading into open water with the French fleet in pursuit . Cornwallis was hampered by the poor sailing of two of his squadron , and on the morning of 17 June the leading French ships were close enough to open fire on his rearguard .",

She went on to serve under a number of the most distinguished naval commanders of her age , in theatres ranging from the English Channel to the East Indies . During this time she was active against enemy privateers , and on several occasions she engaged ships larger than herself , being rewarded with victory on each occasion . She captured the 40-gun R\u00e9sistance and the 22-gun Constance in 1797 , the 36-gun Psych\u00e9 in 1805 , and the 40-gun Pi\u00e9montaise in 1808 .

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Camperdown": "The Battle of Camperdown ( known in Dutch as the Zeeslag bij Kamperduin ) was a major naval action fought on 11 October 1797 , [ Note 1 ] between the British North Sea Fleet under Admiral Adam Duncan and a Batavian Navy ( Dutch ) fleet under Vice-Admiral Jan de Winter . The battle was the most significant action between British and Dutch forces during the French Revolutionary Wars and resulted in a complete victory for the British , who captured eleven Dutch ships without losing any of their own . In 1795 , the Dutch Republic had been overrun by the army of the French Republic and had been reorganised into the Batavian Republic , a French client state . In early 1797 , after the French Atlantic Fleet had suffered heavy losses in a disastrous winter campaign , the Dutch fleet was ordered to reinforce the French at Brest . The rendezvous never occurred ; the continental allies failed to capitalise on the Spithead and Nore mutinies that paralysed the British Channel forces and North Sea fleets during the spring of 1797 . By September , the Dutch fleet under De Winter were blockaded within their harbour in the Texel by the British North Sea fleet under Duncan . At the start of October , Duncan was forced to return to Yarmouth for supplies and De Winter used the opportunity to conduct a brief raid into the North Sea . When the Dutch fleet returned to the Dutch coast on 11 October , Duncan was waiting , and intercepted De Winter off the coastal village of Camperduin . Attacking the Dutch line of battle in two loose groups , Duncan 's ships broke through at the rear and van and were subsequently engaged by Dutch frigates lined up on the other side . The battle split into two m\u00eal\u00e9es , one to south , or leeward , where the more numerous British overwhelmed the Dutch rear , and one to the north , or windward , where a more evenly matched exchange centred on the battling flagships . As the Dutch fleet attempted to reach shallower waters in an effort to escape the British attack , the British leeward division joined the windward combat and eventually forced the surrender of the Dutch flagship Vrijheid and ten other ships . The loss of their flagship prompted the surviving Dutch ships to disperse and retreat , Duncan recalling the British ships with their prizes for the journey back to Yarmouth .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_the_Nile": "The Battle of the Nile ( also known as the Battle of Aboukir Bay ; French : Bataille d'Aboukir ) was a major naval battle fought between the British Royal Navy and the Navy of the French Republic at Aboukir Bay on the Mediterranean coast off the Nile Delta of Egypt from the 1st to the 3rd of August 1798 . The battle was the climax of a naval campaign that had raged across the Mediterranean during the previous three months , as a large French convoy sailed from Toulon to Alexandria carrying an expeditionary force under General Napoleon Bonaparte . The British fleet was led in the battle by Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson ; they decisively defeated the French under Vice-Admiral Fran\u00e7ois-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers . Bonaparte sought to invade Egypt as the first step in a campaign against British India , part of a greater effort to drive Britain out of the French Revolutionary Wars . As Bonaparte 's fleet crossed the Mediterranean , it was pursued by a British force under Nelson who had been sent from the British fleet in the Tagus to learn the purpose of the French expedition and to defeat it . He chased the French for more than two months , on several occasions missing them only by a matter of hours . Bonaparte was aware of Nelson 's pursuit and enforced absolute secrecy about his destination . He was able to capture Malta and then land in Egypt without interception by the British naval forces . With the French army ashore , the French fleet anchored in Aboukir Bay , 20 miles ( 32 km ) northeast of Alexandria . Commander Vice-Admiral Fran\u00e7ois-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers believed that he had established a formidable defensive position . The British fleet arrived off Egypt on 1 August and discovered Brueys 's dispositions , and Nelson ordered an immediate attack . His ships advanced on the French line and split into two divisions as they approached .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Tory_Island": "The Battle of Tory Island ( sometimes called the Battle of Donegal , Battle of Lough Swilly or Warren 's Action ) was a naval action of the French Revolutionary Wars , fought on 12 October 1798 between French and British squadrons off the northwest coast of County Donegal , then in the Kingdom of Ireland . The last action of the Irish Rebellion of 1798 , the Battle of Tory Island ended the final attempt by the French Navy to land substantial numbers of soldiers in Ireland during the war . The Society of United Irishmen , led by Wolfe Tone , launched an uprising against British rule in Ireland in May 1798 . At the request of the rebels , a small French force under General Humbert was landed at Killala , County Mayo , but by early September both this expedition and the rebellion had been defeated . Unaware of Humbert 's surrender , the French despatched reinforcements on 16 September . Having missed one invasion force , the Royal Navy was on alert for another , and when the squadron carrying the reinforcements left Brest they were soon spotted . After a long chase , the French were brought to battle in a bay off the rugged County Donegal coast in the west of Ulster , very close to Tory Island . During the action the outnumbered French attempted to escape , but were run down and defeated piecemeal , with the British capturing four ships and scattering the survivors . Over the next fortnight , British frigate patrols scoured the passage back to Brest , capturing three more ships . Of the ten ships in the original French squadron , only two frigates and a schooner reached safety . British losses in the campaign were minimal . The battle marked the last attempt by the French Navy to launch an invasion of any part of the British Isles ."
