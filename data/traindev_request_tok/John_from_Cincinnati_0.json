  "/wiki/Astral_projection": "Astral projection ( or astral travel ) is a term used in esotericism to describe an intentional out-of-body experience ( OBE ) that assumes the existence of a soul or consciousness called an astral body that is separate from the physical body and capable of travelling outside it throughout the universe . The idea of astral travel is ancient and occurs in multiple cultures . The modern terminology of 'astral projection ' was coined and promoted by 19th century Theosophists . It is sometimes reported in association with dreams , and forms of meditation . Some individuals have reported perceptions similar to descriptions of astral projection that were induced through various hallucinogenic and hypnotic means ( including self-hypnosis ) . There is no scientific evidence that there is a consciousness or soul which is separate from normal neural activity or that one can consciously leave the body and make observations , and astral projection has been characterized as a pseudoscience .",
  "/wiki/Pythagoreanism": "Pythagoreanism originated in the 6th century BC , based on the teachings and beliefs held by Pythagoras and his followers , the Pythagoreans . Pythagoras established the first Pythagorean community in Crotone , Italy . Early Pythagorean communities spread throughout Magna Graecia . Pythagoras death and disputes about his teachings led to the development of two philosophical traditions within Pythagoreanism . The akousmatikoi were superseded in the 4th century BC as a significant mendicant school of philosophy by the Cynics . The math\u0113matikoi philosophers were absorbed into the Platonic school in the 4th century BC . Following the political instability in the Magna Graecia , some Pythagorean philosophers fled to mainland Greece while others regrouped in Rhegium . By about 400 BC the majority of Pythagorean philosophers had left Italy . Pythagorean ideas exercised a marked influence on Plato and through him , on all of Western philosophy . Many of the surviving sources on Pythagoras originate with Aristotle and the philosophers of the Peripatetic school . As a philosophic tradition , Pythagoreanism was revived in the 1st century BC , giving rise to Neopythagoreanism . The worship of Pythagoras continued in Italy and as a religious community Pythagoreans appear to have survived as part of , or deeply influenced , the Bacchic cults and Orphism .",
