Stratford was originally inhabited by Anglo-Saxons and remained a village before the lord of the manor , John of Coutances , set out plans to develop it into a town in 1196 . In that same year , Stratford was granted a charter from King Richard I to hold a weekly market in the town , giving it its status as a market town . As a result , Stratford experienced an increase in trade and commerce as well as urban expansion . The town is a popular tourist destination owing to its status as the birthplace and gravesite of playwright and poet William Shakespeare , and receives approximately 2.5 million visitors a year .

M. Synge , No\u00ebl Coward and J . B. Priestley . Since the First World War , the wide stage has made the theatre suitable for large-scale musical productions , and the theatre has accordingly specialised in hosting musicals . The theatre has been home to record-setting musical theatre runs , notably the First World War sensation Chu Chin Chow and the current production , Andrew Lloyd Webber 's The Phantom of the Opera , which has played continuously at Her Majesty 's since 1986 .

Legitimate drama unaccompanied by music was prohibited by law in all but the two London patent theatres , and so this theatre quickly became an opera house . Between 1711 and 1739 , more than 25 operas by George Frideric Handel premiered here . Joseph Haydns series of concerts in London took place here in the 1790s . In the early 19th century , the theatre hosted the opera company that was to move to the Theatre Royal , Covent Garden , in 1847 , and presented the first London performances of Mozart 's La clemenza di Tito , Cos\u00ec fan tutte and Don Giovanni .

  "/wiki/Theatre_Royal,_Drury_Lane": "The Theatre Royal , Drury Lane , commonly known as Drury Lane , is a West End theatre and Grade I listed building in Covent Garden , London , England . The building faces Catherine Street ( earlier named Bridges or Brydges Street ) and backs onto Drury Lane . The building is the most recent in a line of four theatres which were built at the same location , the earliest of which dated back to 1663 , making it the oldest theatre site in London still in use . According to the author Peter Thomson , for its first two centuries , Drury Lane could reasonably have claimed to be London 's leading theatre . For most of that time , it was one of a handful of patent theatres , granted monopoly rights to the production of legitimate drama in London ( meaning spoken plays , rather than opera , dance , concerts , or plays with music ) . The first theatre on the site was built at the behest of Thomas Killigrew in the early 1660s , when theatres were allowed to reopen during the English Restoration . Initially known as Theatre Royal in Bridges Street , the theatre 's proprietors hired prominent actors who performed at the theatre on a regular basis , including Nell Gwyn and Charles Hart . In 1672 , the theatre caught fire and Killigrew built a larger theatre on the same plot , renamed the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane ; it opened in 1674 . This building lasted nearly 120 years , under the leaderships of Colley Cibber , David Garrick and Richard Brinsley Sheridan , the last of whom employed Joseph Grimaldi as the theatre 's resident Clown . In 1791 , under Sheridan 's management , the building was demolished to make way for a larger theatre which opened in 1794 . This new Drury Lane survived for 15 years before burning down in 1809 .
