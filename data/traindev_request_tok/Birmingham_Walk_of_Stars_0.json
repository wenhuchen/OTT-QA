The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants ' cars must conform . A Formula One season consists of a series of races , known as Grands Prix ( French for 'grand prizes ' or 'great prizes ' ) , which take place worldwide on purpose-built circuits and on public roads . The results of each race are evaluated using a points system to determine two annual World Championships : one for drivers , the other for constructors . Drivers must hold valid Super Licences , the highest class of racing licence issued by the FIA . The races must run on tracks graded 1 ( formerly A ) , the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA . Most events occur in rural locations on purpose-built tracks , but several events take place on city streets . Formula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world , owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce . The cars underwent major changes in 2017 , allowing wider front and rear wings , and wider tyres , resulting in peak cornering forces near 6.5 lateral g and top speeds of up to approximately 350 km/h ( 215 mph ) . As of 2019 [ update ] the hybrid engines are limited in performance to a maximum of 15,000 rpm , the cars are very dependent on electronics and aerodynamics , suspension and tyres .

  "/wiki/Journalism": "Journalism is the production and distribution of reports on events . The word journalism applies to the occupation , as well as citizen journalists who gather and publish information . Journalistic media include print , television , radio , Internet , and , in the past , newsreels . Concepts of the appropriate role for journalism vary between countries . In some nations , the news media are controlled by government intervention and are not fully independent . In others , the news media are independent of the government but instead operate as private industry motivated by profit . In addition to the varying nature of how media organizations are run and funded , countries may have differing implementations of laws handling the freedom of speech and libel cases . The proliferation of the Internet and smartphones has brought significant changes to the media landscape since the turn of the 21st century . This has created a shift in the consumption of print media channels , as people increasingly consume news through e-readers , smartphones , and other personal electronic devices , as opposed to the more traditional formats of newspapers , magazines , or television news channels . News organizations are challenged to fully monetize their digital wing , as well as improvise on the context in which they publish in print . Newspapers have seen print revenues sink at a faster pace than the rate of growth for digital revenues .",

In its format , currently owned and licensed by Sony Pictures Television , contestants tackle a series of multiple-choice questions to win large cash prizes in a format that twists on many game show genre conventions - only one contestant plays at a time , similar to radio quizzes ; contestants are given the question before attempting an answer , and have no time limit to answer questions ; and the amount offered increases as they tackle questions that become increasingly difficult . The maximum cash prize offered in most versions of the format is one million of the local currency . The original British version debuted on 4 September 1998 on the ITV network and was aired until its final episode on 11 February 2014 . A revived series of seven episodes to commemorate its 20th anniversary aired from 5 to 11 May 2018 .
