  "/wiki/Catwoman": "Catwoman is a fictional character created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics , commonly in association with superhero Batman . The character made her debut as the Cat in Batman # 1 ( Spring 1940 ) , and her real name is Selina Kyle . She is Batman 's most enduring love interest and is known for her complex love-hate relationship with him . Catwoman is a Gotham City burglar who typically wears a tight , one-piece outfit and uses a bullwhip for a weapon . She was originally characterized as a supervillain and adversary of Batman , but she has been featured in a series since the 1990s which portrays her as an antiheroine , often doing the wrong things for the right reasons . The character thrived since her earliest appearances , but she took an extended hiatus from September 1954 to November 1966 due to the developing Comics Code Authority in 1954 . These issues involved the rules regarding the development and portrayal of female characters that were in violation of the Comics Code , a code which is no longer in use . In the comics , Holly Robinson and Eiko Hasigawa have both adopted the Catwoman identity , apart from Selina Kyle . Catwoman has been featured in many media adaptations related to Batman . Actresses Julie Newmar , Lee Meriwether , and Eartha Kitt introduced her to a large audience on the 1960s Batman television series and the 1966 Batman film . Michelle Pfeiffer portrayed the character in 1992 's Batman Returns . Halle Berry starred in 2004 's Catwoman ; this , however , was a critical and commercial flop and bears little similarity to the Batman character .",

  "/wiki/Secretary": "A secretary , administrative professional , or personal assistant is a person whose work consists of supporting management , including executives , using a variety of project management , communication , or organizational skills . However this role should not be confused with the role of an executive secretary , who differs from a personal assistant . In many countries , an executive secretary is a high-ranking position in the administrative hierarchy . In fact in Pakistan , federal secretaries are dubbed as the most influential people in the country . The functions of a personal assistant may be entirely carried out to assist one other employee or may be for the benefit of more than one . In other situations a secretary is an officer of a society or organization who deals with correspondence , admits new members , and organizes official meetings and events ."
