The towers of the Alta Vista district recall Barranquilla , and many of the residential neighborhoods have architecture and landscaping that are similar to suburbs in the United States in the 1950s , including 'cookie cutter ' homes , sidewalks , and patterned lawns . This is an artifact due to the presence in the 1960s and early 1970s of US Steel , an American company with iron mining operations in the region .
