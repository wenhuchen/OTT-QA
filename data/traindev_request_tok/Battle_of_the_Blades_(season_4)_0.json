  "/wiki/Autism_Speaks": "Autism Speaks Inc. ( AS ) is the largest autism advocacy organization in the United States . It sponsors autism research and conducts awareness and outreach activities aimed at families , governments , and the public . It was founded in February 2005 by Bob Wright , vice chairman of General Electric , and his wife Suzanne , a year after their grandson Christian was diagnosed with autism . Autism Speaks has been the focus of controversy ; over 60 disability rights organizations have condemned the organization for failing to represent autistic people , and for exploitative practices . The autism rights movement and neurodiversity advocates see autism as a difference rather than a disease that needs to be cured and have criticised Autism Speaks for seeking a cure . In response , former president Liz Feld has stated that one-third of people with autism also have a seizure disorder , half suffer serious digestive complications , 50 percent wander , and more than 30 percent are nonverbal , claiming that those difficulties can only be solved through medical research . However , the word cure was dropped from its mission statement in 2016 .",
