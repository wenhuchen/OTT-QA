  "/wiki/China": "China ( Chinese : \u4e2d\u56fd ; pinyin : Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 ) , officially the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) , is a country in East Asia and is the world 's most populous country , with a population of around 1.428 billion in 2017 . Covering approximately 9,600,000 square kilometers ( 3,700,000 sq mi ) , it is the third largest country by area . [ j ] Governed by the Communist Party of China , the state exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces , [ k ] five autonomous regions , four direct-controlled municipalities ( Beijing , Tianjin , Shanghai , and Chongqing ) , and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty . China , as a whole , was ravaged by feudal warlordism and Japan during World War II .",

The engine features a high overall pressure ratio , yielding a low specific fuel consumption for its time . Although the compressor is all-axial , like the earlier General Electric T58 , the power turbine shaft is coaxial with the HP shaft and delivers power to the front of the engine , not rearwards . Fourteen compressor stages are required to deliver the required overall pressure ratio . Compressor handling is facilitated by 4 rows of variable stators . Unlike the T58 , the power turbine has 2 stages . Later versions of the engine produce from 3,925 to 4,750 shp ( 2,927 to 3,542 kW ) .

At 17,125,200 square kilometres ( 6,612,100 sq mi ) , it is by far the largest country in the world by area , covering more than one-eighth of the Earth 's inhabited land area , spanning eleven time zones , and bordering 16 sovereign nations . The territory of Russia extends from the Baltic Sea in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east , and from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea and the Caucasus in the south . With 146.7 million inhabitants living in the country 's 85 federal subjects as of 2020 , Russia is the most populous nation in Europe and the ninth-most populous nation in the world . Russia 's capital and largest city is Moscow ; other major urban areas include Saint Petersburg , Novosibirsk , Yekaterinburg , Nizhny Novgorod , Kazan and Chelyabinsk . The East Slavs emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD . Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants , the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century . In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire , beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium . Rus ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states , until it was finally reunified by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th century . By the 18th century , the nation had greatly expanded through conquest , annexation , and exploration to become the Russian Empire , which was the third largest empire in history , stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east . Following the Russian Revolution , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) became the largest and leading constituent of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR/Soviet Union ) , the world 's first constitutionally socialist state .",

  "/wiki/SOCATA_TBM": "The SOCATA TBM ( now Daher TBM ) is a family of high performance single-engine turboprop light business and utility aircraft manufactured by Daher . It was originally collaboratively developed between the American Mooney Airplane Company and French light aircraft manufacturer SOCATA . The design of the TBM family originates from the Mooney 301 , a comparatively low-powered and smaller prototype Mooney developed in the early 1980s . Following Mooney 's acquisition by French owners , Mooney and SOCATA held a series of in-depth discussions on the potential for co-developing a new enlarged turboprop design derived from the earlier 301 ; these resulted in the formation of a joint venture for the purpose of developing and manufacturing the envisioned aircraft , which was designated as the TBM 700 . From the onset , emphasis was placed upon the design 's speed , altitude , and reliability . Upon its entry onto the market in 1990 , it held the distinction of being the first high-performance single-engine passenger/cargo aircraft to enter production . Shortly after launch , the TBM 700 was a market success , which quickly led to the production of multiple variants and improved models , often incorporating more powerful engines and new avionics , amongst other features . The TBM 850 is the production name assigned to the TBM 700N , an improved version of the aircraft powered by a single Pratt & Whitney PT6A-66D . In March 2014 , an aerodynamically refined version of the TBM 700N , marketed as the TBM 900 , was made available .",

  "/wiki/ATR_42": "The ATR 42 is a twin-turboprop , short-haul regional airliner developed and manufactured in France and Italy by ATR ( Aerei da Trasporto Regionale or Avions de transport r\u00e9gional ) , a joint venture formed by French aerospace company A\u00e9rospatiale ( now Airbus ) and Italian aviation conglomerate Aeritalia ( now Leonardo S.p.A. ) . The number 42 in its name is derived from the aircraft 's standard seating configuration in a passenger-carrying configuration , which typically varies between 40 and 52 passengers . During the 1980s , French aerospace company A\u00e9rospatiale and Italian aviation conglomerate Aeritalia merged their separate work upon a new generation of regional aircraft together . For this purpose , a new jointly owned company was established , ATR , for the purpose of developing , manufacturing , and marketing their first airliner , which was later designated as the ATR 42 . On 16 August 1984 , the first model of the series , designated as the ATR 42-300 , performed the type 's maiden flight . Type certification from French and Italian aviation authorities was granted during September 1985 , and the aircraft performed its first revenue-earning flight , operated by launch customer Air Littoral , during December of that year . To date , all of the ATR series have been manufactured at the company 's final assembly line in Toulouse , France ; ATR benefits from its sharing of resources and technology with Airbus SE , which has continued to hold a 50 percent stake in the company . Improved models of the aircraft have been introduced , incorporating new avionics such as a glass cockpit , and the adoption of newer engine versions for enhanced performance , such as increased efficiency and reliability along with reductions in operational costs . This aircraft serves as the basis for the larger ATR 72 , which was also developed during the late 1980s to complement its smaller sibling . The ATR 42 and ATR 72 have been produced side-by-side for decades .",

The fuel crisis and increasing worries about aircraft noise led business planners at British Aerospace to believe that there was a market for a short-range , low-noise , fuel-efficient turboprop aircraft . By the time it entered the market , the segment was already well represented by designs such as the de Havilland Canada Dash 8 , ATR 42 and ATR 72 and production was ended after only 65 examples ."
