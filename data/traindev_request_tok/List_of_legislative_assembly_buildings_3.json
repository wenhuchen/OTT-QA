As an archduchy , it was a major component and administrative centre of the Holy Roman Empire . Early in the 19th century , Austria established its own empire , which became a great power and the leading force of the German Confederation but pursued its own course independently of the other German states . Following the Austro-Prussian War and the compromise with Hungary , the Dual Monarchy was established . Austria was involved in World War I under Emperor Franz Joseph following the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand , the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne . After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy , the Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed with the intent of the union with Germany , which eventually failed because of the Allied Powers and the state remained unrecognized .",

It was built to house the two chambers of the Imperial Council ( Reichsrat ) , the bicameral legislature of the Cisleithanian ( Austrian ) part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire . Since its construction , the Parliament Building has been the seat of these two houses , and their successors - the National Council ( Nationalrat ) and the Federal Council ( Bundesrat ) - of the Austrian legislature .

He designed the building holistically , aiming to have each element harmonizing with all the others . He was therefore also responsible for the interior decoration , such as statues , paintings , furniture , chandeliers , and numerous other elements . Hansen was honored by Emperor Franz Joseph with the title of Freiherr ( Baron ) after its completion .

With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres ( 42,855 sq mi ) , Bulgaria is Europe 's 16th-largest country . One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture , which dates back to 6,500 BC . In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for Thracians , Persians , Celts and ancient Macedonians ; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45 . The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries .

The assembly is presided over by a president ( currently Richard Ferrand ) , normally from the largest party represented , assisted by vice-presidents from across the represented political spectrum . The term of the National Assembly is five years ; however , the President of the Republic may dissolve the Assembly ( thereby calling for new elections ) unless it has been dissolved in the preceding twelve months . This measure has become rarer since the 2000 referendum reduced the presidential term from seven to five years : a President usually has a majority elected in the Assembly two months after the presidential election , and it would be useless for him/her to dissolve it for those reasons . Following a tradition started by the first National Assembly during the French Revolution , the left-wing parties sit to the left as seen from the president 's seat , and the right-wing parties sit to the right , and the seating arrangement thus directly indicates the political spectrum as represented in the Assembly .

Hungary 's capital and largest city is Budapest ; other major urban areas include Debrecen , Szeged , Miskolc , P\u00e9cs and Gy\u0151r . The territory of modern Hungary was for centuries inhabited by a succession of peoples , including Celts , Romans , Germanic tribes , Huns , West Slavs and the Avars . The foundations of the Hungarian state were established in the late ninth century CE by the Hungarian grand prince \u00c1rp\u00e1d following the conquest of the Carpathian Basin . His great-grandson Stephen I ascended the throne in 1000 , converting his realm to a Christian kingdom . By the 12th century , Hungary became a regional power , reaching its cultural and political height in the 15th century . Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 , Hungary was partially occupied by the Ottoman Empire ( 1541-1699 ) . It came under Habsburg rule at the turn of the 18th century , and later joined Austria to form the Austro-Hungarian Empire , a major European power . The Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed after World War I , and the subsequent Treaty of Trianon established Hungary 's current borders , resulting in the loss of 71% of its territory , 58% of its population , and 32% of ethnic Hungarians .",

  "/wiki/Iceland": "Iceland ( Icelandic : \u00cdsland ; [ \u02c8istlant ] ( listen ) ) [ c ] is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic , with a population of 360,390 and an area of 103,000 km2 ( 40,000 sq mi ) , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe . [ d ] The capital and largest city is Reykjav\u00edk . Reykjavik and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population . Iceland is volcanically and geologically active . The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields , mountains , and glaciers , and many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands . Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate , despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle . Its high latitude and marine influence keep summers chilly , with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate . According to the ancient manuscript Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k , the settlement of Iceland began in 874 AD when the Norwegian chieftain Ing\u00f3lfr Arnarson became the first permanent settler on the island . In the following centuries , Norwegians , and to a lesser extent other Scandinavians , emigrated to Iceland , bringing with them thralls ( i.e. , slaves or serfs ) of Gaelic origin . The island was governed as an independent commonwealth under the Althing , one of the world 's oldest functioning legislative assemblies . Following a period of civil strife , Iceland acceded to Norwegian rule in the 13th century . The establishment of the Kalmar Union in 1397 united the kingdoms of Norway , Denmark , and Sweden .",
  "/wiki/Al\u00feingish\u00fasi\u00f0": "Al\u00feingish\u00fasi\u00f0 ( Icelandic pronunciation : \u200b [ \u02c8al\u03b8i\u0272c\u026as\u02cchu\u02d0s\u026a\u00f0 ] , The Parliament House ) is a classical 19th century structure which stands by Austurv\u00f6llur in central Reykjav\u00edk , Iceland . It houses Al\u00feingi , the Icelandic parliament . The building was designed by Danish architect Ferdinand Meldahl and built using hewn dolerite from 1880 to 1881 . Al\u00feingish\u00fasi\u00f0 has also housed the Icelandic National Library and Antiquaries Collection , and later the Icelandic National Gallery . The University of Iceland used the first floor of the house from 1911 to 1940 , and the President of Iceland had his offices in the building until 1973 . Today , only the debating chamber , a few small meeting rooms and the offices of some of the senior parliamentary staff are actually located in Al\u00feingish\u00fasi\u00f0 . Committee meeting rooms , parliamentarians offices and most of Al\u00feingi 's secretariat are located in other buildings in the area around Austurv\u00f6llur . There are currently plans to build a new building to house these offices and meeting rooms in the area immediately to the west of Al\u00feingish\u00fasi\u00f0 , where there is today a parking lot and a few smaller buildings currently being used by Al\u00feingi and which will be incorporated into the new building .",
  "/wiki/Althing": "The Al\u00feingi ( parliament ( Icelandic ) and anglicised as Althingi or Althing ) is the national parliament of Iceland . It is the oldest surviving parliament in the world . [ a ] The Althing was founded in 930 at \u00deingvellir ( thing fields or assembly fields ) , situated approximately 45 kilometres ( 28 mi ) east of what later became the country 's capital , Reykjav\u00edk . Even after Iceland 's union with Norway in 1262 , the Althing still held its sessions at \u00deingvellir until 1800 , when it was discontinued . It was restored in 1844 and moved to Reykjav\u00edk , where it has resided ever since . The present parliament building , the Al\u00feingish\u00fas , was built in 1881 , made of hewn Icelandic stone . The unicameral parliament has 63 members , and is elected every four years based on party-list proportional representation . The constitution of Iceland provides for six electoral constituencies with the possibility of an increase to seven . The constituency boundaries and the number of seats allocated to each constituency are fixed by legislation . No constituency can be represented by fewer than six seats . Furthermore , each party with more than 5% of the national vote is allocated seats based on its proportion of the national vote in order that the number of members in parliament for each political party should be more or less proportional to its overall electoral support . If the number of voters represented by each member of the Althing in one constituency would be less than half of the comparable ratio in another constituency , the Icelandic National Electoral Commission is tasked with altering the allocation of seats to reduce that difference ."
