  "/wiki/Steve_Reich": "Stephen Michael Reich ( /ra\u026a\u0283/ born October 3 , 1936 ) is an American composer known for his contribution to the development of minimal music in the mid to late 1960s . Reich 's work is marked by its use of repetitive figures , slow harmonic rhythm , and canons . His innovations include using tape loops to create phasing patterns , as on the early compositions It 's Gon na Rain ( 1965 ) and Come Out ( 1966 ) , and the use of simple , audible processes , as on Pendulum Music ( 1968 ) and Four Organs ( 1970 ) . The 1978 recording Music for 18 Musicians would help entrench minimalism as a movement . Reich 's work took on a darker character in the 1980s with the introduction of historical themes as well as themes from his Jewish heritage , notably Different Trains ( 1988 ) . Reich 's style of composition has influenced many contemporary composers and groups , especially in the US . Writing in The Guardian , music critic Andrew Clements suggested that Reich is one of a handful of living composers who can legitimately claim to have altered the direction of musical history .",

Born in Seattle , Maxfield studied at Stanford University , University of California , Berkeley ( with Roger Sessions ) and privately with Ernst Krenek in Los Angeles .

In 1958 , he attended Cage 's courses at the New School for Social Research ( now The New School ) . In 1959 he taught classes there himself , becoming the first American to teach purely electronic music ( as opposed to electronic music based on musique concrete-style real life recordings ) . As a student at University of California and in Europe in the 1950s , he composed instrumental scores in a neoclassical style and then adopted 12-tone techniques . It is however techniques for composing with magnetic tape that would prove decisive in the development of Maxfield 's mature compositions . Among his innovations with tape music were the simultaneous performance of improvised instrumental solos with tapes based upon samples of the same soloist , re-editing of tapes before each public performance so that the pieces were not fixed in a single form , and the use of the erase head of the tape machine as a sound source . He was also an active Fluxus participant and a friend of La Monte Young who participated in the publication An Anthology of Chance Operations .",

The Rumours studio sessions were marked by hedonism and strife among band members that shaped the album 's lyrics . Recorded with the intention of making a pop album , the album 's music featured a pop rock and soft rock sound characterized by accented rhythms and electric keyboards such as the Fender Rhodes or Hammond B3 organ . The members partied and used cocaine for much of the recording sessions , and its completion was delayed by its mixing process , but was finished by the end of 1976 . Following the album 's release , Fleetwood Mac undertook worldwide promotional tours . Rumours reached the top of both the US Billboard 200 and the UK Albums Chart , and became the band 's most successful release .

  "/wiki/The_Gambler_(song)": "The Gambler is a song written by Don Schlitz , recorded by several artists , most famously by American country music singer Kenny Rogers . Don Schlitz wrote this song in August , 1976 when he was 23 years old . It took two years of shopping the song around Nashville before Bobby Bare recorded it on his album Bare at the urging of Shel Silverstein . Bare 's version did not catch on and was never released as a single , so Schlitz recorded it himself , but this version failed to chart higher than No . 65 . However , other musicians took notice and recorded the song in 1978 , including Johnny Cash , who put it on his album Gone Girl . However , it was Kenny Rogers who made the song a mainstream success . His version was a No . 1 Country hit and made its way to the Pop charts at a time when Country songs rarely crossed over . It was released in November 1978 as the title track from his album The Gambler which won him the Grammy award for best male country vocal performance in 1980 . In 2006 Don Schlitz appeared in the Kenny Rogers career retrospective documentary The Journey , where he praised both Rogers ' and Butler 's contributions to the song stating they added several ideas that were not mine , including the new guitar intro .
