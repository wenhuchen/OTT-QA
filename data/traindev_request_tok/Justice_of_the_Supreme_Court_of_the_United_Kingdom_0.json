He was called to the bar at Lincoln 's Inn in 1985 . In 1997 , he was appointed First Junior Treasury Counsel ( Treasury Devil ) , a private practitioner barrister who represents the UK government in the civil courts . This caused consternation among senior lawyers , according to The Times due to his young age . Sales was a practising barrister at 11 Kings Bench Walk . At the time of the appointment , there was debate over Sales ' appointment . According to The Guardian , an anonymous source referred to 11KBW as a network of old boys and cronies , and that there was no coincidence that the appointment came from Lord Irvine 's and Tony Blair 's old chambers . Acting as a barrister Sales defended the New Labour government 's decision against holding a public inquiry into the Iraq War in the High Court in 2005 . He was made a QC in 2006 , deputy judge of the High Court from 2004-2008 , and judge of the High Court of Justice ( Chancery Division ) since 2008 .

  "/wiki/Churchill_College,_Cambridge": "Churchill College is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge , England . It has a primary focus on science , engineering and technology , but still retains a strong interest in the arts and humanities . In 1958 , a trust was established with Sir Winston Churchill as its chairman of trustees , to build and endow a college for 60 fellows and 540 students as a national and Commonwealth memorial to Winston Churchill ; its Royal Charter and Statutes were approved by the Queen , in August 1960 . It is situated on the outskirts of Cambridge , away from the traditional centre of the city , but close to the University 's main new development zone ( which now houses the Centre for Mathematical Sciences ) , which some would argue is the new city centre . Its 16 hectares ( 40 acres ) of grounds make it physically the largest of all the colleges . Churchill was the first all-male college to decide to admit women , and was among three men 's colleges to admit its first women students in 1972 . Within 15 years all others had followed suit . The college has a reputation for relative informality compared with other Cambridge colleges , and traditionally admits a larger proportion of its undergraduates from state schools . The college motto is Forward . It was taken from the final phrase of Winston Churchill 's first speech to the House of Commons as Prime Minister - his famous Blood , Toil , Tears and Sweat speech - in which he said Come , then , let us go forward together .",
