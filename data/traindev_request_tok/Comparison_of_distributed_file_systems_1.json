BeeGFS includes a distributed metadata architecture for scalability and flexibility reasons . Its most important aspect is data throughput . BeeGFS was originally developed at the Fraunhofer Center for High Performance Computing in Germany by a team around Sven Breuner , who later became the CEO of ThinkParQ , the spin-off company that was founded in 2014 to maintain BeeGFS and offer professional services . The software can be downloaded and used free of charge from the project 's website .",

  "/wiki/GPFS": "IBM Spectrum Scale ( also known as General Parallel File System or GPFS ) [ citation needed ] is high-performance clustered file system software developed by IBM . It can be deployed in shared-disk or shared-nothing distributed parallel modes . It is used by many of the world 's largest commercial companies , as well as some of the supercomputers on the Top 500 List . For example , it was the filesystem of the ASC Purple Supercomputer which was composed of more than 12,000 processors and had 2 petabytes of total disk storage spanning more than 11,000 disks . Like typical cluster filesystems , Spectrum Scale provides concurrent high-speed file access to applications executing on multiple nodes of clusters . It can be used with AIX 5L clusters , Linux clusters , on Microsoft Windows Server , or a heterogeneous cluster of AIX , Linux and Windows nodes . In addition to providing filesystem storage capabilities , Spectrum Scale provides tools for management and administration of the Spectrum Scale cluster and allows for shared access to file systems from remote Spectrum Scale clusters . Spectrum Scale has been available on IBM 's AIX since 1998 , on Linux since 2001 , and on Windows Server since 2008 .",

  "/wiki/MapR_FS": "The MapR File System ( MapR FS ) is a clustered file system that supports both very large-scale and high-performance uses . MapR FS supports a variety of interfaces including conventional read/write file access via NFS and a FUSE interface , as well as via the HDFS interface used by many systems such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark . In addition to file-oriented access , MapR FS supports access to tables and message streams using the Apache HBase and Apache Kafka APIs as well as via a document database interface . First released in 2010 , MapR FS is now typically described as the MapR Converged Data Platform due to the addition of tabular and messaging interfaces . The same core technology is , however , used to implement all of these forms of persistent data storage and all of the interfaces are ultimately supported by the same server processes . To distinguish the different capabilities of the overall data platform , the term MapR FS is used more specifically to refer to the file-oriented interfaces , MapR DB or MapR JSON DB is used to refer to the tabular interfaces and MapR Streams is used to describe the message streaming capabilities . MapR FS is a cluster filesystem in that it provides uniform access from/to files and other objects such as tables using a universal namespace accessible from any client of the system . Access control is also provided for files , tables and streams using access control expressions , which are an extension of the more common ( and limited ) access control list to allow permissions to be composed not just of lists of allowed users or groups , but instead to allow boolean combinations of user id and groups .",

  "/wiki/Command-line_interface": "A command-line interface ( CLI ) processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text . The program which handles the interface is called a command-line interpreter or command-line processor . Operating systems implement a command-line interface in a shell for interactive access to operating system functions or services . Such access was primarily provided to users by computer terminals starting in the mid-1960s , and continued to be used throughout the 1970s and 1980s on VAX/VMS , Unix systems and personal computer systems including DOS , CP/M and Apple DOS . Today , users rely upon graphical user interfaces and menu-driven interactions . However some programming and maintenance tasks may not have a graphical user interface and may still use a command line . Alternatives to the command line interface include text user interface menus ( for example , IBM AIX SMIT ) , keyboard shortcuts , and various desktop metaphors centered on the pointer ( usually controlled with a mouse ) . Examples of this include the Microsoft Windows , DosShell , and Mouse Systems PowerPanel . Command line interfaces are often implemented in terminal devices that are also capable of screen-oriented text user interfaces that use cursor addressing to place symbols on a display screen . Programs with command-line interfaces are generally easier to automate via scripting . Many software systems implement command line interfaces for control and operation . This includes programming environments and utility programs .",

It provides a software framework for distributed storage and processing of big data using the MapReduce programming model . Originally designed for computer clusters built from commodity hardware - still the common use - it has also found use on clusters of higher-end hardware . All the modules in Hadoop are designed with a fundamental assumption that hardware failures are common occurrences and should be automatically handled by the framework . The core of Apache Hadoop consists of a storage part , known as Hadoop Distributed File System ( HDFS ) , and a processing part which is a MapReduce programming model . Hadoop splits files into large blocks and distributes them across nodes in a cluster . It then transfers packaged code into nodes to process the data in parallel . This approach takes advantage of data locality , where nodes manipulate the data they have access to . This allows the dataset to be processed faster and more efficiently than it would be in a more conventional supercomputer architecture that relies on a parallel file system where computation and data are distributed via high-speed networking . The base Apache Hadoop framework is composed of the following modules :",

For secure transmission that protects the username and password , and encrypts the content , FTP is often secured with SSL/TLS ( FTPS ) or replaced with SSH File Transfer Protocol ( SFTP ) . The first FTP client applications were command-line programs developed before operating systems had graphical user interfaces , and are still shipped with most Windows , Unix , and Linux operating systems .

  "/wiki/Representational_state_transfer": "Representational state transfer ( REST ) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services . Web services that conform to the REST architectural style , called RESTful Web services , provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet . RESTful Web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations . Other kinds of Web services , such as SOAP Web services , expose their own arbitrary sets of operations . Web resources were first defined on the World Wide Web as documents or files identified by their URLs . However , today they have a much more generic and abstract definition that encompasses every thing or entity that can be identified , named , addressed , or handled , in any way whatsoever , on the Web . In a RESTful Web service , requests made to a resource 's URI will elicit a response with a payload formatted in HTML , XML , JSON , or some other format . The response can confirm that some alteration has been made to the stored resource , and the response can provide hypertext links to other related resources or collections of resources . When HTTP is used , as is most common , the operations ( HTTP methods ) available are GET , HEAD , POST , PUT , PATCH , DELETE , CONNECT , OPTIONS and TRACE . By using a stateless protocol and standard operations , RESTful systems aim for fast performance , reliability , and the ability to grow by reusing components that can be managed and updated without affecting the system as a whole , even while it is running . The term representational state transfer was introduced and defined in 2000 by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation . Fielding 's dissertation explained the REST principles that were known as the HTTP object model beginning in 1994 , and were used in designing the HTTP 1.1 and Uniform Resource Identifiers ( URI ) standards .",
