The German invasion began on 1 September 1939 , one week after the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union , and one day after the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union had approved the pact . The Soviets invaded Poland on 17 September . The campaign ended on 6 October with Germany and the Soviet Union dividing and annexing the whole of Poland under the terms of the German-Soviet Frontier Treaty . German forces invaded Poland from the north , south , and west the morning after the Gleiwitz incident . Slovak military forces advanced alongside the Germans in northern Slovakia . As the Wehrmacht advanced , Polish forces withdrew from their forward bases of operation close to the Germany-Poland border to more established defense lines to the east . After the mid-September Polish defeat in the Battle of the Bzura , the Germans gained an undisputed advantage . Polish forces then withdrew to the southeast where they prepared for a long defence of the Romanian Bridgehead and awaited expected support and relief from France and the United Kingdom . Those two countries had pacts with Poland and had declared war on Germany on 3 September ; in the end their aid to Poland was very limited , however France invaded a small part of Germany in the Saar Offensive . On 17 September , the Soviet Red Army invaded Eastern Poland , the territory beyond the Curzon Line that fell into the Soviet sphere of influence according to the secret protocol of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact ; this rendered the Polish plan of defence obsolete . Facing a second front , the Polish government concluded the defence of the Romanian Bridgehead was no longer feasible and ordered an emergency evacuation of all troops to neutral Romania .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_the_Atlantic": "The Battle of the Atlantic was the longest continuous military campaign in World War II , running from 1939 to the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 , and was a major part of the Naval history of World War II . At its core was the Allied naval blockade of Germany , announced the day after the declaration of war , and Germany 's subsequent counter-blockade . It was at its height from mid-1940 through to the end of 1943 . The Battle of the Atlantic pitted U-boats and other warships of the Kriegsmarine ( Navy ) and aircraft of the Luftwaffe ( Air Force ) against the Royal Canadian Navy , Royal Navy , United States Navy , and Allied merchant shipping . Convoys , coming mainly from North America and predominantly going to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union , were protected for the most part by the British and Canadian navies and air forces . These forces were aided by ships and aircraft of the United States beginning September 13 , 1941 . The Germans were joined by submarines of the Italian Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) after their Axis ally Italy entered the war on June 10 , 1940 . As an island nation , the United Kingdom was highly dependent on imported goods . Britain required more than a million tons of imported material per week in order to be able to survive and fight . In essence , the Battle of the Atlantic was a tonnage war : the Allied struggle to supply Britain and the Axis attempt to stem the flow of merchant shipping that enabled Britain to keep fighting . From 1942 onward , the Axis also sought to prevent the build-up of Allied supplies and equipment in the British Isles in preparation for the invasion of occupied Europe . The defeat of the U-boat threat was a prerequisite for pushing back the Axis .",

By September 1940 , the Luftwaffe had failed and the German air fleets ( Luftflotten ) were ordered to attack London , to draw RAF Fighter Command into a battle of annihilation . Adolf Hitler and Reichsmarschall Hermann G\u00f6ring , commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe , ordered the new policy on 6 September 1940 . From 7 September 1940 , London was systematically bombed by the Luftwaffe for 56 of the following 57 days and nights . Most notable was a large daylight attack against London on 15 September . The Luftwaffe gradually decreased daylight operations in favour of night attacks to evade attack by the RAF , and the Blitz became a night bombing campaign after October 1940 . The Luftwaffe attacked the main Atlantic sea port of Liverpool in the Liverpool Blitz . The North Sea port of Hull , a convenient and easily found target or secondary target for bombers unable to locate their primary targets , suffered the Hull Blitz .

  "/wiki/Bombsight": "A bombsight is a device used by military aircraft to drop bombs accurately . Bombsights , a feature of combat aircraft since World War I , were first found on purpose-designed bomber aircraft and then moved to fighter-bombers and modern tactical aircraft as those aircraft took up the brunt of the bombing role . A bombsight has to estimate the path the bomb will take after release from the aircraft . The two primary forces during its fall are gravity and air drag , which make the path of the bomb through the air roughly parabolic . There are additional factors such as changes in air density and wind that may be considered , but they are concerns only for bombs that spend a significant portion of a minute falling through the air . Those effects can be minimized by reducing the fall time by low-level bombing or by increasing the speed of the bombs . Those effects are combined in the dive bomber . However , low-level bombing also increases the danger to the bomber from ground-based defences , and accurate bombing from higher altitudes has always been desired . That has led to a series of increasingly sophisticated bombsight designs , dedicated to high-altitude level bombing . Since their first application prior to World War I , bombsights have gone through several major revisions . The earliest systems were iron sights , which were pre-set to an estimated fall angle . In some cases , they consisted of nothing more than a series of nails hammered into a convenient spar , lines drawn on the aircraft , or visual alignments of certain parts of the structure .",

The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England .

It has been described as the first major military campaign fought entirely by air forces . The British officially recognise the battle 's duration as being from 10 July until 31 October 1940 , which overlaps the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz , that lasted from 7 September 1940 to 11 May 1941 . German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard the battle as a single campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941 , including the Blitz . The primary objective of the German forces was to compel Britain to agree to a negotiated peace settlement . In July 1940 , the air and sea blockade began , with the Luftwaffe mainly targeting coastal-shipping convoys , ports and shipping centres , such as Portsmouth . On 1 August , the Luftwaffe was directed to achieve air superiority over the RAF with the aim of incapacitating RAF Fighter Command ; 12 days later , it shifted the attacks to RAF airfields and infrastructure .

During this time , German U-boats sank several merchant ships and four Canadian warships . There were several near shore actions involving the drop of German spies , or the attempted pick up of escaping prisoners of war . Despite the 23 ships lost , this battle marked a strategic victory for Canadian forces as ultimately they managed to disrupt U-boat activity , protect Canadian and Allied convoys , and intercept all attempted shore operations . This marked the first time that a foreign power had inflicted casualties in Canadian inland waters since the US incursions in the War of 1812 . In the interwar years , poor economic conditions and a sense of security , engendered by the proximity of the United States and the traditional protection of the British Royal Navy , had resulted in the Royal Canadian Navy ( RCN ) being equipped with very few ships , especially for coastal defence . Upgraded to six destroyers just before the war , Canadian naval deployment gave priority to the North Atlantic convoy routes and responsibility which grew until the war 's end when the RCN was the third largest allied naval power in the world , with 100,000 men and women and 400 vessels .

The term German resistance should not be understood as meaning that there was a united resistance movement in Germany at any time during the Nazi period , analogous to the more coordinated Polish Underground State , Greek Resistance , Yugoslav Partisans , French Resistance , Dutch resistance , Norwegian resistance movement and Italian Resistance . The German resistance consisted of small and usually isolated groups . They were unable to mobilize political opposition .

Approximately 77,000 German citizens were killed for one or another form of resistance by Special Courts , courts-martial , People 's Courts and the civil justice system . Many of these Germans had served in government , the military , or in civil positions , which enabled them to engage in subversion and conspiracy ; in addition , the Canadian historian Peter Hoffman counts unspecified tens of thousands in Nazi concentration camps who were either suspected of or actually engaged in opposition . By contrast , the German historian Hans Mommsen wrote that resistance in Germany was resistance without the people and that the number of those Germans engaged in resistance to the Nazi regime was very small . The resistance in Germany included German citizens of non-German ethnicity , such as members of the Polish minority who formed resistance groups like Olimp .",

The remainder of the film was fairly apolitical , and , as such , it was brought back in circulation a few years later ; the propaganda end sequence is not seen on current prints of the film . It was shot at the Tempelhof Studios .",

  "/wiki/Laurel_and_Hardy": "Laurel and Hardy were a comedy duo act during the early Classical Hollywood era of American cinema . The team was composed of Englishman Stan Laurel ( 1890-1965 ) and American Oliver Hardy ( 1892-1957 ) . They became well known during the late 1920s to the mid-1940s for their slapstick comedy , with Laurel playing the clumsy and childlike friend of the pompous bully Hardy . The duo 's signature tune is known variously as The Cuckoo Song , Ku-Ku , or The Dance of the Cuckoos . It was played over the opening credits of their films and has become as emblematic of the duo as their bowler hats . Prior to emerging as a team , both actors had well-established film careers . Laurel had appeared in over 50 films as an actor ( while also working as a writer and director ) , while Hardy had been in more than 250 productions . The two comedians had previously worked together as cast members on the film The Lucky Dog in 1921 . However , they were not a comedy team at that time and it was not until 1926 that they appeared in a short movie together , when both separately signed contracts with the Hal Roach film studio . Laurel and Hardy officially became a team in 1927 when they appeared together in the silent short film Putting Pants on Philip . They remained with the Roach studio until 1940 and then appeared in eight B movie comedies for 20th Century Fox and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer from 1941 to 1945 . After finishing their movie commitments at the end of 1944 , they concentrated on performing in stage shows and embarked on a music hall tour of England , Ireland , and Scotland .",

It took place from April 9 , 1940 , until June 10 , 1940 . The Allied campaign did not succeed , and it resulted in the fleeing of King Haakon VII along with the remainder of the royal family to Great Britain . In April , the United Kingdom and France came to Norway 's aid with an expeditionary force . As Plan R 4 got underway the Royal Navy began laying mines in neutral Norwegian waters as part of Operation Wilfred when the German invasion began . Despite moderate success in the northern parts of Norway , the Allies were eventually compelled to withdraw by Germany 's invasion of France in May , and the Norwegian government sought exile in London . The campaign ended with the occupation of Norway by Germany , and the continued fighting by exiled Norwegian forces from abroad . The 62 days of fighting made Norway the nation that withstood a German land invasion for the second longest period of time , after the Soviet Union .",

The term is the nominalised plural of volksdeutsch , with Volksdeutsche denoting a singular female , and Volksdeutsche ( r ) , a singular male . The words Volk and v\u00f6lkisch conveyed the meanings of folk . The Volksdeutsche ( Ethnic Germans at the time ) shed their identity as Auslandsdeutsch ( Germans abroad ) and morphed into the Volksdeutsche in a process of self-radicalisation . This process gave the Nazi regime the nucleus around which the new Volksgemeinschaft was established across the German borders . Volksdeutsche were further divided into racial groups - minorities within a state minority - based on special cultural , social , and historic criteria elaborated by the Nazis .",
