  "/wiki/Cameron_White": "Cameron Leon White ( born 18 August 1983 ) is an Australian cricketer and former Australian Twenty20 and Victorian Bushrangers captain . A powerful middle order batsman and right-arm leg-spin bowler , White made his first-class cricket debut as a teenager in the 2000-01 season for the Victorian Bushrangers as a bowling all-rounder . Early comparisons with Victoria teammate Shane Warne faded as White took on a role closer to that of Andrew Symonds , a batsman who bowled occasionally , and bats aggressively with flat sixes around his leg side . In 2003-04 , he became Victoria 's youngest ever captain at the age of 20 when he took over leadership of their one-day side , and the first-class captaincy followed the season after . International recognition came for the first time in 2005 , but White found himself in and out of the side as the selectors and national captain Ricky Ponting looked for White to improve his bowling to play as a front-line spinner . Two successful winters with English county side Somerset helped to propel White back into the selectors ' minds . White had a short Test career playing four Test matches in 2008 . His tenure as T20 captain ended with the 2012 series against India where he was dropped following poor form in the Big Bash League . He was succeeded by Melbourne Stars teammate George Bailey . His nickname of Bear is due to his purported resemblance to the polar bear mascot of Bundaberg Rum .",
