The Presiding Officer were initially to serve as the first among equals on bodies were the commission members served the roles similar to both judge and jury . In the first version of the Military Commissions the Presiding Officer was to be the only member of the Commission who was a lawyer . So the Presiding Officer would be making all the ruling similar to the rulings on points of law that a judge makes in courts of law . But the Presiding Officer would also be voting on the suspect 's guilt or innocence - unlike in a jury trial . The Commission system was extensively reformed in the summer of 2004 . Several of the original Commission members of the first Commission were retired , because of their inherent bias . The structure of the Commissions were changed , so that the Presiding Officer would no long vote on the suspect 's guilt . In the summer of 2005 leaked memos were published that revealsed that prior to the reorganization the first Chief Prosecutor , Fred Borch , promised his subordinates that only officers who could be counted on to convict suspects would be chose as Commission members , and that Prosecutors would not have to worry about exculpatory evidence - as it would all be classified so it could be withheld from the suspect 's attorneys on National Security grounds . Peter Brownback -- the first Presiding Officer , was unexpectedly replaced in the summer of 2008 . Critics speculated that he had been fired because he kept trying to force Omar Khadr 's prosecution to release evidence to Khadr 's Defense attorneys ."
