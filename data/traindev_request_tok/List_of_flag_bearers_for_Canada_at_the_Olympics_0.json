  "/wiki/Figure_Skating": "Figure skating is a sport in which individuals , duos , or groups perform on figure skates on ice . It was the first winter sport to be included in the Olympic Games , when it was contested at the 1908 Olympics in London . The four Olympic disciplines are men 's singles , ladies ' singles , pair skating , and ice dance . Non-Olympic disciplines include synchronized skating , Theater on Ice , and four skating . From intermediate through senior-level competition , skaters generally perform two programs ( short and free skate ) , which may include spins , jumps , moves in the field , lifts , throw jumps , death spirals , and other elements or moves , depending on the discipline . The blade has a groove on the bottom creating two distinct edges : inside and outside . Judges prefer that skaters glide on one edge of the blade and not on both at the same time , which is referred to as a flat edge . During a spin , skaters use the sweet spot of the blade , formally called a rocker , which is the roundest portion of the blade , just behind the toe pick and near the middle of the blade . Skates used in singles and pair skating have a set of large , jagged teeth called toe picks on the front of the blade . Toe picks are mainly used for the take-off on jumps . Ice dance blades have smaller toe picks . Figure skaters compete at various levels from beginner up to the Olympic level ( senior ) at local , regional , sectional , national , and international competitions .",

The sport was originally created in 1882 by Jigoro Kano ( \u5609\u7d0d\u6cbb\u4e94\u90ce ) as a physical , mental , and moral pedagogy in Japan . Judo 's most prominent feature is its competitive element , where the objective is to either throw or take down an opponent to the ground , immobilize or otherwise subdue an opponent with a pin , or force an opponent to submit with a joint lock or a choke . Strikes and thrusts by hands and feet as well as weapons defences are a part of judo , but only in pre-arranged forms ( kata , \u5f62 ) and are not allowed in judo competition or free practice ( randori , \u4e71\u53d6\u308a ) . A judo practitioner is called a judoka . The philosophy and subsequent pedagogy developed for judo became the model for other modern Japanese martial arts that developed from kory\u016b ( \u53e4\u6d41 , traditional schools ) . Judo also spawned a number of derivative martial arts across the world , such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu , Krav Maga and Sambo .",

The blade has a groove on the bottom creating two distinct edges : inside and outside . Judges prefer that skaters glide on one edge of the blade and not on both at the same time , which is referred to as a flat edge . During a spin , skaters use the sweet spot of the blade , formally called a rocker , which is the roundest portion of the blade , just behind the toe pick and near the middle of the blade . Skates used in singles and pair skating have a set of large , jagged teeth called toe picks on the front of the blade . Toe picks are mainly used for the take-off on jumps .

  "/wiki/Canoe": "A canoe is a lightweight narrow vessel , typically pointed at both ends and open on top , propelled by one or more seated or kneeling paddlers facing the direction of travel using a single-bladed paddle . In British English , the term canoe can also refer to a kayak , while canoes are then called Canadian canoes to distinguish them from kayaks . Canoes are widely used for competition and pleasure , such as racing , whitewater , touring and camping , freestyle , and general recreation . Canoeing has been part of the Olympics since 1936 . The intended use of the canoe dictates its hull shape and length and construction material . Historically , canoes were dugouts or made of bark on a wood frame , but construction materials evolved to canvas on a wood frame , then to aluminum . Most modern canoes are made of molded plastic or composites such as fiberglass . Canoes were developed by cultures all over the world , including some designed for use with sails or outriggers . Until the mid-1800s the canoe was an important means of transport for exploration and trade , and in some places it still is used as such , perhaps with the addition of an outboard motor . Where the canoe played a key role in history , such as the northern United States , Canada , and New Zealand , it remains an important theme in popular culture . Canoes may be launched or retrieved from water at specific canoe launch points , beaches , or river banks ."
