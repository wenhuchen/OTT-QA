  "/wiki/Peregrine_falcon": "The peregrine falcon ( Falco peregrinus ) , also known as the peregrine , and historically as the duck hawk in North America , is a widespread bird of prey ( raptor ) in the family Falconidae . A large , crow-sized falcon , it has a blue-grey back , barred white underparts , and a black head . The Peregrine is renowned for its speed , reaching over 320 km/h ( 200 mph ) during its characteristic hunting stoop ( high-speed dive ) , making it the fastest bird in the world and the fastest member of the animal kingdom . According to a National Geographic TV program , the highest measured speed of a peregrine falcon is 389 km/h ( 242 mph ) . As is typical of bird-eating raptors , peregrine falcons are sexually dimorphic , with females being considerably larger than males . According to one study , it has the fastest visual processing speed of any animal tested so far , and can register discrete changes up to 129 Hz or cycles per second . As an analogy , film is a series of still images projected onto a screen . Those still images need to be changing at roughly 25 frames per second before humans see them as fluid and no longer as individual , discrete pictures . The film would have to be refreshing at 129 frames per second before peregrine falcons stopped seeing flashing , still images and started seeing fluid motion . The peregrine 's breeding range includes land regions from the Arctic tundra to the tropics . It can be found nearly everywhere on Earth , except extreme polar regions , very high mountains , and most tropical rainforests ; the only major ice-free landmass from which it is entirely absent is New Zealand . This makes it the world 's most widespread raptor , and one of the most widely found bird species .",

  "/wiki/List_of_Sesame_Street_Muppets": "The Muppets are a group of puppet characters created by Jim Henson , many for the purpose of appearing on the children 's television program Sesame Street . Henson 's involvement in Sesame Street began when he and Joan Ganz Cooney , one of the creators of the show , met in the summer of 1968 , at one of the show 's five three-day curriculum planning seminars in Boston . Author Christopher Finch reported that director Jon Stone , who had worked with Henson previously , felt that if they could not bring him on board , they should make do without puppets . Henson was initially reluctant but agreed to join Sesame Street in support of its social goals . He also agreed to waive his performance fee for full ownership of the Sesame Street Muppets and to split any revenue they generated with the Children 's Television Workshop ( renamed to the Sesame Workshop in 2000 ) , the series ' non-profit producer . The Muppets were a crucial part of the show 's popularity and it brought Henson national attention . The Muppet segments of the show were popular since its premiere , and more Muppets were added during the first few seasons . The Muppets were effective teaching tools because children easily recognized them , they were predictable , and they appealed to adults and older siblings . During the production of Sesame Street 's first season , producers created five one-hour episodes to test the show 's appeal to children and examine their comprehension of the material . Not intended for broadcast , they were presented to preschoolers in 60 homes throughout Philadelphia and in day care centers in New York City in July 1969 . The results were generally very positive ; children learned from the shows , their appeal was high , and children 's attention was sustained over the full hour . However , the researchers found that although children 's attention was high during the Muppet segments , their interest wavered during the Street segments , when no Muppets were on screen .",

The format of Sesame Street consists of a combination of commercial television production elements and techniques which have evolved to reflect the changes in American culture and the audience 's viewing habits . With the creation of Sesame Street , producers and writers of a children 's television show used , for the first time , educational goals and a curriculum to shape its content . It was also the first time a show 's educational effects were formally studied . The show , therefore , has undergone significant changes in its history as adjustments to the format and content have been made to reflect change sources to the curriculum . Shortly after creating Sesame Street , its producers developed what came to be called the CTW model ( after the production company 's previous name ) , a system of television show planning , production , and evaluation based on collaborations between producers , writers , educators , and researchers . The show was initially funded by government and private foundations but has become somewhat self-supporting due to revenues from licensing arrangements , international sales , and other media . By 2006 , there were independently produced versions , or co-productions , of Sesame Street broadcast in twenty countries . In 2001 , there were over 120 million viewers of various international versions of Sesame Street , and by the show 's 40th anniversary in 2009 , it was broadcast in more than 140 countries .",
