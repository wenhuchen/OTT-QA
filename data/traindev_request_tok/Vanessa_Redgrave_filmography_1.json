  "/wiki/Cosima_Wagner": "Cosima Wagner ( born Francesca Gaetana Cosima Liszt ; 24 December 1837 - 1 April 1930 ) was the illegitimate daughter of the Hungarian pianist and composer Franz Liszt and Marie d'Agoult . She became the second wife of the German composer Richard Wagner , and with him founded the Bayreuth Festival as a showcase for his stage works ; after his death she devoted the rest of her life to the promotion of his music and philosophy . Commentators have recognised Cosima as the principal inspiration for Wagner 's later works , particularly Parsifal . In 1857 , after a childhood largely spent under the care of her grandmother and with governesses , Cosima married the conductor Hans von B\u00fclow . Although the marriage produced two children , it was largely a loveless union , and in 1863 Cosima began a relationship with Wagner , who was 24 years her senior . She married him in 1870 ; after his death in 1883 she directed the Bayreuth Festival for more than 20 years , increasing its repertoire to form the Bayreuth canon of ten operas and establishing the festival as a major event in the world of musical theatre . During her directorship , Cosima opposed theatrical innovations and adhered closely to Wagner 's original productions of his works , an approach continued by her successors long after her retirement in 1907 . She shared Wagner 's convictions of German cultural and racial superiority , and under her influence , Bayreuth became increasingly identified with antisemitism . This was a defining aspect of Bayreuth for decades , into the Nazi era which closely followed her death in 1930 . Thus , although she is widely perceived as the saviour of the festival , her legacy remains controversial .",

  "/wiki/Queen_(Snow_White)": "The Evil Queen , also called the Wicked Queen , is a fictional character and the main antagonist of Snow White , a German fairy tale recorded by the Brothers Grimm ; similar stories are also known to exist in other countries . Other versions of the Queen appear in Snow White derivative works , and the character has also become an archetype for unrelated works of fiction . The Evil Queen is Snow White 's evil and vindictive stepmother who is obsessed with being the fairest in the land . The beautiful young princess Snow White evokes the Queen 's sense of envy , so the Queen designs a number of plans to kill Snow White through the use of witchcraft . A driving force in the story is the Queen 's Magic Mirror . In the traditional resolution of the story , the Queen is grotesquely executed for her crimes . The tale is meant as a lesson for young children warning them against the dangers of narcissism , pride , and hubris . Various other versions of the Queen appear in subsequent adaptations and continuations of the fairy tale , including novels and films . In these , the Queen is often re-imagined and sometimes portrayed more sympathetically , such as being morally conflicted or suffering from madness instead of being simply evil . In some of the revisionist stories she has even been portrayed as an antihero or a tragic hero . In some instances , she serves as the protagonist of the story ; one such particularly notable version is Disney 's , sometimes known as Queen Grimhilde . The Queen has also become an archetype that inspired several characters featured in the works that are not directly based on the original tale .",
