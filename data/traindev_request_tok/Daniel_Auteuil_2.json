  "/wiki/Cach\u00e9_(film)": "Cach\u00e9 ( French : [ ka\u0283e ] ) , also known as Hidden , is a 2005 psychological thriller film written and directed by Michael Haneke and starring Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche . The plot follows an upper-class French couple , Georges ( Auteuil ) and Anne ( Binoche ) , who are terrorised by anonymous tapes that appear on their front porch and seem to show the family is under surveillance . Clues in the videos point to Georges 's childhood memories , and his resistance to his parents ' adopting an Algerian orphan named Majid , who was sent away . The tapes lead him to the now-grown Majid ( Maurice B\u00e9nichou ) . Shot in Paris and Vienna in 2004 , the film is an international co-production of France , Austria , Germany and Italy . Haneke wrote the screenplay with Auteuil and Binoche in mind , and with a concept of exploring guilt and childhood . When he learned of the French government 's decades-long denial of the 1961 Seine River massacre , he incorporated memories of the event into his story . Cach\u00e9 opened at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival to critical acclaim for the performances and Haneke 's direction . Its plot ambiguities raised considerable discussion . The film has been interpreted as an allegory about collective guilt and collective memory , and as a statement on France 's Algerian War and colonialism in general . While presented as a mystery , the film does not explicitly reveal which character sends the tapes . Haneke regarded that as of secondary importance to the exploration of guilt and left the question up to viewer interpretation ."
