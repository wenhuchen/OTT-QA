  "/wiki/Ramey_Mound": "The Ramey Mound , designated 15BH1 , is an archaeological site in Bath County in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Kentucky . Built by people of the prehistoric Adena culture , the site has been known for more than two centuries ; it was recorded in 1807 as consisting of an enclosure at least 3 feet ( 0.91 m ) high . In 1871 , another survey observed four mounds in association with the main earthwork : one was located just east of the enclosure , another directly to the west , a larger one to the southeast , and a small one to the southwest . The source of a nearby brook lies within the site and transverses the enclosure ; the 1871 survey supposed that it had been dug to provide earth for the enclosure . By the time of this later survey , cultivation had reduced the earthwork to the point that it was nearly indistinguishable . The Ramey Mound was also observed by the Kentucky Geological Survey under the direction of John Robert Procter , who marked numerous Bath County earthworks on his topographic maps of the county . By 1932 , despite the damage of the plow , locals observed that it could still be distinguished from the surrounding terrain . The mound 's name is shared with Emma Ramey , who owned it in 1932 . In 1998 , the mound was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its archaeological significance ; it is Bath County 's only archaeological site on the Register .",
