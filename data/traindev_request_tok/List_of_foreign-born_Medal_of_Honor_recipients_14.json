The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable , maritime climate . Welsh national identity emerged among the Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century , and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales , though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century . The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century . Welsh Liberalism , exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century ; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962 .

  "/wiki/USS_Iowa_(BB-4)": "USS Iowa ( BB-4 ) was a pre-dreadnought battleship built for the United States Navy in the mid-1890s . The ship was a marked improvement over the previous Indiana-class battleships , correcting many of the defects in the design of those vessels . Among the most important improvements were significantly better seaworthiness owing to her greater freeboard and a more efficient arrangement of the armament . Iowa was designed to operate on the high seas , which had been the impetus to increase the freeboard . She was armed with a battery of four 12-inch ( 300 mm ) guns in two twin-gun turrets , supported by a secondary battery of eight 8-inch ( 200 mm ) guns . Upon entering service in June 1897 , Iowa conducted training operations in the Atlantic Ocean before moving to the Caribbean in early 1898 as tensions between the United States and Spain over Cuba grew , leading to the Spanish-American War . The ship took part in the bombardment of San Juan , Puerto Rico , and then participated in the blockade of Cuba during the war , and after the Spanish cruiser squadron was found in Santiago de Cuba , she patrolled off the harbor to block their escape . In the Battle of Santiago de Cuba on 3 July , Iowa assisted in the destruction of three of the four Spanish cruisers . After the war , Iowa spent the next several years conducting routine training exercises , serving with the Pacific Squadron from 1898 to 1902 , the South Atlantic Squadron until 1904 , and the North Atlantic Squadron until 1906 , when the latter two units were merged to form the Atlantic Fleet . Iowa was modernized between 1908 and 1910 ; she thereafter served as a training ship for naval cadets from the United States Naval Academy and for naval militia crews . Removed from service in 1913 and decommissioned in 1914 , she was reactivated after the United States entered World War I in April 1917 , initially serving as a receiving ship and then as a training vessel and guard ship . She was decommissioned again in 1919 , renamed Coast Battleship No .",

  "/wiki/Ordinary_Seaman": "An ordinary seaman ( OS ) is a naval rating of the deck department of a ship . The position is an apprenticeship to become an able seaman , and has been for centuries . In modern times , an OS is required to work on a ship for a specific amount of time , gaining what is referred to as sea time . For centuries , the term ordinary seaman was used to refer to a seaman with between one and two years ' experience at sea , who showed enough seamanship to be so rated by their captain . Historically in some navies and the merchant marine a sailor with less experience was called a landsman . An OS is generally not required to stand watch , but must pass examinations on watchstanding skills such as performing lookout duty and being a helmsman . Thus an OS will often be found on a ship 's bridge after working hours taking a turn at the ship 's wheel or being familiarized with bridge equipment . During the apprenticeship , an OS performs a variety of duties concerned with the operation and upkeep of deck department areas and equipment . These duties vary with the type of ship , the type of voyage , the number of crewmembers , the weather , the supervisor , and any number of other variables . However , in most cases , one can expect an ordinary seaman to clean , to perform maintenance , to work with deck equipment , and to undergo on-the-job-training under the supervision of senior deck department members .",

Alexandria is a popular tourist destination , and also an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez . Alexandria was founded in c. 331 BC by Alexander the Great , king of Macedon and leader of the Greek League of Corinth , during his conquest of the Achaemenid Empire . An Egyptian village named Rhacotis existed at the location and grew into the Egyptian quarter of Alexandria .

Hellenistic Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria ( Pharos ) , one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World ; its Great Library ( the largest in the ancient world ) ; and the Necropolis , one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages . Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural center of the ancient Mediterranean world for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity .

Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan , across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia , and across the Mediterranean lie Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , although none share a land border with Egypt . Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",

  "/wiki/Jamaica": "Jamaica ( /d\u0292\u0259\u02c8me\u026ak\u0259/ ( listen ) ) is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea . Spanning 10,990 square kilometres ( 4,240 sq mi ) in area , it is the third-largest island of the Greater Antilles and the Caribbean ( after Cuba and Hispaniola ) . Jamaica lies about 145 kilometres ( 90 mi ) south of Cuba , and 191 kilometres ( 119 mi ) west of Hispaniola ( the island containing the countries of Haiti and the Dominican Republic ) ; the British Overseas Territory of the Cayman Islands lies some 215 kilometres ( 134 mi ) to the north-west . Originally inhabited by the indigenous Arawak and Ta\u00edno peoples , the island came under Spanish rule following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494 . Many of the indigenous people were either killed or died of diseases to which they had no immunity , and the Spanish thus forcibly transplanted large numbers of African slaves to Jamaica as labourers . The island remained a possession of Spain until 1655 , when England ( later Great Britain ) conquered it , renaming it Jamaica . Under British colonial rule Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter , with a plantation economy dependent on the African slaves and later their descendants . The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838 , and many freedmen chose to have subsistence farms rather than to work on plantations . Beginning in the 1840s , the British began utilising Chinese and Indian indentured labour to work on plantations . The island achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 6 August 1962 . With 2.9 million people , Jamaica is the third-most populous Anglophone country in the Americas ( after the United States and Canada ) , and the fourth-most populous country in the Caribbean . Kingston is the country 's capital and largest city .",

It is located on the southern estuary of the Yangtze , and the Huangpu River flows through it . With a population of 24.2 million as of 2018 [ update ] , it is the most populous urban area in China and the second most populous city proper in the world . Shanghai is a global center for finance , innovation , and transportation , and the Port of Shanghai is the world 's busiest container port . Originally a fishing village and market town , Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to trade and its favorable port location . The city was one of five treaty ports forced open to foreign trade after the First Opium War . The Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession were subsequently established . The city then flourished , becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of the Asia-Pacific region in the 1930s . During the Second Sino-Japanese War , the city was the site of the major Battle of Shanghai . After the war , with the CPC takeover of mainland China in 1949 , trade was limited to other socialist countries , and the city 's global influence declined . In the 1990s , economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping resulted in an intense redevelopment of the city , especially the Pudong district , aiding the return of finance and foreign investment to the city . The city has since re-emerged as a hub for international trade and finance ; it is the home of the Shanghai Stock Exchange , one of the largest stock exchanges in the world by market capitalization , and the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone , the first free-trade zone in China .",

  "/wiki/Scotland": "Scotland ( Scots : Scotland , Scottish Gaelic : Alba [ \u02c8al\u032a\u02e0ap\u0259 ] ( listen ) ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain , with a border with England to the southeast , and is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west , the North Sea to the northeast , the Irish Sea to the south , and more than 790 islands , including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides . The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England . In 1997 , a Scottish Parliament was re-established , in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members , having authority over many areas of domestic policy . The head of the Scottish Government is the first minister of Scotland , who is supported by the deputy first minister of Scotland .",

  "/wiki/Gunner's_Mate": "The United States Navy & United States Coast Guard occupational rating of gunner 's mate ( GM ) is a designation given by the Bureau of Naval Personnel ( BUPERS ) to enlisted sailors who either satisfactorily complete initial Gunner 's Mate A school training , or who strike for the rating by showing competence in the field of ordnance . When striking one is n't required to be a seaman , but must belong to one of three undesignated rates : Fireman ( FN ) , Seaman ( SN ) , or Airman ( AN ) . ( Striking is no longer authorized in the USCG ) It is also possible cross rate to Gunner 's Mate . Cross rating refers to the act of an enlisted sailor crossing from their current rating to another rating of their choice , provided their ASVAB scores are high enough and there are open slots for the rate . The Gunner 's Mate A school is held at Naval Training Center Great Lakes , Illinois and Yorktown , VA for the USCG . In its early years , the school was very hands-on , but it is now primarily conducted through technical educational tools , such as self-study computer-based training ( CBT ) . Training focuses on the operation , maintenance , and troubleshooting of naval guns , missile launchers and torpedoes as well as a strong emphasis on basic explosives , guidance and tracking systems , small arms , Naval ammunition classification , and safety . Upon completion of this basic training , enlisted members often continue on to a specialized C school , where they learn a particular weapons system .",

It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia , in the east by Brazil , in the southeast by Bolivia , in the south by Chile , and in the west by the Pacific Ocean . Peru is a megadiverse country with habitats ranging from the arid plains of the Pacific coastal region in the west to the peaks of the Andes mountains vertically extending from the north to the southeast of the country to the tropical Amazon Basin rainforest in the east with the Amazon river . At 1.28 million km2 ( 0.5 million mi2 ) , Peru is the 19th largest country in the world , and the third largest in South America . Peruvian territory was home to several ancient cultures . Ranging from the Norte Chico civilization starting in 3500 BC , the oldest civilization in the Americas and one of the five cradles of civilization , to the Inca Empire , the largest state in pre-Columbian America , the territory now including Peru has one of the longest histories of civilization of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 4th millennia BCE . The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and established a viceroyalty that encompassed most of its South American colonies , with its capital in Lima . Peru formally proclaimed independence in 1821 , and following the military campaigns of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar , and the decisive battle of Ayacucho , Peru completed its independence in 1824 . In the ensuing years , the country enjoyed relative economic and political stability , which ended shortly before the War of the Pacific with Chile . Throughout the 20th century , Peru endured armed territorial disputes , coups , social unrest , and internal conflicts , as well as periods of stability and economic upswing . Alberto Fujimori was elected to the presidency in 1990 ; his government was credited with economically stabilizing Peru and successfully ending the Shining Path insurgency , though he was widely accused of human rights violations and suppression of political dissent . Fujimori left the presidency in 2000 and was charged with human rights violations and imprisoned until his pardon by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in 2017 ."
