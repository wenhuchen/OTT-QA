  "/wiki/Mulholland_Drive_(film)": "Mulholland Drive ( stylized as Mulholland Dr. ) is a 2001 American neo-noir mystery film written and directed by David Lynch and starring Naomi Watts , Laura Harring , Justin Theroux , Ann Miller , Mark Pellegrino and Robert Forster . It tells the story of an aspiring actress named Betty Elms ( Watts ) , newly arrived in Los Angeles , who meets and befriends an amnesiac woman ( Harring ) recovering from a car accident . The story follows several other vignettes and characters , including a Hollywood film director ( Theroux ) . Originally conceived as a television pilot , a large portion of the film was shot in 1999 with Lynch 's plan to keep it open-ended for a potential series . After viewing Lynch 's cut , however , television executives rejected it . Lynch then provided an ending to the project , making it a feature film . The half-pilot , half-feature result , along with Lynch 's characteristic style , has left the general meaning of the film 's events open to interpretation . Lynch has declined to offer an explanation of his intentions for the narrative , leaving audiences , critics , and cast members to speculate on what transpires . He gave the film the tagline A love story in the city of dreams . Categorized as a psychological thriller , Mulholland Drive earned Lynch the Prix de la mise en sc\u00e8ne ( Best Director Award ) at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival , sharing the prize with Joel Coen for The Man Who Was n't There . Furthermore , Lynch would also earn an Academy Award nomination for Best Director . The film launched Harring 's career , boosted Watts ' Hollywood profile considerably , and was the last feature film to star veteran Hollywood actress Ann Miller .",

  "/wiki/Down_with_Love": "Down with Love is a 2003 American romantic comedy film directed by Peyton Reed and written by Eve Ahlert and Dennis Drake . It stars Ren\u00e9e Zellweger and Ewan McGregor , and is a pastiche of the early 1960s American no-sex sex comedies such as Pillow Talk and Lover Come Back ( both which starred Rock Hudson , Doris Day , and Tony Randall ) and the myriad spawn of derivative films that followed . Time film critic Richard Corliss , estimating conservatively , wrote that Down with Love is so clogged with specific references to a half-dozen Rock-and-Doris-type comedies that it serves as definitive distillation of the genre . Randall himself plays a small role in Down with Love , bestowing his sly , patriarchal blessing on the film that also stars David Hyde Pierce ( in the neurotic best friend role often played by Randall or Gig Young ) , Sarah Paulson , Rachel Dratch , Jeri Ryan , and Jack Plotnick , who spoofs the kind of role Chet Stratton played in Lover Come Back . Typical of the genre the film tells the story of a woman who advocates female independence in combat with a lothario , the plot reflects the attitudes and behaviour of the early pre-sexual revolution 1960s but has an anachronistic conclusion driven by more modern , post-feminist ideas and attitudes .",
