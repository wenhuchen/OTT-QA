  "/wiki/Kim_Possible": "Kim Possible is an American animated action comedy-adventure television series created by Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle . The series revolves around eponymous high school student Kim Possible , a teenager tasked with fighting crime on a regular basis while coping with everyday issues commonly associated with adolescence . Kim is aided by her clumsy best friend and eventual love interest , Ron Stoppable , his pet naked mole rat Rufus , and ten year-old computer genius Wade . Known collectively as Team Possible , Kim and Ron 's missions primarily require them to thwart the evil plans of the mad scientist-supervillain duo Dr. Drakken and his sidekick Shego , though they encounter several other enemies as well throughout the show . Veteran Disney Channel writers Schooley and McCorkle were recruited by the network to develop an animated series that could attract both older and younger audiences , and conceived Kim Possible as a show about a talented action heroine and her less competent sidekick . Inspired by the scarcity of female-led animated series at the time , the episodes are based on the creators ' own high school experiences , combine elements of action , adventure , drama , romance and comedy to appeal to both girls and boys while parodying the James Bond franchise , spy and superhero films and teen sitcoms . Distinct from other Disney Channel shows in its use of self-referential humor , Schooley and McCorkle developed fast-paced sitcom-style dialogue in order to cater to adult viewers . Set in the fictional town of Middleton , Colorado , the show 's setting and locations exhibit a retro-influenced aesthetic . With a strong emphasis on modern-day technology and the Internet , the series also explores themes such as girl power , feminism , and relationships . It receives heavy comparisons to other female-driven action shows such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Alias and The Powerpuff Girls . Kim Possible was the second animated Disney Channel Original Series and the first series produced by Walt Disney Television Animation . The series premiered on June 7 , 2002 .",

The programme has been broadcast in over 100 countries , including the US , Canada , China and all the countries in mainland Europe . The snouted and concentrically-ringed appearance of the Fimbles was based on the eponymous villains of Lucy Anna and the Finders , written and illustrated by Sarah Hayes .

The scripts of the 200 episodes were written by a number of writers , most notably the programme 's producer Lucinda Whiteley . The Fimbles are cuddly , hippo-like creatures and are portrayed by skin actors in complex , fluffy animatronic suits and all look quite similar apart from their colour and size . Fimbo is yellow with green stripes , is the tallest and he likes to eat crumble crackers , Florrie is blue with purple stripes , a little smaller than Fimbo and is often seen carrying a Fimble-like doll called Little One , and Baby Pom is the smallest , green with pink stripes and generally follows the others like a toddler , whilst pushing Trundle Truck .
