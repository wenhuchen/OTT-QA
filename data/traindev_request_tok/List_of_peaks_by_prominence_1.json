  "/wiki/Summit_(topography)": "A summit is a point on a surface that is higher in elevation than all points immediately adjacent to it . The topographic terms acme , apex , peak ( mountain peak ) , and zenith are synonymous . The term top ( mountain top ) is generally used only for a mountain peak that is located at some distance from the nearest point of higher elevation . For example , a big massive rock then to the main summit of a mountain is not considered a summit . Summits near a higher peak , with some prominence or isolation , but not reaching a certain cutoff value for the quantities , are often considered subsummits ( or subpeaks ) of the higher peak , and are considered part of the same mountain . A pyramidal peak is an exaggerated form produced by ice erosion of a mountain top . Summit may also refer to the highest point along a line , trail , or route . The highest summit in the world is Mount Everest with a height of 8844.43 m above sea level ( 29,029 ft ) . The first official ascent was made by Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary . They reached the mountain 's peak in 1953 . Whether a highest point is classified as a summit , a sub peak or a separate mountain is subjective . The UIAA definition of a peak is that it has a prominence of 30 metres ( 98 ft ) or more ; it is a mountain summit if it has a prominence of at least 300 metres ( 980 ft ) .",
  "/wiki/Elevation": "The elevation of a geographic location is its height above or below a fixed reference point , most commonly a reference geoid , a mathematical model of the Earth 's sea level as an equipotential gravitational surface ( see Geodetic datum \u00a7 Vertical datum ) . The term elevation is mainly used when referring to points on the Earth 's surface , while altitude or geopotential height is used for points above the surface , such as an aircraft in flight or a spacecraft in orbit , and depth is used for points below the surface . Elevation is not to be confused with the distance from the center of the Earth . Due to the equatorial bulge , the summits of Mount Everest and Chimborazo have , respectively , the largest elevation and the largest geocentric distance .",
  "/wiki/Topographic_prominence": "In topography , prominence [ a ] measures the height of a mountain or hill 's summit relative to the lowest contour line encircling it but containing no higher summit within it . It is a measure of the independence of a summit . A peak 's key col ( highest gap between two mountains ) is a unique point on this contour line and the parent peak is some higher mountain , selected according to various criteria .",
  "/wiki/Mountain_pass": "A mountain pass is a navigable route through a mountain range or over a ridge . Since many of the world 's mountain ranges have presented formidable barriers to travel , passes have played a key role in trade , war , and both human and animal migration throughout Earth 's history . At lower elevations it may be called a hill pass . The highest vehicle-accessible pass in the world appears to be Mana Pass , located in the Himalayas on the border between India and Tibet , China .",

It has a total land area of 268,000 square kilometres ( 103,500 sq mi ) . New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 mi ) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres ( 600 mi ) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal , fungal , and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , and its most populous city is Auckland . Sometime between 1250 and 1300 , Polynesians settled in the islands and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture . In 1642 , Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight New Zealand . In 1840 , representatives of the United Kingdom and M\u0101ori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi , which declared British sovereignty over the islands . In 1841 , New Zealand became a colony within the British Empire and in 1907 it became a dominion ; it gained full statutory independence in 1947 and the British monarch remained the head of state .",

It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia , in the east by Brazil , in the southeast by Bolivia , in the south by Chile , and in the west by the Pacific Ocean . Peru is a megadiverse country with habitats ranging from the arid plains of the Pacific coastal region in the west to the peaks of the Andes mountains vertically extending from the north to the southeast of the country to the tropical Amazon Basin rainforest in the east with the Amazon river . At 1.28 million km2 ( 0.5 million mi2 ) , Peru is the 19th largest country in the world , and the third largest in South America . Peruvian territory was home to several ancient cultures . Ranging from the Norte Chico civilization starting in 3500 BC , the oldest civilization in the Americas and one of the five cradles of civilization , to the Inca Empire , the largest state in pre-Columbian America , the territory now including Peru has one of the longest histories of civilization of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 4th millennia BCE . The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and established a viceroyalty that encompassed most of its South American colonies , with its capital in Lima . Peru formally proclaimed independence in 1821 , and following the military campaigns of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar , and the decisive battle of Ayacucho , Peru completed its independence in 1824 . In the ensuing years , the country enjoyed relative economic and political stability , which ended shortly before the War of the Pacific with Chile . Throughout the 20th century , Peru endured armed territorial disputes , coups , social unrest , and internal conflicts , as well as periods of stability and economic upswing . Alberto Fujimori was elected to the presidency in 1990 ; his government was credited with economically stabilizing Peru and successfully ending the Shining Path insurgency , though he was widely accused of human rights violations and suppression of political dissent .

Nevado Ojos del Salado is translated to Snowy Salty Eyes describing it being very snowy in the winter and salty with many lakes . Due to its location near the Atacama Desert , the mountain has very dry conditions , with snow usually only remaining on the peak during winter , though heavy storms can cover the surrounding area with a few feet of snow even in summer . Despite the generally dry conditions , there is a permanent crater lake about 100 m ( 330 ft ) in diameter at an elevation of 6,390 m ( 20,960 ft ) on the eastern side of the mountain . This is most likely the highest lake of any kind in the world . The ascent of Ojos del Salado is mostly a hike except for the final section to the summit which is a difficult scramble that may require ropes . The first ascent was made in 1937 by Jan Alfred Szczepa\u0144ski and Justyn Wojsznis , members of a Polish expedition in the Andes . Its name , meaning roughly Eyes of the Salty One in Spanish , comes from the enormous deposits of salt that , in the form of lagoons or eyes , appear in its glaciers .

With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres ( 42,855 sq mi ) , Bulgaria is Europe 's 16th-largest country . One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture , which dates back to 6,500 BC . In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for Thracians , Persians , Celts and ancient Macedonians ; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45 . The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries .

[ note 2 ] It rises 4,808 m ( 15,774 ft ) above sea level and is ranked 11th in the world in topographic prominence . The mountain stands in a range called the Graian Alps , between the regions of Aosta Valley , Italy , and Savoie and Haute-Savoie , France . The location of the summit is on the watershed line between the valleys of Ferret and Veny in Italy and the valleys of Montjoie , and Arve in France , on the border between the two countries . The Mont Blanc massif is popular for outdoor activities like hiking , climbing , trail running and winter sports like skiing , and snowboarding . The three towns and their communes which surround Mont Blanc are Courmayeur in Aosta Valley , Italy ; and Saint-Gervais-les-Bains and Chamonix in Haute-Savoie , France . The latter town was the site of the first Winter Olympics . A cable car ascends and crosses the mountain range from Courmayeur to Chamonix , through the Col du G\u00e9ant .

  "/wiki/Balkans": "The Balkans /\u02c8b\u0254\u02d0lk\u0259nz/ BAWL-k\u0259nz , also known as the Balkan Peninsula , is a geographic area in Southeast Europe with various definitions and meanings , including geopolitical and historical . The region takes its name from the Balkan Mountains that stretch throughout the whole of Bulgaria from the Serbian-Bulgarian border to the Black Sea coast . The Balkan Peninsula is bordered by the Adriatic Sea in the northwest , the Ionian Sea in the southwest , the Aegean Sea in the south , the Turkish Straits in the east , and the Black Sea in the northeast . The northern border of the peninsula is variously defined . The highest point of the Balkans is Mount Musala , 2,925 metres ( 9,596 ft ) , in the Rila mountain range , Bulgaria . The concept of the Balkan peninsula was created by the German geographer August Zeune in 1808 , who mistakenly considered the Balkan Mountains the dominant mountain system of Southeast Europe spanning from the Adriatic Sea to the Black Sea . The term of Balkan Peninsula was a synonym for Rumelia ( European Turkey ) in the 19th century , the former provinces of the Ottoman Empire in Southeast Europe . It had a geopolitical rather than a geographical definition , further promoted during the creation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in the early 20th century . The definition of the Balkan peninsula 's natural borders do not coincide with the technical definition of a peninsula and hence modern geographers reject the idea of a Balkan peninsula , while scholars usually discuss the Balkans as a region . The term has acquired a stigmatized and pejorative meaning related to the process of Balkanization , and hence the preferred alternative term used for the region is Southeast Europe .",

In 64 BC , the region came under the rule of the Roman Empire , and eventually became one of the Empire 's leading centers of Christianity . In the Mount Lebanon range a monastic tradition known as the Maronite Church was established . As the Arab Muslims conquered the region , the Maronites held onto their religion and identity . However , a new religious group , the Druze , established themselves in Mount Lebanon as well , generating a religious divide that has lasted for centuries . During the Crusades , the Maronites re-established contact with the Roman Catholic Church and asserted their communion with Rome .

The international border between Nepal ( Province No . 1 ) and China ( Tibet Autonomous Region ) runs across its summit point . The current official elevation of 8,848 m ( 29,029 ft ) , recognised by China and Nepal , was established by a 1955 Indian survey and subsequently confirmed by a Chinese survey in 1975 .

Mount Everest attracts many climbers , some of them highly experienced mountaineers . There are two main climbing routes , one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal ( known as the standard route ) and the other from the north in Tibet . While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route , Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness , weather , and wind , as well as significant hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall . As of 2019 [ update ] , over 300 people have died on Everest , many of whose bodies remain on the mountain . The first recorded efforts to reach Everest 's summit were made by British mountaineers . As Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time , the British made several attempts on the north ridge route from the Tibetan side . After the first reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921 reached 7,000 m ( 22,970 ft ) on the North Col , the 1922 expedition pushed the north ridge route up to 8,320 m ( 27,300 ft ) , marking the first time a human had climbed above 8,000 m ( 26,247 ft ) .",

  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",
  "/wiki/Mainland_Australia": "Mainland Australia is the main landmass of the Australian continent excluding Tasmania and other offshore islands . The land mass also constitutes the mainland of the territory governed by the Commonwealth of Australia , and the term , along with continental Australia , can be used in a geographic sense to exclude surrounding continental islands and external territories ( such as the Australian Antarctic Territory ) . Generally , the term is applied to the states of New South Wales , Victoria , Queensland , Western Australia , and South Australia , as well as the Northern Territory , Australian Capital Territory , and Jervis Bay Territory . The term is typically used when referring to the relationship between Tasmania and the other Australian states , in that people not from Tasmania are referred to as mainlanders . Tasmania has been omitted on a number of occasions from maps of Australia , reinforcing the divide between Tasmania and the mainland . The 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane left Tasmania off the map of Australia during the opening ceremony , as did the designs of the Australian Swim Team uniform for the 2014 Commonwealth Games . The land mass covers 7,595,342 km2 ( 2,932,578 sq mi ) , about 98.7% of the area of the country of Australia and covering 1.5% of the Earth 's surface . Its population is about 24.5 million , 98% of Australia 's population .",
  "/wiki/Monte_Rosa": "Monte Rosa ( Italian : massiccio del Monte Rosa ; German : Monte Rosa-Massiv ; French : massif du Mont Rose ) is a mountain massif located in the eastern part of the Pennine Alps . It is located between Italy ( Piedmont and Aosta Valley ) and Switzerland ( Valais ) . Monte Rosa is the second highest mountain in the Alps and western Europe , after Mont Blanc . The group is located on the watershed between central and southern Europe . The Monte Rosa massif has four faces . Three in Italy : the Liskamm heading above the Val de Gressoney , the Valsesian face above Alagna Valsesia at the upper part of the Valle della Sesia , and the steep , big east wall above Macugnaga in the Valle Anzasca . And the Swiss north-western face with several glaciers ( with one of the largest Alpine glaciers ) flowing towards the Mattertal with Zermatt . Its main summit , named Dufourspitze in honor of the surveyor Guillaume-Henri Dufour and wholly located in Switzerland , culminates at 4,634 m ( 15,203 ft ) above sea level and is followed by the five nearly equally high subsidiary summits of Dunantspitze , Grenzgipfel , Nordend , Zumsteinspitze and Signalkuppe . Some other over 4000 m peaks such as Piramide Vincent , Punta Giordani , and Corno Nero are wholly in Italy . Monte Rosa is the highest mountain of both Switzerland and the Pennine Alps and is also the second-highest mountain of the Alps and Europe outside the Caucasus . The north-west side of the central Monte Rosa massif , with its enormous ice slopes and seracs , constitutes the boundary and upper basin of the large Gorner Glacier , which descends towards Zermatt and merges with its nowadays much larger tributary , the Grenzgletscher ( English : Border Glacier ) , right below the Monte Rosa Hut on the lower end of the visible western wing . The Grenzgletscher is an impressive glacier formation between the western wing of the mountain and Liskamm , a ridge on its southwestern side on the Swiss-Italian border .",
  "/wiki/Switzerland": "Switzerland , officially the Swiss Confederation , is a country situated in the confluence of western , central , and southern Europe . [ note 4 ] It is a federal republic composed of 26 cantons , with federal authorities seated in Bern . [ note 1 ] Switzerland is a landlocked country bordered by Italy to the south , France to the west , Germany to the north , and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east . It is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau , the Alps , and the Jura , spanning a total area of 41,285 km2 ( 15,940 sq mi ) , and land area of 39,997 km2 ( 15,443 sq mi ) . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory , the Swiss population of approximately 8.5 million is concentrated mostly on the plateau , where the largest cities are located , among them the two global cities and economic centres of Z\u00fcrich and Geneva . The establishment of the Old Swiss Confederacy dates to the late medieval period , resulting from a series of military successes against Austria and Burgundy . Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire was formally recognized in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 . The Federal Charter of 1291 is considered the founding document of Switzerland which is celebrated on Swiss National Day . Since the Reformation of the 16th century , Switzerland has maintained a strong policy of armed neutrality ; it has not fought an international war since 1815 and did not join the United Nations until 2002 . Nevertheless , it pursues an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace-building processes around the world . Switzerland is the birthplace of the Red Cross , one of the world 's oldest and best known humanitarian organisations , and is home to numerous international organisations , including the second largest UN office . It is a founding member of the European Free Trade Association , but notably not part of the European Union , the European Economic Area or the Eurozone .",

[ d ] The capital and largest city is Reykjav\u00edk . Reykjavik and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population . Iceland is volcanically and geologically active . The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields , mountains , and glaciers , and many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands . Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate , despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle . Its high latitude and marine influence keep summers chilly , with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate . According to the ancient manuscript Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k , the settlement of Iceland began in 874 AD when the Norwegian chieftain Ing\u00f3lfr Arnarson became the first permanent settler on the island . In the following centuries , Norwegians , and to a lesser extent other Scandinavians , emigrated to Iceland , bringing with them thralls ( i.e. , slaves or serfs ) of Gaelic origin . The island was governed as an independent commonwealth under the Althing , one of the world 's oldest functioning legislative assemblies . Following a period of civil strife , Iceland acceded to Norwegian rule in the 13th century . The establishment of the Kalmar Union in 1397 united the kingdoms of Norway , Denmark , and Sweden .",

One hypothesis is the mountain was named after Perun , the highest god of the Slavic pantheon and the god of thunder and lightning . Another version is that the etymology of the range derives from the Thracian word Perinthos , meaning Rocky Mountain . The range extends about 80 km from the north-west to the south-east and is about 40 km wide , spanning a territory of 2,585 km2 ( 998 sq mi ) . To the north Pirin is separated from Bulgaria 's highest mountain range , the Rila Mountain , by the Predel saddle , while to the south it reaches the Slavyanka Mountain . To the west is located the valley of the river Struma and to the east the valley of the river Mesta separates it from the Rhodope Mountains . Pirin is dotted with more than a hundred glacial lakes and is also the home of Europe 's southernmost glaciers , Snezhnika and Banski Suhodol . The northern part of the range , which is also the highest one , is protected by the Pirin National Park , declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 . Pirin is noted for its rich flora and fauna , as well as for the presence of a number of relict species . Much of the area is forested , with some of the best preserved conifer woods in Bulgaria , holding important populations of the Balkan endemic species Macedonian pine , Bosnian pine and Bulgarian fir . Animals include many species of high conservation value , such as brown bear , gray wolf , wildcat , European pine marten , wild boar , red deer , roe deer , chamois , etc . The combination of favourable natural conditions and varied historical heritage contribute makes Pirin an important tourist destination ."
