The town of San Lucar was granted to the Spanish nobleman Alonso P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n in 1297 . Due to its strategic location , the city was a starting point for the exploration , colonization and evangelization of America between the 15th and 17th centuries .

During the Muslim rule in Spain , Seville came under the jurisdiction of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba before becoming the independent Taifa of Seville ; later it was ruled by the Muslim Almoravids and the Almohads until finally being incorporated into the Christian Kingdom of Castile under Ferdinand III in 1248 . After the discovery of the Americas , Seville became one of the economic centres of the Spanish Empire as its port monopolised the trans-oceanic trade and the Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n ( House of Trade ) wielded its power , opening a Golden Age of arts and literature . In 1519 , Ferdinand Magellan departed from Seville for the first circumnavigation of the Earth . Coinciding with the Baroque period of European history , the 17th century in Seville represented the most brilliant flowering of the city 's culture ; then began a gradual economic and demographic decline as silting in the Guadalquivir forced the trade monopoly to relocate to the nearby port of C\u00e1diz .",
