For most of the next 30 years , Cunard held the Blue Riband for the fastest Atlantic voyage . However , in the 1870s Cunard fell behind its rivals , the White Star Line and the Inman Line . To meet this competition , in 1879 the firm was reorganised as the Cunard Steamship Company , Ltd , to raise capital . In 1902 , White Star joined the American-owned International Mercantile Marine Co . In response , the British Government provided Cunard with substantial loans and a subsidy to build two superliners needed to retain Britain 's competitive position . Mauretania held the Blue Riband from 1909 to 1929 . The sinking of her running mate Lusitania in 1915 was one of the causes of the United States ' entering the First World War . In 1919 , Cunard relocated its British homeport from Liverpool to Southampton , to better cater for travellers from London .
