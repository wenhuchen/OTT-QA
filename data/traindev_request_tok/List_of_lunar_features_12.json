  "/wiki/Diameter": "In geometry , a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle . It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle . Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere . In more modern usage , the length of a diameter is also called the diameter . In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter ( which refers to the line segment itself ) , because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length , this being twice the radius r .",
  "/wiki/Rupes_Altai": "Rupes Altai is an escarpment in the lunar surface that is located in the southeastern quadrant of the Moon 's near side . It is named for the Altai Mountains in Asia , and is the most prominent lunar escarpment . The selenographic coordinates of this feature are 24\u00b018\u2032S 22\u00b036\u2032E / 24.3\u00b0S 22.6\u00b0E / -24.3 ; 22.6 , and it has a length of about 427 km . The southeastern end of the cliff terminates along the western edge of the crater Piccolomini . It then arcs irregularly towards the north , climbing to heights of nearly a kilometer . The northern end of the arc is an irregular region with no clearly defined terminus , where it brackets the prominent craters Theophilus , Cyrillus , and Catharina . This cliff forms the southwestern rim of the Nectaris impact basin . This feature is difficult to locate during the full moon when the sunlight is nearly overhead . It appears as a bright , winding line about five days after the new moon , and casts a long , irregular shadow about four days after the full moon , when the sunset terminator is nearby and the sunlight is arriving at a low angle .",
  "/wiki/Altai_Mountains": "The Altai Mountains ( /\u0251\u02d0l\u02c8ta\u026a/ ) , also spelled Altay Mountains , are a mountain range in Central and East Asia , where Russia , China , Mongolia , and Kazakhstan come together , and where the rivers Irtysh and Ob have their headwaters . The massif merges with the Sayan Mountains in the northeast , and gradually becomes lower in the southeast , where it merges into the high plateau of the Gobi Desert . It spans from about 45\u00b0 to 52\u00b0 N and from about 84\u00b0 to 99\u00b0 E. The region is inhabited by a sparse but ethnically diverse population , including Russians , Kazakhs , Altais , and Mongolians . The local economy is based on bovine , sheep , and horse husbandry , agriculture , forestry , and mining . The now-disputed Altaic language family takes its name from this mountain range .",
  "/wiki/Rupes_Boris": "Rupes Boris is a short fault or ridge in the lunar surface that is located in the northwestern quadrant of the Moon 's near side , within Mare Imbrium . Its name was adopted in 1985 by the International Astronomical Union , and was taken from the tiny nearby crater Boris . The selenographic coordinates of this feature are 30\u00b030\u2032N 33\u00b030\u2032W / 30.5\u00b0N 33.5\u00b0W / 30.5 ; -33.5 , and it has a length of just 4 km . It has been proposed that Rupes Boris is not actually a lunar escarpment , but may be a ridge of ejecta from the nearby crater Delisle .",
  "/wiki/Boris_(crater)": "Boris is a tiny lunar impact crater that is located on the Mare Imbrium , to the northeast of the crater Delisle . It lies near the southwest extremity of a sinuous rille that is designated Rima Delisle . This rille meanders to the northeast , towards the crater Heis , before vanishing into the lunar mare . The name Boris is a common Russian male given name ; the crater is not named after a specific person .",
  "/wiki/Rupes_Cauchy": "Rupes Cauchy is a 120 km-long escarpment at 9\u00b000\u2032N 37\u00b000\u2032E / 9.0\u00b0N 37.0\u00b0E / 9.0 ; 37.0 on the surface of the Moon . It faces southwest , and rises about 200-300 m. It is located in the northeastern portion of the Mare Tranquillitatis , and is named after the nearby crater Cauchy . The east end of Rupes Cauchy emerges from the highlands on the eastern margin of Mare Tranquillitatis . The 3.6 km diameter crater Cauchy C intersects the Rupes due south of Cauchy crater itself . Cauchy E and F lie to the north side of the Rupes , and Cauchy B lies on the south side . At the west end of the Rupes are two similar-sized elongate depressions ( unlikely to be impact craters ) . Between Cauchy B and the depressions the Rupes form an en echelon pattern , similar to that of veins within rock on earth , on a grand scale . The similar-sized craters Sinas J and H lie to the west of the depressions . Rupes Cauchy casts a thin shadow about five days after the new moon , when the sunrise terminator is nearby and the sunlight is arriving at a low angle . The feature name is shown as Fossa Casals on a 1974 map based on Apollo 15 photographs , but the name was not approved by the IAU .",
  "/wiki/Cauchy_(crater)": "Cauchy is a small lunar impact crater on the eastern Mare Tranquillitatis . It was named after French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy . It is circular and symmetric , with a small interior floor at the midpoint of the sloping inner walls . Due to the high albedo of this bowl-shaped formation , it is particularly prominent at full Moon . Cauchy lies between the Rupes Cauchy and the Rimae Cauchy , as described below . South of Rupes Cauchy are two lunar domes designated Omega ( \u03c9 ) Cauchy and Tau ( \u03c4 ) Cauchy . They lie to the south and southwest of Cauchy respectively . Each lunar dome has a small depression at its crest , which is likely to be a volcanic vent rather than an impact crater . The vent at the top of Omega Cauchy is called Donna .",

  "/wiki/Liebig_(crater)": "Liebig is a lunar impact crater that is located to the south-southeast of the crater Mersenius , and west of the Mare Humorum in the southwest part of the Moon . To the southwest of Liebig is the slightly smaller crater de Gasparis . The rim of Liebig has a low inner wall , with an interior floor that is nearly featureless except for a few tiny craterlets . It is nearly , but not quite circular , with outward bulges to the west and southeast . The small , cup-shaped crater Liebig A lies along the inner wall and part of the interior floor . The western edge of the Mare Humorum is a fault line designated the Rupes Liebig , named after this crater . This fault extends for about 180 km along the shore . To the southwest , in the section of lava-flooded surface between Liebig and de Gasparis , is a system of rilles named the Rimae de Gasparis . These cover an area with a diameter of 130 km .",
  "/wiki/Mercator_(crater)": "Mercator is a lunar impact crater that is located on the southwestern edge of Mare Nubium , in the southwest part of the Moon . It was named after 16th-century Southern Dutch cartographer Gerardus Mercator . It is located to the southeast of the crater Campanus , and the two are separated by a narrow , winding valley . The Rupes Mercator fault is tangential with the northeastern outer rim of Mercator . The eastern edge of Palus Epidemiarum reaches the west rim of Mercator , and a rille from the Rimae Ramsden reaches the western rim at the site of the craterlet Mercator C. The rim of Mercator is only somewhat eroded , and several tiny craterlets lie on the west and eastern rims . The interior floor has been flooded by lava in the past , leaving a relatively smooth and featureless surface .",

The name is Latin for straight cliff , although it is more commonly called the Straight Wall . This is the most well-known escarpment on the Moon , and is a popular target for amateur astronomers .",
  "/wiki/Latin": "Latin ( Latin : lingua lat\u012bna , IPA : [ \u02c8l\u026a\u014b\u0261\u02b7a la\u02c8ti\u02d0na ] ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages . The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets and ultimately from the Phoenician alphabet . Latin was originally spoken in the area around Rome , known as Latium . Through the power of the Roman Republic , it became the dominant language in Italy , and subsequently throughout the western Roman Empire . Latin has contributed many words to the English language . In particular , Latin ( and Ancient Greek ) roots are used in English descriptions of theology , the sciences , medicine , and law . By the late Roman Republic ( 75 BC ) , Old Latin had been standardised into Classical Latin . Vulgar Latin was the colloquial form spoken during the same time and attested in inscriptions and the works of comic playwrights like Plautus and Terence and author Petronius . Late Latin is the written language from the 3rd century and the colloquial form Vulgar Latin developed into the Romance languages , such as French , Italian , Portuguese , Romanian , Catalan and Spanish in the 6th to 9th centuries . Medieval Latin was used as a literary language from the 9th century to the Renaissance which used Renaissance Latin . Later , Early Modern Latin and New Latin evolved . Latin was used as the language of international communication , scholarship and science until well into the 18th century , when it began to be supplanted by vernaculars ( including the Romance languages ) .",
  "/wiki/Toscanelli_(crater)": "Toscanelli is a tiny , bowl-shaped lunar impact crater that is located to the north of the prominent crater Aristarchus , in the northwestern part of the Moon . The crater lies at the southern end of a rille that proceeds towards the north . This rille is part of a nearby system that has the designation Rimae Aristarchus . Just to the south of Toscanelli is a fault line in the surface named the Rupes Toscanelli , after the crater . This break in the surface continues to the south for a distance of about 70 kilometers ."
