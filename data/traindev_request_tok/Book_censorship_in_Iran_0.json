  "/wiki/The_Satanic_Verses": "The Satanic Verses is Salman Rushdie 's fourth novel , first published in 1988 and inspired in part by the life of Muhammad . As with his previous books , Rushdie used magical realism and relied on contemporary events and people to create his characters . The title refers to the satanic verses , a group of Quranic verses that refer to three pagan Meccan goddesses : All\u0101t , Uzza , and Man\u0101t . The part of the story that deals with the satanic verses was based on accounts from the historians al-Waqidi and al-Tabari . In the United Kingdom , The Satanic Verses received positive reviews , was a 1988 Booker Prize finalist ( losing to Peter Carey 's Oscar and Lucinda ) and won the 1988 Whitbread Award for novel of the year . However , major controversy ensued as Muslims accused it of blasphemy and mocking their faith . The outrage among Muslims resulted in a fatw\u0101 calling for Rushdie 's death issued by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , then Supreme Leader of Iran , on 14 February 1989 . The result was several failed assassination attempts on Rushdie , who was placed under police protection by the UK government , and attacks on several connected individuals , including the murder of translator Hitoshi Igarashi . The book was banned in India as hate speech directed toward a specific religious group .",

  "/wiki/The_God_Delusion": "The God Delusion is a 2006 book by English biologist Richard Dawkins , a professorial fellow at New College , Oxford , and former holder of the Charles Simonyi Chair for the Public Understanding of Science at the University of Oxford . In The God Delusion , Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that belief in a personal god qualifies as a delusion , which he defines as a persistent false belief held in the face of strong contradictory evidence . He is sympathetic to Robert Pirsig 's statement in Lila ( 1991 ) that when one person suffers from a delusion it is called insanity . When many people suffer from a delusion it is called religion . With many examples , he explains that one does not need religion to be moral and that the roots of religion and of morality can be explained in non-religious terms . In early December 2006 , it reached number four in the New York Times Hardcover Non-Fiction Best Seller list after nine weeks on the list . More than three million copies were sold . According to Dawkins in a 2016 interview with Matt Dillahunty , an unauthorised Arabic translation of this book has been downloaded 3 million times in Saudi Arabia . The book has attracted widespread commentary , with many books written in response .",
  "/wiki/Richard_Dawkins": "Richard Dawkins , FRS FRSL ( born Clinton Richard Dawkins ) ( born 26 March 1941 ) is an English ethologist , evolutionary biologist , and author . He is an emeritus fellow of New College , Oxford , and was the University of Oxford 's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008 . Dawkins first came to prominence with his 1976 book The Selfish Gene , which popularised the gene-centred view of evolution and introduced the term meme . With his book The Extended Phenotype ( 1982 ) , he introduced into evolutionary biology the influential concept that the phenotypic effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism 's body , but can stretch far into the environment . In 2006 , he founded the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science . Dawkins is known as an outspoken atheist . He is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design . In The Blind Watchmaker ( 1986 ) , he argues against the watchmaker analogy , an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms . Instead , he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker , in that reproduction , mutation , and selection are unguided by any designer . In The God Delusion ( 2006 ) , Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion . Dawkins has been awarded academic and writing awards , and he makes television , radio , and Internet appearances , predominantly discussing his books , his atheism , and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual .",

Shamlou was arguably the most influential poet of modern Iran . His initial poetry was influenced by and in the tradition of Nima Youshij . In fact , Abdolali Dastgheib , Iranian literary critic , argues that Shamlou is one of the pioneers of modern Farsi poetry and has had the greatest influence , after Nima , on Iranian poets of his era . Shamlou 's poetry is complex , yet his imagery , which contributes significantly to the intensity of his poems , is simple . As the base , he uses the traditional imagery familiar to his Iranian audience through the works of Persian masters like Hafiz and Omar Khayy\u00e1m . For infrastructure and impact , he uses a kind of everyday imagery in which personified oxymoronic elements are spiked with an unreal combination of the abstract and the concrete thus far unprecedented in Persian poetry , which distressed some of the admirers of more traditional poetry . Shamlou has translated extensively from French to Persian and his own works are also translated into a number of languages . He has also written a number of plays , edited the works of major classical Persian poets , especially Hafiz . His thirteen-volume Ketab-e Koucheh ( The Book of Alley ) is a major contribution in understanding the Iranian folklore beliefs and language . He also wrote fiction and screenplays , contributing to children 's literature , and journalism .",
