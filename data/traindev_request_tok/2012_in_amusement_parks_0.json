  "/wiki/Ocean_Park_Hong_Kong": "Ocean Park Hong Kong ( Chinese : \u9999\u6e2f\u6d77\u6d0b\u516c\u5712 ) , commonly known as Ocean Park , is a marine mammal park , oceanarium , animal theme park and amusement park situated in Wong Chuk Hang and Nam Long Shan in the Southern District of Hong Kong . It is the second largest theme park in Hong Kong , after Hong Kong Disneyland . And also , the largest theme park in Hong Kong by area . It is also the second oldest theme park in Hong Kong , after the now-defunct Lai Chi Kok Amusement Park which closed in 31 March 1997 , four months before the 1997 handover . Opened in 1977 , Ocean Park became popular , but 22 years later , it was unprofitable and widely expected to close due to the new Hong Kong Disneyland . However , the Park responded with a HK $ 5.5 billion development plan that saw it expand to over 80 attractions and rides , and steadily grow visitor numbers to 7.6 million in 2014 , making it the world 's 13th most visited theme park , and one of the largest theme parks in Asia . Half of all visitors now come from mainland China , in growth that parallels rising mainland tourist visitor levels to Hong Kong over the same period . Covering an area of 91.5 hectares ( 226 acres ) , the park is separated by a large mountain into two areas , The Summit ( Headland ) and The Waterfront ( Lowland ) . These areas can be reached by a 1.5 kilometres ( 0.93 mi ) cable car system , or the Ocean Express funicular railway . To ascend the Headland comprises several hills , visitors can use Hong Kong 's second longest outdoor escalator . The theme park has various attractions and rides , including four roller coasters , and also animal exhibits with different themes , such as a giant panda habitat , rainforest and polar displays , as well as an aquarium featuring the world 's largest aquarium dome . Between 1979 and 1997 , Ocean Park was most famous for its signature killer whale , Miss Hoi Wai/Susie Wong .",
  "/wiki/Powered_roller_coaster": "A powered roller coaster is a railed amusement ride similar to a roller coaster . Unlike a true roller coaster , the train is powered through the entire course , rather than being allowed to coast after an initial lift or launch . This allows for both compact layouts that start out with curving hills , or long , extended layouts that would need too many lifts to be feasible . The most common manufacturers of powered coasters are Mack , Wisdom Rides , and Zamperla . Due to the family-oriented nature of the rides , height restrictions can be as little as 36 inches or taller for someone to ride . The most common model of powered coasters is the Zamperla Dragon coasters ( also called Dragon Wagons , although there are non-powered versions of these coasters ) . Other installations include Casey Junior , Le Petit Train du Cirque at Disneyland Park ( Paris ) ( built by Vekoma ) , Thunder Run at Canada 's Wonderland , Runaway Mine Train at Alton Towers and High in the Sky Seuss Trolley Train Ride at Islands of Adventure . The train on a powered coaster usually picks up electricity from contacts in the rails ( similar to an electric locomotive or a monorail ) and may contain multiple motors . Some powered coasters are powered by a flexible cable connected to the train . Another component of powered coasters is an extra track in the center of the rails . This allows the tyres attached to the motor to grip the track and propel the train forward . A powered coaster generally runs a single train and may traverse the circuit multiple times before stopping at the station .",

It is the largest theme park in Hong Kong , followed by Ocean Park Hong Kong . Hong Kong Disneyland was opened to visitors on Monday , 12 September 2005 at 13:00 HKT . Disney attempted to avoid problems of cultural backlash by incorporating Chinese culture , customs , and traditions when designing and building the resort , including adherence to the rules of feng shui . For instance , a bend was put in a walkway near the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort entrance so good qi energy would not flow into the South China Sea . The park consists of seven themed areas : Main Street , U.S.A. , Fantasyland , Adventureland , Tomorrowland , Grizzly Gulch , Mystic Point , and Toy Story Land . The theme park 's cast members speak Cantonese , English , and Mandarin . Guide maps are printed in traditional and simplified Chinese as well as English .

  "/wiki/Wooden_roller_coaster": "A wooden roller coaster is most often classified as a roller coaster with running rails made of flattened steel strips mounted on laminated wooden track . Occasionally , the support structure may be made out of a steel lattice or truss , but the ride remains classified as a wooden roller coaster due to the track design . The type of wood typically used in the construction of wooden coasters is Southern Yellow Pine , usually grown in the US and the rest of North America . Because of the limits of wood , wooden roller coasters , in general , do not have inversions ( when the coaster goes upside down ) , steep drops , or extremely banked turns ( overbanked turns ) . However , there are exceptions , such as the original loop on Son of Beast at Kings Island ; a corkscrew and 90-degree banked turn at Hades 360 at Mount Olympus Water and Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells , Wisconsin ; a steel structure at The Voyage at Holiday World ; and banked turns at Ravine Flyer II at Waldameer Park and Outlaw Run at Silver Dollar City .",

  "/wiki/Wild_Mouse_roller_coaster": "A Wild Mouse roller coaster ( also Mad Mouse or Crazy Mouse ) is a type of roller coaster characterized by small cars that seat four people or fewer and ride on top of the track , taking tight , flat turns ( without banking ) at modest speeds , yet producing high lateral G-forces . The track work is characterized by many turns and bunny hops , the latter producing abrupt negative vertical G forces . When approaching a turn from a straight section , the intended impression is that one will simply continue straight , and thus plunge off of the device , this since there are no transition sections as are in a conventional high speed roller coaster track and the turn itself is obscured upon close approach . Almost all Wild Mice feature switchback sections , consisting of several of these unbanked turns , separated by straight sections . Usually the turns on the switchback section are 180\u00b0 , but some coasters feature 90\u00b0 turns as well as more rarely steep runs with loops ( for example Crazy Mouse at Tobu Zoo in Japan , which is no longer operating ) . Some riders , usually among taller people , report sustaining whiplash after being subjected to these turns . [ citation needed ] The feeling of a Wild Mouse coaster is amplified by using cars that are wider than the track itself , giving the impression that the riders are hanging off the side or that they might fly out , thus giving it the name wild . Some may include trick-track - a straight piece of track banked slightly side to side designed to throw the rider left to right . Some wild mouse coasters , such as Primeval Whirl , also have spinning cars . The modern Wild Mouse was invented by German designer Franz Mack . In the original wooden Wild Mouse coasters of the 1960s and 1970s , the cars were so small that they could only fit two adults in close contact . While the low capacity of these rides led to long lines , the cars were small by design .",

The term was first coined by Arrow Dynamics and Cedar Point in 1989 with the release of the first full-circuit hypercoaster in the world , Magnum XL-200 . Other roller coaster manufacturers developed their own models with custom names , including Mega Coasters from Intamin , Hyper Coasters from Bolliger & Mabillard , and Hyper-Hybrid Coasters from Rocky Mountain Construction . The competition between amusement parks to build increasingly taller roller coasters eventually led to giga coasters which exceed 300 feet ( 91 m ) and strata coasters which exceed 400 feet ( 120 m ) .",
