  "/wiki/At-large": "At-large is a designation for members of a governing body who are elected or appointed to represent the whole membership of the body ( notably , a city , county , state or province , nation , club or association ) , rather than a subset of that membership . At-large voting is in contrast to voting by electoral districts . If an at-large election is called to choose a single candidate , a single-winner voting system must necessarily be used . If a group of seats must be covered , many electoral systems can be possible , from proportional representation methods ( such as party-list proportional representation , or PR-STV ) to block voting .",
