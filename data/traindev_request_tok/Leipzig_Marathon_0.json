  "/wiki/Hour": "An hour ( symbol : h ; also abbreviated hr . ) is a unit of time conventionally reckoned as \u200b1\u204424 of a day and scientifically reckoned as 3,599-3,601 seconds , depending on conditions . The hour was initially established in the ancient Near East as a variable measure of \u200b1\u204412 of the night or daytime . Such seasonal , temporal , or unequal hours varied by season and latitude . Medieval astronomers such as al-Biruni and Sacrobosco , subsequently divided the hour into 60 minutes , each of 60 seconds . ( This derives from Babylonian astronomy , where the corresponding terms denoted the time required for the Sun 's apparent motion through the ecliptic to describe one minute or second of arc , respectively . In present terms , the Babylonian degree of time was thus four minutes long , the minute of time was thus four seconds long and the second 1/15 of a second . ) Equal or equinoctial hours were taken as \u200b1\u204424 of the day as measured from noon to noon ; the minor seasonal variations of this unit were eventually smoothed by making it \u200b1\u204424 of the mean solar day . Since this unit was not constant due to long term variations in the Earth 's rotation , the hour was finally separated from the Earth 's rotation and defined in terms of the atomic or physical second . In the modern metric system , hours are an accepted unit of time defined as 3,600 atomic seconds . However , on rare occasions an hour may incorporate a positive or negative leap second , [ a ] making it last 3,599 or 3,601 seconds , in order to keep it within 0.9 seconds of UT1 , which is based on measurements of the mean solar day .",
  "/wiki/Minute": "The minute is a unit of time usually equal to \u200b1\u204460 ( the first sexagesimal fraction ) of an hour , or 60 seconds . In the UTC time standard , a minute on rare occasions has 61 seconds , a consequence of leap seconds ( there is a provision to insert a negative leap second , which would result in a 59-second minute , but this has never happened in more than 40 years under this system ) . Although not an SI unit , the minute is accepted for use with SI units . The SI symbol for minute or minutes is min ( without a dot ) . The prime symbol is also sometimes used informally to denote minutes of time . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/Second": "The second ( symbol : s , abbreviation : sec ) is the base unit of time in the International System of Units ( SI ) , commonly understood and historically defined as \u200b1\u204486400 of a day - this factor derived from the division of the day first into 24 hours , then to 60 minutes and finally to 60 seconds each . Analog clocks and watches often have sixty tick marks on their faces , representing seconds ( and minutes ) , and a second hand to mark the passage of time in seconds . Digital clocks and watches often have a two-digit seconds counter . The second is also part of several other units of measurement like meters per second for velocity , meters per second per second for acceleration , and cycles per second for frequency . Although the historical definition of the unit was based on this division of the Earth 's rotation cycle , the formal definition in the International System of Units ( SI ) is a much steadier timekeeper : it is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency \u2206\u03bdCs , the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom , to be 9192631770 when expressed in the unit Hz , which is equal to s\u22121 . Because the Earth 's rotation varies and is also slowing ever so slightly , a leap second is periodically added to clock time [ nb 1 ] to keep clocks in sync with Earth 's rotation . Multiples of seconds are usually counted in hours and minutes . Fractions of a second are usually counted in tenths or hundredths . In scientific work , small fractions of a second are counted in milliseconds ( thousandths ) , microseconds ( millionths ) , nanoseconds ( billionths ) , and sometimes smaller units of a second . An everyday experience with small fractions of a second is a 1-gigahertz microprocessor which has a cycle time of 1 nanosecond . Camera shutter speeds are often expressed in fractions of a second , such as \u200b1\u204430 second or \u200b1\u20441000 second . Sexagesimal divisions of the day from a calendar based on astronomical observation have existed since the third millennium BC , though they were not seconds as we know them today [ citation needed ] .",

Germany is a very decentralised country . Its capital and largest metropolis is Berlin , while Frankfurt serves as its financial capital and has the country 's busiest airport . Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity . A region named Germania was documented before AD 100 . Beginning in the 10th century , German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire . During the 16th century , northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation . After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire , the German Confederation was formed in 1815 . The German revolutions of 1848-49 resulted in the Frankfurt Parliament establishing major democratic rights .",

It is bordered by Poland to the north , Ukraine to the east , Hungary to the south , Austria to the southwest , and the Czech Republic to the northwest . Slovakia 's territory spans about 49,000 square kilometres ( 19,000 sq mi ) and is mostly mountainous . The population is over 5.6 million and consists mostly of Slovaks . The capital and largest city is Bratislava , and the second-largest city is Ko\u0161ice . The official language is Slovak . The Slavs arrived in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th and 6th centuries . In the 7th century they played a significant role in the creation of Samo 's Empire and in the 9th century established the Principality of Nitra , which was later conquered by the Principality of Moravia to establish Great Moravia . In the 10th century , after the dissolution of Great Moravia , the territory was integrated into the Principality of Hungary , which would become the Kingdom of Hungary in 1000 . In 1241 and 1242 , much of the territory was destroyed by the Mongols during their invasion of Central and Eastern Europe . The area was recovered largely thanks to B\u00e9la IV of Hungary who also settled Germans who became an important ethnic group in the area , especially in what are today parts of central and eastern Slovakia . After World War I and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire , the Czechoslovak National Council established Czechoslovakia ( 1918-1939 ) .",

The history of human activity on Polish soil spans almost 500,000 years . Throughout the Iron Age the area became extensively diverse , with various cultures and tribes settling on the vast Central European Plain . However , it was the Western Polans who dominated the region and gave Poland its name . The establishment of Polish statehood can be traced to AD 966 , when Mieszko I , ruler of the realm coextensive with the territory of present-day Poland , converted to Christianity . The Kingdom of Poland was founded in 1025 , and in 1569 it cemented its longstanding political association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the Union of Lublin . This union formed the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , one of the largest ( over 1,000,000 square kilometres - 400,000 square miles ) and most populous countries of 16th and 17th century Europe , with a uniquely liberal political system which adopted Europe 's first written national constitution , the Constitution of 3 May 1791 .",

It shares borders with Eritrea to the north , Djibouti to the northeast , Somalia , and the de facto state of Somaliland to the east , Kenya to the south , South Sudan to the west and Sudan to the northwest . With over 109 million inhabitants , Ethiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world and the second-most populous nation on the African continent with a total area of 1,100,000 square kilometres ( 420,000 sq mi ) . Its capital and largest city is Addis Ababa , which lies a few miles west of the East African Rift that splits the country into the Nubian and Somali tectonic plates . Some of the oldest skeletal evidence for anatomically modern humans has been found in Ethiopia . It is widely considered as the region from which modern humans first set out for the Middle East and places beyond . According to linguists , the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations settled in the Horn region during the ensuing Neolithic era . Tracing its roots to the 2nd millennium BCE , Ethiopia 's governmental system was a monarchy for most of its history . Oral literature tells that the monarchy was founded by the Solomonic dynasty of the Queen of Sheba , under its first king , Menelik I . In the first centuries , the Kingdom of Aksum maintained a unified civilization in the region , followed by the Ethiopian Empire circa 1137 . During the late 19th-century Scramble for Africa , Ethiopia and Liberia were two nations that preserved their sovereignty from long-term colonisation by a European colonial power and many newly-independent nations on the continent subsequently adopted its flag colours . However , the country was later occupied by Italy in 1936 and became Italian Ethiopia ( part of Italian East Africa ) until it was liberated during World War II .",

Kenya is bordered by South Sudan to the northwest , Ethiopia to the north , Somalia to the east , Uganda to the west , Tanzania to the south , and the Indian Ocean to the southeast . According to archaeological dating of associated artifacts and skeletal material , the Cushites first settled in the lowlands of Kenya between 3,200 and 1,300 BC , a phase referred to as the Lowland Savanna Pastoral Neolithic . Nilotic-speaking pastoralists ( ancestral to Kenya 's Nilotic speakers ) started migrating from present-day southern Sudan into Kenya around 500 BC . European colonisation of Kenya began in the 19th century during the European exploration of the interior . Modern-day Kenya emerged from a protectorate established by the British Empire in 1895 and the subsequent Kenya Colony , which began in 1920 . Numerous disputes between the UK and the colony led to the Mau Mau revolution , which began in 1952 , and the subsequent declaration of independence in 1963 .",
