  "/wiki/De_Havilland_Mosquito": "The de Havilland DH.98 Mosquito is a British twin-engined , shoulder-winged multirole combat aircraft , introduced during the Second World War . Unusual in that its frame is constructed mostly of wood , it was nicknamed the Wooden Wonder , or Mossie . Lord Beaverbrook , Minister of Aircraft Production , nicknamed it Freeman 's Folly , alluding to Air Chief Marshal Sir Wilfrid Freeman , who defended Geoffrey de Havilland and his design concept against orders to scrap the project . In 1941 , it was one of the fastest operational aircraft in the world . Originally conceived as an unarmed fast bomber , the Mosquito 's use evolved during the war into many roles , including low- to medium-altitude daytime tactical bomber , high-altitude night bomber , pathfinder , day or night fighter , fighter-bomber , intruder , maritime strike , and photo-reconnaissance aircraft . It was also used by the British Overseas Airways Corporation as a fast transport to carry small , high-value cargo to and from neutral countries through enemy-controlled airspace . The crew of two , pilot and navigator , sat side by side . A single passenger could ride in the aircraft 's bomb bay when necessary . The Mosquito FBVI was often flown in special raids , such as Operation Jericho - an attack on Amiens Prison in early 1944 , and precision attacks against military intelligence , security , and police facilities ( such as Gestapo headquarters ) . On 30 January 1943 , the 10th anniversary of the Nazis ' seizure of power , a morning Mosquito attack knocked out the main Berlin broadcasting station while Hermann G\u00f6ring was speaking , putting his speech off the air . The Mosquito flew with the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) and other air forces in the European , Mediterranean and Italian theatres . The Mosquito was also operated by the RAF in the Southeast Asian theatre and by the Royal Australian Air Force based in the Halmaheras and Borneo during the Pacific War .",

  "/wiki/Supermarine_Spitfire": "The Supermarine Spitfire is a British single-seat fighter aircraft that was used by the Royal Air Force and other Allied countries before , during , and after World War II . Many variants of the Spitfire were built , using several wing configurations , and it was produced in greater numbers than any other British aircraft . It was also the only British fighter produced continuously throughout the war . The Spitfire continues to be popular among enthusiasts ; nearly 60 remain airworthy , and many more are static exhibits in aviation museums throughout the world . The Spitfire was designed as a short-range , high-performance interceptor aircraft by R. J. Mitchell , chief designer at Supermarine Aviation Works , which operated as a subsidiary of Vickers-Armstrong from 1928 . Mitchell pushed the Spitfire 's distinctive elliptical wing with cutting-edge sunken rivets ( designed by Beverley Shenstone ) to have the thinnest possible cross-section , helping give the aircraft a higher top speed than several contemporary fighters , including the Hawker Hurricane . Mitchell continued to refine the design until his death in 1937 , whereupon his colleague Joseph Smith took over as chief designer , overseeing the Spitfire 's development through its multitude of variants . During the Battle of Britain , from July to October 1940 , the public perceived the Spitfire to be the main RAF fighter , though the more numerous Hurricane shouldered a greater proportion of the burden against Nazi Germany 's air force , the Luftwaffe . However , Spitfire units had a lower attrition rate and a higher victory-to-loss ratio than those flying Hurricanes because of the Spitfire 's higher performance . During the battle , Spitfires were generally tasked with engaging Luftwaffe fighters - mainly Messerschmitt Bf 109E-series aircraft , which were a close match for them . After the Battle of Britain , the Spitfire superseded the Hurricane to become the backbone of RAF Fighter Command , and saw action in the European , Mediterranean , Pacific , and South-East Asian theatres . Much loved by its pilots , the Spitfire served in several roles , including interceptor , photo-reconnaissance , fighter-bomber , and trainer , and it continued to serve in these roles until the 1950s .",

  "/wiki/Hawker_Hurricane": "The Hawker Hurricane is a British single-seat fighter aircraft of the 1930s-40s that was designed and predominantly built by Hawker Aircraft Ltd. for service with the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . It was overshadowed in the public consciousness by the Supermarine Spitfire 's role during Battle of Britain in 1940 , but the Hurricane inflicted 60 percent of the losses sustained by the Luftwaffe in the engagement , and fought in all the major theatres of the Second World War . The Hurricane originated from discussions between RAF officials and aircraft designer Sir Sydney Camm about a proposed monoplane derivative of the Hawker Fury biplane in the early 1930s . Despite an institutional preference for biplanes and lack of interest from the Air Ministry , Hawker refined their monoplane proposal , incorporating several innovations which became critical to wartime fighter aircraft , including retractable landing gear and the more powerful Rolls-Royce Merlin engine . The Air Ministry ordered Hawker 's Interceptor Monoplane in late 1934 , and the prototype Hurricane K5083 performed its maiden flight on 6 November 1935 . In June 1936 , the Hurricane went into production for the Air Ministry ; it entered squadron service on 25 December 1937 . Its manufacture and maintenance was eased by using conventional construction methods so that squadrons could perform many major repairs without external support . The Hurricane was rapidly procured prior to the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 , when the RAF had 18 Hurricane-equipped squadrons in service . The aircraft was relied on to defend against German aircraft operated by the Luftwaffe , including dogfighting with Messerschmitt Bf 109s in multiple theatres of action . The Hurricane was developed through several versions , into bomber-interceptors , fighter-bombers , and ground support aircraft as well as fighters . Versions designed for the Royal Navy known as the Sea Hurricane had modifications enabling operation from ships . Some were converted as catapult-launched convoy escorts .",

  "/wiki/Hawker_Typhoon": "The Hawker Typhoon ( Tiffy in RAF slang ) is a British single-seat fighter-bomber , produced by Hawker Aircraft . It was intended to be a medium-high altitude interceptor , as a replacement for the Hawker Hurricane but several design problems were encountered and it never completely satisfied this requirement . The Typhoon was originally designed to mount twelve .303 inch ( 7.7 mm ) Browning machine guns and be powered by the latest 2,000 hp engines . Its service introduction in mid-1941 was plagued with problems and for several months the aircraft faced a doubtful future . When the Luftwaffe brought the formidable Focke-Wulf Fw 190 into service in 1941 , the Typhoon was the only RAF fighter capable of catching it at low altitudes ; as a result it secured a new role as a low-altitude interceptor . The Typhoon became established in roles such as night-time intruder and long-range fighter . From late 1942 the Typhoon was equipped with bombs and from late 1943 RP-3 rockets were added to its armoury . With those weapons and its four 20mm Hispano autocannons , the Typhoon became one of the Second World War 's most successful ground-attack aircraft .",

  "/wiki/Bristol_Beaufort": "The Bristol Beaufort ( manufacturer designation Type 152 ) was a British twin-engined torpedo bomber designed by the Bristol Aeroplane Company , and developed from experience gained designing and building the earlier Blenheim light bomber . At least 1,180 Beauforts were built by Bristol and other British manufacturers . The Australian government 's Department of Aircraft Production ( DAP ) also manufactured variants of the Beaufort . These are often known collectively as the DAP Beaufort . More than 700 Australian-built Beauforts saw service with the Royal Australian Air Force in the South West Pacific theatre , where they were used until the end of the war . Beauforts first saw service with Royal Air Force Coastal Command and then the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm from 1940 . They were used as torpedo bombers , conventional bombers and mine-layers until 1942 , when they were removed from active service and were then used as trainer aircraft until being declared obsolete in 1945 . Beauforts also saw considerable action in the Mediterranean ; Beaufort squadrons based in Egypt and on Malta helped interdict Axis shipping supplying Rommel 's Deutsches Afrikakorps in North Africa . Although it was designed as a torpedo-bomber , the Beaufort was more often used as a medium day bomber . The Beaufort also flew more hours in training than on operational missions and more were lost through accidents and mechanical failures than were lost to enemy fire . The Beaufort was adapted as a long-range heavy fighter variant called the Beaufighter , which proved to be very successful and many Beaufort units eventually converted to the Beaufighter .",

  "/wiki/Boeing_B-17_Flying_Fortress": "The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress is a four-engined heavy bomber developed in the 1930s for the United States Army Air Corps ( USAAC ) . Competing against Douglas and Martin for a contract to build 200 bombers , the Boeing entry ( prototype Model 299/XB-17 ) outperformed both competitors and exceeded the air corps ' performance specifications . Although Boeing lost the contract ( to the Douglas B-18 Bolo ) because the prototype crashed , the air corps ordered 13 more B-17s for further evaluation . From its introduction in 1938 , the B-17 Flying Fortress evolved through numerous design advances , becoming the third-most produced bomber of all time , behind the four-engined B-24 and the multirole , twin-engined Ju 88 . The B-17 was primarily employed by the USAAF in the daylight strategic bombing campaign of World War II against German industrial and military targets . The United States Eighth Air Force , based at many airfields in central , eastern and southern England , and the Fifteenth Air Force , based in Italy , complemented the RAF Bomber Command 's nighttime area bombing in the Combined Bomber Offensive to help secure air superiority over the cities , factories and battlefields of Western Europe in preparation for the invasion of France in 1944 . The B-17 also participated to a lesser extent in the War in the Pacific , early in World War II , where it conducted raids against Japanese shipping and airfields . From its prewar inception , the USAAC ( by June 1941 , the USAAF ) promoted the aircraft as a strategic weapon ; it was a relatively fast , high-flying , long-range bomber with heavy defensive armament at the expense of bombload . It developed a reputation for toughness based upon stories and photos of badly damaged B-17s safely returning to base . The B-17 dropped more bombs than any other U.S. aircraft in World War II . Of approximately 1.5 million tons of bombs dropped on Nazi Germany and its occupied territories by U.S. aircraft , over 640,000 tons were dropped from B-17s . In addition to its role as a bomber , the B-17 was also employed as a transport , antisubmarine aircraft , drone controller , and search-and-rescue aircraft .",

  "/wiki/Bristol_Blenheim": "The Bristol Blenheim is a British light bomber aircraft designed and built by the Bristol Aeroplane Company ( Bristol ) which was used extensively in the first two years and in some cases throughout the Second World War . The aircraft was developed as Type 142 , a civil airliner , in response to a challenge from Lord Rothermere to produce the fastest commercial aircraft in Europe . The Type 142 first flew in April 1935 , and the Air Ministry , impressed by its performance , ordered a modified design as the Type 142M for the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) as a bomber . Deliveries of the newly named Blenheim to RAF squadrons commenced on 10 March 1937 . A development of the Type 142M was the Type 149 which Bristol named the Bolingbroke , retrospectively changed by the Air Ministry to Blenheim Mk IV and the Type 142M to the Blenheim Mk I. Fairchild Canada built the Type 149 under licence as the Bolingbroke . Blenheims Mk I and the Mk IV were adapted as fighters by the addition of a gun pack of four Browning .303 machine guns in the bomb bay . The Mk IV was used as a long range fighter and as a maritime patrol aircraft ; both aircraft were used as bomber/gunnery trainers . The Blenheim was one of the first British aircraft with an all-metal stressed-skin construction , retractable landing gear , flaps , a powered gun turret and variable-pitch propellers . The Mk I was faster than most fighters in the late 1930s but the advance in development of monoplane fighters made all bombers more vulnerable particularly if flown in daylight , though it proved successful as a night fighter . The Blenheim was effective as a bomber but many were shot down . Both Blenheim types were used by overseas operators , being licence built in Yugoslavia and Finland .",
