  "/wiki/5_June_(film)": "5 June ( German : Der 5 . Juni ) is a 1942 German war film directed by Fritz Kirchhoff and starring Carl Raddatz , Joachim Brennecke and Karl Ludwig Diehl . The film depicts the events of 1940 when German forces successfully invaded France . It was shot on location in France and Germany . Constant changes to the film , often at the request of the German military , led to large cost overruns . In November 1942 , the film was banned by the Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda Joseph Goebbels for unspecified reasons . It has been speculated that Goebbels thought the film was not entertaining enough or wished to avoid offending the Vichy government of France .",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_France": "The Battle of France , also known as the Fall of France , was the German invasion of France and the Low Countries during the Second World War . On 3 September 1939 France had declared war on Germany , following the invasion of its ally Poland . In early September 1939 , France launched the Saar Offensive , which stalled . By mid October , French troops had been withdrawn to their original start positions . In six weeks from 10 May 1940 , German forces defeated Allied forces by mobile operations and conquered France , Belgium , Luxembourg and the Netherlands , bringing land operations on the Western Front to an end until the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944 . Italy entered the war on 10 June 1940 and invaded France over the Alps . In Fall Gelb ( Case Yellow ) , German armoured units made a surprise push through the Ardennes , and then along the Somme valley , cutting off and surrounding the Allied units that had advanced into Belgium to meet the expected German invasion . When British , Belgian and French forces were pushed back to the sea by the mobile and well-organised German operation , the British evacuated the British Expeditionary Force ( BEF ) and French divisions from Dunkirk in Operation Dynamo . German forces began Fall Rot ( Case Red ) on 5 June . The sixty remaining French divisions and two British divisions made a determined resistance but were unable to overcome the German air superiority and armoured mobility . German tanks outflanked the Maginot Line and pushed deep into France , occupying Paris unopposed on 14 June . After the flight of the French government and the collapse of the French army , German commanders met with French officials on 18 June to negotiate an end to hostilities .",
  "/wiki/Across_the_Pacific": "Across the Pacific is a 1942 American spy film set on the eve of the entry of the United States into World War II . The film was directed first by John Huston , then by Vincent Sherman after Huston joined the United States Army Signal Corps . It stars Humphrey Bogart , Mary Astor , and Sydney Greenstreet . Despite the title , the action of the film never progresses across the Pacific , concluding in Panama . The title had been used before by Warner Brothers for a 1926 silent adventure film by the same name starring Monte Blue , who also has a small role in this film . However , the plots of the two films bear no resemblance to each other . Indeed , the plot of the talkie is more like a remake of the silent film-era spy thriller The Silent Command . Initially , it was planned that the film would portray an attempt to avert a Japanese plan to bomb Pearl Harbor . When the real-life Pearl Harbor bombing occurred , the script was quickly rewritten to change the location of the planned attack to Panama . Director John Huston was called up to military service during filming ; he claimed he left at the point near the end of the film in which Bogart is trapped in a house at gun-point . Vincent Sherman finished directing the film , minus the script which Huston took with him , explaining Bogie will know how to get out . An implausible escape and plot wrap-up was shot , which Huston declared lacked credibility .",

Huston was a citizen of the United States by birth but renounced U.S. citizenship to become an Irish citizen and resident . He returned to the United States , where he lived the rest of his life . He wrote the screenplays for most of the 37 feature films he directed , many of which are today considered classics : The Maltese Falcon ( 1941 ) , The Treasure of the Sierra Madre ( 1948 ) , The Asphalt Jungle ( 1950 ) , The African Queen ( 1951 ) , The Misfits ( 1961 ) , Fat City ( 1972 ) , The Man Who Would Be King ( 1975 ) and Prizzi 's Honor ( 1985 ) . During his 46-year career , Huston received 15 Oscar nominations , winning twice , and directed both his father , Walter Huston , and daughter , Anjelica Huston , to Oscar wins . Huston studied and worked as a fine art painter in Paris in his early years . He explored the visual aspects of his films throughout his career , sketching each scene on paper beforehand , then carefully framing his characters during the shooting . While most directors rely on post-production editing to shape their final work , Huston instead created his films while they were being shot , with little editing needed . Some of Huston 's films were adaptations of important novels , often depicting an heroic quest , as in Moby Dick , or The Red Badge of Courage . In many films , different groups of people , while struggling toward a common goal , would become doomed , forming destructive alliances , giving the films a dramatic and visual tension . Many of his films involved themes such as religion , meaning , truth , freedom , psychology , colonialism , and war . Huston has been referred to as a titan , a rebel , and a renaissance man in the Hollywood film industry .",

  "/wiki/Panama_Canal": "The Panama Canal ( Spanish : Canal de Panam\u00e1 ) is an artificial 82 km ( 51 mi ) waterway in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean . The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a conduit for maritime trade . Canal locks are at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake , an artificial lake created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal , 26 m ( 85 ft ) above sea level , and then lower the ships at the other end . The original locks are 32.5 m ( 110 ft ) wide . A third , wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016 . The expanded canal began commercial operation on June 26 , 2016 . The new locks allow transit of larger , neo-Panamax ships , capable of handling more cargo . The construction of the Panama Canal is where the expression Another Day , Another Dollar comes from , as the workers were rumored to be paid a dollar a day for their labor . France began work on the canal in 1881 , but stopped due to engineering problems and a high worker mortality rate . The United States took over the project in 1904 and opened the canal on August 15 , 1914 . One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken , the Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduced the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans , enabling them to avoid the lengthy , hazardous Cape Horn route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage or Strait of Magellan and the even less popular route through the Arctic Archipelago and the Bering Strait . Colombia , France , and later the United States controlled the territory surrounding the canal during construction .",

The vast size of the Mediterranean and Middle East theatre saw interconnected naval , land , and air campaigns fought for control of the Mediterranean , North Africa , the Horn of Africa , the Middle East and Southern Europe . The fighting in this theatre lasted from 10 June 1940 , when Italy entered the war on the side of Germany , until 2 May 1945 when all Axis forces in Italy surrendered . However , fighting would continue in Greece - where British troops had been dispatched to aid the Greek government - during the early stages of the Greek Civil War . The British referred to this theatre as the Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre ( so called due to the location of the fighting and the name of Middle East Command ) , the Americans called it the Mediterranean Theater of War and the German informal official history of the fighting is The Mediterranean , South-East Europe , and North Africa 1939-1941 ( 1995 ) . Regardless of the size of the theatre , the various campaigns were not seen as neatly separated areas of operations but part of a vast theatre of war . Fascist Italy aimed to carve out a new Roman Empire , while British forces aimed initially to retain the status quo . Italy invaded Greece , and not until the introduction of German forces were Greece and Yugoslavia overrun . Allied and Axis forces engaged in back and forth fighting across North Africa , with Axis interference in the Middle East causing fighting to spread there . With confidence high from early gains , German forces planned elaborate attacks to be launched to capture the Middle East and then to possibly attack the southern border of the Soviet Union . In three years of fighting , Axis forces were defeated in North Africa and their interference in the Middle East was halted . The anti-Axis coalition then commenced the Allied invasion of Italy , resulting in the Italians deposing Mussolini and joining the Allies .",

  "/wiki/Invasion_of_Yugoslavia": "The invasion of Yugoslavia , also known as the April War [ a ] or Operation 25 , [ b ] was a German-led attack on the Kingdom of Yugoslavia by the Axis powers which began on 6 April 1941 during World War II . The order for the invasion was put forward in F\u00fchrer Directive No . 25 , which Adolf Hitler issued on 27 March 1941 , following the Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat . The invasion commenced with an overwhelming air attack on Belgrade and facilities of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force ( VVKJ ) by the Luftwaffe ( German Air Force ) and attacks by German land forces from southwestern Bulgaria . These attacks were followed by German thrusts from Romania , Hungary and the Ostmark . Italian forces were limited to air and artillery attacks until 11 April , when the Italian army attacked towards Ljubljana ( in modern-day Slovenia ) and through Istria and Lika and down the Dalmatian coast . On the same day , Hungarian forces entered Yugoslav Ba\u010dka and Baranya , but like the Italians they faced practically no resistance . A Yugoslav attack into the northern parts of the Italian protectorate of Albania met with initial success , but was inconsequential due to the collapse of the rest of the Yugoslav forces . Scholars have proposed several theories for the Royal Yugoslav Army 's sudden collapse , including poor training and equipment , generals eager to secure a quick cessation of hostilities , and a sizeable Croatian nationalist fifth column . The invasion ended when an armistice was signed on 17 April 1941 , based on the unconditional surrender of the Yugoslav army , which came into effect at noon on 18 April . Yugoslavia was then occupied and partitioned by the Axis powers . Some areas of Yugoslavia were annexed by neighboring Axis countries , some areas remained occupied , and in other areas Axis puppet states such as the Independent State of Croatia ( Serbo-Croatian Latin : Nezavisna Dr\u017eava Hrvatska , or NDH ) were created during the invasion on 10 April .",

  "/wiki/Eagle_Squadron": "The Eagle Squadrons were three fighter squadrons of the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) formed with volunteer pilots from the United States during the early days of World War II ( circa 1940 ) , prior to America 's entry into the war in December 1941 . With the United States still neutral , many Americans simply crossed the border and joined the Royal Canadian Air Force ( RCAF ) to learn to fly and fight . Many early recruits had originally gone to Europe to fight for Finland against the Soviet Union in the Winter War . Some had been rejected by the United States Army Air Corps as lacking in intrinsic flying ability . Charles Sweeny , a wealthy businessman living in London , began recruiting American citizens to fight as a US volunteer detachment in the French Air Force , echoing the Lafayette Escadrille of World War I . Following the Fall of France in 1940 , a dozen of these recruits joined the RAF . Sweeny 's efforts were also coordinated in Canada by the World War I air ace Billy Bishop and the artist Clayton Knight , who formed the Clayton Knight Committee , which by the time the United States entered the war , had processed and approved 6,700 applications from Americans to join the RCAF or RAF . Sweeny and his rich society contacts bore the cost ( over $ 100,000 ) of processing and sending the men to the United Kingdom for training .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Britain": "The Battle of Britain ( German : die Luftschlacht um England , the Air Battle for England ) was a military campaign of the Second World War , in which the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) defended the United Kingdom ( UK ) against large-scale attacks by Nazi Germany 's air force , the Luftwaffe . It has been described as the first major military campaign fought entirely by air forces . The British officially recognise the battle 's duration as being from 10 July until 31 October 1940 , which overlaps the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz , that lasted from 7 September 1940 to 11 May 1941 . German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard the battle as a single campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941 , including the Blitz . The primary objective of the German forces was to compel Britain to agree to a negotiated peace settlement . In July 1940 , the air and sea blockade began , with the Luftwaffe mainly targeting coastal-shipping convoys , ports and shipping centres , such as Portsmouth . On 1 August , the Luftwaffe was directed to achieve air superiority over the RAF with the aim of incapacitating RAF Fighter Command ; 12 days later , it shifted the attacks to RAF airfields and infrastructure . As the battle progressed , the Luftwaffe also targeted factories involved in aircraft production and strategic infrastructure . Eventually , it employed terror bombing on areas of political significance and on civilians . [ nb 9 ] The Germans had rapidly overwhelmed France and the Low Countries , leaving Britain to face the threat of invasion by sea . The German high command knew the difficulties of a seaborne attack and its impracticality while the Royal Navy controlled the English Channel and the North Sea . [ page needed ] On 16 July , Adolf Hitler ordered the preparation of Operation Sea Lion as a potential amphibious and airborne assault on Britain , to follow once the Luftwaffe had air superiority over the UK .",

  "/wiki/The_First_of_the_Few": "The First of the Few ( US title Spitfire ) is a 1942 British black-and-white biographical film produced and directed by Leslie Howard , who stars as R. J. Mitchell , the designer of the Supermarine Spitfire fighter aircraft . David Niven co-stars as a Royal Air Force officer and test pilot , a composite character that represents the pilots who flew Mitchell 's seaplanes and tested the Spitfire . The film depicts Mitchell 's strong work ethic in designing the Spitfire and his death . The film 's title alludes to Winston Churchill 's speech describing Battle of Britain aircrew , subsequently known as the Few : Never was so much owed by so many to so few . Leslie Howard 's portrayal of Mitchell has a special significance since Howard was killed when the Lisbon-to-London civilian airliner in which he was travelling was shot down by the Luftwaffe on 1 June 1943 . His death occurred only days before The First of the Few was released in the United States on 12 June 1943 , under the alternate title of Spitfire .",

He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for Berkeley Square and Pygmalion . Howard 's World War II activities included acting and filmmaking . He was active in anti-German propaganda and rumoured to have been involved with British or Allied Intelligence , sparking conspiracy theories regarding his death in 1943 when the Luftwaffe shot down BOAC Flight 777 over the Bay of Biscay ( in Cedeira , A Coru\u00f1a ) , on which he was a passenger .",
  "/wiki/Supermarine_Spitfire": "The Supermarine Spitfire is a British single-seat fighter aircraft that was used by the Royal Air Force and other Allied countries before , during , and after World War II . Many variants of the Spitfire were built , using several wing configurations , and it was produced in greater numbers than any other British aircraft . It was also the only British fighter produced continuously throughout the war . The Spitfire continues to be popular among enthusiasts ; nearly 60 remain airworthy , and many more are static exhibits in aviation museums throughout the world . The Spitfire was designed as a short-range , high-performance interceptor aircraft by R. J. Mitchell , chief designer at Supermarine Aviation Works , which operated as a subsidiary of Vickers-Armstrong from 1928 . Mitchell pushed the Spitfire 's distinctive elliptical wing with cutting-edge sunken rivets ( designed by Beverley Shenstone ) to have the thinnest possible cross-section , helping give the aircraft a higher top speed than several contemporary fighters , including the Hawker Hurricane . Mitchell continued to refine the design until his death in 1937 , whereupon his colleague Joseph Smith took over as chief designer , overseeing the Spitfire 's development through its multitude of variants . During the Battle of Britain , from July to October 1940 , the public perceived the Spitfire to be the main RAF fighter , though the more numerous Hurricane shouldered a greater proportion of the burden against Nazi Germany 's air force , the Luftwaffe . However , Spitfire units had a lower attrition rate and a higher victory-to-loss ratio than those flying Hurricanes because of the Spitfire 's higher performance . During the battle , Spitfires were generally tasked with engaging Luftwaffe fighters - mainly Messerschmitt Bf 109E-series aircraft , which were a close match for them . After the Battle of Britain , the Spitfire superseded the Hurricane to become the backbone of RAF Fighter Command , and saw action in the European , Mediterranean , Pacific , and South-East Asian theatres . Much loved by its pilots , the Spitfire served in several roles , including interceptor , photo-reconnaissance , fighter-bomber , and trainer , and it continued to serve in these roles until the 1950s .",

  "/wiki/B-17_Flying_Fortress": "The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress is a four-engined heavy bomber developed in the 1930s for the United States Army Air Corps ( USAAC ) . Competing against Douglas and Martin for a contract to build 200 bombers , the Boeing entry ( prototype Model 299/XB-17 ) outperformed both competitors and exceeded the air corps ' performance specifications . Although Boeing lost the contract ( to the Douglas B-18 Bolo ) because the prototype crashed , the air corps ordered 13 more B-17s for further evaluation . From its introduction in 1938 , the B-17 Flying Fortress evolved through numerous design advances , becoming the third-most produced bomber of all time , behind the four-engined B-24 and the multirole , twin-engined Ju 88 . The B-17 was primarily employed by the USAAF in the daylight strategic bombing campaign of World War II against German industrial and military targets . The United States Eighth Air Force , based at many airfields in central , eastern and southern England , and the Fifteenth Air Force , based in Italy , complemented the RAF Bomber Command 's nighttime area bombing in the Combined Bomber Offensive to help secure air superiority over the cities , factories and battlefields of Western Europe in preparation for the invasion of France in 1944 . The B-17 also participated to a lesser extent in the War in the Pacific , early in World War II , where it conducted raids against Japanese shipping and airfields . From its prewar inception , the USAAC ( by June 1941 , the USAAF ) promoted the aircraft as a strategic weapon ; it was a relatively fast , high-flying , long-range bomber with heavy defensive armament at the expense of bombload . It developed a reputation for toughness based upon stories and photos of badly damaged B-17s safely returning to base . The B-17 dropped more bombs than any other U.S. aircraft in World War II . Of approximately 1.5 million tons of bombs dropped on Nazi Germany and its occupied territories by U.S. aircraft , over 640,000 tons were dropped from B-17s . In addition to its role as a bomber , the B-17 was also employed as a transport , antisubmarine aircraft , drone controller , and search-and-rescue aircraft ."
