By 1890 , Parwan had a platform , goods shed , a 20-lever interlocked signal box and a three road yard . In 1920 , the crossing loop at the Up end of the station was extended , and became known as Works Siding . The Ballast Siding became the new main running line in September 1922 , and the old main line became a siding , which closed in early 1923 . Automatic staff exchangers were provided around May 1927 . A new station building was erected on in 1948 , along with a new signal frame . During 1983 , the dead-end siding at the Up end of No.2 track was shortened to 110m , and work commenced on extending the loop , as part of the CTC signalling system , which was being introduced on the Serviceton line . The former Works Siding was also discontinued in the same year , after a derailment involving passenger train The Overland .
