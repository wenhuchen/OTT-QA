The F/A-18E single-seat and F/A-18F tandem-seat variants are larger and more advanced derivatives of the F/A-18C and D Hornet . The Super Hornet has an internal 20 mm M61 rotary cannon and can carry air-to-air missiles and air-to-surface weapons . Additional fuel can be carried in up to five external fuel tanks and the aircraft can be configured as an airborne tanker by adding an external air refueling system . Designed and initially produced by McDonnell Douglas , the Super Hornet first flew in 1995 . Low-rate production began in early 1997 with full-rate production starting in September 1997 , after the merger of McDonnell Douglas and Boeing the previous month . The Super Hornet entered service with the United States Navy in 2001 , replacing the Grumman F-14 Tomcat , which was retired in 2006 ; the Super Hornet serves alongside the original Hornet . The Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) , which has operated the F/A-18A as its main fighter since 1984 , ordered the F/A-18F in 2007 to replace its aging F-111C fleet . RAAF Super Hornets entered service in December 2010 .",

  "/wiki/E-2_Hawkeye": "The Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye is an American all-weather , carrier-capable tactical airborne early warning ( AEW ) aircraft . This twin-turboprop aircraft was designed and developed during the late 1950s and early 1960s by the Grumman Aircraft Company for the United States Navy as a replacement for the earlier , piston-engined E-1 Tracer , which was rapidly becoming obsolete . The aircraft 's performance has been upgraded with the E-2B , and E-2C versions , where most of the changes were made to the radar and radio communications due to advances in electronic integrated circuits and other electronics . The fourth major version of the Hawkeye is the E-2D , which first flew in 2007 . The E-2 was the first aircraft designed specifically for its role , as opposed to a modification of an existing airframe , such as the Boeing E-3 Sentry . Variants of the Hawkeye have been in continuous production since 1960 , giving it the longest production run of any carrier-based aircraft . The E-2 also received the nickname Super Fudd because it replaced the WF ( later E-1 ) Willy Fudd . In recent decades , the E-2 has been commonly referred to as the Hummer because of the distinctive sounds of its turboprop engines , quite unlike that of turbojet and turbofan jet engines . In addition to U.S. Navy service , smaller numbers of E-2s have been sold to the armed forces of Egypt , France , Israel , Japan , Mexico , Singapore , and Taiwan .",
