  "/wiki/Music_recording_sales_certification": "Music recording certification is a system of certifying that a music recording has shipped , sold , or streamed a certain number of units . The threshold quantity varies by type ( such as album , single , music video ) and by nation or territory ( see List of music recording certifications ) . Almost all countries follow variations of the RIAA certification categories , which are named after precious materials ( gold , platinum and diamond ) . The threshold required for these awards depends upon the population of the territory where the recording is released . Typically , they are awarded only to international releases and are awarded individually for each country where the album is sold . Different sales levels , some perhaps 10 times lower than others , may exist for different music media ( for example : videos versus albums , singles , or music download ) .",
  "/wiki/List_of_music_recording_certifications": "Music recording certifications are typically awarded by the worldwide music industry based on the total units sold , streamed , or shipped to retailers . These awards and their requirements are defined by the various certifying bodies representing the music industry in various countries and territories worldwide . The standard certification awards given consist of Gold , Platinum , and sometimes Diamond awards , in ascending order ; the UK also has a Silver certification , ranking below Gold . In most cases , a Multi-Platinum or Multi-Diamond award is given for multiples of the Platinum or Diamond requirements . Many music industries around the world are represented by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) . The IFPI operates in 66 countries and services affiliated industry associations in 45 countries . In some cases , the IFPI is merely affiliated with the already operational certification bodies of a country , but in many countries with lesser-developed industries , the IFPI acts as the sole certifying body servicing the country or region 's music industry . Still other countries not represented by the IFPI have certifying bodies operating independently , such as individual record companies which service the country or region 's music industry as a whole . Though all certifying bodies give awards for album sales or shipments , many also certify singles , paid digital downloads , streaming media , music videos , music DVDs , and master ringtones . Additionally , some certifying bodies have separate threshold scales for works of domestic or international origins , varying genres , lengths , and formats . From the 2010s digital streaming was included in some territories .",

  "/wiki/Rock_and_roll": "Rock and roll ( often written as rock & roll , rock ' n ' roll or rock ' n roll ) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s from musical styles such as gospel , jump blues , jazz , boogie woogie , rhythm and blues , and country music . While elements of what was to become rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s , the genre did not acquire its name until 1954 . According to Greg Kot , rock and roll refers to a style of popular music originating in the U.S. in the 1950s prior to its development by the mid-1960s into the more encompassing international style known as rock music , though the latter also continued to be known as rock and roll . For the purpose of differentiation , this article deals with the first definition . In the earliest rock and roll styles , either the piano or saxophone was typically the lead instrument , but these instruments were generally replaced or supplemented by guitar in the middle to late 1950s . The beat is essentially a dance rhythm with an accentuated backbeat , which is almost always provided by a snare drum . Classic rock and roll is usually played with one or two electric guitars ( one lead , one rhythm ) , a double bass or string bass or ( after the mid-1950s ) an electric bass guitar , and a drum kit . Beyond simply a musical style , rock and roll , as seen in movies , in fan magazines , and on television , influenced lifestyles , fashion , attitudes , and language . In addition , rock and roll may have contributed to the civil rights movement because both African-American and white American teenagers enjoyed the music . It went on to spawn various genres , often without the initially characteristic backbeat , that are now more commonly called rock music or simply rock .",

  "/wiki/Led_Zeppelin": "Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968 . The group consisted of vocalist Robert Plant , guitarist Jimmy Page , bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones , and drummer John Bonham . With their heavy , guitar-driven sound , they are regularly cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal , although their style drew from a variety of influences , including blues and folk music . After changing their name from the New Yardbirds , Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that afforded them considerable artistic freedom . Although the group were initially unpopular with critics , they achieved significant commercial success with eight studio albums released over ten years , from Led Zeppelin ( 1969 ) to In Through the Out Door ( 1979 ) . Their untitled fourth studio album , commonly known as Led Zeppelin IV ( 1971 ) , and featuring the song Stairway to Heaven , is among the most popular and influential works in rock music , and helped to secure the group 's popularity . Page wrote most of Led Zeppelin 's music , particularly early in their career , while Plant generally supplied the lyrics . Jones 's keyboard-based compositions later became central to the group 's catalogue , which featured increasing experimentation . The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery . Although they remained commercially and critically successful , their output and touring schedule were limited during the late 1970s , and the group disbanded following Bonham 's death from alcohol-related asphyxia in 1980 . In the decades that followed , the former members sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off Led Zeppelin reunions . The most successful of these was the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in London , with Bonham 's son Jason Bonham on drums .",
  "/wiki/Led_Zeppelin_IV": "The untitled fourth studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin , commonly known as Led Zeppelin IV , was released on 8 November 1971 by Atlantic Records . It was produced by guitarist Jimmy Page and recorded between December 1970 and February 1971 , mostly in the country house Headley Grange . The album is notable for featuring Stairway to Heaven , which has been described as the band 's signature song . The informal setting at Headley Grange inspired the band , and allowed them to try different arrangements of material and create songs in a variety of styles . After the band 's previous album Led Zeppelin III received lukewarm reviews from critics , they decided their fourth album would officially be untitled , and would be represented instead by four symbols chosen by each band member , without featuring the name or any other details on the cover . Unlike the prior two albums , the band was joined by some guest musicians . Joining Robert Plant ( vocals ) , Jimmy Page ( guitar ) , John Paul Jones ( bass , multi-instrumentalist ) , and John Bonham ( drums ) were Fairport Convention vocalist Sandy Denny on The Battle of Evermore , and Rolling Stones pianist Ian Stewart on Rock and Roll . As with prior albums , most of the material was written by the band , though there was one cover song , a hard rock re-interpretation of the Memphis Minnie blues song When the Levee Breaks . The album was a commercial and critical success and is Led Zeppelin 's best-selling , shipping over 37 million copies worldwide . It is one of the best-selling albums in the US , while critics have regularly placed it highly on lists of the greatest albums of all time .",
  "/wiki/Hard_rock": "Hard rock , a loosely-defined subgenre of rock music , began in the mid-1960s with the garage , psychedelic and blues rock movements . It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals , distorted electric guitars , bass guitar , and drums , often accompanied with keyboards . Hard rock developed into a major form of popular music in the 1970s , with bands such as the Who , Boston , Led Zeppelin , Deep Purple , Aerosmith , Kiss , Queen , AC/DC and Van Halen . During the 1980s , some hard-rock bands moved away from their hard-rock roots and more towards pop rock , Established bands made a comeback in the mid-1980s and hard rock reached a commercial peak in the 1980s , with glam metal bands like Bon Jovi , and Def Leppard and the rawer sounds of Guns N ' Roses , which followed up with great success in the later part of that decade . Hard rock began losing popularity with the commercial success of R & B , hip-hop , urban pop , grunge and later Britpop in the 1990s . Despite this , many post-grunge bands adopted a hard-rock sound , and the 2000s saw a renewed interest in established bands , attempts at a revival , and new hard-rock bands that emerged from the garage rock and post-punk revival scenes . Out of this movement came garage rock bands like the White Stripes , the Strokes , Interpol and , later on , the Black Keys . In the 2000s only a few hard-rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers .",
  "/wiki/Heavy_metal_music": "Heavy metal ( or simply metal ) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s , largely in the United Kingdom and the United States . With roots in blues rock , psychedelic rock , and acid rock , the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick , massive sound , characterized by highly amplified distortion , extended guitar solos , emphatic beats , and overall loudness . The genre 's lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo . In 1968 , three of the genre 's most famous pioneers , Led Zeppelin , Black Sabbath and Deep Purple were founded . Though they came to attract wide audiences , they were often derided by critics . Following the blueprint laid down by Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath , several American bands modified heavy metal into more accessible forms during the 1970s : the raw , sleazy sound and outrageous stage shows of Alice Cooper and Kiss ; the blues-rooted rock of Aerosmith ; and the flashy guitar leads and wild party rock of Van Halen . During the mid-1970s , Judas Priest helped spur the genre 's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence ; Mot\u00f6rhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed . Beginning in the late 1970s , bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Def Leppard followed in a similar vein . Before the end of the decade , heavy metal fans became known as metalheads or headbangers . During the 1980s , glam metal became popular with groups such as Bon Jovi and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce . Underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles : thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica , Slayer , Megadeth , and Anthrax , while other extreme subgenres of heavy metal such as death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena . Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded the definition of the genre .",
  "/wiki/Folk_rock": "Folk rock is a hybrid music genre combining elements of folk music and rock music , which arose in the United States , Canada , and the United Kingdom in the mid-1960s . In the U.S. , folk rock emerged from the folk music revival and the influence that the Beatles and other British Invasion bands had on members of that movement . Performers such as Bob Dylan and the Byrds - several of whose members had earlier played in folk ensembles - attempted to blend the sounds of rock with their pre-existing folk repertoire , adopting the use of electric instrumentation and drums in a way previously discouraged in the U.S. folk community . The term folk rock was initially used in the U.S. music press in June 1965 to describe the Byrds ' music . The commercial success of the Byrds ' cover version of Dylan 's Mr. Tambourine Man and their debut album of the same name , along with Dylan 's own recordings with rock instrumentation - on the albums Bringing It All Back Home ( 1965 ) , Highway 61 Revisited ( 1965 ) , and Blonde on Blonde ( 1966 ) - encouraged other folk acts , such as Simon & Garfunkel , to use electric backing on their records and new groups , such as Buffalo Springfield , to form . Dylan 's controversial appearance at the Newport Folk Festival on 25 July 1965 , where he was backed by an electric band , was also a pivotal moment in the development of the genre . During the late 1960s in Britain and Europe , a distinct , eclectic British folk rock style was created by Pentangle , Fairport Convention and Alan Stivell . Inspired by British psychedelic folk and the North American style of folk rock , British folk rock bands began to incorporate elements of traditional British folk music into their repertoire , leading to other variants , including the overtly English folk rock of the Albion Band and Celtic rock .",

Dubbed the King of Pop , he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest entertainers in the history of music . Jackson 's contributions to music , dance , and fashion , along with his publicized personal life , made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades . His sound and style have influenced artists of various genres . The eighth child of the Jackson family , Jackson made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie , Tito , Jermaine , and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 . Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records , and rose to solo stardom with his fifth studio album Off the Wall ( 1979 ) . By the early 1980s , Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music . His music videos , including those for Beat It , Billie Jean , and Thriller from his sixth studio album Thriller ( 1982 ) , are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool . Their popularity helped propel the television channel MTV into a significant factor of 1980s pop culture . The album won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards at the 26th Grammy Awards , including Album of the Year . Jackson continued to innovate with videos including Leave Me Alone and Smooth Criminal from Bad ( 1987 ) , Black or White and Remember the Time from Dangerous ( 1991 ) , Scream from HIStory : Past , Present and Future , Book I ( 1995 ) and Ghosts from the remix album Blood on the Dance Floor : HIStory in the Mix ( 1997 ) .

The terms popular music and pop music are often used interchangeably , although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many diverse styles . Pop and rock were roughly synonymous terms until the late 1960s , when they became quite separated from each other . Although much of the music that appears on record charts is seen as pop music , the genre is distinguished from chart music . Pop music often borrows elements from other styles such as urban , dance , rock , Latin , and country ; nevertheless , there are many key elements that define pop music . Identifying factors usually include short to medium-length songs written in a basic format , also known as perrypoetry ( often the verse-chorus structure ) , as well as common use of repeated choruses , melodic tunes and hooks .",
  "/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues": "Rhythm and blues , commonly abbreviated as R & B , is a genre of popular music that originated in African American communities in the 1940s . The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans , at a time when urbane , rocking , jazz based music with a heavy , insistent beat was becoming more popular . In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s , the bands usually consisted of piano , one or two guitars , bass , drums , one or more saxophones , and sometimes background vocalists . R & B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy , as well as triumphs and failures in terms of relationships , economics , and aspirations . The term rhythm and blues has undergone a number of shifts in meaning . In the early 1950s , it was frequently applied to blues records . Starting in the mid-1950s , after this style of music contributed to the development of rock and roll , the term R & B became used to refer to music styles that developed from and incorporated electric blues , as well as gospel and soul music . In the 1960s , several British rock bands such as the Rolling Stones , the Who and the Animals were referred to and promoted as being R & B bands ; posters for the Who 's residency at the Marquee Club in 1964 contained the slogan , Maximum R & B . Their mix of rock and roll and R & B is now known as British rhythm and blues . By the 1970s , the term rhythm and blues changed again and was used as a blanket term for soul and funk . In the 1980s , a newer style of R & B developed , becoming known as contemporary R & B . It combines rhythm and blues with elements of pop , soul , funk , hip hop , and electronic music .",
  "/wiki/Funk": "Funk is a music genre that originated in African-American communities in the mid-1960s when African-American musicians created a rhythmic , danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music , psychedelic rock , jazz , and rhythm and blues ( R & B ) . Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions and focuses on a strong rhythmic groove of a bassline played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer , often at slower tempos than other popular music . Like much of African-inspired music , funk typically consists of a complex groove with rhythm instruments playing interlocking grooves that created a hypnotic and danceable feel . Funk uses the same richly colored extended chords found in bebop jazz , such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths , or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths and thirteenths . Funk originated in the mid-1960s , with James Brown 's development of a signature groove that emphasized the downbeat - with heavy emphasis on the first beat of every measure ( The One ) , and the application of swung 16th notes and syncopation on all basslines , drum patterns , and guitar riffs . Other musical groups , including Sly and the Family Stone , The Meters , and Parliament-Funkadelic , soon began to adopt and develop Brown 's innovations . Notable funk women include Chaka Khan , Marva Whitney , Lyn Collins , Brides of Funkenstein , Vicki Anderson , Anna King ( The JB 's singer ) , and Parlet . Funk derivatives include the psychedelic funk of Sly Stone and George Clinton ; the avant-funk of groups such as Talking Heads and the Pop Group ; boogie , a form of post-disco dance music ; electro music , a hybrid of electronic music and funk ; funk metal ( e.g. , Living Colour , Faith No More ) ; G-funk , a mix of gangsta rap and funk ; Timba , a form of funky Cuban popular dance music ; and funk jam . Funk samples and breakbeats have been used extensively in hip hop and various forms of electronic dance music , such as house music , and Detroit techno . It is also the main influence of go-go , a subgenre associated with funk .",
  "/wiki/Rock_music": "Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as rock and roll in the United States in the early 1950s , and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later , particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom . It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll , a style which drew heavily from the genres of blues , rhythm and blues , and from country music . Rock music also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk , and incorporated influences from jazz , classical and other musical styles . Musically , rock has centered on the electric guitar , usually as part of a rock group with electric bass , drums , and one or more singers . Usually , rock is song-based music with a 4/4 time signature using a verse-chorus form , but the genre has become extremely diverse . Like pop music , lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political . By the late 1960s classic rock period , a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged , including hybrids like blues rock , folk rock , country rock , southern rock , raga rock , and jazz-rock , many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock , which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene . New genres that emerged included progressive rock , which extended the artistic elements ; glam rock , which highlighted showmanship and visual style ; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal , which emphasized volume , power , and speed . In the second half of the 1970s , punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down , energetic social and political critiques . Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave , post-punk and eventually alternative rock . From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge , Britpop , and indie rock . Further fusion subgenres have since emerged , including pop punk , electronic rock , rap rock , and rap metal , as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock 's history , including the garage rock/post-punk and techno-pop revivals at the beginning of the 2000s .",

Morissette began work on the album after moving from her hometown , Ottawa , to Toronto ; she made little progress until she traveled to Los Angeles , where she met producer Glen Ballard . Morissette and Ballard had an instant connection and began co-writing and experimenting with sounds .

  "/wiki/Alternative_rock": "Alternative rock ( also called alternative music , alt-rock , alt-pop or simply alternative ) is a term used to categorize rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1970s and became widely popular in the 1980s . In this instance , the word alternative refers to the genre 's distinction from mainstream , or commercial rock or pop music . The term 's original meaning was broader , referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent , DIY ethos of punk rock , which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music . In September of 1988 , Billboard magazine introduced Alternative Songs into their charting system rather than continue incorporating these artists into the existing rock and pop charts . By then alternative had become a catch-all description for both successful artists ( e.g . U2 and R.E.M . ) , as well as music from underground , independent , or non-commercial rock artists that received some level of mainstream recognition . Although the genre evolved in the late 1970s and 1980s , music anticipating the sound of the genre can be found as early as the 1960s , with bands such as the Velvet Underground and artists such as Syd Barrett . Since the early 1990s the term has often been misused to market an artist 's image or music toward consumers seeking to distinguish their tastes from mainstream pop or rock music . Traditionally , alternative rock broadly consisted of music that differed greatly in terms of its sound , social context and regional roots . Throughout the 1980s , magazines and zines , college radio airplay , and word of mouth had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock , helping to define a number of distinct styles ( and music scenes ) such as noise pop , indie rock , grunge , and shoegaze . Most of these subgenres had achieved minor mainstream notice and a few bands , such as H\u00fcsker D\u00fc and R.E.M. , were signed to major labels .",

  "/wiki/New_jack_swing": "New jack swing or swingbeat is a fusion genre spearheaded by Teddy Riley and Bernard Belle that was popular from the mid-1980s into the early 1990s . The style originated from Janet Jackson 's third studio album , Control from 1986 . Its influence , along with hip hop , seeped into pop culture and was the definitive sound of the inventive New York club scene . It fuses the rhythms , samples , and production techniques of hip hop and dance-pop with the urban contemporary sound of R & B . The new jack swing style developed as many previous music styles did , by combining elements of older styles with newer sensibilities . It used R & B style vocals sung over hip hop and dance-pop style influenced instrumentation . The sound of new jack swing comes from the hip hop swing beats created by drum machine , and hardware samplers , which were popular during the Golden Age of Hip Hop , with contemporary R & B style singing . Merriam-Webster 's online dictionary defines new jack swing as pop music usually performed by black musicians that combines elements of jazz , funk , rap , and rhythm and blues . New jack swing did take up the trend of using sampled beats and tunes , and also created beats using the then-new SP-1200 sampler and the Roland TR-808 drum machine to lay an insistent beat under light melody lines and clearly enunciated vocals . The Roland TR-808 was sampled to create distinctive , syncopated , swung rhythms , with its snare sound being especially prominent . Two examples would be Groove Me by Guy which samples Funky President ( People It 's Bad ) , My Thang and The Champ as well as its own swing drums and Right or Wrong by Mind which fuses sharp drum reverb effects and a hidden looped sample of the Funky Drummer . The key producers were Timmy Gatling , Babyface & L.A. Reid , Bernard Belle , Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis , and Teddy Riley .",

Electronic influences are becoming an increasing trend and the use of hip hop or dance-inspired beats are typical , although the roughness and grit inherent in hip hop may be reduced and smoothed out . Contemporary R & B vocalists are often known for their use of melisma , popularized by vocalists such as Michael Jackson , R. Kelly , Craig David , Stevie Wonder , Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey . As of late , contemporary R & B rhythms are being combined with elements of hip-hop and pop music .",

With a line-up comprising John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison and Ringo Starr , they are regarded as the most influential band of all time .

Rooted in skiffle , beat and 1950s rock and roll , their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways ; the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock . As pioneers in recording , songwriting and artistic presentation , the group revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era 's youth and sociocultural movements . Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney , the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960 , initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass . The core trio of Lennon , McCartney and Harrison , together since 1958 , went through a succession of drummers , including Pete Best , before asking Starr to join them in 1962 . Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings , greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit , Love Me Do , in late 1962 .

Catchy rhythms , stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body moves , are an important feature of soul music . Other characteristics are a call and response between the lead vocalist and the chorus and an especially tense vocal sound . The style also occasionally uses improvisational additions , twirls and auxiliary sounds . Soul music reflected the African-American identity and it stressed the importance of an African-American culture . The new-found African-American consciousness led to new styles of music , which boasted pride in being black . Soul music dominated the U.S. R & B chart in the 1960s , and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the U.S. , Britain and elsewhere .

It borders Argentina to its west and Brazil to its north and east , with the R\u00edo de la Plata ( River of Silver ) to the south and the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast . Uruguay is home to an estimated 3.45 million people , of whom 1.8 million live in the metropolitan area of its capital and largest city , Montevideo . With an area of approximately 176,000 square kilometers ( 68,000 sq mi ) , Uruguay is geographically the second-smallest nation in South America , after Suriname . Uruguay was inhabited by the Charr\u00faa people for approximately 4,000 years before the Portuguese established Col\u00f3nia do Sacramento in 1680 ; Uruguay was colonized by Europeans relatively late compared with neighboring countries . Montevideo was founded as a military stronghold by the Spanish in the early 18th century , signifying the competing claims over the region . Uruguay won its independence between 1811 and 1828 , following a four-way struggle between Portugal and Spain , and later Argentina and Brazil . It remained subject to foreign influence and intervention throughout the 19th century , with the military playing a recurring role in domestic politics . A series of economic crises put an end to a democratic period that had begun in the early 20th century , culminating in a 1973 coup , which established a civic-military dictatorship . The military government persecuted leftists , socialists , and political opponents , resulting in several deaths and numerous instances of torture by the military ; the military relinquished power to a civilian government in 1985 . Uruguay is today a democratic constitutional republic , with a president who serves as both head of state and head of government . Uruguay is ranked first in Latin America in democracy , peace , low perception of corruption , e-government , and is first in South America when it comes to press freedom , size of the middle class and prosperity .",

Well-known disco artists include Donna Summer , Gloria Gaynor , the Bee Gees , Chic , KC and the Sunshine Band , Thelma Houston , Sister Sledge , the Trammps , Village People and Michael Jackson . While performers and singers garnered public attention , record producers working behind the scenes played an important role in developing the genre . Films such as Saturday Night Fever ( 1977 ) and Thank God It 's Friday ( 1978 ) contributed to disco 's mainstream popularity . Disco started as a mixture of music from venues popular with African Americans and also Hispanic and Latino Americans , and LGBT peoplein Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s . Disco can be seen as a reaction by the counterculture during this period to both the dominance of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music at the time . Several dance styles were developed during the period of disco 's popularity in the United States , including the Bump and the Hustle . By the late 70s , most major U.S. cities had thriving disco club scenes , and DJs would mix dance records at clubs such as Studio 54 in New York City , a venue popular among celebrities . Discoth\u00e8que-goers often wore expensive , extravagant and sexy fashions . There was also a thriving drug subculture in the disco scene , particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud music and the flashing lights , such as cocaine and Quaaludes , the latter being so common in disco subculture that they were nicknamed disco biscuits .",

Singapore is located about one degree ( 137 kilometres or 85 miles ) north of the equator , and is situated off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula , and by extension , the southernmost extremity of continental Asia . The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia 's Riau Islands , its northern , western , and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia , and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east . It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south , and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans , being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east . The country 's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets , the combined area of which has increased by almost 25% since the country 's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects . Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history , modern Singapore , then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate , was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles , a British colonial officer , established a trading post of the East India Company on the island . In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond . During the Second World War , Imperial Japan successfully invaded Singapore , resulting in an interregnum of British rule corresponding with a brief Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 .

  "/wiki/Blues_rock": "Blues rock is a fusion genre combining elements of blues and rock . It is mostly an electric ensemble-style music with instrumentation similar to electric blues and rock : electric guitar , electric bass guitar , and drums , sometimes with keyboards and harmonica . From its beginnings in the early- to mid-1960s , blues rock has gone through several stylistic shifts and along the way it inspired and influenced hard rock , Southern rock , and early heavy metal . Blues rock continues to be an influence in the 2010s , with performances and recordings by popular artists . Blues rock started with rock musicians in the UK and the US performing American blues songs . They typically recreated electric Chicago-style blues songs , such as those by Muddy Waters , Jimmy Reed , Howlin ' Wolf , and Albert King , at faster tempos and with a more aggressive sound common to rock . In the UK , the style was popularized by groups such as the Rolling Stones , the Yardbirds , and the Animals , who placed several blues songs into the pop charts . In the US , Lonnie Mack , the Paul Butterfield Blues Band , and Canned Heat were among the earliest exponents and later attempted to play long , involved improvisations which were commonplace on jazz records . John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers and Peter Green 's Fleetwood Mac also developed this more instrumental , but traditional-based style in the UK , while late 1960s and early 1970s groups , including Ten Years After , Savoy Brown , the Climax Blues Band and Foghat became more hard rock oriented . In the US , Johnny Winter , the Allman Brothers Band , and ZZ Top represented a hard rock trend . Along with hard rock , blues rock songs became the core of the music played on album-oriented rock radio , and later the classic rock format birthed in the 1980s . Although around this time , the differences between blues rock and hard rock lessened , there was also a return to more blues-influenced styles .",

  "/wiki/Film_score": "A film score is original music written specifically to accompany a film . The score forms part of the film 's soundtrack , which also usually includes pre-existing music , dialogue and sound effects , and comprises a number of orchestral , instrumental , or choral pieces called cues , which are timed to begin and end at specific points during the film in order to enhance the dramatic narrative and the emotional impact of the scene in question . Scores are written by one or more composers , under the guidance of , or in collaboration with , the film 's director or producer and are then usually performed by an ensemble of musicians - most often comprising an orchestra or band , instrumental soloists , and choir or vocalists - known as playback singers and recorded by a sound engineer . Film scores encompass an enormous variety of styles of music , depending on the nature of the films they accompany . The majority of scores are orchestral works rooted in Western classical music , but many scores are also influenced by jazz , rock , pop , blues , new-age and ambient music , and a wide range of ethnic and world music styles . Since the 1950s , a growing number of scores have also included electronic elements as part of the score , and many scores written today feature a hybrid of orchestral and electronic instruments . Since the invention of digital technology and audio sampling , many modern films have been able to rely on digital samples to imitate the sound of live instruments , and many scores are created and performed wholly by the composers themselves , by using music composition software , synthesizers , samplers , and MIDI controllers . Songs such as pop songs and rock songs are usually not considered part of the film 's score , [ citation needed ] although songs do also form part of the film 's soundtrack . Although some songs , especially in musicals , are based on thematic ideas from the score ( or vice versa ) , scores usually do not have lyrics , except for when sung by choirs or soloists as part of a cue . Similarly , pop songs which are needle dropped into a specific scene in film for added emphasis , or which are depicted as being part of the scenes ' background ( e.g. , a song playing on a character 's car radio ) , are not considered part of the score , although occasionally the score 's composer will write an original pop song based on their themes , such as James Horner 's My Heart Will Go On from Titanic , written for Celine Dion .",
  "/wiki/Metallica": "Metallica is an American heavy metal band . The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich , and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career . The band 's fast tempos , instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding big four bands of thrash metal , alongside Megadeth , Anthrax and Slayer . Metallica 's current lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich , longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo . Guitarist Dave Mustaine ( who went on to form Megadeth after being fired from the band ) and bassists Ron McGovney , Cliff Burton ( who died in a bus accident in Sweden in 1986 ) and Jason Newsted are former members of the band . Metallica earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and won critical acclaim with its first five albums . The band 's third album , Master of Puppets ( 1986 ) , was described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums . Its eponymous fifth album , Metallica ( 1991 ) , the band 's first to root predominantly in heavy metal , appealed to a more mainstream audience , achieving substantial commercial success and selling over 16 million copies in the United States to date , making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era . After experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent releases , the band returned to its thrash metal roots with the release of its ninth album , Death Magnetic ( 2008 ) , which drew similar praise to that of the band 's earlier albums . In 2000 , Metallica led the case against the peer-to-peer file sharing service Napster , in which the band and several other artists filed lawsuits against the service for sharing their copyright-protected material without consent ; after reaching a settlement , Napster became a pay-to-use service in 2003 . Metallica was the subject of the acclaimed 2004 documentary film Metallica : Some Kind of Monster , which documented the troubled production of the band 's eighth album , St. Anger ( 2003 ) , and the internal struggles within the band at the time .

  "/wiki/Nirvana_(band)": "Nirvana was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen , Washington in 1987 . It was founded by lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic . Nirvana went through a succession of drummers , the longest-lasting and best-known being Dave Grohl , who joined in 1990 . Though the band dissolved in 1994 after the death of Cobain , their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern rock and roll culture . In the late 1980s , Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene , releasing its first album , Bleach , for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989 . They developed a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts , often between quiet verses and loud , heavy choruses . After signing to major label DGC Records in 1991 , Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with Smells Like Teen Spirit , the first single from their landmark second album Nevermind ( 1991 ) . A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s , the album went on to be certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . Nirvana 's sudden success popularized alternative rock , and Cobain found himself described as the spokesman of a generation and Nirvana the flagship band of Generation X . Following extensive tours and the 1992 compilation album Incesticide and EP Hormoaning , Nirvana released their third studio album , In Utero ( 1993 ) , to critical acclaim and further chart success . Its abrasive , less mainstream sound challenged the band 's audience , and though less successful than Nevermind , it was a commercial success . Nirvana disbanded following the death of Cobain in 1994 .",
  "/wiki/Nevermind": "Nevermind is the second studio album by American rock band Nirvana , released on September 24 , 1991 , by DGC Records . A number of labels courted the band , but Nirvana ultimately signed with Geffen Records imprint DGC Records based upon repeated recommendations from Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth and their management company . Produced by Butch Vig , it was the band 's first release on the label , as well as the first to feature drummer Dave Grohl . The album cover , which shows a naked baby swimming with a U.S. dollar bill on a fishhook just out of his reach , is often considered as one of the most famous album covers in popular music . For the preparation of Nevermind , Cobain wrote a number of songs that were influenced by bands like The Melvins , R.E.M. , The Smithereens , and the Pixies . A key development was the single Sliver , released on Sub Pop in 1990 , which Cobain said was like a statement in a way . I had to write a pop song and release it on a single to prepare people for the next record . I wanted to write more songs like that . Despite the initial low commercial expectations , Nevermind became an unexpected breakout success . In January 1992 , it reached number one on the US Billboard 200 . The lead single Smells Like Teen Spirit was a critical success and peaked at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100 . Three other successful singles were produced : Come as You Are , Lithium , and In Bloom .",
  "/wiki/Grunge": "Grunge ( sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound ) is a rock music genre and subculture that emerged during the mid-1980s in the Pacific Northwest U.S. state of Washington , particularly in Seattle and nearby towns . The early grunge movement revolved around Seattle 's independent record label Sub Pop and the region 's underground music scene . The owners of Sub Pop marketed Northwestern punk rock shrewdly and the media was encouraged to describe it as grunge , which came to mean a punk and metal hybrid style of music . By the early 1990s its popularity had spread , with grunge bands appearing in California , then emerging in other parts of the United States and in Australia , building strong followings and signing major record deals . Grunge was commercially successful in the early to mid-1990s , due to releases such as Nirvana 's Nevermind and In Utero , Pearl Jam 's Ten , Soundgarden 's Badmotorfinger , Alice in Chains ' Dirt , Stone Temple Pilots ' Core and Radiohead 's Pablo Honey . The success of these bands boosted the popularity of alternative rock and made grunge the most popular form of rock music at the time Although most grunge bands had disbanded or faded from view by the late 1990s , they influenced modern rock music , as their lyrics brought socially conscious issues into pop culture and added introspection and an exploration of what it means to be true to oneself . Grunge was also an influence on later genres such as post-grunge ( such as Creed and Nickelback ) and nu metal ( such as Korn and Limp Bizkit ) . Grunge fuses elements of punk rock and heavy metal , featuring the distorted electric guitar sound used in both genres , although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other . Like these genres , grunge typically uses electric guitar , bass guitar , drums and vocals . Grunge also incorporates influences from indie rock bands such as Sonic Youth . Lyrics are typically angst-filled and introspective , often addressing themes such as social alienation , self-doubt , abuse , neglect , betrayal , social and emotional isolation , psychological trauma and a desire for freedom . A number of factors contributed to grunge 's decline in prominence .",
  "/wiki/Pink_Floyd": "Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London in 1965 . Gaining a following as a psychedelic rock group , they were distinguished for their extended compositions , sonic experimentation , philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows , and became a leading band of the progressive rock genre . They are one of the most commercially successful and influential bands in popular music history . Pink Floyd were founded by students Syd Barrett ( guitar , lead vocals ) , Nick Mason ( drums ) , Roger Waters ( bass guitar , vocals ) , and Richard Wright ( keyboards , vocals ) . Under Barrett 's leadership , they released two charting singles and a successful debut album , The Piper at the Gates of Dawn ( 1967 ) . Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967 ; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health . Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader , devising the concepts behind the albums The Dark Side of the Moon ( 1973 ) , Wish You Were Here ( 1975 ) , Animals ( 1977 ) , The Wall ( 1979 ) , and The Final Cut ( 1983 ) . The band also composed several film scores . Following personal tensions , Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979 , followed by Waters in 1985 . Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd , rejoined later by Wright . The three produced two more albums - A Momentary Lapse of Reason ( 1987 ) and The Division Bell ( 1994 ) - and toured both albums before entering a long period of inactivity .

  "/wiki/The_Wall": "The Wall is the eleventh studio album by English rock band Pink Floyd , released 30 November 1979 on Harvest and Columbia Records . It is a rock opera that explores Pink , a jaded rockstar whose eventual self-imposed isolation from society is symbolized by a wall . The album was a commercial success , topping the US charts for 15 weeks , and reaching number three in the UK . It initially received mixed reviews from critics , many of whom found it overblown and pretentious , but later came to be considered one of the greatest albums of all time . Bassist Roger Waters conceived The Wall during Pink Floyd 's 1977 In The Flesh tour , modeling the character of Pink after himself and former bandmate Syd Barrett . Recording spanned from December 1978 to November 1979 . Producer Bob Ezrin helped to refine the concept and bridge tensions during recording , as the band were struggling with personal and financial issues at the time . The Wall is the last album to feature Pink Floyd as a quartet ; keyboardist Richard Wright was fired by Waters during production , but stayed on as a salaried musician . Three singles were issued from the album : Another Brick in the Wall , Part 2 ( the band 's only US number-one single ) , Run Like Hell , and Comfortably Numb . From 1980 to 1981 , Pink Floyd performed the full album on a tour that featured elaborate theatrical effects . The Wall was adapted into a 1982 feature film of the same name and remains one of the best-known concept albums . The album has sold more than 24 million copies , is the second best-selling in the band 's catalog , and is one of the best-selling of all time .",
  "/wiki/Progressive_rock": "Progressive rock ( shortened as prog ; sometimes called art rock , classical rock or symphonic rock ) is a broad genre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid- to late 1960s . Initially termed progressive pop , the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz , folk , or classical music . Additional elements contributed to its progressive label : lyrics were more poetic , technology was harnessed for new sounds , music approached the condition of art , and the studio , rather than the stage , became the focus of musical activity , which often involved creating music for listening rather than dancing . Prog is based on fusions of styles , approaches and genres , involving a continuous move between formalism and eclecticism . Due to its historical reception , prog 's scope is sometimes limited to a stereotype of long solos , long albums , fantasy lyrics , grandiose stage sets and costumes , and an obsessive dedication to technical skill . While the genre is often cited for its merging of high culture and low culture , few artists incorporated literal classical themes in their work to any great degree , and only a handful of groups purposely emulated or referenced classical music . The genre coincided with the mid-1960s economic boom that allowed record labels to allocate more creative control to their artists , as well as the new journalistic division between pop and rock that lent generic significance to both terms . Prog saw a high level of popularity in the early-to-mid-1970s , but faded soon after . Conventional wisdom holds that the rise of punk rock caused this , but several more factors contributed to the decline . Music critics , who often labelled the concepts as pretentious and the sounds as pompous and overblown , tended to be hostile towards the genre or to completely ignore it . After the late 1970s , progressive rock fragmented in numerous forms . Some bands achieved commercial success well into the 1980s ( albeit with changed lineups and more compact song structures ) or crossed into symphonic pop , arena rock , or new wave ."
