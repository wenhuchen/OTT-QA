It shares land borders with Montenegro to the northwest , Kosovo [ a ] to the northeast , North Macedonia to the east , Greece to the south and maritime borders with Greece , Montenegro and Italy to the west . Geographically , the country displays varied climatic , geological , hydrological and morphological conditions , defined in an area of 28,748 km2 ( 11,100 sq mi ) . It possesses remarkable diversity with the landscape ranging from the snow-capped mountains in the Albanian Alps as well as the Korab , Skanderbeg , Pindus and Ceraunian Mountains to the hot and sunny coasts of the Albanian Adriatic and Ionian Sea along the Mediterranean Sea . Historically , the country has been inhabited by numerous civilisations such as the Illyrians , Thracians , Ancient Greeks , Romans , Byzantines , Venetians and Ottomans . The Albanians established the autonomous Principality of Arb\u00ebr in the 12th century . The Kingdom of Albania and Principality of Albania formed between the 13th and 14th centuries . Prior to the Ottoman conquest of Albania in the 15th century , the Albanian resistance to Ottoman expansion into Europe led by Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg won them acclaim over most of Europe . Between the 18th and 19th centuries , Albanians gathered both spiritual and intellectual strength which conclusively led to the Albanian Renaissance . After the defeat of the Ottomans in the Balkan Wars , the modern nation state of Albania declared independence in 1912 . In the 20th century , the Kingdom of Albania was invaded by Italy which formed Greater Albania before becoming a protectorate of Nazi Germany . Enver Hoxha formed Communist Albania after the Second World War and launched the Albanians on a path of oppression and decades of isolation .",

With about 7.5 million speakers , it comprises an independent branch within the Indo-European languages and is not closely related to any other language . First attested in the 15th century , it is the last Indo-European branch to appear in written records . This is one of the reasons why its still-unknown origin has long been a matter of dispute among linguists and historians . Albanian is considered to be the descendant of one of the Paleo-Balkan languages of antiquity . For more historical and geographical reasons than specifically linguistic ones , there are various modern historians and linguists who believe that the Albanian language may have descended from a southern Illyrian dialect spoken in much the same region in classical times . Alternative hypotheses hold that Albanian may have descended from Thracian or Daco-Moesian , other ancient languages spoken farther east than Illyrian . Not enough is known of these languages to completely prove or disprove the various hypotheses . The two main Albanian dialects , Gheg and Tosk which are primarily distinguished by phonological differences , are mutually intelligible , with Gheg spoken in the north and Tosk spoken in the south of the Shkumbin river . Their characteristics in the treatment of the native and loanwords from other languages , have led to the conclusion that the dialectal split occurred after Christianisation of the region ( 4th century AD ) and at the time of the Slavic migration to the Balkans , with the historic boundary between Gheg and Tosk being the Shkumbin which straddled the Jire\u010dek line . Standard Albanian is a standardised form of spoken Albanian based on the Tosk dialect . It is the official language of Albania and Kosovo [ a ] and a co-official language in North Macedonia as well as a minority language of Italy , Montenegro , Romania and Serbia .",

Due to developments in the Macedonian Front of World War I the city of Kor\u00e7\u00eb came under French control ( 1916-20 ) . During this time 14 representatives of Kor\u00e7\u00eb and French Colonel Descoins signed a protocol that proclaimed the Autonomous Albanian Republic of Kor\u00e7\u00eb under the military protection of the French army and with Themistokli G\u00ebrmenji as Prefect of Police . The new authorities introduced Albanian and French as the official language and replaced Greek schools with Albanian ones , which were forbidden during the Greek administration of the city . There was also a French school in Kor\u00e7\u00eb and one of its many students was Enver Hoxha , who was an apprentice ( 1927 - 1930 ) and then teacher ( 1937 - 1939 ) there .

Believed to have been created by Charlemagne , Andorra was ruled by the count of Urgell until 988 , when it was transferred to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell . The present principality was formed by a charter in 1278 . It is known as a principality as it is a diarchy headed by two princes : the Catholic bishop of Urgell in Catalonia , Spain , and the president of the French Republic . Andorra is the sixth-smallest nation in Europe , having an area of 468 square kilometres ( 181 sq mi ) and a population of approximately 77,006 . The Andorran people are a Romance ethnic group of originally Catalan descent . Andorra is the 16th-smallest country in the world by land and the 11th-smallest by population . Its capital , Andorra la Vella , is the highest capital city in Europe , at an elevation of 1,023 metres ( 3,356 feet ) above sea level . The official language is Catalan , but Spanish , Portuguese , and French are also commonly spoken . Tourism in Andorra sees an estimated 10.2 million visitors annually .

However the origins of the name Hayastan trace back to much earlier dates and were first attested in circa 5th century in the works of Agathangelos , Faustus of Byzantium , Ghazar Parpetsi , Koryun , and Sebeos . The name has traditionally been derived from Hayk ( \u0540\u0561\u0575\u056f ) , the legendary patriarch of the Armenians and a great-great-grandson of Noah , who , according to the 5th-century AD author Moses of Chorene ( Movsis Khorenatsi ) , defeated the Babylonian king Bel in 2492 BC and established his nation in the Ararat region . The further origin of the name is uncertain . It is also further postulated that the name Hay comes from one of the two confederated , Hittite vassal states - the \u1e2aaya\u0161a-Azzi ( 1600-1200 BC ) .

Its institutional organization is complex and is structured on both regional and linguistic grounds . It is divided into three highly autonomous regions : the Flemish Region in the north , Wallonia in the south , and the Brussels-Capital Region . Brussels is the smallest and most densely populated region , as well as the richest region in terms of GDP per capita . Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups or communities : the Dutch-speaking Flemish Community , which constitutes about 60 percent of the population , and the French-speaking Community , which comprises about 40 percent of all Belgians . A small German-speaking Community , numbering around one percent , exists in the East Cantons .

Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders .

The Walloon Region was not merged with the French Community of Belgium , which is the political entity responsible for matters related mainly to culture and education , because the French Community of Belgium encompasses both Wallonia and the majority French-Speaking Brussels-Capital Region . The German-speaking minority in eastern Wallonia results from World War I and the subsequent annexation of three cantons that were initially part of the former German empire . This community represents less than 1% of the Belgian population . It forms the German-speaking Community of Belgium , which has its own government and parliament for culture-related issues . During the industrial revolution , Wallonia was second only to the United Kingdom in industrialization , capitalizing on its extensive deposits of coal and iron . This brought the region wealth , and from the beginning of the 19th to the middle of the 20th century , Wallonia was the more prosperous half of Belgium . Since World War II , the importance of heavy industry has greatly diminished , and the Flemish Region surpassed Wallonia in wealth , as Wallonia declined economically .

The second colonial empire came to an end after the loss in later wars of Indochina ( 1954 ) and Algeria ( 1962 ) , and relatively peaceful decolonization elsewhere after 1960 . The main competition included Spain , Portugal , the Dutch United Provinces and later Kingdom of Britain . France began to establish colonies in North America , the Caribbean and India in the 17th century . A series of wars with Britain and others resulted in France losing nearly all of its conquests by 1814 . France rebuilt a new empire mostly after 1850 , concentrating chiefly in Africa as well as Indochina and the South Pacific . Republicans , at first hostile to empire , only became supportive when Germany after 1880 started to build its own colonial empire . As it developed , the new French empire took on roles of trade with the motherland , supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items . Rebuilding an empire rebuilt French prestige , especially regarding international power and spreading the French language and the Catholic religion . It also provided manpower in the World Wars .

The capital and largest city is Sofia ; other major cities are Plovdiv , Varna and Burgas . With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres ( 42,855 sq mi ) , Bulgaria is Europe 's 16th-largest country . One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture , which dates back to 6,500 BC . In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for Thracians , Persians , Celts and ancient Macedonians ; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45 . The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries . The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State .",

The July 2019 population estimate by the United Nations was 20,321,378 . The countrys official language of government and business is French . Roughly 50% of the population speaks the Mossi language natively . Formerly called the Republic of Upper Volta ( 1958-1984 ) , the country was renamed Burkina Faso on 4 August 1984 by then-President Thomas Sankara .

It is bordered by Rwanda to the north , Tanzania to the east and southeast , and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west ; Lake Tanganyika lies along its southwestern border . The capital is Bujumbura . The Twa , Hutu and Tutsi peoples have lived in Burundi for at least 500 years . For more than 200 of those years , Burundi was an independent kingdom , until the beginning of the 20th century , when Germany colonised the region . After the First World War and Germany 's defeat , it ceded the territory to Belgium . Both Germans and Belgians ruled Burundi and Rwanda as a European colony known as Ruanda-Urundi . Despite common misconceptions , Burundi and Rwanda had never been under common rule until the time of European colonisation . Burundi gained independence in 1962 and initially had a monarchy , but a series of assassinations , coups and a general climate of regional instability culminated in the establishment of a republic and one-party state in 1966 . Bouts of ethnic cleansing and ultimately two civil wars and genocides during the 1970s and again in the 1990s left the economy undeveloped and the population as one of the world 's poorest . The presidents of Rwanda and Burundi , both Hutus , died together when their aeroplane was shot down in April 1994 . 2015 witnessed large-scale political strife as President Pierre Nkurunziza opted to run for a third term in office , a coup attempt failed and the country 's parliamentary and presidential elections were broadly criticised by members of the international community .",

By the same law on languages promulgated in 2014 Kiswahili is mentioned as a fourth language spoken and taught in the country . Of these , only Kirundi is spoken by the vast majority of the population . It is recognised as the national language by the Burundian constitution of 2005 . French is spoken by a significant minority and is spoken mainly as a second language , as a French pidgin , or by foreign residents of the country . Burundi is unusual among African states in having a single indigenous language shared by its entire population . In one estimate , 98 percent of Burundians speak Kirundi . Under Belgian colonial rule ( 1919-62 ) , Kirundi was taught whereas under German rule ( 1894-1916 ) Swahili had been encouraged . In recent years , the Burundian government has promoted the use of Kirundi language as way to unify the country 's different ethnic groups . The country is considered part of Francophonie . As a legacy of Belgian colonial rule , French has an important role in government , business , and the educated classes but only between 3 and 10 percent of the population speak the language fluently . Burundian vernacular French also frequently incorporates loanwords from Kirundi , Lingala and other languages .",

Cambodia 's minority groups include Vietnamese , Chinese , Chams and 30 hill tribes . The capital and largest city is Phnom Penh , the political , economic and cultural centre of Cambodia . The kingdom is an elective constitutional monarchy with a monarch , currently Norodom Sihamoni , chosen by the Royal Council of the Throne as head of state . The head of government is the Prime Minister , currently Hun Sen , the longest serving non-royal leader in Southeast Asia , ruling Cambodia since 1985 . In 802 AD , Jayavarman II declared himself king , uniting the warring Khmer princes of Chenla under the name Kambuja . This marked the beginning of the Khmer Empire , which flourished for over 600 years , allowing successive kings to control and exert influence over much of Southeast Asia and accumulate immense power and wealth . The Indianised kingdom facilitated the spread of first Hinduism and then Buddhism to much of Southeast Asia and undertook many religious infrastructural projects throughout the region , including the construction of more than 1,000 temples and monuments in Angkor alone .

The more colloquial registers have influenced , and have been influenced by , Thai , Lao , Vietnamese , and Cham , all of which , due to geographical proximity and long-term cultural contact , form a sprachbund in peninsular Southeast Asia . It is also the earliest recorded and earliest written language of the Mon-Khmer family , predating Mon and by a significant margin Vietnamese , due to Old Khmer being the language of the historical empires of Chenla , Angkor and , presumably , their earlier predecessor state , Funan . The vast majority of Khmer speakers speak Central Khmer , the dialect of the central plain where the Khmer are most heavily concentrated . Within Cambodia , regional accents exist in remote areas but these are regarded as varieties of Central Khmer . Two exceptions are the speech of the capital , Phnom Penh , and that of the Khmer Khe in Stung Treng province , both of which differ sufficiently enough from Central Khmer to be considered separate dialects of Khmer . Outside of Cambodia , three distinct dialects are spoken by ethnic Khmers native to areas that were historically part of the Khmer Empire . The Northern Khmer dialect is spoken by over a million Khmers in the southern regions of Northeast Thailand and is treated by some linguists as a separate language .

Although Cameroon is not an ECOWAS member state , it is geographically and historically in West Africa with the Southern Cameroons which now form her Northwest and Southwest Regions having a strong West African history . The country is sometimes identified as West African and other times as Central African due to its strategic position at the crossroads between West and Central Africa . Cameroon is home to over 250 native languages spoken by nearly 20 million people . The official languages of the country are English and French . Early inhabitants of the territory included the Sao civilisation around Lake Chad and the Baka hunter-gatherers in the southeastern rainforest .

Its southern border with the United States , stretching some 8,891 kilometres ( 5,525 mi ) , is the world 's longest bi-national land border . Canada 's capital is Ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver .

  "/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada": "The provinces and territories of Canada are sub-national divisions within the geographical areas of Canada under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Constitution . In the 1867 Canadian Confederation , three provinces of British North America - New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , and the Province of Canada ( which upon Confederation was divided into Ontario and Quebec ) - were united to form a federated colony , becoming a sovereign nation in the next century . Over its history , Canada 's international borders have changed several times , and the country has grown from the original four provinces to the current ten provinces and three territories . Together , the provinces and territories make up the world 's second-largest country by area . The major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces receive their power and authority from the Constitution Act , 1867 ( formerly called the British North America Act , 1867 ) , whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the Parliament of Canada . The powers flowing from the Constitution Act are divided between the Government of Canada ( the federal government ) and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively . A change to the division of powers between the federal government and the provinces requires a constitutional amendment , whereas a similar change affecting the territories can be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada or government . In modern Canadian constitutional theory , the provinces are considered sovereign within certain areas based on the divisions of responsibility between the provincial and federal government within the Constitution Act 1867 , and each province thus has its own representative of the Canadian Crown , the lieutenant governor . The territories are not sovereign , but instead their authorities and responsibilities come directly from the federal level , and as a result , have a commissioner instead of a lieutenant governor .",

A distinction is generally made between the first colonial empire , that existed until 1814 , by which time most of it had been lost , and the second colonial empire , which began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830 . The second colonial empire came to an end after the loss in later wars of Indochina ( 1954 ) and Algeria ( 1962 ) , and relatively peaceful decolonization elsewhere after 1960 . The main competition included Spain , Portugal , the Dutch United Provinces and later Kingdom of Britain . France began to establish colonies in North America , the Caribbean and India in the 17th century . A series of wars with Britain and others resulted in France losing nearly all of its conquests by 1814 . France rebuilt a new empire mostly after 1850 , concentrating chiefly in Africa as well as Indochina and the South Pacific . Republicans , at first hostile to empire , only became supportive when Germany after 1880 started to build its own colonial empire . As it developed , the new French empire took on roles of trade with the motherland , supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items . Rebuilding an empire rebuilt French prestige , especially regarding international power and spreading the French language and the Catholic religion . It also provided manpower in the World Wars .

New Brunswick is 83% forested and less densely-populated than the rest of the Maritimes . Being relatively close to Europe , New Brunswick was among the first places in North America to be explored and settled by Europeans , starting with the French in the early 1600s , who displaced the indigenous Mi'kmaq , Maliseet , and the Passamaquoddy peoples . The French settlers were later displaced when the area became part of the British Empire . In 1784 , after an influx of refugees from the American Revolutionary War , the province was partitioned from Nova Scotia . In 1785 Saint John became Canada 's first incorporated city .

[ a ] The colony was located in what is now Eastern Canada 's Maritime provinces ( Nova Scotia , New Brunswick , and Prince Edward Island ) , as well as part of Quebec , and present-day Maine to the Kennebec River . Acadia was a distinctly separate colony of New France . It was geographically and administratively separate from the French colony of Canada ( modern-day Quebec ) . As a result , the Acadians and Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois developed two distinct histories and cultures . The settlers whose descendants became Acadians came from many areas in France , but especially northern and central regions such as \u00cele-de-France , Normandy , Brittany , Poitou and Aquitaine . During the French and Indian War ( the North American theater of the Seven Years ' War ) , British colonial officers suspected that Acadians were aligned with France , after finding some Acadians fighting alongside French troops at Fort Beaus\u00e9jour . Though most Acadians remained neutral during the French and Indian War , the British , together with New England legislators and militia , carried out the Great Expulsion ( Le Grand D\u00e9rangement ) of the Acadians during the 1755-1764 period . They deported approximately 11,500 Acadians from the maritime region . Approximately one-third perished from disease and drowning .

It is bordered by Libya to the north , Sudan to the east , the Central African Republic to the south , Cameroon to the south-west , Nigeria to the southwest ( at Lake Chad ) , and Niger to the west . Chad has several regions : a desert zone in the north , an arid Sahelian belt in the centre and a more fertile Sudanian Savanna zone in the south . Lake Chad , after which the country is named , is the largest wetland in Chad and the second-largest in Africa . The capital N'Djamena is the largest city . Chad 's official languages are Arabic and French . Chad is home to over 200 different ethnic and linguistic groups . The most popular religion of Chad is Islam ( at 55% ) , followed by Christianity ( at 40% ) . Beginning in the 7th millennium BC , human populations moved into the Chadian basin in great numbers . By the end of the 1st millennium AD , a series of states and empires had risen and fallen in Chad 's Sahelian strip , each focused on controlling the trans-Saharan trade routes that passed through the region . France conquered the territory by 1920 and incorporated it as part of French Equatorial Africa . In 1960 , Chad obtained independence under the leadership of Fran\u00e7ois Tombalbaye .",

It was formerly called Zaire ( 1971-1997 ) . It is , by area , the largest country in sub-Saharan Africa , the second-largest in all of Africa ( after Algeria ) , and the 11th-largest in the world . With a population of over 84 million , the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most populous officially Francophone country , the fourth-most-populous country in Africa , and the 16th-most-populous country in the world . Eastern DR Congo has been the scene of ongoing military conflict in Kivu , since 2015 . Centred on the Congo Basin , the territory of the DRC was first inhabited by Central African foragers around 90,000 years ago and was reached by the Bantu expansion about 3,000 years ago . In the west , the Kingdom of Kongo ruled around the mouth of the Congo River from the 14th to 19th centuries . In the centre and east , the kingdoms of Luba and Lunda ruled from the 16th and 17th centuries to the 19th century . In the 1870s , just before the onset of the Scramble for Africa , European exploration of the Congo Basin was carried out , first led by Henry Morton Stanley under the sponsorship of Leopold II of Belgium . Leopold formally acquired rights to the Congo territory at the Berlin Conference in 1885 and made the land his private property , naming it the Congo Free State . During the Free State , his colonial military unit , the Force Publique , forced the local population to produce rubber . From 1885 to 1908 , millions of the Kongo people died as a consequence of disease and exploitation .",
  "/wiki/Belgian_Congo": "The Belgian Congo ( French : Congo belge , pronounced [ k\u0254\u0303\u0261o b\u025bl\u0292 ] ; Dutch : Belgisch-Congo [ a ] ) was a Belgian colony in Central Africa from 1908 until independence in 1960 . The former colony adopted its present-day name , the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) , in 1964 . Colonial rule in the Congo began in the late 19th century . King Leopold II of Belgium attempted to persuade the Belgian government to support colonial expansion around the then-largely unexplored Congo Basin . Their ambivalence resulted in Leopold 's establishing a colony himself . With support from a number of Western countries , Leopold achieved international recognition for a personal colony , the Congo Free State , in 1885 . By the turn of the century , however , the violence used by Free State officials against indigenous Congolese and a ruthless system of economic exploitation led to intense diplomatic pressure on Belgium to take official control of the country , which it did by creating the Belgian Congo in 1908 . Belgian rule in the Congo was based on the colonial trinity ( trinit\u00e9 coloniale ) of state , missionary and private-company interests . The privileging of Belgian commercial interests meant that large amounts of capital flowed into the Congo and that individual regions became specialised . On many occasions , the interests of the government and of private enterprise became closely linked , and the state helped companies to break strikes and to remove other barriers raised by the indigenous population . The colony was divided into hierarchically organised administrative subdivisions , and run uniformly according to a set native policy ( politique indig\u00e8ne ) . This contrasted the practice of British and French colonial policy , which generally favoured systems of indirect rule , retaining traditional leaders in positions of authority under colonial oversight .",
  "/wiki/Languages_of_the_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo": "The Democratic Republic of the Congo is a multilingual country where an estimated total of 242 languages are spoken . Ethnologue lists 215 living languages . The official language , inherited from the colonial period , is French . Four indigenous languages have the status of national language : Kituba ( called Kikongo ) , Lingala , Swahili and Tshiluba . When the country was a Belgian colony , it had already instituted teaching and use of the four national languages in primary schools , making it one of the few African nations to have had literacy in local languages during the European colonial period . During the colonial period Dutch and French were the official languages but French was by far the more important .",
  "/wiki/Republic_of_the_Congo": "The Republic of the Congo ( pronunciation ( help\u00b7info ) French : R\u00e9publique du Congo , Kongo : Repubilika ya K\u00f4ngo ) , also known as Congo-Brazzaville , the Congo Republic , RotC , or simply the Congo , is a country located in the western coast of Central Africa . It is bordered by five countries : Gabon to its west ; Cameroon to its northwest and the Central African Republic to its northeast ; the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the southeast and the Angolan exclave of Cabinda to its south ; and the Atlantic Ocean to its southwest . The region was dominated by Bantu-speaking tribes at least 3,000 years ago , who built trade links leading into the Congo River basin . Congo was formerly part of the French colony of Equatorial Africa . The Republic of the Congo was established on 28 November 1958 but gained independence from France in 1960 . It was a Marxist-Leninist state from 1969 to 1992 , under the name People 's Republic of the Congo . The sovereign state has had multi-party elections since 1992 , although a democratically elected government was ousted in the 1997 Republic of the Congo Civil War , and President Denis Sassou Nguesso , who first came to power in 1979 , has ruled for 35 of the past 40 years . The Republic of the Congo has become the fourth-largest oil producer in the Gulf of Guinea , providing the country with a degree of prosperity despite political and economic instability in some areas and unequal distribution of oil revenue nationwide . Congo 's economy is heavily dependent on the oil sector , and economic growth has slowed considerably since the post-2015 drop in oil prices ."
