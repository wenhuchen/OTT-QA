  "/wiki/List_of_Bulgarian_monarchs": "The monarchs of Bulgaria ruled the country during three periods of its history as an independent country : from the establishment of the First Bulgarian Empire in 681 to the Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria in 1018 ; from the Uprising of Asen and Peter that established the Second Bulgarian Empire in 1185 to the annexation of the rump Bulgarian principality into the Ottoman Empire in 1396 ; and from the re-establishment of an independent Bulgaria in 1878 to the abolition of monarchy in a referendum held on 15 September 1946 . Early Bulgarian rulers possibly used the title Kanasubigi ( Khan ) , later knyaz ( prince ) for a brief period , and subsequently tsar ( emperor ) . The title tsar , the Bulgarian form of the Latin Caesar , was first adopted and used in Bulgaria by Simeon I , following a decisive victory over the Byzantine Empire in 913 . It was also used by all of Simeon I 's successors until the fall of Bulgaria under Ottoman rule in 1396 . After Bulgaria 's liberation from the Ottomans in 1878 , its first monarch Alexander I adopted the title knyaz , or prince . However , when de jure independence was proclaimed under his successor Ferdinand in 1908 , the title was elevated to the customary tsar once more . The use of tsar continued under Ferdinand and later under his heirs Boris III and Simeon II until the abolition of monarchy in 1946 . While the title tsar was translated as emperor in the First and Second Bulgarian Empires , it was translated as king in modern Bulgaria . In the few surviving medieval Bulgarian royal charters , the monarchs of Bulgaria styled themselves as In Christ the Lord Faithful Emperor and Autocrat of all Bulgarians or similar variations , sometimes including . and Romans , Greeks , or Vlachs .

In 1951 , the Egyptian Parliament amended the Constitution by Law 176 of 16 October 1951 to provide that the title of the King should be King of Egypt and the Sudan instead of King of Egypt , Sovereign of Nubia , Sudan , Kordofan , and Darfur . This move came in the wake of Wafdist Prime Minister Nahhas Pasha 's decision to unilaterally abrogate the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 . The change in King Farouk I 's title was intended to further Egypt 's claims over the Sudan , which had been an Anglo-Egyptian condominium since 1899 . The title had long been used by Egyptian nationalists to emphasize their desire for the unity of the Nile Valley . For instance , expatriate Egyptian students in France greeted Farouk I during his 1937 tour of Europe by proclaiming Long live the King of Egypt and Sudan . A Member of Parliament is also reported to have cried out Long live His Majesty , King of Egypt and Sudan ! during Farouk I 's coronation ceremony . However , the title had no legal standing prior to 1951 , and Farouk I was officially Sovereign of the Sudan ( not King ) until the Wafdist government 's decision to change his title . The title King of the Sudan was merely ceremonial , as the Egyptian King did not exercise effective control over Sudan , which was administered by the United Kingdom . The British objected to the title and did not recognize it , claiming that Egypt needed to respect the Sudanese people 's right to self-determination . Many other countries also refused to recognize Farouk I as King of the Sudan , notably the United States , as well as the Vatican .",

The revolution was initially aimed at overthrowing King Farouk . However , the movement had more political ambitions , and soon moved to abolish the constitutional monarchy and aristocracy of Egypt and Sudan , establish a republic , end the British occupation of the country , and secure the independence of Sudan ( previously governed as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium ) . The revolutionary government adopted a staunchly nationalist , anti-imperialist agenda , which came to be expressed chiefly through Arab nationalism , and international non-alignment . The revolution was faced with immediate threats from Western imperial powers , particularly the United Kingdom , which had occupied Egypt since 1882 , and France , both of whom were wary of rising nationalist sentiment in territories under their control throughout the Arab world , and Africa . The ongoing state of war with Israel also posed a serious challenge , as the Free Officers increased Egypt 's already strong support of the Palestinians . These two issues conflated four years after the revolution when Egypt was invaded by Britain , France , and Israel in the Suez Crisis of 1956 . Despite enormous military losses , the war was seen as a political victory for Egypt , especially as it left the Suez Canal in uncontested Egyptian control for the first time since 1875 , erasing what was seen as a mark of national humiliation . This strengthened the appeal of the revolution in other Arab and African countries . Wholesale agrarian reform , and huge industrialisation programmes were initiated in the first decade and half of the revolution , leading to an unprecedented period of infrastructure building , and urbanisation . By the 1960s , Arab socialism had become a dominant theme , transforming Egypt into a centrally planned economy .

Ordained as a priest in 1951 in his native Bavaria , Ratzinger had established himself as a highly regarded university theologian by the late 1950s and was appointed a full professor in 1958 . After a long career as an academic and professor of theology at several German universities , he was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising and Cardinal by Pope Paul VI in 1977 , an unusual promotion for someone with little pastoral experience . In 1981 , he was appointed Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , one of the most important dicasteries of the Roman Curia . From 2002 until his election as pope , he was also Dean of the College of Cardinals . Prior to becoming pope , he was a major figure on the Vatican stage for a quarter of a century ; he had an influence second to none when it came to setting church priorities and directions as one of John Paul II 's closest confidants . He has lived in Rome since 1981 . His prolific writings generally defend traditional Catholic doctrine and values . He was originally a liberal theologian , but adopted conservative views after 1968 . During his papacy , Benedict XVI advocated a return to fundamental Christian values to counter the increased secularisation of many Western countries .",
  "/wiki/Pope": "The Pope ( Latin : papa from Greek : \u03c0\u03ac\u03c0\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2 pappas , father ) , also known as the Supreme Pontiff ( Pontifex Maximus ) , or the Roman Pontiff ( Romanum Pontificem ) , is the Bishop of Rome , leader of the worldwide Catholic Church , and head of state representing the Holy See . Since 1929 , the pope has official residence in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican City , the Holy See 's city-state enclaved within Rome , Italy . The current pope is Francis , who was elected on 13 March 2013 , succeeding Benedict XVI . While his office is called the papacy , the jurisdiction of the episcopal see is called the Holy See . It is the Holy See that is the sovereign entity by international law headquartered in the distinctively independent Vatican City State , established by the Lateran Treaty in 1929 between Italy and the Holy See to ensure its temporal , diplomatic , and spiritual independence . The primacy of the bishop of Rome is largely derived from his role as the apostolic successor to Saint Peter , to whom primacy was conferred by Jesus , giving him the Keys of Heaven and the powers of binding and loosing , naming him as the rock upon which the church would be built . According to Catholic tradition , the apostolic see of Rome was founded by Saint Peter and Saint Paul in the 1st century . The papacy is one of the most enduring institutions in the world and has had a prominent part in world history . In ancient times the popes helped spread Christianity , and intervened to find resolutions in various doctrinal disputes . In the Middle Ages , they played a role of secular importance in Western Europe , often acting as arbitrators between Christian monarchs . Currently , in addition to the expansion of the Christian faith and doctrine , the popes are involved in ecumenism and interfaith dialogue , charitable work , and the defense of human rights . In some periods of history , the papacy , which originally had no temporal powers , accrued wide secular powers rivaling those of temporal rulers .",
  "/wiki/Resignation_of_Pope_Benedict_XVI": "The resignation of Pope Benedict XVI occurred on 28 February 2013 at 20:00 CET , after having been announced on the morning of 11 February 2013 directly by himself . Benedict XVI 's decision to step down as leader of the Catholic Church made him the first pope to relinquish the office since Gregory XII in 1415 ( who did so in order to end the Western Schism ) , the first to do so on his own initiative since Celestine V in 1294 . The move was unexpected , given that popes in the modern era have held the position from election until death . The Pope stated that the reason for his decision was his declining health due to old age . The conclave to select his successor began on 12 March 2013 and elected Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio , Archbishop of Buenos Aires , Argentina , who took the name of Francis .",

  "/wiki/List_of_Sultans_of_Zanzibar": "The Sultans of Zanzibar ( Arabic : \u0633\u0644\u0627\u0637\u064a\u0646 \u0632\u0646\u062c\u0628\u0627\u0631 ) were the rulers of the Sultanate of Zanzibar , which was created on 19 October 1856 after the death of Said bin Sultan , who had ruled Oman and Zanzibar as the Sultan of Oman since 1804 . The Sultans of Zanzibar were of a cadet branch of the Al Said Dynasty of Oman . In 1698 , Zanzibar became part of the overseas holdings of Oman , falling under the control of the Sultan of Oman . In 1832 , or 1840 ( the date varies among sources ) , Said bin Sultan moved his capital from Muscat in Oman to Stone Town . He established a ruling Arab elite and encouraged the development of clove plantations , using the island 's slave labour . Zanzibar 's commerce fell increasingly into the hands of traders from the Indian subcontinent , whom Said encouraged to settle on the island . After his death in 1856 , two of his sons , Majid bin Said and Thuwaini bin Said , struggled over the succession , so Zanzibar and Oman were divided into two separate principalities ; Thuwaini became the Sultan of Oman while Majid became the first Sultan of Zanzibar . During his 14-year reign as Sultan , Majid consolidated his power around the East African slave trade . His successor , Barghash bin Said , helped abolish the slave trade in Zanzibar and largely developed the country 's infrastructure . The third Sultan , Khalifa bin Said , also furthered the country 's progress toward abolishing slavery . Until 1886 , the Sultan of Zanzibar controlled a substantial portion of the east African coast , known as Zanj , and trading routes extending further into the continent , as far as Kindu on the Congo River . That year , the British and Germans secretly met and re-established the area under the Sultan 's rule .",
  "/wiki/Zanzibar_Revolution": "The Zanzibar Revolution ( Arabic : \u062b\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0632\u0646\u062c\u0628\u0627\u0631 Thawrat Zanjib\u0101r ) occurred in 1964 and led to the overthrow of the Sultan of Zanzibar and his mainly Arab government by local African revolutionaries . Zanzibar was an ethnically diverse state consisting of a number of islands off the east coast of Tanganyika which had been granted independence by Britain in 1963 . In a series of parliamentary elections preceding independence , the Arab minority succeeded in retaining the hold on power it had inherited from Zanzibar 's former existence as an overseas territory of Oman . Frustrated by under-representation in Parliament despite winning 54% of the vote in the July 1963 election , the mainly African Afro-Shirazi Party ( ASP ) allied itself with the left-wing Umma Party , and early in the morning of 12 January 1964 ASP member John Okello mobilised around 600-800 revolutionaries on the main island of Unguja ( Zanzibar Island ) . Having overrun the country 's police force and appropriated their weaponry , the insurgents proceeded to Zanzibar Town where they overthrew the Sultan and his government . Reprisals against Arab and South Asian civilians on the island followed ; the resulting death toll is disputed , with estimates ranging from several hundred to 20,000 . The moderate ASP leader Abeid Karume became the country 's new president and head of state , and positions of power were granted to Umma party members . The new government 's apparent communist ties concerned Western governments . As Zanzibar lay within the British sphere of influence , the British government drew up a number of intervention plans . However , the feared communist government never materialised , and because British and United States citizens were successfully evacuated , these plans were not put into effect . Meanwhile , the Communist Bloc powers of East Germany and the Soviet Union , along with the anti-Soviet People 's Republic of China , established friendly relations with the new government by recognising the country and sending advisors . Karume succeeded in negotiating a merger of Zanzibar with Tanganyika to form the new nation of Tanzania , an act judged by contemporary media to be an attempt to prevent communist subversion of Zanzibar ."
