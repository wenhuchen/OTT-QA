With an estimated population of 2,096,829 as of the July 1 , 2019 U.S. Census Bureau estimate , New Mexico is the 36th largest state by population . With a total area of 121,592 sq mi ( 314,920 km2 ) , it is the fifth-largest and sixth-least densely populated of the 50 states . Due to their geographic locations , northern and eastern New Mexico exhibit a colder , alpine climate , while western and southern New Mexico exhibit a warmer , arid climate . The economy of New Mexico is dependent on oil drilling , mineral extraction , dryland farming , cattle ranching , lumber milling , and retail trade . As of 2018 , its total gross domestic product ( GDP ) was $ 101 billion with a GDP per capita of $ 45,465 . New Mexico 's status as a tax haven yields low to moderate personal income taxes on residents and military personnel , and gives tax credits and exemptions to favorable industries . Because of this , its film industry has grown and contributed $ 1.23 billion to its overall economy . Due to its large area and economic climate , New Mexico has a large U.S. military presence marked notably with the White Sands Missile Range .

The Lone Star can be found on the Texas state flag and on the Texas state seal . The origin of Texas 's name is from the word taysha , which means friends in the Caddo language . Due to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault , Texas contains diverse landscapes common to both the U.S. Southern and Southwestern regions . Although Texas is popularly associated with the U.S. southwestern deserts , less than 10% of Texas 's land area is desert . Most of the population centers are in areas of former prairies , grasslands , forests , and the coastline . Traveling from east to west , one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods , to rolling plains and rugged hills , and finally the desert and mountains of the Big Bend . The term six flags over Texas [ note 1 ] refers to several nations that have ruled over the territory .",

In 1521 , the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the territory from its politically powerful base in Mexico-Tenochtitlan ( part of Mexico City ) , which was administered as the viceroyalty of New Spain . The Roman Catholic Church played a powerful role in governing the country as millions were converted to the faith , although King Charles III expelled the Jesuits in the 1770s . The territory became a nation state following its recognition in 1821 after the Mexican War of Independence . The post-independence period was tumultuous , characterized by economic inequality and many contrasting political changes .",

Human habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans , one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Anasazi ( c. 300 CE ) . Subsequently , the Virgin Anasazi culture ( c. 500 ) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities . Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes .
