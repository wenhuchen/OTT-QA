Initially launched as an Arabic news and current-affairs satellite TV channel , Al Jazeera has since expanded into a network with several outlets , including the Internet and specialty television channels in multiple languages . Al Jazeera Media Network is a major global news organization , with 80 bureaus around the world . The original Al Jazeera Arabic channel 's willingness to broadcast dissenting views , for example on call-in shows , created controversies in the Arab States of the Persian Gulf . The station gained worldwide attention following the outbreak of the war in Afghanistan , when its office there was the only channel to cover the war live . Al Jazeera Media Network is owned by the government of Qatar . Al Jazeera Media Network has stated that they are editorially independent from the government of Qatar as the network is funded through loans and grants rather than government subsidies . Critics have accused Al Jazeera of being a propaganda outlet for the Qatari government . The network is sometimes perceived to have mainly Islamist perspectives , promoting the Muslim Brotherhood , and having a pro-Sunni and an anti-Shia bias in its reporting of regional issues . However , Al Jazeera insists it covers all sides of a debate ; it says it presents Israel 's view , Iran 's view and even aired videos released by Osama bin Laden . In June 2017 , the Saudi , Emirati , Bahraini , and Egyptian governments demanded the closure of the news station as one of thirteen demands made to Qatar during the 2017 Qatar Crisis .

It was founded in 1987 by Hafiz Saeed , Abdullah Azzam and Zafar Iqbal with funding from Osama bin Laden . Its headquarters are in Muridke , near Lahore in Punjab province of Pakistan , and the group operates several training camps in Pakistan-administered Kashmir . Lashkar-e-Taiba has been accused by India of attacking military and civilian targets in India , most notably the 2001 Indian Parliament attack , the 2008 Mumbai attacks and the 2019 Pulwama attack on Armed Forces . Its stated objective is to introduce an Islamic state in South Asia and to liberate Muslims residing in Indian Kashmir . The organization is banned as a terrorist organization by India , the United States , the United Kingdom , the European Union , Russia , Australia , and the United Nations ( under the UNSC Resolution 1267 Al-Qaeda Sanctions List ) . Though formally banned by Pakistan , the general view of India and the Western countries , including of experts such as former French investigating magistrate Jean-Louis Brugui\u00e8re and New America Foundation president Steve Coll , is that Pakistan 's main intelligence agency , the Inter-Services Intelligence ( ISI ) , continues to give LeT help and protection . Whilst LeT remains banned in Pakistan , the political arm of the group , Jamat ud Dawah ( JuD ) has remained un-banned for spans of time . As of February 2019 , it is deemed as a proscribed organization per an order of the Interior Ministry .",

  "/wiki/Non-governmental_organization": "Non-governmental organizations ( also known as NGOs , nongovernmental organizations , or nongovernment organizations ) are organizations that are independent of any government . They are usually non-profit and many are active in humanitarian or social areas ; however , NGOs can also be lobby groups for corporations , such as the World Economic Forum . NGOs are a subgroup of all organizations founded by citizens , which include clubs and other associations that provide services , benefits , and premises only to members [ dubious - discuss ] . Sometimes the term is used as a synonym of civil society organization to refer to any association founded by citizens , but this is not how the term is normally used in the media or everyday language , as recorded by major dictionaries . The explanation of the term by NGO.org ( the non-governmental organizations associated with the United Nations ) is ambivalent : [ an NGO is ] any non-profit , voluntary citizens ' group which is organized on a local , national or international level , but then goes on to restrict the meaning in the sense used by most English speakers and the media : Task-oriented and driven by people with a common interest , NGOs perform a variety of service and humanitarian functions , bring citizen concerns to Governments , advocate and monitor policies and encourage political participation through provision of information . NGOs are usually funded by donations , but some avoid formal funding altogether and are run primarily by volunteers . NGOs are highly diverse groups of organizations engaged in a wide range of activities , and take different forms in different parts of the world . Some may have charitable status , while others may be registered for tax exemption based on recognition of social purposes . Others may be fronts for political , religious , or other interests . Since the end of World War II , NGOs have had an increasing role in international development , particularly in the fields of humanitarian assistance and poverty alleviation . Russia had about 277,000 NGOs in 2008 . India is estimated to have had around 2 million NGOs in 2009 , just over one NGO per 600 Indians , and many times the number of primary schools and primary health centres in India .",
  "/wiki/Counter-terrorism": "Counter-terrorism ( also spelled counterterrorism ) , also known as antiterrorism , incorporates the practice , military tactics , techniques , and strategy that government , military , law enforcement , business , and intelligence agencies use to combat or prevent terrorism . Counter-terrorism strategy is a government 's plan to use the instruments of national power to neutralize terrorists , their organizations , and their networks in order to render them incapable of using violence to instill fear and to coerce the government or its citizens to react in accordance with the terrorists goals . If terrorism is part of a broader insurgency , counter-terrorism may employ counter-insurgency measures . The United States Armed Forces use the term foreign internal defense for programs that support other countries in attempts to suppress insurgency , lawlessness , or subversion or to reduce the conditions under which these threats to security may develop . [ citation needed ] At a workshop of experts at RAND in October 2019 which included David Kilcullen , Ben Connable and Christine Wormuth , the U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Mick Mulroy officially rolled out the Irregular Warfare Annex and said it was a critical component of the U.S. 2018 National Defense Strategy . He explained that irregular warfare ( IW ) included counter-insurgency ( COIN ) , counter-terrorism ( CT ) , unconventional warfare ( UW ) , foreign internal defense ( FID ) , sabotage and subversion , as well as stabilization ( warfare ) and information operations ( IO ) , among other areas . He continued , that IW was perceived as primarily the CT effort used to fight violent extremist organizations as that has been the focus since 2001 , but it should be applied to all areas of military competition . These areas include the global powers competitors of China and Russia as well as the rogue states of North Korea and Iran . Mulroy emphasized that the U.S. must be prepared to respond with aggressive , dynamic , and unorthodox approaches to IW to be competitive across these priorities .",
  "/wiki/Koran_desecration": "The term Quran desecration is defined as insulting the Quran - which Muslims believe to be the literal word of God , in its original Arabic form - by defiling or defacing copies . Intentionally insulting the Quran is regarded by Muslims as blasphemous . Most traditional schools of Islamic law require wudu ( ritual handwashing ) before a Muslim may touch the Quran . Muslims must always treat the printed book with reverence , which may even extend to excerpts of text . Disposal of worn copies is also of concern to Muslims . Because the Quran contains no specifics on how to dispose of a worn or defective text , different and conflicting methods of disposal have been adopted in different regions by different sects . According to Islamic historian Michael Cook the Quran should be wrapped in cloth and buried on holy ground where it is unlikely to be trampled on or safely placed where it is unlikely to come into contact with impurity . According to Arab News , Muslims are forbidden to recycle , pulp , or shred worn-out copies of the text ; instead , burning or burying the worn-out copies in a respectful manner is required . Respect for the written text of the Quran is an important element of religious faith in Islam . Intentionally desecrating a copy of the Quran is punishable by imprisonment in some countries ( up to life imprisonment in Pakistan , according to Article 295-B of the Penal Code ) and could lead to death in Afghanistan , Saudi Arabia , Somalia and Pakistan .",
