  "/wiki/Swanee_(song)": "Swanee is an American popular song written in 1919 by George Gershwin , with lyrics by Irving Caesar . It is most often associated with singer Al Jolson . The song was written for a New York City revue called Demi-Tasse , which opened in October 1919 in the Capitol Theater . Caesar and Gershwin , who was then aged 20 , claimed to have written the song in about ten minutes riding on a bus in Manhattan , finishing it at Gershwin 's apartment . It was written partly as a parody of Stephen Foster 's Old Folks at Home , even filching the title for the Swanee lyrics . It was originally used as a big production number , with 60 chorus girls dancing with electric lights in their slippers on an otherwise darkened stage . The song had little impact in its first show , but not long afterwards Gershwin played it at a party where Al Jolson heard it . Jolson then put it into his show Sinbad , already a success at the Winter Garden Theatre , and recorded it for Columbia Records in January 1920 . After that , said Gershwin , Swanee penetrated the four corners of the earth . The song was charted in 1920 for 18 weeks holding the No . 1 position for nine . It sold a million sheet music copies , and an estimated two million records .",

Although best remembered today as the star of the first talking picture , The Jazz Singer ( 1927 ) , he starred in a series of successful musical films during the 1930s . After the attack on Pearl Harbor , he was the first star to entertain troops overseas during World War II . After a period of inactivity , his stardom returned with The Jolson Story ( 1946 ) , for which Larry Parks played Jolson , with the singer dubbing for Parks . The formula was repeated in a sequel , Jolson Sings Again ( 1949 ) . In 1950 , he again became the first star to entertain GIs on active service in the Korean War , performing 42 shows in 16 days . He died weeks after returning to the U.S. , partly owing to the physical exertion of performing . Defense Secretary George Marshall posthumously awarded him the Medal for Merit .",

Before the United States entered World War II , Lindbergh was an advocate of non-interventionism and a supporter of Nazi Germany .

  "/wiki/Narrative": "A narrative or story is an account of a series of related events , experiences , or the like , whether true ( episode , vignette , travelogue , memoir , autobiography , biography ) or fictitious ( fairy tale , fable , story , epic , legend , novel ) . The word derives from the Latin verb narrare ( to tell ) , which is derived from the adjective gnarus ( knowing or skilled ) . Along with argumentation , description , and exposition , narration , broadly defined , is one of four rhetorical modes of discourse . More narrowly defined , it is the fiction-writing mode in which the narrator communicates directly to the reader . Oral storytelling is the earliest method for sharing narratives . During most people 's childhoods , narratives are used to guide them on proper behavior , cultural history , formation of a communal identity and values , as especially studied in anthropology today among traditional indigenous peoples . Narrative is found in all forms of human creativity , art , and entertainment , including speech , literature , theatre , music and song , comics , journalism , film , television and video , video games , radio , game-play , unstructured recreation and performance in general , as well as some painting , sculpture , drawing , photography and other visual arts , as long as a sequence of events is presented . Several art movements , such as modern art , refuse the narrative in favor of the abstract and conceptual . Narrative can be organized into a number of thematic or formal categories : non-fiction ( such as definitively including creative non-fiction , biography , journalism , transcript poetry and historiography ) ; fictionalization of historical events ( such as anecdote , myth , legend and historical fiction ) and fiction proper ( such as literature in prose and sometimes poetry , such as short stories , novels and narrative poems and songs , and imaginary narratives as portrayed in other textual forms , games or live or recorded performances ) . Narratives may also be nested within other narratives , such as narratives told by an unreliable narrator ( a character ) typically found in the genre of noir fiction . An important part of narration is the narrative mode , the set of methods used to communicate the narrative through a process narration ( see also Aesthetics approach below ) .",

  "/wiki/Coleman_Hawkins": "Coleman Randolph Hawkins ( November 21 , 1904 - May 19 , 1969 ) , nicknamed Hawk and sometimes Bean , was an American jazz tenor saxophonist . One of the first prominent jazz musicians on his instrument , as Joachim E. Berendt explained : there were some tenor players before him , but the instrument was not an acknowledged jazz horn . Hawkins biographer John Chilton described the prevalent styles of tenor saxophone solos prior to Hawkins as mooing and rubbery belches . Hawkins cited as influences Happy Caldwell , Stump Evans , and Prince Robinson , although he was the first to tailor his method of improvisation to the saxophone rather than imitate the techniques of the clarinet . Hawkins ' virtuosic , arpeggiated approach to improvisation , with his characteristic rich , emotional , loud , and vibrato-laden tonal style , was the main influence on a generation of tenor players that included Chu Berry , Charlie Barnet , Tex Beneke , Ben Webster , Vido Musso , Herschel Evans , Buddy Tate , and Don Byas , and through them the later tenormen , Arnett Cobb , Illinois Jacquet , Flip Phillips , Ike Quebec , Al Sears , Paul Gonsalves , and Lucky Thompson . While Hawkins became well known with swing music during the big band era , he had a role in the development of bebop in the 1940s . Fellow saxophonist Lester Young , known as Pres , commented in a 1959 interview with The Jazz Review : As far as I 'm concerned , I think Coleman Hawkins was the President first , right ? As far as myself , I think I 'm the second one . Miles Davis once said : When I heard Hawk , I learned to play ballads .",

Sergej Sergejevi\u010d Prokofjev ; [ n 1 ] 27 April [ O.S . 15 April ] 1891 - 5 March 1953 ) [ n 2 ] was a Russian Soviet composer , pianist and conductor . As the creator of acknowledged masterpieces across numerous music genres , he is regarded as one of the major composers of the 20th century . His works include such widely heard pieces as the March from The Love for Three Oranges , the suite Lieutenant Kij\u00e9 , the ballet Romeo and Juliet - from which Dance of the Knights is taken - and Peter and the Wolf . Of the established forms and genres in which he worked , he created - excluding juvenilia - seven completed operas , seven symphonies , eight ballets , five piano concertos , two violin concertos , a cello concerto , a symphony-concerto for cello and orchestra , and nine completed piano sonatas . A graduate of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory , Prokofiev initially made his name as an iconoclastic composer-pianist , achieving notoriety with a series of ferociously dissonant and virtuosic works for his instrument , including his first two piano concertos . In 1915 , Prokofiev made a decisive break from the standard composer-pianist category with his orchestral Scythian Suite , compiled from music originally composed for a ballet commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev of the Ballets Russes . Diaghilev commissioned three further ballets from Prokofiev - Chout , Le pas d'acier and The Prodigal Son - which at the time of their original production all caused a sensation among both critics and colleagues . Prokofiev 's greatest interest , however , was opera , and he composed several works in that genre , including The Gambler and The Fiery Angel . Prokofiev 's one operatic success during his lifetime was The Love for Three Oranges , composed for the Chicago Opera and subsequently performed over the following decade in Europe and Russia . After the Revolution of 1917 , Prokofiev left Russia with the official blessing of the Soviet minister Anatoly Lunacharsky , and resided in the United States , then Germany , then Paris , making his living as a composer , pianist and conductor .",
