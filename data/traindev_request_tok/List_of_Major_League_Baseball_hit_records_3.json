Since July 1999 , the Mariners ' home ballpark has been T-Mobile Park ( formerly Safeco Field ) , located in the SoDo neighborhood of Seattle . The Mariners name originates from the prominence of marine culture in the city of Seattle . They are nicknamed the M 's , a title featured in their primary logo from 1987 to 1992 . They adopted their current team colors - navy blue , northwest green ( teal ) , and silver - prior to the 1993 season , after having been royal blue and gold since the team 's inception . Their mascot is the Mariner Moose . The organization did not field a winning team until 1991 , and any real success eluded them until 1995 when they won their first division championship and defeated the New York Yankees in the ALDS . The game-winning hit in Game 5 , in which Edgar Mart\u00ednez drove home Ken Griffey Jr. to win the game in the 11th inning , clinched a series win for the Mariners , served as a powerful impetus to preserve baseball in Seattle , and has since become an iconic moment in team history . The Mariners won 116 games in 2001 , which set the American League record for most wins in a single season and tied the 1906 Chicago Cubs for the Major League record for most wins in a single season .

In August 1989 ( his last year as a manager and three years after retiring as a player ) , Rose was penalized with permanent ineligibility from baseball amidst accusations that he gambled on baseball games while he played for and managed the Reds ; the charges of wrongdoing included claims that he bet on his own team . In 1991 , the Baseball Hall of Fame formally voted to ban those on the permanently ineligible list from induction , after previously excluding such players by informal agreement among voters . After years of public denial , Rose admitted in 2004 that he bet on baseball and on the Reds . The issue of Rose 's possible reinstatement and election to the Hall of Fame remains contentious throughout baseball .
