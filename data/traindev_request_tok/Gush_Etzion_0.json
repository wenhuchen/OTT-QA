  "/wiki/Community_settlement_(Israel)": "A community settlement is a type of village in Israel and the West Bank . While in an ordinary town anyone may buy property , in a community settlement the village 's residents are organized in a cooperative . They have the power to approve or veto a sale of a house or a business to any buyer . Residents of a community settlement may have a particular shared ideology , religious perspective , or desired lifestyle which they wish to perpetuate by accepting only like-minded individuals . For example , a family-oriented community settlement that wishes to avoid becoming a retirement community may choose to accept only young married couples as new residents . As distinct from the traditional Israeli development village , typified by the kibbutz and moshav , the community settlement emerged in the 1970s as a non-political movement for new urban settlements in Israel . But it essentially took shape as a new typology for settling the West Bank and the Galilee as part of the goal of establishing a 'demographic balance ' between Jews and Arabs . In 2013 , there were 118 community settlements with total population of 84,800 residents .",

  "/wiki/Kibbutz": "A kibbutz is a collective community in Israel that was traditionally based on agriculture . The first kibbutz , established in 1909 , was Degania . Today , farming has been partly supplanted by other economic branches , including industrial plants and high-tech enterprises .

  "/wiki/Israeli_outpost": "In Israeli law , an outpost is an unauthorized or illegal Israeli settlement within the West Bank , constructed without the required authorization from the Israeli government in contravention of Israeli statutes regulating planning and construction . In Israeli law , outposts are distinguished from settlements authorized by the Israeli government . This distinction between illegal outposts and legal settlements is not endorsed by international law , which considers both a violation of the norms , governing belligerent occupations , applicable to the Israeli-occupied West Bank . Outposts appeared after the 1993 Oslo I Accord , when the Israeli government made commitments to freeze the building of new settlements . Although outposts were not officially supported by the government , Israeli public authorities and other government bodies played a major role in establishing and developing them , according to the 2005 Sasson Report , commissioned by then Prime Minister Ariel Sharon . Outposts differ from neighborhoods in that they are built at a substantial distance from authorized settlements , while neighborhoods are attached to an existing settlement . In July 2002 , the Israeli government acknowledged that 69 outposts had been established since 1996 . A number of them , most unpopulated , have been removed afterwards . Currently , some hundred outposts exist . The majority of them , some 70 in 2002 , belong to the Amana movement . In 2012 , ten unauthorized outposts were retroactively legalised by the Israeli government under Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu , according to the Israeli NGO Peace Now , by redesignating them as a neighbourhood of nearby settlements .
