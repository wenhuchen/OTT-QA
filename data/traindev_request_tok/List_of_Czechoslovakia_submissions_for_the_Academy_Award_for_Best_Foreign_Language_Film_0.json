The Best Picture winner of 1964 , director George Cukor 's My Fair Lady , was about the transformative training of a rough-speaking flower girl into a lady . The musical had run for many years on the stage in both NYC and London . Audrey Hepburn , the female lead of the film , was controversially not nominated for Best Actress . The unpopularity of her replacing Julie Andrews - who had originated the role on Broadway and , coincidentally , the Best Actress winner of the year for Mary Poppins - as well as the revelation that the majority of her singing was dubbed by Marni Nixon ( which was n't approved by Hepburn herself ) were seen as the main reasons for the snub . The ceremony was produced by MGM 's Joe Pasternak and hosted , for the 14th time , by Bob Hope . The awards show was a star-studded one , including an appearance by Judy Garland , who sang a medley of Cole Porter songs in tribute to the composer , who had died in October 1964 . This event marked the first time that more than two films had received ten or more nominations ( repeated at the 50th and 92nd Academy Awards ) , and the only time in Oscar history that three films got twelve or more nominations : Becket and My Fair Lady each received twelve , while Mary Poppins received thirteen .

Forman based his story on a real-world incident from his past and the filmmakers focused much of their attention on trying to create a real-life look and feel by filming on location in a small Czech town with a shoe factory of its own , utilizing a largely non-professional cast , relying on a considerable amount of dialogue improvisation , and employing documentary-style cinematographic techniques . Upon its release , Loves of a Blonde was a popular success in its home country and was shown at some major film festivals , where it was well-received , garnering a number of nominations and awards . Critical response was largely positive , although some reviewers were less enthusiastic than others . The film is now considered one of the most significant examples of the Czech New Wave , a movement which took advantage of a temporary relaxation of totalitarian control over creative artists to use cinema as a means to explore new narrative strategies while making pointed critiques of social and political conditions behind the Iron Curtain . Loves of a Blonde was nominated for the 1966 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film .",
