  "/wiki/Brechfa_Forest": "The Brechfa Forest is an area of forest in Carmarthenshire , south Wales . Brechfa Forest is the 'modern ' name for part of the ancient Glyn Cothi Forest . From before records began in the 6th century the communities in the 15 villages which encircle Glyn Cothi Forest were managing it to provide employment , building materials , products , and grazing . At various times the forest has been the refuge of Welsh Princes fighting the Norman Invasion , a Royal Hunting Forest , and for two centuries was the 'Texas ' of Wales , producing large quantities of oil for lamps . and was a major supplier of timber for the trenches and explosives during World War One . The Forestry Commission was established to increase timber production during World War One taking control of woodland which was no longer productive . Like the New Forest and the Forest of Dean , Glyn Cothi Forest was still being actively managed by the local community at this point and was a major supplier of timber for the trenches , as well as oil and explosives . During the depression in the 1930s the UK government purchased land which had been part of the original Glyn Cothi forest but had been converted to agriculture . Much of the planting work to create conifer plantations and construction of forest roads was carried out by young unemployed men from a Ministry of Labour work camp . Many came from the distressed coal mining communities , and were recruited for training in one of a number of Instructional Centres created by the Ministry , most of which were on Forestry Commission property ; by 1938 , the Ministry had 38 Instructional Centres across Britain . The hutted camp in Brechfa was later used to house Basque children who were refugees from the Spanish Civil War . Management and maintenance of the forest continued to be a major source of employment for local residents until the 1980s when Forestry Commission policies changed to increased mechanisation and subcontracting of work .",

The three largest towns are Llanelli , Carmarthen and Ammanford . Carmarthen is the county town and administrative centre . Carmarthenshire has been inhabited since prehistoric times . The county town was founded by the Romans , and the region was part of the Principality of Deheubarth in the High Middle Ages . After invasion by the Normans in the 12th and 13th centuries it was subjugated , along with other parts of Wales , by Edward I of England . There was further unrest in the early 15th century , when the Welsh rebelled under Owain Glynd\u0175r , and during the English Civil War . Carmarthenshire is mainly an agricultural county , apart from the southeastern part which was once heavily industrialised with coal mining , steel-making and tin-plating . In the north of the county , the woollen industry was very important in the 18th century . The economy depends on agriculture , forestry , fishing and tourism . West Wales was identified in 2014 as the worst-performing region in the United Kingdom along with the South Wales Valleys with the decline in its industrial base , and the low profitability of the livestock sector .

Proposals were put forward in 2004 to remove large parts of the forest .
