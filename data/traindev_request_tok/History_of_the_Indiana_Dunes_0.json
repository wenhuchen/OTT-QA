  "/wiki/Clovis_culture": "The Clovis culture is a prehistoric Paleoamerican culture , named for distinct stone tools found in close association with Pleistocene fauna at Blackwater Locality No . 1 near Clovis , New Mexico , in the 1920s and 1930s . It appears around 11,500-11,000 uncalibrated RCYBP at the end of the last glacial period , and is characterized by the manufacture of Clovis points and distinctive bone and ivory tools . Archaeologists ' most precise determinations at present suggest this radiocarbon age is equal to roughly 13,200 to 12,900 calendar years ago . Clovis people are considered to be the ancestors of most of the indigenous cultures of the Americas . The only human burial that has been directly associated with tools from the Clovis culture included the remains of an infant boy researchers named Anzick-1 . Paleogenetic analyses of Anzick-1 's ancient nuclear , mitochondrial , and Y-chromosome DNA reveal that Anzick-1 is closely related to modern Native American populations , which lends support to the Beringia hypothesis for the settlement of the Americas . The Clovis culture was replaced by several more localized regional societies from the Younger Dryas cold-climate period onward . Post-Clovis cultures include the Folsom tradition , Gainey , Suwannee-Simpson , Plainview-Goshen , Cumberland , and Redstone . Each of these is thought to derive directly from Clovis , in some cases apparently differing only in the length of the fluting on their projectile points . Although this is generally held to be the result of normal cultural change through time , numerous other reasons have been suggested as driving forces to explain changes in the archaeological record , such as the Younger Dryas postglacial climate change which exhibited numerous faunal extinctions . After the discovery of several Clovis sites in eastern North America in the 1930s , the Clovis people came to be regarded as the first human inhabitants who created a widespread culture in the New World .",
  "/wiki/Paleo-Indians": "Paleo-Indians , Paleoindians or Paleoamericans , were the first peoples who entered , and subsequently inhabited , the Americas during the final glacial episodes of the late Pleistocene period . The prefix paleo- comes from the Greek adjective palaios ( \u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2 ) , meaning old or ancient . The term Paleo-Indians applies specifically to the lithic period in the Western Hemisphere and is distinct from the term Paleolithic . Traditional theories suggest that big-animal hunters crossed the Bering Strait from North Asia into the Americas over a land-and-ice bridge ( Beringia ) . This bridge existed from 45,000 to 12,000 BCE ( 47,000-14,000 BP ) . Small isolated groups of hunter-gatherers migrated alongside herds of large herbivores far into Alaska . From c. 16,500 - c. 13,500 BCE ( c. 18,500 - c. 15,500 BP ) , ice-free corridors developed along the Pacific coast and valleys of North America . This allowed animals , followed by humans , to migrate south into the interior of the continent . The people went on foot or used primitive boats along the coastline . The precise dates and routes of the peopling of the New World remain subjects of ongoing debate . At least two morphologically different Paleo-Indian populations were coexisting in different geographical areas of Mexico 10,000 years ago . Stone tools , particularly projectile points and scrapers , are the primary evidence of the earliest human activity in the Americas .",

  "/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States": "Native Americans , also known as American Indians , Indigenous Americans and other terms , are the indigenous peoples of the United States , except Hawaii and territories of the United States . More than 570 federally recognized tribes live within the US , about half of which are associated with Indian reservations . The term American Indian excludes Native Hawaiians and some Alaskan Natives , while Native Americans ( as defined by the US Census ) are American Indians , plus Alaska Natives of all ethnicities . The US Census does not include Native Hawaiians or Chamorro , instead being included in the Census grouping of Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander . The ancestors of living Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago , possibly much earlier , from Asia via Beringia . A vast variety of peoples , societies and cultures subsequently developed . Native Americans were greatly affected by the European colonization of the Americas , which began in 1492 , and their population declined precipitously overwhelmingly due to introduced diseases as well as warfare , including biological warfare , territorial confiscation and slavery . After its creation , the United States , as part of its policy of settler colonialism , waged war and perpetrated massacres against many Native American peoples , removed them from their ancestral lands , and subjected them to one-sided treaties and to discriminatory government policies into the 20th century . Since the 1960s , Native American self-determination movements have resulted in changes to the lives of Native Americans , though there are still many contemporary issues faced by Native Americans . Today , there are over five million Native Americans in the United States , 78% of whom live outside reservations . When the United States was created , established Native American tribes were generally considered semi-independent nations , as they generally lived in communities separate from British settlers . The federal government signed treaties at a government-to-government level until the Indian Appropriations Act of 1871 ended recognition of independent native nations , and started treating them as domestic dependent nations subject to federal law .",
  "/wiki/Glacial_Kame_Culture": "The Glacial Kame Culture was a culture of Archaic people in North America that occupied southern Ontario , Michigan , Ohio and Indiana from around 8000 BC to 1000 BC . The name of this culture derives from its members ' practice of burying their dead atop glacier-deposited gravel hills . Among the most common types of artifacts found at Glacial Kame sites are shells of marine animals and goods manufactured from a copper ore , knows as float copper . The type site for Glacial Kame is the Ridgeway Site near the village of Ridgeway in Hardin County , Ohio . The site was discovered in 1856 by workers building a railroad line nearby , who mined the kame for ballast ; the supervisor 's detailed report of the excavation has survived to the present day and is a premier resource for the culture . Archaeologists specializing in Ohio became familiar with Glacial Kame sooner than with the state 's other cultures ; even as late as the 1930s , Glacial Kame sites were the only widely known ones other than some later sites on the Lake Erie shoreline and a few large Hopewellian geometric earthworks in the southern part of the state . Other regional cultures include the Maple Creek Culture of southwestern Ohio , Red Ocher Culture and Old Copper Culture of Wisconsin . For a time , it was thought that the Glacial Kame Culture did not produce ceramics , but this understanding was disproven by the discovery of basic pottery at the Zimmerman Site near Roundhead , Ohio . Excavation of Glacial Kame sites frequently yields few projectile points - some of the most important sites have yielded no projectile points at all - and their few points that have been found are of diverse styles . For this reason , it appears that different groups of Glacial Kame peoples independently developed different methods of manufacturing their projectile points . This diversity appears even in the culture 's heartland in Champaign , Hardin , and Logan counties in western Ohio ; one large Logan County site yielded just three points , each of which was significantly different from the other two .",
  "/wiki/Red_Ocher_people": "The Red Ocher people were an indigenous people of North America . A series of archaeological sites located in the Upper Great Lakes , the Greater Illinois River Valley , and the Ohio River Valley in the American Midwest have been discovered to be a Red Ocher burial complex , dating from 1000 BC to 400 BC , the Terminal Archaic - Early Woodland period . Characterized as shallow burials located in sandy ridges along river valleys , covered in red ochre or hydrated iron oxide ( FeH3O ) , they contain diagnostic artifacts that include caches of flint points , turkey-tails , and various forms of worked copper . Turkey-tails are large flint blades of a distinct type . It is believed that Red Ocher people spoke an ancestral form of the Algonquian languages . Red ochre has a long history of use in North America ; as early as the Folsom tradition during the Paleo-Indian period , certain localities in New Mexico and Wyoming were being mined for the substance . The people today known as Red Ocher were first identified by the University of Chicago in 1937 . During the late 1950s and early 1960s , the Red Ocher Culture was a topic of great interest among archaeologists who were trying to better define the burial culture through various methods of research . Since then intermittent archaeological works have been published dealing with specific sub-topics within the burial culture and supported by more reliable AMS carbon dates . Nevertheless , many important archaeological questions regarding the Red Ocher burial manifestation and cultural phenomenon are still without answers .",
  "/wiki/Old_Copper_Complex": "Old Copper Complex is a term used for ancient Native North American societies known to have been heavily involved in the utilization of copper for weaponry and tools . The evidence of smelting or alloying that has been found is subject to some dispute and a common assumption by archaeologists is that objects were cold-worked into shape . Artifacts from some of these sites have been dated from 4000 to 1000 BCE . Furthermore , some archaeologists find artifactual and structural evidence of casting by Hopewellian and Mississippian peoples to be demonstrated in the archaeological record .",
  "/wiki/Woodland_period": "In the classification of archaeological cultures of North America , the Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures spanned a period from roughly 1000 BCE to European contact in the eastern part of North America , with some archaeologists distinguishing the Mississippian period , from 1000 CE to European contact as a separate period . The term Woodland Period was introduced in the 1930s as a generic term for prehistoric sites falling between the Archaic hunter-gatherers and the agriculturalist Mississippian cultures . The Eastern Woodlands cultural region covers what is now eastern Canada south of the Subarctic region , the Eastern United States , along to the Gulf of Mexico . This period is variously considered a developmental stage , a time period , a suite of technological adaptations or traits , and a family tree of cultures related to earlier Archaic cultures . It can be characterized as a chronological and cultural manifestation without any massive changes in a short time but instead having a continuous development in stone and bone tools , leather crafting , textile manufacture , cultivation , and shelter construction . Many Woodland peoples used spears and atlatls until the end of the period , when they were replaced by bows and arrows ; however , Southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns . The most cited technological distinction of this period was the widespread use of pottery ( although pottery manufacture had arisen during the Archaic period in some places ) , and the diversification of pottery forms , decorations , and manufacturing practices . The increasing use of horticulture and the development of the Eastern Agricultural Complex , consisting of weedy seed plants as well as gourd cultivation , also meant that groups became less mobile over time and , in some times and places , people lived in permanently occupied villages and cities . Intensive agriculture characterizes the Mississippian period from c. 1000-1400 CE and may have continued up to European contact , around 500 years ago .",

  "/wiki/Goodall_Focus_(Hopewellian_Culture)": "The Goodall Focus was a Hopewellian culture from the Middle Woodland period peoples that occupied Western Michigan and northern Indiana from around 200 BCE to 500 CE . Extensive trade networks existed at this time , particularly among the many local cultural expressions of the Hopewell communities . The Goodall pattern stretched from the southern tip of Lake Michigan , east across northern Indiana , to the Ohio border , then northward , covering central Michigan , almost reaching to Saginaw Bay on the east and Grand Traverse Bay to the north . The culture is named for the Goodall Site in northwest Indiana .",
  "/wiki/Hopewell_tradition": "The Hopewell tradition ( also called the Hopewell culture ) describes the common aspects of the Native American culture that flourished along rivers in the northeastern and midwestern Eastern Woodlands from 100 BCE to 500 CE , in the Middle Woodland period . The Hopewell tradition was not a single culture or society , but a widely dispersed set of related populations . They were connected by a common network of trade routes , known as the Hopewell exchange system . At its greatest extent , the Hopewell exchange system ran from the Crystal River Indian Mounds in modern-day Florida as far north as the northern shores of Lake Ontario . Within this area , societies participated in a high degree of exchange with the highest amount of activity along waterways . The Hopewell exchange system received materials from all over what is now occupied by the United States . Most of the items traded were exotic materials and were received by people living in the major trading and manufacturing areas . These people then converted the materials into products and exported them through local and regional exchange networks . The objects created by the Hopewell exchange system spread far and wide and have been seen in many burials outside the Midwest .",
  "/wiki/Fort_Ancient": "Fort Ancient is a name for a Native American culture that flourished from Ca . 1000-1750 CE and predominantly inhabited land near the Ohio River valley in the areas of modern-day southern Ohio , northern Kentucky , southeastern Indiana and western West Virginia . Although a contemporary of the Mississippian Culture , they are often considered a sister culture and distinguished from the Mississippian Culture . Although far from agreed upon , there is evidence to suggest that the Fort Ancient Culture were not the direct descendants of the Hopewellian Culture . It is suspected that the Fort Ancient Culture introduced maize agriculture to Ohio . The Fort Ancient Culture were most likely the builders of the Great Serpent Mound .",
  "/wiki/Oneota": "Oneota is a designation archaeologists use to refer to a cultural complex that existed in the eastern plains and Great Lakes area of what is now occupied by the United States from around AD 900 to around 1650 or 1700 . Based on classification defined in Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips ' 1958 book Method and Theory in American Archaeology , the Oneota culture belongs to formative stage . The culture is believed to have transitioned into various Siouan cultures of the protohistoric and historic times , such as the Ioway [ citation needed ] . A long-accepted ancestry to the Ho-chunk has yet to be conclusively demonstrated . Oneota is considered a major component of Upper Mississippian culture . It is characterized by globular , shell-tempered pottery that is often coarse in fibre . Pieces often had a spherical body , short necks and/or a flat lip . Sometimes the vessels had strap handles . Decoration includes wavy and zigzag lines , often in parallel . Most decoration was done on the top half of the vessel . Analytically , the culture has been broken down into various stages or horizons . Generally accepted are the following :",
  "/wiki/Mississippian_culture": "The Mississippian culture was a mound-building Native American civilization that flourished in what is now the Midwestern , Eastern , and Southeastern United States from approximately 800 to 1600 , varying regionally . It was composed of a series of urban settlements and satellite villages ( suburbs ) linked together by loose trading networks . The largest city was Cahokia , believed to be a major religious center . The Mississippian way of life began to develop in the Mississippi River Valley ( for which it is named ) . Cultures in the tributary Tennessee River Valley may have also begun to develop Mississippian characteristics at this point . Almost all dated Mississippian sites predate 1539-1540 ( when Hernando de Soto explored the area ) , with notable exceptions being Natchez communities that maintained Mississippian cultural practices into the 18th century .",

They traditionally speak the Potawatomi language , a member of the Algonquian family . The Potawatomi call themselves Neshnab\u00e9 , a cognate of the word Anishinaabe . The Potawatomi are part of a long-term alliance , called the Council of Three Fires , with the Ojibwe and Odawa ( Ottawa ) . In the Council of Three Fires , the Potawatomi are considered the youngest brother and are referred to in this context as Bod\u00e9wadmi , a name that means keepers of the fire and refers to the council fire of three peoples . In the 19th century , they were pushed to the west by European/American encroachment in the late 18th century and removed from their lands in the Great Lakes region to reservations in Oklahoma . Under Indian Removal , they eventually ceded many of their lands , and most of the Potawatomi relocated to Nebraska , Kansas , and Indian Territory , now in Oklahoma . Some bands survived in the Great Lakes region and today are federally recognized as tribes . In Canada , there are over 20 First Nation bands ."
