Sixteen years after the American League expanded from 12 to 14 teams , the National League finally followed suit , with the Colorado Rockies and the Florida Marlins ( now the Miami Marlins ) joining the NL .

The Toronto Blue Jays capped off the season by winning their second consecutive World Series title , beating the Philadelphia Phillies in six games .

The team began play as an expansion team in the 1993 season as the Florida Marlins and played home games from their inaugural season to the 2012 season at what was originally called Joe Robbie Stadium , which they shared with the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League ( NFL ) . Since the 2012 season , they have played at Marlins Park in downtown Miami , on the site of the former Orange Bowl . The new park , unlike their previous home ( which was criticized in its baseball configuration for poor sight lines in some locations ) , was designed foremost as a baseball park . Per an agreement with the city and Miami-Dade County ( which owns the park ) , the Marlins officially changed their name to the Miami Marlins on November 11 , 2011 . They also adopted a new logo , color scheme , and uniforms . The Marlins have the distinction of winning a World Series championship in every postseason they have qualified for to date , having won the World Series in 1997 and 2003 as National League wild card team . They also have the distinction of being the only franchise in the major four North American professional sports leagues ( MLB , NBA , NFL , NHL ) to have never lost a playoff round . They defeated the American League ( AL ) champion Cleveland Indians in the 1997 World Series , with shortstop \u00c9dgar Renter\u00eda driving in second baseman Craig Counsell for the series-clinching run in the 11th inning of the seventh and deciding game .",
  "/wiki/National_League_East": "The National League East is one of Major League Baseball 's six divisions . The Atlanta Braves have the most National League East titles ( 14 ) . Most of Atlanta 's NL East titles came during a record stretch of reaching MLB playoffs 14 consecutive times ( there were no playoffs in 1994 and the first three titles of that streak came when the Braves were in the National League West . ) Along with the American League Central it is one of two divisions to have every member win at least one World Series title . The division was created when the National League ( along with the American League ) added two expansion teams and divided into two divisions , East and West effective for the 1969 season . The National League 's geographical alignment was rather peculiar as its partitioning was really more north and south instead of east and west . Two teams in the Eastern Time Zone , the Atlanta Braves and the Cincinnati Reds , were in the same division as teams on the Pacific coast . This was due to the demands of the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals , who refused to support expansion unless they were promised they would be kept together in the newly created East division . During the two-division era , from 1969 to 1993 , the Philadelphia Phillies and the Pittsburgh Pirates together owned more than half of the division titles , having won a combined 15 of 25 championships during that span . They were also the only teams in the division to have won consecutive titles during that span . When the National League realigned into three divisions in 1994 , the Pittsburgh Pirates were originally supposed to stay in the East while the Braves were to be moved to the newly created National League Central . However , the Braves , wanting to form a natural rivalry with the expansion Florida Marlins , elected to be placed in the East .",

The Pirates are also often referred to as the Bucs or the Buccos ( derived from buccaneer , a synonym for pirate ) . The team plays its home games at PNC Park , its home since 2001 . The Pirates previously played at Forbes Field from 1909-1970 and at Three Rivers Stadium , so named because of its location near the confluence of the Allegheny , Monongahela , and Ohio rivers , from 1970-2000 . The franchise joined the NL in its eighth season in 1887 and was competitive from its early years , winning three NL titles from 1901 to 1903 , playing in the inaugural World Series in 1903 and winning their first World Series in 1909 behind Honus Wagner . The Pirates have had many ups and downs during their long history , most famously winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a series-winning walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski , the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run . They also won the 1971 World Series , led by the talent of Roberto Clemente , and the 1979 World Series under the slogan We Are Family , led by Pops Willie Stargell . After a run of regular-season success in the early 1990s ( winning three straight NL East Division titles ) , the Pirates struggled mightily over the following 20 years , with 20 consecutive losing seasons from 1993 to 2012 - the longest such streak in American professional sports history - before posting a winning record in 2013 of 94-68 , qualifying them for the NL Wild Card .

However , the Braves , wanting to form a natural rivalry with the expansion Florida Marlins , requested to remain in the East . Despite the Marlins offering to go to the Central , the Pirates instead gave up their spot in the East to the Braves . Since then , the Pirates have tried several times unsuccessfully to be placed back in the East . In 1998 , the NL Central became the largest division in Major League Baseball when the Milwaukee Brewers were moved in from the American League Central .

The game-winning hit in Game 5 , in which Edgar Mart\u00ednez drove home Ken Griffey Jr. to win the game in the 11th inning , clinched a series win for the Mariners , served as a powerful impetus to preserve baseball in Seattle , and has since become an iconic moment in team history .

The team 's board voted 6-1 on the name , with the only opposition coming from team owner Ewing Kauffman , who eventually changed his vote and said the name had grown on him . Entering the American League in 1969 along with the Seattle Pilots , the club was founded by Kansas City businessman Ewing Kauffman .",
