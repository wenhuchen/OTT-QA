  "/wiki/Manned_Orbital_Laboratory": "The Manned Orbiting Laboratory ( MOL ) , originally referred to as the Manned Orbital Laboratory , was a never-flown part of the United States Air Force 's human spaceflight program , a successor to the canceled Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar military reconnaissance space plane project . The project was developed from several early Air Force and NASA concepts of crewed space stations to be used for reconnaissance purposes . MOL evolved into a single-use laboratory , with which crews would be launched on 40-day missions and return to Earth using a Gemini B spacecraft , derived from NASA 's Project Gemini . The MOL program was announced to the public on 10 December 1963 as an inhabited platform to prove the utility of putting people in space for military missions . Astronauts selected for the program were later told of the reconnaissance mission for the program . The contractor for the MOL was the Douglas Aircraft Company . The Gemini B was externally similar to NASA 's Gemini spacecraft , although it underwent several modifications , including the addition of a circular hatch through the heat shield , which allowed passage between the spacecraft and the laboratory . MOL was canceled in 1969 , during the height of the Apollo program , when it was shown that uncrewed reconnaissance satellites could achieve the same objectives much more cost-effectively . U.S. space station development was instead pursued with the civilian NASA Skylab ( Apollo Applications Program ) which flew in the mid-1970s . In the 1970s , the Soviet Union launched three Almaz military space stations , similar in intent to the MOL , but cancelled the program in 1977 for the same reasons . There is a MOL space suit on display at the Oklahoma City Science Museum , presumably never used .",

Aldrin made three spacewalks as pilot of the 1966 Gemini 12 mission , and as the lunar module pilot on the 1969 Apollo 11 mission , he and mission commander Neil Armstrong were the first two humans to land on the Moon . Born in Glen Ridge , New Jersey , Aldrin graduated third in the class of 1951 from the United States Military Academy at West Point , with a degree in mechanical engineering . He was commissioned into the United States Air Force , and served as a jet fighter pilot during the Korean War . He flew 66 combat missions and shot down two MiG-15 aircraft . After earning a Sc.D . degree in astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Aldrin was selected as a member of NASA 's Astronaut Group 3 , making him the first astronaut with a doctoral degree . His doctoral thesis was Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous , earning him the nickname Dr. Rendezvous from fellow astronauts . His first space flight was in 1966 on Gemini 12 during which he spent over five hours on extravehicular activity . Three years later , Aldrin set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21 , 1969 ( UTC ) , nineteen minutes after Armstrong first touched the surface , while command module pilot Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit . A Presbyterian elder , Aldrin became the first person to hold a religious ceremony on the Moon when he privately took communion . Upon leaving NASA in 1971 , Aldrin became Commandant of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School .",
  "/wiki/Gemini_12": "Gemini 12 ( officially Gemini XII ) was a 1966 crewed spaceflight in NASA 's Project Gemini . It was the 10th and final crewed Gemini flight , the 18th crewed American spaceflight , and the 26th spaceflight of all time , including X-15 flights over 100 kilometers ( 54 nmi ) . Commanded by Gemini VII veteran James A. Lovell , the flight featured three periods of extravehicular activity ( EVA ) by rookie Edwin Buzz Aldrin , lasting a total of 5 hours and 30 minutes . It also achieved the fifth rendezvous and fourth docking with an Agena target vehicle . Gemini XII marked a successful conclusion of the Gemini program , achieving the last of its goals by successfully demonstrating that astronauts can effectively work outside of spacecraft . This was instrumental in paving the way for the Apollo program to achieve its goal of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s .",

Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin formed the American crew that landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 , 1969 , at 20:17 UTC . Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours and 39 minutes later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC ; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later . They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft , and they collected 47.5 pounds ( 21.5 kg ) of lunar material to bring back to Earth . Command module pilot Michael Collins flew the Command Module Columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon 's surface . Armstrong and Aldrin spent 21 hours , 36 minutes on the lunar surface at a site they named Tranquility Base before lifting off to rejoin Columbia in lunar orbit . Apollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island , Florida , on July 16 at 13:32 UTC , and it was the fifth crewed mission of NASA 's Apollo program . The Apollo spacecraft had three parts : a command module ( CM ) with a cabin for the three astronauts , the only part that returned to Earth ; a service module ( SM ) , which supported the command module with propulsion , electrical power , oxygen , and water ; and a lunar module ( LM ) that had two stages - a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit . After being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V 's third stage , the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit . Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility on July 20 . The astronauts used Eagle 's ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module . They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth .",

  "/wiki/STS-125": "STS-125 , or HST-SM4 ( Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Mission 4 ) , was the fifth and final Space Shuttle mission to the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) and the last solo flight of the Space Shuttle Atlantis . [ NASA 4 ] The launch of the Space Shuttle Atlantis occurred on 11 May 2009 at 2:01 pm EDT . Landing occurred on 24 May at 11:39 am EDT , with the mission lasting a total of just under 13 days . Space Shuttle Atlantis carried two new instruments to the Hubble Space Telescope , the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph and the Wide Field Camera 3 . The mission also replaced a Fine Guidance Sensor , six gyroscopes , and two battery unit modules to allow the telescope to continue to function at least through 2014 . The crew also installed new thermal blanket insulating panels to provide improved thermal protection , and a soft-capture mechanism that would aid in the safe de-orbiting of the telescope by a robotic spacecraft at the end of its operational lifespan . [ NASA 5 ] The mission also carried an IMAX camera with which the crew documented the progress of the mission for the 2010 IMAX film , Hubble . [ NASA 6 ] The crew of STS-125 included three astronauts who had previous experience servicing Hubble . [ NASA 3 ] [ NASA 7 ] Scott Altman visited Hubble in 2002 as commander of STS-109 , the fourth Hubble servicing mission . [ NASA 8 ] John Grunsfeld , an astronomer , has serviced Hubble twice , performing a total of five spacewalks on STS-103 in 1999 and STS-109 . [ NASA 8 ] Michael Massimino served with both Altman and Grunsfeld on STS-109 , and performed two spacewalks to service the telescope .

  "/wiki/Soyuz_MS-10": "Soyuz MS-10 was a crewed Soyuz MS spaceflight which aborted shortly after launch on 11 October 2018 due to a failure of the Soyuz-FG launch vehicle boosters . MS-10 was the 139th flight of a Soyuz spacecraft . It was intended to transport two members of the Expedition 57 crew to the International Space Station . A few minutes after liftoff , the craft went into contingency abort due to a booster failure and had to return to Earth . By the time the contingency abort was declared , the launch escape system ( LES ) tower had already been ejected and the capsule was pulled away from the rocket using the launch escape solid rocket motors on the capsule fairing . Both crew members , Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksey Ovchinin and NASA astronaut Nick Hague , were recovered alive and in good health . The MS-10 flight abort was the first instance of a Russian crewed booster accident in 35 years , since Soyuz T-10-1 exploded on the launch pad in September 1983 .

The mission ended on 9 August 2005 when Discovery landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California . Poor weather over the Kennedy Space Center in Florida hampered the shuttle from using its primary landing site . Analysis of the launch footage showed debris separating from the external tank during ascent ; this was of particular concern because it was the issue that had set off the Columbia disaster .
