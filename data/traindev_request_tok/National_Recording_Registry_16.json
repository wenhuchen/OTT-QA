It originated during the 9th century in Central Europe , providing the nascent Ashkenazi community with a High German-based vernacular fused with elements taken from Hebrew and Aramaic as well as from Slavic languages and traces of Romance languages . Yiddish writing uses the Hebrew alphabet . The earliest surviving references date from the 12th century and call the language \u05dc\u05e9\u05d5\u05df\u05be\u05d0\u05b7\u05e9\u05db\u05bc\u05e0\u05d6 ( loshn-ashknaz , language of Ashkenaz ) or \u05d8\u05f2\u05b7\u05d8\u05e9 ( taytsh ) , a variant of tiutsch , the contemporary name for Middle High German .

In the late 19th and into the 20th century the language was more commonly called Jewish , especially in non-Jewish contexts , [ clarification needed ] but Yiddish is again the more common designation today .

  "/wiki/Cello_Suites_(Bach)": "The six Cello Suites , BWV 1007-1012 , are suites for unaccompanied cello by Johann Sebastian Bach . They are some of the most frequently performed and recognizable solo compositions ever written for cello . Bach most likely composed them during the period 1717-23 , when he served as Kapellmeister in K\u00f6then . The title given on the cover of the Anna Magdalena Bach manuscript was Suites \u00e0 Violoncello Solo senza Basso ( Suites for cello solo without bass ) . As usual in a Baroque musical suite , after the prelude which begins each suite , all the other movements are based around baroque dance types ; the cello suites are structured in six movements each : prelude , allemande , courante , sarabande , two minuets or two bourr\u00e9es or two gavottes , and a final gigue . The Bach cello suites are considered to be among the most profound of all classical music works . Wilfrid Mellers described them in 1980 as Monophonic music wherein a man has created a dance of God . Due to the works ' technical demands , \u00e9tude-like nature , and difficulty in interpretation because of the non-annotated nature of the surviving copies , the cello suites were little known and rarely publicly performed until they were revived and recorded by Pablo Casals in the early 20th century . They have since been performed and recorded by many renowned cellists and have been transcribed for numerous other instruments ; they are considered some of Bach 's greatest musical achievements .",

He is generally regarded as the pre-eminent cellist of the first half of the 20th century and one of the greatest cellists of all time .

  "/wiki/Super_Fly_(soundtrack)": "Super Fly is the third studio album by American soul musician Curtis Mayfield , released in July 1972 on Curtom Records . It was released as the soundtrack for the Blaxploitation film of the same name . Widely considered a classic of 1970s soul and funk music , Super Fly was a nearly immediate hit . Its sales were bolstered by two million-selling singles , Freddie 's Dead ( number 2 R & B charts , number 4 Pop charts ) and the title track ( number 5 R & B , number 8 Pop ) . Super Fly is one of the few soundtracks to out-gross the film it accompanied . Super Fly , along with Marvin Gaye 's What 's Going On ( 1971 ) , was one of the pioneering soul concept albums , with its then-unique socially aware lyrics about poverty and drug abuse making the album stand out . The film and the soundtrack may be perceived as dissonant , since the film holds rather ambiguous views on drug dealers , whereas Curtis Mayfield 's position is far more critical . Like What 's Going On , the album was a surprise hit that record executives felt had little chance at significant sales . Due to its success , Mayfield was tapped for several film soundtracks over the course of the decade .",
