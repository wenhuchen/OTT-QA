  "/wiki/Arkansas_Post": "The Arkansas Post ( French : Poste de Arkansea ) was the first European settlement in the lower Mississippi River Valley and present-day Arkansas when Henri de Tonti established it in 1686 as a French trading post on the banks of the lower Arkansas River . The French and Spanish traded with the Quapaw for years , and the post was of strategic value to the French , Spanish , and Americans . It was designated as the first capital of the Arkansas Territory in 1819 , but lost that status to Little Rock in 1821 . During the years of fur trading , Arkansas Post was protected by a series of forts . The forts and associated settlements were located at three known sites and possibly a fourth , as the waterfront area was prone to erosion and flooding . The land encompassing the second ( and fourth ) Arkansas Post site ( Red Bluff ) was designated as a state park in 1929 . In 1960 about 758 acres ( 307 ha ) of land at the site were protected as a National Memorial and National Historic Landmark ; it commemorates the history of several cultures and time periods : the Quapaw , the French settlers who inhabited the small entrep\u00f4t as the first Arkansans , Spanish rule , an American Revolutionary War skirmish in 1783 , the first territorial capital of Arkansas , and an American Civil War battle in 1863 . Three archeological excavations have been conducted at the site , beginning in the 1950s . Experts say the most extensive cultural resources at the site are archeological , both for the 18th and 19th-century settlements , and the earlier Quapaw villages . Due to changes in the river and navigation measures , the water level has risen closer to the height of the bluffs , which used to be well above the river . The site is now considered low lying . Erosion and construction on the river have resulted in the remains of three of the historic forts being under water in the river channel .",

Although nominally considered a tributary of the Mississippi , the Missouri River above the confluence is much longer and carries a comparable volume of water . When combined with the lower Mississippi River , it forms the world 's fourth longest river system . For over 12,000 years , people have depended on the Missouri River and its tributaries as a source of sustenance and transportation . More than ten major groups of Native Americans populated the watershed , most leading a nomadic lifestyle and dependent on enormous bison herds that roamed through the Great Plains . The first Europeans encountered the river in the late seventeenth century , and the region passed through Spanish and French hands before becoming part of the United States through the Louisiana Purchase . The Missouri River was one of the main routes for the westward expansion of the United States during the 19th century . The growth of the fur trade in the early 19th century laid much of the groundwork as trappers explored the region and blazed trails . Pioneers headed west en masse beginning in the 1830s , first by covered wagon , then by the growing numbers of steamboats that entered service on the river .

Kansas is named after the Kansas River , which in turn was named after the Kansa Native Americans who lived along its banks . The tribe 's name ( natively kk\u0105 : ze ) is often said to mean people of the ( south ) wind although this was probably not the term 's original meaning . For thousands of years , what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes . Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys . Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison . Kansas was first settled by Americans in 1827 with the establishment of Fort Leavenworth . The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s , in the midst of political wars over the slavery debate . When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the Kansas-Nebraska Act , abolitionist Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a free state or a slave state . Thus , the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided , and was known as Bleeding Kansas .",

  "/wiki/Fort_Conti": "Fort Conti was built in early 1679 at the mouth of the Niagara River on Lake Ontario as a post for the French explorer Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier , Sieur de La Salle . Because of the fort 's location , the French hoped to control the fur trade in the lower Great Lakes . The fort was named after Louis Armand I , Prince of Conti , the patron of La Salle 's lieutenant , Henri de Tonti . The storehouse and stockade were used as a shifting point for ships coming from Fort Frontenac ( modern day Kingston , Ontario ) ; the supplies would then be further shipped by canoes or bateaux up the river to current day Lewiston , New York , portaged up the Niagara Escarpment and carried past Niagara Falls to a place where the swift currents would not endanger the supplies , craft or crew . At this place , believed to be somewhere around current-day La Salle , New York ( part of the city of Niagara Falls , New York , local historians place the site on Cayuga Island in Jayne Park . [ citation needed ] ) La Salle built a larger boat ( most likely a reassembled boat taken apart at Fort Conti [ citation needed ] ) , and christened it Le Griffon and used her for the exploration of the river and Lake Erie in his search for a passage to the East Indies . In the summer of 1679 the fort was garrisoned by a handful of men while La Salle explored the upper lakes ; The men returned to Fort Frontenac saying it was burned by Indian raiders ; probably a cover to escape a brutal windswept winter on the shores of Ontario . The story is unlikely because natives in the area did not begin to become hostile until a few years later . [ citation needed ] Nonetheless the fort burned in late 1679 , and was never rebuilt . Later the site would serve the French as Fort Denonville , which failed after less than a year , and later as the more permanent Fort Niagara which still stands today .
