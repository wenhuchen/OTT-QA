Asquith by his first wife , Cyril Asquith followed the steps of his father and eldest brother into a distinguished academic career at Balliol College , Oxford , before serving in the British Army during the First World War . After the war he practised , with modest success , at the common law bar until 1938 , when he was appointed to the High Court . He was promoted to the Court of Appeal in 1946 and to the House of Lords in 1951 . The same year he was offered the Lord Chancellorship by Winston Churchill , but declined the post . Asquith was widely regarded as possessing one of the finest minds on the bench , although his rapid rise , after an unremarkable career at the bar , was the cause for some adverse comment . According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography , his career was an undistinguished - although extraordinarily lucky one .",

He was called to the bar of England and Wales in 1923 , and became a King 's Counsel in 1938 .

He was made a Lord Justice of Appeal in 1948 after less than five years in the High Court . He became a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary in 1957 and after five years in the House of Lords returned to the Court of Appeal as Master of the Rolls in 1962 , a position he held for twenty years . In retirement he wrote several books and continued to offer opinions on the state of the common law through his writing and his position in the House of Lords . Margaret Thatcher said that Denning was probably the greatest English judge of modern times . Mark Garnett and Richard Weight argue that he was a conservative Christian who remained popular with morally conservative Britons who were dismayed at the postwar rise in crime and who , like him , believed that the duties of the individual were being forgotten in the clamour for rights . He had a more punitive than redemptive view of criminal justice , as a result of which he was a vocal supporter of corporal and capital punishment . Though he changed his stance on capital punishment in later life . Denning was one of the most publicly known judges thanks to his report on the Profumo affair . He was noted for his bold judgments running counter to the law at the time .",
  "/wiki/Master_of_the_Rolls": "The Keeper or Master of the Rolls and Records of the Chancery of England , known as the Master of the Rolls , is the President of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales , Civil Division , and Head of Civil Justice . As a judge , he is the second in seniority in England and Wales only to the Lord Chief Justice . The position dates from at least 1286 , although it is believed that the office probably existed earlier than that . The Master of the Rolls was initially a clerk responsible for keeping the Rolls or records of the Court of Chancery , and was known as the Keeper of the Rolls of Chancery . The Keeper was the most senior of the dozen Chancery clerks , and as such occasionally acted as keeper of the Great Seal of the Realm . The post evolved into a judicial one as the Court of Chancery did ; the first reference to judicial duties dates from 1520 . With the Judicature Act 1873 , which merged the Court of Chancery with the other major courts , the Master of the Rolls joined the Chancery Division of the High Court and the Court of Appeal , but left the Chancery Division by the terms of the Judicature Act 1881 . The Master of the Rolls had also been warden of the little-used Domus Conversorum for housing Jewish converts , which led to the house and chapel being used to store legal documents and later becoming the location of the Public Record Office . He retained his clerical functions as the nominal head of the Public Record Office until the Public Records Act 1958 transferred responsibility for it to the Lord Chancellor . One residual reminder of this role is the fact that the Master of the Rolls of the day continues to serve , ex officio , as President of the British Records Association . The Master of the Rolls was also previously responsible for registering solicitors , the officers of the Senior Courts . One of the most prominent people to hold the position was Thomas Cromwell , a highly influential figure during the reign of Henry VIII ; more recently , Lord Denning held the position for 20 years , from 1962 to 1982 , and made sweeping changes in the common law .",
