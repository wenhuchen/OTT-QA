Florence was a centre of medieval European trade and finance and one of the wealthiest cities of that era . It is considered by many academics the birthplace of the Renaissance , and has been called the Athens of the Middle Ages . Its turbulent political history includes periods of rule by the powerful Medici family and numerous religious and republican revolutions . From 1865 to 1871 the city served as the capital of the Kingdom of Italy ( established in 1861 ) . The Florentine dialect forms the base of Standard Italian and it became the language of culture throughout Italy due to the prestige of the masterpieces by Dante Alighieri , Petrarch , Giovanni Boccaccio , Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli and Francesco Guicciardini . The city attracts millions of tourists each year , and UNESCO declared the Historic Centre of Florence a World Heritage Site in 1982 .

  "/wiki/Republic_of_Florence": "The Republic of Florence , also known as the Florentine Republic ( Italian : Repubblica Fiorentina , pronounced [ re\u02c8pubblika fjoren\u02c8ti\u02d0na ] , or Repubblica di Firenze ) , was a medieval and early modern state that was centered on the Italian city of Florence in Tuscany . The republic originated in 1115 , when the Florentine people rebelled against the Margraviate of Tuscany upon the death of Matilda of Tuscany , who controlled vast territories that included Florence . The Florentines formed a commune in her successors ' place . The republic was ruled by a council known as the Signoria of Florence . The signoria was chosen by the gonfaloniere ( titular ruler of the city ) , who was elected every two months by Florentine guild members . The Republic , despite having a large degree of autonomy , was formally part of the Holy Roman Empire throughout its existence . The republic had a checkered history of coups and counter-coups against various factions . The Medici faction gained governance of the city in 1434 under Cosimo de ' Medici . The Medici kept control of Florence until 1494 . Giovanni de ' Medici ( later Pope Leo X ) re-conquered the republic in 1512 . Florence repudiated Medici authority for a second time in 1527 , during the War of the League of Cognac . The Medici re-assumed their rule in 1531 after an 11-month siege of the city .",
  "/wiki/Bardi_family": "The Bardi family were an influential Florentine family that started the powerful banking company Compagnia dei Bardi . In the 14th century the Bardis lent Edward III of England 900,000 gold florins , a debt which he failed to repay along with 600,000 florins borrowed from the Peruzzi family , leading to the collapse of both families ' banks . During the 15th century the Bardi family continued to operate in various European centres , playing a notable role in financing some of the early voyages of discovery to America including those by Christopher Columbus and John Cabot . The nobility of the Bardi family has been documented since the year 1164 , when Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa relinquished the county of Vernio to Count Alberto along with the right to confer the noble title on his descendents . Countess Margherita , the last of Albertos line , sold Vernio to her son-in-law , Piero de Bardi . Albertos property included a castle and nine communes located 22 miles from Florence on an area that bordered the Mugello . During the fourteenth century the Bardi family became so powerful that the Florentine government considered them a threat . They eventually were forced to sell their castle to Florence because fortified castles near the city were seen as a danger to the republic . In the 1290s , the Bardi and Peruzzi families had established branches in England and were the main European bankers by the 1320s . By the fourteenth century the Bardi and the Peruzzi family grew tremendously wealthy by offering financial services . These two families facilitated trade by providing the merchants with bills of exchange , known today as checks . What made it so simple was that money paid by a debtor in one town could be paid out to creditor just by presenting the bill in another town .",
  "/wiki/Compagnia_dei_Bardi": "The Compagnia dei Bardi was a Florentine banking and trading company which was started by the Bardi family . The Bardi company was one of three major Florentine banking companies ( called super-companies by some modern scholars ) that assembled large amounts of capital and established wide-ranging , diversified business networks , doing business throughout the Mediterranean and in England . The Bardi traded oil and wine , and had close economic ties to southern Italy and Sicily . Their chief product , however , was high-quality woolen cloth . The Bardi were the largest of these super-companies and seem to have been 50 percent larger than their closest rival , the Peruzzi company . In 1344 , at about the same time as the Peruzzi company , the Bardi company went bankrupt and the Florentine writer Giovanni Villani blamed this on the repudiation of war loans by King Edward III of England . However , Villani was not an independent source ; his brother was a member of the Peruzzi company that also went bankrupt . Villanni said that Edward owed the Bardi 900,000 gold florins ( \u00a3135,000 ) and the Peruzzi 600,000 ( \u00a390,000 ) . However , the Peruzzi 's records show that they never had that much capital to lend Edward III . Edward did not default on all his loans and repaid some with cash and others with royal grants of wool , a principal export of the English economy at the time . At the time Florence was going through a period of internal disputes and the third largest financial company , the Acciaiuoli , also went bankrupt and they did not lend any money to Edward . What loans Edward III did default on are likely only to have contributed to the financial problems in Florence , not caused them .",

The Berenberg banking family became extinct in the male line with Elisabeth Berenberg ( 1749-1822 ) ; she was married to Johann Hinrich Gossler , who became a co-owner of the bank in 1769 . From the late 18th century , the Gossler family , as owners of Berenberg Bank , rose to great prominence in Hamburg , and was widely considered one of Hamburg 's two most prominent families , along with the related Amsinck family .

The family became the heads of a consortium of the prominent Guelfs that securely controlled Florence after the battle of Benevento in 1266 . In Florence , the Cerchi purchased some of the ancient structures in the closely packed inner city formerly belonging to the counts Guidi , cheek-by-jowl with the proud Florentine family of the Donati , with whom their growing mutual antagonism was expressed in violent episodes that polarized Florence within a couple of decades in a virtual civil war that aligned behind two captains , Corso Donati of the Neri Guelf faction - the Black Guelfs of the old noble oligarchy - and Vieri de ' Cerchi of the Bianchi , the moderate party that represented itself as champions of working people ( the magri ) . The resulting violence lasted , with irruptions of tranquility , into the fourteenth century . In 1289 a plot had been intercepted at Arezzo , by which the city 's bishop agreed to give over to the Florentines Bibbiena Civitella , and all the villages of his see , in return for a life annuity of 5,000 golden florins a year , guaranteed by the bank of the Cerchi . These rumors led to the confrontation of Guelfs and Ghibellines at the Battle of Campaldino , 11 June 1289 , in which the young Dante Alighieri took part and Vieri dei Cerchi lost his life . In the popular uprising of 2 May 1299 , the podest\u00e0 Corso Donati was expelled , and with him the Donati faction . The Cerchi faction prevailed . In May the following year a brawl between Donati and Cerchi erupted , in which one of the Cerchi had his nose slit , but plots to restore Donati , who had become podest\u00e0 of Orvieto , were unsuccessful . Matters were complicated when Pope Boniface VIII sent Carlo of Valois , brother of The king of France Philip IV to restore peace between Bianchi and Neri . He favoured the Neri : Dante , who had married Gemma Donati , was among those Bianchi dispossessed and banished in 1302 , and marked Boniface as destined for the eighth circle of Hell in his Inferno . In Florence , the house of the Alighieri was a few hundred paces from the cluster of tower houses of the Cerchi , which were restructured in the fourteenth century to form a rambling Palazzo dei Cerchi in the isolated block ( insula ) fronting via dei Cimatori and via della Condotta behind Piazza della Signoria .",

  "/wiki/Gondi_family": "The Florentine banking family of the Gondi were prominent financial partners of the Medici . Unlike the Medici , they were of the old Florentine nobility , tracing their line traditionally from the legendary Philippi , said to have been ennobled by Charlemagne himself , in 805 ; from him the Strozzi and the Gualfreducci also claimed their descent . With Orlando Bellicozzo , a member of the Great Council of Florence in 1197 , the Gondi emerge into history , receiving their patronymic from Gondo Gondi , sitting on the Great Council in 1251 , signatory to a treaty between Florence and Genoa in that year . In the fourteenth century several members of the family sat on the Great Council . Simon de Gondi renounced the Ghibelline party for himself and his house , in 1351 ; he loaned the Republic 8000 golden florins in a time of extremity . He held extensive lands round Valcava , in the Mugello , where the church bore the Gondi arms inside and out . Of Simon 's seven children , his grandson another Simon was the first of the Gondi to hold the position of Grand Prior of the Republic , on three occasions . His daughter Maddalena , who married Giovanni Salviati , by the marriage of her daughter Maria with Giovanni dalle Bande Nere , became the grandmother of Cosimo I de ' Medici ; thence were descended all the Catholic crowned heads of pre-Napoleonic Europe . Carlo de Gondi was a staunch backer of Piero de ' Medici , and when the Medici came to be Grand Dukes , the Gondi received empty but honorary titles of Senators . The Palazzo Gondi in Piazza San Firenze , Florence , the central seat of the family , was built from 1489 to 1495 to designs of Giuliano da Sangallo for Giuliano Gondi ; it later passed to the Orlandini [ citation needed ] . The cortile is enclosed by colonnaded loggias ; the staircase is remarkable for its fine balustrade infilled with animals and foliage .

  "/wiki/Hochstetter": "The family of H\u00f6chstetter ( also rendered Hechstetter or Hochstetter ) from H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt in western Bavaria near the banks of the Danube were members of the fifteenth and sixteenth-century mercantile patriciate of Augsburg . For a time , these international mercantile bankers and venture capitalists - whose most notorious member was Ambrosius H\u00f6chstetter ( 1463 - 1534 ) - were on a par with the Fugger and the Welser houses . Like other Augsburg bankers , they provided loans to Emperor Maximilian I ( reigned 1508-1519 ) . The accumulating wealth of Augsburg relied on control of metal ores - the gold , silver and copper of Bohemia , Slovakia , Hungary and the Tyrol - and their refining and marketing . The Hochstetter company drew upon investments as small as a few florins , but the total invested with him required Ambrosius H\u00f6chstetter to pay out up to a million florins a year in interest . He successfully cornered for brief periods local markets in ash timber , grain and certain wines . Grain hoarding is never a popular practice , and Ambrosius was accused [ by whom ? ] of adulterating the spices in which he traded . His son and son-in-law lost spectacular sums in gambling . Then in 1529 Ambrosius H\u00f6chstetter tried to engross the whole quicksilver stock in a cartel ; this failed attempt to corner the market led to his bankruptcy ( 1529 ) for 800,000 gulden , for which he would die in prison . Rising prices bring out a hidden supply , and the size of the required investment had become too large for even the greatest merchant-banking house to monopolize , as the Fuggers discovered with their attempt on the copper market . Figures representing the enormous profits of the Hochstetter at their height became public after a certain Bartholomew Rem invested 900 gulden in the Hochstetter company in 1511 ; by 1517 he claimed a profit of 33,000 gulden .",

The town is the seat of the municipal association H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt an der Donau , which includes the towns Blindheim , Finningen , Lutzingen and Schwenningen . In the fifteenth and sixteenth century , the wealthy mercantile family H\u00f6chstetter , which came from the town , was part of the mercantile patriciate of Augsburg . In the early 18th century , the town was the site of two battles . The first Battle of H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt ( German : Schlacht von H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt ) on 20 September 1703 cost over 5,000 lives . A year later in 1704 , the Battle of Blenheim ( or Second Battle of H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt also German : Schlacht von H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt ) between the Austrian and British forces ( led by John Churchill , 1st Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene of Savoy ) on the one side , and Bavarian and French troops ( commanded by Maximilian II Emanuel , Elector of Bavaria , and the Comte de Tallard ) on the other side . The carnage of that battle was so horrific ( over 20,000 men had died at the end of the day ) that farmers are said to still dig up skulls from the fields today , as described in the poem After Blenheim , written by Robert Southey , which tells about children finding the skull of one of the . many thousand men , said he , Were slain in that great victory .

The family originated in the Mugello region of Tuscany , and prospered gradually until it was able to fund the Medici Bank . This bank was the largest in Europe during the 15th century , and it facilitated the Medicis ' rise to political power in Florence , although they officially remained citizens rather than monarchs until the 16th century . The Medici produced four Popes of the Catholic Church - Pope Leo X ( 1513-1521 ) , Pope Clement VII ( 1523-1534 ) , Pope Pius IV ( 1559-1565 ) and Pope Leo XI ( 1605 ) - and two queens of France - Catherine de ' Medici ( 1547-1589 ) and Marie de ' Medici ( 1600-1630 ) . In 1532 , the family acquired the hereditary title Duke of Florence . In 1569 , the duchy was elevated to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany after territorial expansion . The Medici ruled the Grand Duchy from its inception until 1737 , with the death of Gian Gastone de ' Medici . The grand duchy witnessed degrees of economic growth under the early grand dukes , but was bankrupt by the time of Cosimo III de ' Medici ( r. 1670-1723 ) . The Medicis ' wealth and influence was initially derived from the textile trade guided by the wool guild of Florence , the Arte della Lana . Like other families ruling in Italian signorie , the Medici dominated their city 's government , were able to bring Florence under their family 's power , and created an environment in which art and humanism flourished . They and other families of Italy inspired the Italian Renaissance , such as the Visconti and Sforza in Milan , the Este in Ferrara , the Borgia in Rome , and the Gonzaga in Mantua . The Medici Bank , from when it was created in 1397 to its fall in 1494 , was one of the most prosperous and respected institutions in Europe , and the Medici family was considered the wealthiest in Europe for a time .",
