  "/wiki/Assur": "A\u0161\u0161ur , also known as Ashur and Qal'at Sherqat , was the capital of the Old Assyrian Empire ( 2025-1750 BC ) , the Middle Assyrian Empire ( 1365-1050 BC ) , and for a time , of the Neo-Assyrian Empire ( 911-608 BC ) . The remains of the city lie on the western bank of the Tigris River , north of the confluence with its tributary , the Little Zab , in what is now Iraq , more precisely in the al-Shirqat District of the Saladin Governorate . Occupation of the city itself continued for approximately 4,000 years , from c. 2600 BC to the mid-14th century AD , when the forces of Timur massacred its population . The site is a World Heritage Site , having been added to that organisation 's list of sites in danger in 2003 following the conflict that erupted following the 2003 invasion of Iraq and as a result of a proposed dam which would flood some of the site . Assur lies 65 kilometres ( 40 mi ) south of the site of Nimrud and 100 km ( 60 mi ) south of Nineveh .",
  "/wiki/Assyria": "Assyria ( /\u0259\u02c8s\u026a\u0259ri\u0259/ ) , also called the Assyrian Empire , was a Mesopotamian kingdom and empire of the ancient Near East and the Levant that existed as a state from perhaps as early as the 25th century BC ( in the form of the Assur city-state ) until its collapse between 612 BC and 609 BC - spanning the periods of the Early to Middle Bronze Age through to the late Iron Age . From the end of the seventh century BC ( when the Neo-Assyrian state fell ) to the mid-seventh century AD , it survived as a geopolitical entity , for the most part ruled by foreign powers such as the Parthian and early Sasanian Empires between the mid-second century BC and late third century AD , the final part of which period saw Mesopotamia become a major centre of Syriac Christianity and the birthplace of the Church of the East . A largely Semitic-speaking realm , Assyria was centred on the Tigris in Upper Mesopotamia . The Assyrians came to rule powerful empires in several periods . Making up a substantial part of the greater Mesopotamian cradle of civilization , which included Sumer , the Akkadian Empire , and Babylonia , Assyria reached the height of technological , scientific and cultural achievements for its time . At its peak , the Neo-Assyrian Empire of 911 to 609 BC stretched from eastern Libya and Cyprus in the East Mediterranean to Iran , and from present-day Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Transcaucasia to the Arabian Peninsula . The name Assyria originates with the Assyrian state 's original capital , the ancient city of A\u0161\u0161ur , which dates to c. 2600 BC - originally one of a number of Akkadian-speaking city-states in Mesopotamia . In the 25th and 24th centuries BC , Assyrian kings were pastoral leaders . From the late 24th century BC , the Assyrians became subject to Sargon of Akkad , who united all the Akkadian- and Sumerian-speaking peoples of Mesopotamia under the Akkadian Empire , which lasted from c. 2334 BC to 2154 BC . After the Assyrian Empire fell from power , the greater remaining part of Assyria formed a geopolitical region and province of other empires , although between the mid-2nd century BC and late 3rd century AD a patchwork of small independent Assyrian kingdoms arose in the form of Assur , Adiabene , Osroene , Beth Nuhadra , Beth Garmai and Hatra . The region of Assyria fell under the successive control of the Median Empire of 678 to 549 BC , the Achaemenid Empire of 550 to 330 BC , the Macedonian Empire ( late 4th century BC ) , the Seleucid Empire of 312 to 63 BC , the Parthian Empire of 247 BC to 224 AD , the Roman Empire ( from 116 to 118 AD ) and the Sasanian Empire of 224 to 651 AD . The Arab Islamic conquest of the area in the mid-seventh century finally dissolved Assyria ( Assuristan ) as a single entity , after which the remnants of the Assyrian people ( by now Christians ) gradually became an ethnic , linguistic , cultural and religious minority in the Assyrian homeland , surviving there to this day as an indigenous people of the region .",

The capital , and largest city , is Baghdad . Iraq is home to diverse ethnic groups including Arabs , Kurds , Assyrians , Turkmen , Shabakis , Yazidis , Armenians , Mandeans , Circassians and Kawliya . Around 99% of the country 's 38 million citizens are Muslims , with tiny minorities of Christians , Yarsans , Yezidis and Mandeans also present . The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish . Iraq has a coastline measuring 58 km ( 36 miles ) on the northern Persian Gulf and encompasses the Mesopotamian Alluvial Plain , the northwestern end of the Zagros mountain range and the eastern part of the Syrian Desert . Two major rivers , the Tigris and Euphrates , run south through Iraq and into the Shatt al-Arab near the Persian Gulf . These rivers provide Iraq with significant amounts of fertile land . The region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers , historically known as Mesopotamia , is often referred to as the cradle of civilisation . It was here that mankind first began to read , write , create laws and live in cities under an organised government - notably Uruk , from which Iraq is derived . The area has been home to successive civilisations since the 6th millennium BC . Iraq was the centre of the Akkadian , Sumerian , Assyrian and Babylonian empires .",

It was a major Assyrian city between approximately 1350 BC and 610 BC . The city is located in a strategic position 10 kilometres ( 6 mi ) north of the point that the river Tigris meets its tributary the Great Zab . The city covered an area of 360 hectares ( 890 acres ) . The ruins of the city were found within one kilometre ( 1,100 yd ) of the modern-day Assyrian village of Noomanea in Nineveh Governorate , Iraq . The name Nimrud was recorded as the local name by Carsten Niebuhr in the mid-18th century . [ note 1 ] In the mid 19th century , biblical archaeologists proposed the Biblical name of Kalhu ( the Biblical Calah ) , based on a description of the travels of Nimrod in Genesis 10 . [ note 2 ] Archaeological excavations at the site began in 1845 , and were conducted at intervals between then and 1879 , and then from 1949 onwards . Many important pieces were discovered , with most being moved to museums in Iraq and abroad . In 2013 , the UK 's Arts and Humanities Research Council funded the Nimrud Project , directed by Eleanor Robson , whose aims were to write the history of the city in ancient and modern times , to identify and record the dispersal history of artefacts from Nimrud , distributed amongst at least 76 museums worldwide ( including 36 in the United States and 13 in the United Kingdom ) . In 2015 , the terrorist organization Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) announced its intention to destroy the site because of its un-Islamic Assyrian nature .

Today it is a common name for the half of Mosul that lies on the eastern bank of the Tigris and the Nineveh Governorate takes its name from it . It was the largest city in the world for approximately fifty years until the year 612 BC when , after a bitter period of civil war in Assyria , it was sacked by a coalition of its former subject peoples , the Babylonians , Medes , Chaldeans , Persians , Scythians and Cimmerians . Its ruins are across the river from the modern-day major city of Mosul , in Iraq 's Nineveh Governorate . The two main tells , or mound-ruins , within the walls are Kuyunjiq ( Kuyuncuk ) and Tell Nab\u012b Y\u016bnus . Large amounts of Assyrian sculpture and other artifacts have been excavated and are now located in museums around the world . The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) occupied the site during the mid-2010s , during which time they bulldozed several of the monuments there and caused considerable damage to the others .

  "/wiki/Babylon": "Babylon was the capital city of Babylonia , a kingdom in ancient Mesopotamia , between the 18th and 6th centuries BC . It was built along the left and right banks of the Euphrates river with steep embankments to contain the river 's seasonal floods . Babylon was originally a small Akkadian town dating from the period of the Akkadian Empire c. 2300 BC . The town became part of a small independent city-state with the rise of the First Babylonian dynasty in the 19th century BC . The Amorite king Hammurabi created a short-lived empire in the 18th century BC . He built Babylon into a major city and declared himself its king . Southern Mesopotamia became known as Babylonia and Babylon eclipsed Nippur as its holy city . The empire waned under Hammurabi 's son Samsu-iluna and Babylon spent long periods under Assyrian , Kassite and Elamite domination . After being destroyed and then rebuilt by the Assyrians , Babylon became the capital of the short-lived Neo-Babylonian Empire from 609 to 539 BC . The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World . After the fall of the Neo-Babylonian Empire , the city came under the rule of the Achaemenid , Seleucid , Parthian , Roman , and Sassanid empires . It has been estimated that Babylon was the largest city in the world c. 1770 - c. 1670 BC , and again c. 612 - c. 320 BC .",
  "/wiki/Babylonia": "Babylonia ( /\u02ccb\u00e6b\u026a\u02c8lo\u028ani\u0259/ ) was an ancient Akkadian-speaking state and cultural area based in central-southern Mesopotamia ( present-day Iraq ) . A small Amorite-ruled state emerged in 1894 BC , which contained the minor administrative town of Babylon . It was merely a small provincial town during the Akkadian Empire ( 2335-2154 BC ) but greatly expanded during the reign of Hammurabi in the first half of the 18th century BC and became a major capital city . During the reign of Hammurabi and afterwards , Babylonia was called the country of Akkad ( M\u0101t Akkad\u012b in Akkadian ) , a deliberate archaism in reference to the previous glory of the Akkadian Empire . It was often involved in rivalry with the older state of Assyria to the north and Elam to the east in Ancient Iran . Babylonia briefly became the major power in the region after Hammurabi ( fl . c. 1792-1752 BC middle chronology , or c. 1696-1654 BC , short chronology ) created a short-lived empire , succeeding the earlier Akkadian Empire , Third Dynasty of Ur , and Old Assyrian Empire . The Babylonian Empire , however , rapidly fell apart after the death of Hammurabi and reverted to a small kingdom . Like Assyria , the Babylonian state retained the written Akkadian language ( the language of its native populace ) for official use , despite its Northwest Semitic-speaking Amorite founders and Kassite successors , who spoke a language isolate , not being native Mesopotamians . It retained the Sumerian language for religious use ( as did Assyria ) , but already by the time Babylon was founded , this was no longer a spoken language , having been wholly subsumed by Akkadian . The earlier Akkadian and Sumerian traditions played a major role in Babylonian and Assyrian culture , and the region would remain an important cultural center , even under its protracted periods of outside rule . The earliest mention of the city of Babylon can be found in a clay tablet from the reign of Sargon of Akkad ( 2334-2279 BC ) , dating back to the 23rd century BC .",

Tbilisi was founded in the 5th century AD by Vakhtang I of Iberia , and since then has served as the capital of various Georgian kingdoms and republics . Between 1801 and 1917 , then part of the Russian Empire , Tbilisi was the seat of the Imperial Viceroy , governing both Southern and Northern Caucasus . Because of its location on the crossroads between Europe and Asia , and its proximity to the lucrative Silk Road , throughout history Tbilisi was a point of contention among various global powers .

The modern name Elam stems from the Sumerian transliteration elam ( a ) , along with the later Akkadian elamtu , and the Elamite haltamti . Elamite states were among the leading political forces of the Ancient Near East .

Elam was part of the early urbanization during the Chalcolithic period ( Copper Age ) . The emergence of written records from around 3000 BC also parallels Sumerian history , where slightly earlier records have been found . In the Old Elamite period ( Middle Bronze Age ) , Elam consisted of kingdoms on the Iranian plateau , centered in Anshan , and from the mid-2nd millennium BC , it was centered in Susa in the Khuzestan lowlands . Its culture played a crucial role during the Persian Achaemenid dynasty that succeeded Elam , when the Elamite language remained among those in official use . Elamite is generally considered a language isolate unrelated to the much later arriving Persian and Iranic languages ; however , some linguists hypothesize that Elamite and the Dravidian languages of India belong to the same language family . In accordance with geographical and archaeological matches , some historians argue that the Elamites comprise a large portion of the ancestors of the modern day Lurs , whose language , Luri , split from Middle Persian .",

In the 8th century BC , Media 's tribes came together to form the Median Kingdom , which became a Neo-Assyrian vassal . Between 616 and 609 BC , King Cyaxares ( 624-585 BC ) allied with King Nabopolassar of the Neo-Babylonian Empire and destroyed the Neo-Assyrian Empire , after which the Median Empire stretched across the Iranian Plateau as far as Anatolia . Its precise geographical extent remains unknown . A few archaeological sites ( discovered in the Median triangle in western Iran ) and textual sources ( from contemporary Assyrians and also ancient Greeks in later centuries ) provide a brief documentation of the history and culture of the Median state . Apart from a few personal names , the language of the Medes is unknown . The Medes had an ancient Iranian religion ( a form of pre-Zoroastrian Mazdaism or Mithra worshipping ) with a priesthood named as Magi . Later , during the reigns of the last Median kings , the reforms of Zoroaster spread into western Iran . [ citation needed ]",

It is believed that Ecbatana is in Hagmatana Hill ( Tappe-ye Hagmat\u0101na ) , an archaeological mound in Hamedan . According to Herodotus , Ecbatana was chosen as the Medes ' capital in the late 8th century BC by Deioces . Under the Achaemenid Persian kings , Ecbatana , situated at the foot of Mount Alvand , became a summer residence . Later , it became the capital of the Parthian kings , at which time it became their main mint , producing drachm , tetradrachm , and assorted bronze denominations . The wealth and importance of the city in the Persian empire is attributed to its location on a crucial crossroads that made it a staging post on the main East-West highway . In 330 BC , Ecbatana was the site of the assassination of the Macedonian general Parmenion by order of Alexander the Great .",
  "/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great": "Cyrus II of Persia , commonly known as Cyrus the Great , and also called Cyrus the Elder by the Greeks , was the founder of the Achaemenid Empire , the first Persian Empire . Under his rule , the empire embraced all the previous civilized states of the ancient Near East , expanded vastly and eventually conquered most of Western Asia and much of Central Asia . From the Mediterranean Sea and Hellespont in the west to the Indus River in the east , Cyrus the Great created the largest empire the world had yet seen . Under his successors , the empire eventually stretched at its maximum extent from parts of the Balkans ( Bulgaria-Paeonia and Thrace-Macedonia ) and Eastern Europe proper in the west , to the Indus Valley in the east . His regal titles in full were The Great King , King of Persia , King of Anshan , King of Media , King of Babylon , King of Sumer and Akkad , and King of the Four Corners of the World . The Nabonidus Chronicle notes the change in his title from simply King of Anshan , a city , to King of Persia . Assyriologist Fran\u00e7ois Vallat wrote that When Astyages marched against Cyrus , Cyrus is called 'King of Anshan , but when Cyrus crosses the Tigris on his way to Lydia , he is 'King of Persia . ' The coup therefore took place between these two events . The reign of Cyrus the Great lasted c. 30 years . Cyrus built his empire by first conquering the Median Empire , then the Lydian Empire , and eventually the Neo-Babylonian Empire . He led an expedition into Central Asia , which resulted in major campaigns that were described as having brought into subjection every nation without exception . Cyrus did not venture into Egypt , and was alleged to have died in battle , fighting the Massagetae along the Syr Darya in December 530 BC .",

Ranging at its greatest extent from the Balkans and Eastern Europe proper in the west to the Indus Valley in the east , it was larger than any previous empire in history , spanning 5.5 million square kilometers . Incorporating various peoples of different origins and faiths , it is notable for its successful model of a centralised , bureaucratic administration ( through satraps under the King of Kings ) , for building infrastructure such as road systems and a postal system , the use of an official language across its territories , and the development of civil services and a large professional army . The empire 's successes inspired similar systems in later empires . By the 7th century BC , the Persians had settled in the south-western portion of the Iranian Plateau in the region of Persis , which came to be their heartland . From this region , Cyrus the Great advanced to defeat the Medes , Lydia , and the Neo-Babylonian Empire , establishing the Achaemenid Empire . Alexander the Great , an avid admirer of Cyrus the Great , conquered most of the empire by 330 BC . Upon Alexander 's death , most of the empire 's former territory fell under the rule of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and Seleucid Empire , in addition to other minor territories which gained independence at that time . The Iranian elites of the central plateau reclaimed power by the second century BC under the Parthian Empire . The Achaemenid Empire is noted in Western history as the antagonist of the Greek city-states during the Greco-Persian Wars and for the emancipation of the Jewish exiles in Babylon . The historical mark of the empire went far beyond its territorial and military influences and included cultural , social , technological and religious influences as well . Despite the lasting conflict between the two states , many Athenians adopted Achaemenid customs in their daily lives in a reciprocal cultural exchange , some being employed by or allied to the Persian kings .",

He was the son and successor of Cyrus the Great ( r. 550 - 530 BC ) and his mother was Cassandane . Before his accession , Cambyses had briefly served as the governor of northern Babylonia under his father from April 539 BC to December 538 BC . Afterwards , he continued to roam in the Babylonian cities of Babylon and Sippar , before being appointed by his father as co-ruler in 530 BC , who set off to mount an expedition against the Massagetae of Central Asia , where he met his end . Cambyses thus became the sole ruler of the vast Achaemenid Empire , facing no noticeable opposition . His relatively brief reign was marked by his conquests in Africa , notably Egypt , which he conquered after his victory over the Egyptian pharaoh Psamtik III ( r. 526 - 525 BC ) at the battle of Pelusium in 525 BC . After having established himself in Egypt , he expanded his holdings in Africa even further , such as his conquest of Cyrenaica . In the spring of 522 BC , Cambyses hurriedly left Egypt to deal with a rebellion in Persia . While en route in Syria ( Eber-Nari ) , he received a wound to the thigh , which was soon affected by gangrene . Cambyses died three weeks later at a location called Agbatana , which is most likely the modern city of Hama .

Alexander was awarded the generalship of Greece and used this authority to launch his father 's pan-Hellenic project to lead the Greeks in the conquest of Persia . In 334 BC , he invaded the Achaemenid Empire ( Persian Empire ) and began a series of campaigns that lasted 10 years .

The kingdom was founded and initially ruled by the royal Argead dynasty , which was followed by the Antipatrid and Antigonid dynasties . Home to the ancient Macedonians , the earliest kingdom was centered on the northeastern part of the Greek peninsula , and bordered by Epirus to the west , Paeonia to the north , Thrace to the east and Thessaly to the south . Before the 4th century BC , Macedonia was a small kingdom outside of the area dominated by the great city-states of Athens , Sparta and Thebes , and briefly subordinate to Achaemenid Persia . During the reign of the Argead king Philip II ( 359-336 BC ) , Macedonia subdued mainland Greece and the Thracian Odrysian kingdom through conquest and diplomacy . With a reformed army containing phalanxes wielding the sarissa pike , Philip II defeated the old powers of Athens and Thebes in the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC . Philip II 's son Alexander the Great , leading a federation of Greek states , accomplished his father 's objective of commanding the whole of Greece when he destroyed Thebes after the city revolted . During Alexander 's subsequent campaign of conquest , he overthrew the Achaemenid Empire and conquered territory that stretched as far as the Indus River . For a brief period , his empire was the most powerful in the world - the definitive Hellenistic state , inaugurating the transition to a new period of Ancient Greek civilization . Greek arts and literature flourished in the new conquered lands and advances in philosophy , engineering , and science spread throughout much of the ancient world . Of particular importance were the contributions of Aristotle , tutor to Alexander , whose writings became a keystone of Western philosophy . After Alexander 's death in 323 BC , the ensuing wars of the Diadochi , and the partitioning of Alexander 's short-lived empire , Macedonia remained a Greek cultural and political center in the Mediterranean region along with Ptolemaic Egypt , the Seleucid Empire , and the Kingdom of Pergamon .",

Seleucus received Babylonia ( 321 BC ) and from there expanded his dominions to include much of Alexander 's near-eastern territories . At the height of its power , the Empire included central Anatolia , Persia , the Levant , Mesopotamia , and what is now Kuwait , Afghanistan , and parts of Pakistan and Turkmenistan . The Seleucid Empire became a major center of Hellenistic culture - it maintained the preeminence of Greek customs where a Greek political elite dominated , mostly in the urban areas . The Greek population of the cities who formed the dominant elite were reinforced by immigration from Greece . Seleucid attempts to defeat their old enemy Ptolemaic Egypt were frustrated by Roman demands . Having come into conflict in the east ( 305 BC ) with Chandragupta Maurya of the Maurya Empire , Seleucus I entered into an agreement with Chandragupta whereby he ceded vast territory west of the Indus , including the Hindu Kush , modern-day Afghanistan , and the Balochistan province of Pakistan and offered his daughter in marriage to the Maurya Emperor to formalize the alliance . Antiochus III the Great attempted to project Seleucid power and authority into Hellenistic Greece , but his attempts were thwarted by the Roman Republic and by Greek allies such as the Kingdom of Pergamon , culminating in a Seleucid defeat at the 190 BC Battle of Magnesia . In the subsequent Treaty of Apamea in 188 BC , the Seleucids were compelled to pay costly war reparations and relinquished claims to territories west of the Taurus Mountains . The Parthians under Mithridates I of Parthia conquered much of the remaining eastern part of the Seleucid Empire in the mid-2nd century BC , while the independent Greco-Bactrian Kingdom continued to flourish in the northeast .

Its latter name comes from Arsaces I of Parthia who , as leader of the Parni tribe , founded it in the mid-3rd century BC when he conquered the region of Parthia in Iran 's northeast , then a satrapy ( province ) under Andragoras , in rebellion against the Seleucid Empire . Mithridates I of Parthia ( r. c. 171-138 BC ) greatly expanded the empire by seizing Media and Mesopotamia from the Seleucids . At its height , the Parthian Empire stretched from the northern reaches of the Euphrates , in what is now central-eastern Turkey , to eastern Iran . The empire , located on the Silk Road trade route between the Roman Empire in the Mediterranean Basin and the Han dynasty of China , became a center of trade and commerce . The Parthians largely adopted the art , architecture , religious beliefs , and royal insignia of their culturally heterogeneous empire , which encompassed Persian , Hellenistic , and regional cultures . For about the first half of its existence , the Arsacid court adopted elements of Greek culture , though it eventually saw a gradual revival of Iranian traditions . The Arsacid rulers were titled the King of Kings , as a claim to be the heirs to the Achaemenid Empire ; indeed , they accepted many local kings as vassals where the Achaemenids would have had centrally appointed , albeit largely autonomous , satraps . The court did appoint a small number of satraps , largely outside Iran , but these satrapies were smaller and less powerful than the Achaemenid potentates . With the expansion of Arsacid power , the seat of central government shifted from Nisa to Ctesiphon along the Tigris ( south of modern Baghdad , Iraq ) , although several other sites also served as capitals . The earliest enemies of the Parthians were the Seleucids in the west and the Scythians in the north . However , as Parthia expanded westward , they came into conflict with the Kingdom of Armenia , and eventually the late Roman Republic .",

Named after the House of Sasan , it ruled from 224 to 651 AD . The Sasanian Empire succeeded the Parthian Empire and was recognised as one of the leading world powers alongside its neighbouring arch-rival , the Roman-Byzantine Empire for a period of more than 400 years . The Sasanian Empire was founded by Ardashir I , after the fall of the Parthian Empire and the defeat of the last Arsacid king , Artabanus V.

According to a legend , the vexilloid of the Sasanian Empire was the Derafsh Kaviani . The Sasanian Empire during Late Antiquity is considered to have been one of Iran 's most important , and influential historical periods and constituted the last great Iranian empire before the Muslim conquest and the Islamization of Iran . In many ways , the Sasanian period witnessed the peak of ancient Iranian civilisation . The Sasanians ' cultural influence extended far beyond the empire 's territorial borders , reaching as far as Western Europe , Africa , China and India . It played a prominent role in the formation of both European and Asian medieval art . Much of what later became known as Islamic culture in art , architecture , music and other subject matter was transferred from the Sasanians throughout the Muslim world .",

  "/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_Persia": "The Muslim conquest of Persia , also known as the Arab invasion of Iran , led to the fall of the Sasanian Empire of Iran ( Persia ) in 651 and the eventual decline of the Zoroastrian religion . The rise of Muslims coincided with an unprecedented political , social , economic , and military weakness in Persia . Once a major world power , the Sasanian Empire had exhausted its human and material resources after decades of warfare against the Byzantine Empire . The internal political situation quickly deteriorated after the execution of King Khosrow II in 628 AD . Subsequently , ten new claimants were enthroned within the next four years . With civil war erupting between different factions , the empire was no longer centralized . Arab Muslims first attacked the Sassanid territory in 633 , when general Khalid ibn Walid invaded Mesopotamia ( Sassanid province of As\u014drist\u0101n ; what is now Iraq ) , which was the political and economic center of the Sassanid state . Following the transfer of Khalid to the Byzantine front in the Levant , the Muslims eventually lost their holdings to Sasanian counterattacks . The second invasion began in 636 under Sa ` d ibn Abi Waqqas , when a key victory at the Battle of al-Q\u0101disiyyah led to the permanent end of Sasanian control west of Iran . The Zagros mountains , a natural barrier , marked the border between the Rashidun Caliphate and the Sassanid Empire . Caliph Umar ordered a full invasion of the Sasanian empire in 642 , which led to the complete conquest of the Sasanians around 651 . Directing from Medina , a few thousand kilometres away , Caliph Umar 's quick conquest of Iran in a series of well-coordinated , multi-pronged attacks became his greatest triumph , contributing to his reputation as a great military and political strategist .",

The Tahirids have been described as the first independent Iranian dynasty after the fall of the Sassanian Empire . However , according Hugh Kennedy : The Tahirids are sometimes considered as the first independent Iranian dynasty , but such a view is misleading . The arrangement was effectively a partnership between the Abbasids and the Tahirids . And instead , the Tahirids were loyal to the Abbasid caliphs and enjoyed considerable autonomy rather than being independent from the central authority .
