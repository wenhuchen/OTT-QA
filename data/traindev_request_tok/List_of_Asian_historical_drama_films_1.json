The grandson of the founder of the Maurya Dynasty , Chandragupta Maurya , Ashoka promoted the spread of Buddhism across ancient Asia . Considered by many to be one of India 's greatest emperors , Ashoka expanded Chandragupta 's empire to reign over a realm stretching from present-day Afghanistan in the west to Bangladesh in the east . It covered the entire Indian subcontinent except for parts of present-day Tamil Nadu , Karnataka and Kerala .

Ashoka waged a destructive war against the state of Kalinga ( modern Odisha ) , which he conquered in about 260 BCE . In about 263 BCE , he converted to Buddhism after witnessing the mass deaths of the Kalinga War , which he had waged out of a desire for conquest and which reportedly directly resulted in more than 100,000 deaths and 150,000 deportations . He is remembered for the Ashoka pillars and edicts , for sending Buddhist monks to Sri Lanka and Central Asia , and for establishing monuments marking several significant sites in the life of Gautama Buddha .

The empire was the largest political entity that has ever existed in the Indian subcontinent , extending over 5 million square kilometres ( 1.9 million square miles ) at its zenith under Ashoka . Chandragupta Maurya raised an army , with the assistance of Chanakya ( also known as Kau\u1e6dilya ) , and overthrew the Nanda Empire in c. 322 BCE . Chandragupta rapidly expanded his power westwards across central and western India by conquering the satraps left by Alexander the Great , and by 317 BCE the empire had fully occupied northwestern India . The Mauryan Empire then defeated Seleucus I , a diadochus and founder of the Seleucid Empire during the Seleucid-Mauryan war , thus acquiring territory west of the Indus River . At its greatest extent , the empire stretched along the natural boundary of the Himalayas , to the east into Assam , to the west into what is present-day Balochistan , Pakistan and the Hindu Kush mountains of what is now eastern Afghanistan . The dynasty expanded into India 's southern regions by the reign of the emperor Bindusara , but it excluded Kalinga ( modern Odisha ) , until it was conquered by Ashoka . It declined for about 50 years after Ashoka 's rule , and dissolved in 185 BCE with the foundation of the Shunga dynasty in Magadha . Under Chandragupta Maurya and his successors , internal and external trade , agriculture , and economic activities all thrived and expanded across South Asia due to the creation of a single and efficient system of finance , administration , and security .

Mayurasharma defeated the armies of the Pallavas of Kanchi possibly with the help of some native tribes and claimed sovereignty . The Kadamba power reached its peak during the rule of Kakusthavarma . The Kadambas were contemporaries of the Western Ganga Dynasty and together they formed the earliest native kingdoms to rule the land with autonomy . From the mid-6th century the dynasty continued to rule as a vassal of larger Kannada empires , the Chalukya and the Rashtrakuta empires for over five hundred years during which time they branched into minor dynasties . Notable among these are the Kadambas of Goa , the Kadambas of Halasi and the Kadambas of Hangal . During the pre-Kadamba era the ruling families that controlled the Karnataka region , the Mauryas and later the Satavahanas , were not natives of the region and therefore the nucleus of power resided outside present-day Karnataka . The Kadambas were the first indigenous dynasty to use Kannada , the language of the soil at an administrative level .

Due to Malayali expatriates in the Persian Gulf , the language is also widely spoken in Gulf countries . The origin of Malayalam remains a matter of dispute among scholars . One view holds that Malayalam and modern Tamil are offshoots of Middle Tamil and separated from it sometime after the c. 7th century AD . A second view argues for the development of the two languages out of Proto-Dravidian or Proto-Tamil-Malayalam in the prehistoric era . Designated a Classical Language in India in 2013 , it developed into the current form mainly by the influence of the poet Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan in the 16th century . The oldest documents written purely in Malayalam and still surviving are the Vazhappalli Copper plates from 832 AD and Tharisapalli Copper plates from 849 AD . The earliest script used to write Malayalam was the Vatteluttu alphabet , and later the Kolezhuttu , which derived from it .",
  "/wiki/Mughal-e-Azam": "Mughal-e-Azam ( transl . The Great Mughal ) is a 1960 Indian epic historical drama film directed by K. Asif and produced by Shapoorji Pallonji . Starring Prithviraj Kapoor , Madhubala , Durga Khote , and Dilip Kumar , it follows the love affair between Mughal Prince Salim ( who went on to become Emperor Jahangir ) and Anarkali , a court dancer . Salim 's father , Emperor Akbar , disapproves of the relationship , which leads to a war between father and son . The development of Mughal-e-Azam began in 1944 , when Asif read a play set in the reign of Emperor Akbar ( 1556-1605 ) . Production was plagued by delays and financial uncertainty . Before its principal photography began in the early 1950s , the project had lost a financier and undergone a complete change of cast . Mughal-e-Azam cost more to produce than any previous Indian motion picture ; the budget for a single song sequence exceeded that typical for an entire film of the period . The soundtrack , inspired by Indian classical and folk music , comprises 12 songs voiced by playback singer Lata Mangeshkar along with Mohammed Rafi , Shamshad Begum and classical singer Bade Ghulam Ali Khan , and is often cited among the finest in Bollywood cinematic history . Mughal-e-Azam had the widest release of any Indian film up to that time , and patrons often queued all day for tickets . Released on 5 August 1960 , it broke box office records in India and became the highest-grossing Indian film of all time , a distinction it held for 15 years . By some accounts , Mughal-e-Azam remains the highest-grossing Indian film of all time , adjusted for inflation .",
  "/wiki/Bollywood": "Hindi cinema , often known as Bollywood and formerly as Bombay cinema , is the Indian Hindi-language film industry based in Mumbai ( formerly Bombay ) . The term is a portmanteau of Bombay and Hollywood . The industry is related to Cinema of South India and other Indian film industries , making up Indian Cinema - the world 's largest by number of feature films produced . Indian cinema has an annual output of 1,986 feature films in 2017 . Bollywood is its largest film producer , with 364 Hindi films produced in 2017 . Bollywood represents 43 percent of Indian net box-office revenue ; Tamil and Telugu cinema represent 36 percent , and the remaining regional cinema constituted 21 percent in 2014 . Bollywood is one of the largest centres of film production in the world . In 2001 ticket sales , Indian cinema ( including Bollywood ) reportedly sold an estimated 3.6 billion tickets worldwide , compared to Hollywood 's 2.6 billion tickets sold . Bollywood films tend to use a colloquial dialect of Hindi-Urdu ( or Hindustani ) , mutually intelligible by Hindi and Urdu speakers , and modern Bollywood movies increasingly incorporate elements of Hinglish . The most popular commercial genre in Bollywood since the 1970s has been the masala film , which freely mixes different genres including action , comedy , romance , drama and melodrama along with musical numbers . Masala films generally fall under the musical film genre , of which Indian cinema has been the largest producer since the 1960s when it exceeded the American film industry 's total musical output after musical films declined in the West ; the first Indian musical talkie was Alam Ara ( 1931 ) , several years after the first Hollywood musical talkie The Jazz Singer ( 1927 ) . Alongside commercial masala films , a distinctive genre of art films known as parallel cinema has also existed , presenting realistic content and avoidance of musical numbers .",
  "/wiki/Mughal_Empire": "The Mughal Empire or Mogul Empire , was an early-modern empire in South Asia . For some two centuries , the empire stretched from the outer fringes of the Indus basin in the west , northern Afghanistan in the northwest , and Kashmir in the north , to the highlands of present-day Assam and Bangladesh in the east , and the uplands of the Deccan plateau in South India . The Mughal empire is conventionally said to have been founded in 1526 by Babur , a warrior chieftain from what today is Uzbekistan , who employed aid from the neighboring Safavid- and Ottoman empires , to defeat the Sultan of Delhi , Ibrahim Lodhi , in the First Battle of Panipat , and to sweep down the plains of Upper India . The Mughal imperial structure , however , is sometimes dated to 1600 , to the rule of Babur 's grandson , Akbar , This imperial structure lasted until 1720 , until shortly after the death of the last major emperor , Aurengzeb , during whose reign the empire also achieved its maximum geographical extent . Reduced subsequently , especially during the East India Company rule in India , to the region in and around Old Delhi , the empire was formally dissolved by the British Raj after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 . Although the Mughal empire was created and sustained by military warfare , it did not vigorously suppress the cultures and peoples it came to rule , but rather equalized and placated them through new administrative practices , and diverse ruling elites , leading to more efficient , centralised , and standardized rule . The base of the empire 's collective wealth was agricultural taxes , instituted by the third Mughal emperor , Akbar . These taxes , which amounted to well over half the output of a peasant cultivator , were paid in the well-regulated silver currency , and caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets . The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India 's economic expansion . Burgeoning European presence in the Indian ocean , and its increasing demand for Indian raw- and finished products , created still greater wealth in the Mughal courts . There was more conspicuous consumption among the Mughal elite , resulting in greater patronage of painting , literary forms , textiles , and architecture , especially during the reign of Shah Jahan . Among the Mughal UNESCO World Heritage Sites in South Asia are : Agra Fort , Fatehpur Sikri , Red Fort , Humayun 's Tomb , Lahore Fort and the Taj Mahal , which is described as , The jewel of Muslim art in India , and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world 's heritage .",

A strong personality and a successful general , Akbar gradually enlarged the Mughal Empire to include most of the Indian subcontinent . His power and influence , however , extended over the entire subcontinent because of Mughal military , political , cultural , and economic dominance . To unify the vast Mughal state , Akbar established a centralised system of administration throughout his empire and adopted a policy of conciliating conquered rulers through marriage and diplomacy . To preserve peace and order in a religiously and culturally diverse empire , he adopted policies that won him the support of his non-Muslim subjects . Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic state identity , Akbar strove to unite far-flung lands of his realm through loyalty , expressed through an Indo-Persian culture , to himself as an emperor . Mughal India developed a strong and stable economy , leading to commercial expansion and greater patronage of culture . Akbar himself was a patron of art and culture . He was fond of literature , and created a library of over 24,000 volumes written in Sanskrit , Urdu , Persian , Greek , Latin , Arabic and Kashmiri , staffed by many scholars , translators , artists , calligraphers , scribes , bookbinders and readers . He did much of the cataloging himself through three main groupings .

According to one of the stories , Anarkali had an illicit relationship with the Crown Prince Jahangir and the Mughal Emperor Akbar had her enclosed in a wall where she died . There is no historic proof of Anarakali 's existence although her character often appears in movies , books and fictionalized versions of history . Anarkali was first mentioned in the journal of an English tourist and trader , William Finch , after he visited the Mughal Empire on 24 August , 1608 . The story was also written by Indian writer Abdul Halim Sharar and on the first page of his book , he clearly mentions it to be a work of fiction . Nevertheless , Anarkali 's story has been adapted into literature , art and cinema .

According to legend , Anarkali was ordered to be buried alive between two walls by Mughal Emperor Akbar for having an illicit relationship with the Crown-Prince Salim , later to become Mughal Emperor Jahangir . There is disagreement among scholars concerning the authenticity of Anarkali 's story . There are many supporting and opposing views such as the ones mentioned below . The earliest Western stories about the love affair between Salim and Anarkali were written by two British travellers , William Finch and Edward Terry . William Finch reached Lahore in February 1611 ( only 11 years after the supposed death of Anarkali ) , to sell indigo he had purchased at Bayana on behalf of the East India Company .",

  "/wiki/Mughal_Emperor": "The Mughal Emperors , Moghul , from the early 16th century to the mid 19th century , built and ruled the Mughal Empire on the Indian subcontinent , mainly corresponding to the modern countries of India , Pakistan , Afghanistan and Bangladesh . The Mughals emerged as a branch of the Timurid dynasty of Turco-Mongol origin from Central Asia . Their founder Babur , a Timurid prince from the Fergana Valley ( in modern Uzbekistan ) , was a direct descendant of Timur ( generally known in western nations as Tamerlane ) and also affiliated with Genghis Khan through Timur 's marriage to a Genghisid princess . Many of the later Mughal emperors had significant Indian Rajput and Persian ancestry through marriage alliances as emperors were born to Rajput and Persian princesses . Akbar , for instance , was half-Persian ( his mother was of Persian origin ) , Jahangir was half-Rajput and quarter-Persian , and Shah Jahan was three-quarters Rajput . During Aurangzeb 's Islamic sharia based government , the empire , as the world 's largest economy , worth over 25% of world GDP , controlled all of the Indian subcontinent , extending from Chittagong in the east to Kabul and Baluchistan in the west , Kashmir in the north to the Kaveri River basin in the south . Its population at the time has been estimated as between 110 and 150 million ( a quarter of the world 's population ) , over a territory of more than 4 million square kilometres ( 1.2 million square miles ) .

Historically , the term has also been used as a geographical , cultural , and later religious identifier for people living in the Indian subcontinent . The historical meaning of the term Hindu has evolved with time . Starting with the Persian and Greek references to the land of the Indus in the 1st millennium BCE through the texts of the medieval era , the term Hindu implied a geographic , ethnic or cultural identifier for people living in the Indian subcontinent around or beyond the Sindhu ( Indus ) river . By the 16th century , the term began to refer to residents of the subcontinent who were not Turkic or Muslims . [ a ] [ b ] The historical development of Hindu self-identity within the local South Asian population , in a religious or cultural sense , is unclear . Competing theories state that Hindu identity developed in the British colonial era , or that it may have developed post-8th century CE after the Islamic invasion and medieval Hindu-Muslim wars . A sense of Hindu identity and the term Hindu appears in some texts dated between the 13th and 18th century in Sanskrit and Bengali . The 14th- and 18th-century Indian poets such as Vidyapati , Kabir and Eknath used the phrase Hindu dharma ( Hinduism ) and contrasted it with Turaka dharma ( Islam ) . The Christian friar Sebastiao Manrique used the term 'Hindu ' in religious context in 1649 . In the 18th century , the European merchants and colonists began to refer to the followers of Indian religions collectively as Hindus , in contrast to Mohamedans for Mughals and Arabs following Islam . By the mid-19th century , colonial orientalist texts further distinguished Hindus from Buddhists , Sikhs and Jains , but the colonial laws continued to consider all of them to be within the scope of the term Hindu until about mid-20th century .",

Another traced it to some great Muslim families who fled after murdering a favoured slave of Akbar . These original Muslim Thugs spread Thuggee amongst Rajputs , Hindus , Lodhis and Ahirs .

It was formed to trade in the Indian Ocean region , initially with Mughal India and the East Indies , and later with Qing China . The company ended up seizing control of large parts of the Indian subcontinent , colonised parts of Southeast Asia , and colonised Hong Kong after a war with Qing China . Originally chartered as the Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East-Indies , the company rose to account for half of the world 's trade , particularly in basic commodities including cotton , silk , indigo dye , salt , spices , saltpetre , tea , and opium . The company also ruled the beginnings of the British Empire in India . In his speech to the House of Commons in July 1833 , Lord Macaulay explained that since the beginning , the East India company had always been involved in both trade and politics , just as its French and Dutch counterparts had been . The company received a Royal Charter from Queen Elizabeth I on 31 December 1600 , coming relatively late to trade in the Indies . Before them the Portuguese Estado da \u00cdndia had traded there for much of the 16th century and the first of half a dozen Dutch Companies sailed to trade there from 1595 . These Dutch companies amalgamated in March 1602 into the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) , which introduced the first permanent joint stock from 1612 ( meaning investment into shares did not need to be returned , but could be traded on a stock exchange ) . By contrast , wealthy merchants and aristocrats owned the EIC 's shares .

As the Mughal Empire declined and decentralized , local governors in Oudh began asserting greater autonomy , and eventually Oudh matured into an independent polity governing the fertile lands of the Central and Lower Doab . With the British East India Company entering Bengal and decisively defeating Oudh at the Battle of Buxar in 1764 , Oudh fell into the British orbit . The capital of Oudh was in Faizabad , but the British Agents , officially known as residents , had their seat in Lucknow . The Nawab of Oudh , one of the richest princes , paid for and erected a Residency in Lucknow as a part of a wider programme of civic improvements . Oudh joined other Indian states in an upheaval against British rule in 1858 during one of the last series of actions in the Indian rebellion of 1857 . In the course of this uprising detachments of the British Indian Army from the Bombay Presidency overcame the disunited collection of Indian states in a single rapid campaign . Determined rebels continued to wage sporadic guerrilla clashes until the spring of 1859 . This rebellion is also historically known as the Oudh campaign .
