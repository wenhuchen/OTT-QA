  "/wiki/English_Civil_War": "The English Civil War ( 1642-1651 ) was a series of civil wars and political machinations between Parliamentarians ( Roundheads ) and Royalists ( Cavaliers ) principally over the manner of England 's governance . The first ( 1642-1646 ) and second ( 1648-1649 ) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament , while the third ( 1649-1651 ) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament . The war ended with Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651 . The outcome of the war was threefold : the trial and execution of Charles I ( 1649 ) ; the exile of his son , Charles II ( 1651 ) ; and the replacement of English monarchy with , at first , the Commonwealth of England ( 1649-1653 ) and then the Protectorate under the personal rule of Oliver Cromwell ( 1653-1658 ) and briefly his son Richard ( 1658-1659 ) . A king had never been executed before . In England , the monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship was ended , while in Ireland the victors consolidated the established Protestant Ascendancy .

  "/wiki/Short_Parliament": "The Short Parliament was a Parliament of England that was summoned by King Charles I of England on 20 February 1640 and sat from 13 April to 5 May 1640 . It was so called because of its short life of only three weeks . After 11 years of attempting Personal Rule between 1629 and 1640 , Charles recalled Parliament in 1640 on the advice of Lord Wentworth , recently created Earl of Strafford , primarily to obtain money to finance his military struggle with Scotland in the Bishops ' Wars . However , like its predecessors , the new parliament had more interest in redressing perceived grievances occasioned by the royal administration than in voting the King funds to pursue his war against the Scottish Covenanters . John Pym , MP for Tavistock , quickly emerged as a major figure in debate ; his long speech on 17 April expressed the refusal of the House of Commons to vote subsidies unless royal abuses were addressed . John Hampden , in contrast , was persuasive in private : he sat on nine committees . A flood of petitions concerning royal abuses were coming up to Parliament from the country . Charles 's attempted offer to cease the levying of ship money did not impress the House . Annoyed with the resumption of debate on Crown privilege and the violation of Parliamentary privilege by the arrest of the nine members in 1629 , and unnerved about an upcoming scheduled debate on the deteriorating situation in Scotland , Charles dissolved Parliament on 5 May 1640 , after only three weeks ' sitting .

In September 1640 , King Charles I issued writs summoning a parliament to convene on 3 November 1640 . [ a ] He intended it to pass financial bills , a step made necessary by the costs of the Bishops ' Wars in Scotland . The Long Parliament received its name from the fact that , by Act of Parliament , it stipulated it could be dissolved only with agreement of the members ; and , those members did not agree to its dissolution until 16 March 1660 , after the English Civil War and near the close of the Interregnum . The parliament sat from 1640 until 1648 , when it was purged by the New Model Army . After this point , the remaining members of the House of Commons became known as the Rump Parliament . In the chaos following the death of Oliver Cromwell in 1658 , General George Monck allowed the members barred in 1648 to retake their seats , so that they could pass the necessary legislation to allow the Restoration and dissolve the Long Parliament . This cleared the way for a new parliament to be elected , which was known as the Convention Parliament . Some key members of the Long Parliament , such as Sir Henry Vane the Younger and General Edmond Ludlow were barred from the final acts of the Long Parliament . They claimed the parliament was not legally dissolved , its final votes a procedural irregularity ( words used contemporaneously device and conspiracy ) by General George Monck to ensure the restoration of King Charles II of England .
