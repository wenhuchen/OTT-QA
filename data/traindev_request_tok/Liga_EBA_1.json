Located in the northwest Iberian Peninsula , it includes the provinces of A Coru\u00f1a , Lugo , Ourense and Pontevedra . Galicia is bordered by Portugal to the south , the Spanish autonomous communities of Castile and Le\u00f3n and Asturias to the east , the Atlantic Ocean to the west , and the Cantabrian Sea to the north .

During the Middle Ages , the kingdom of Galicia was occasionally ruled by its own kings , but most of the time it was leagued to the kingdom of Leon and later to that of Castile , while maintaining its own legal and customary practices and culture . From the 13th century on , the kings of Castile , as kings of Galicia , appointed an Adiantado-m\u00f3r , whose attributions passed to the Governor and Captain General of the Kingdom of Galiza from the last years of the 15th century .
