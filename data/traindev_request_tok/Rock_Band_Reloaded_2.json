Since 2015 , the lineup of the band has consisted of bass guitarist and vocalist Mark Hoppus , drummer Travis Barker , and guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba . Founded by Hoppus , guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge , and drummer Scott Raynor , the band emerged from the Southern California punk scene of the early 1990s and first gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent lyrical toilet humor . Bassist Mark Hoppus is the only constant band member . In its early years , Blink-182 toured heavily behind the band 's debut , Cheshire Cat ( 1995 ) . The group signed with major label MCA Records to co-distribute its second album , Dude Ranch ( 1997 ) . Raynor was fired midway through a 1998 tour and replaced by Barker . The group 's next two releases , Enema of the State ( 1999 ) and Take Off Your Pants and Jacket ( 2001 ) , were enormous successes on the strength of radio and MTV airplay . Blink-182 followed in 2003 and marked a stylistic shift for the group . DeLonge quit in 2005 , sending the band into what was termed an indefinite hiatus . They reunited in 2009 , producing the trio 's sixth album , Neighborhoods ( 2011 ) .

Adam 's Song shares writing credits between the band 's guitarist Tom DeLonge and bassist Mark Hoppus , but Hoppus was the primary composer of the song . The track concerns suicide , depression and loneliness . It incorporates a piano in its bridge section and was regarded as one of the most serious songs the band had written to that point . Hoppus was inspired by the loneliness he experienced while on tour ; while his bandmates had significant others to return home to , he was single . He was also influenced by a teen suicide letter he read in a magazine . The song takes the form of a suicide note , and contains lyrical allusions to the Nirvana song Come as You Are . Adam 's Song was one of the last songs to be written and recorded for Enema of the State , and it was nearly left off the album . Though Hoppus worried the subject matter was too depressing , his bandmates were receptive to its message . The song was produced by Jerry Finn . Adam 's Song peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart ; it was also a top 25 hit in Canada and Italy , but did not replicate its success on other charts .",
