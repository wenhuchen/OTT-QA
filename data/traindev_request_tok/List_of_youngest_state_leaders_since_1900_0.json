He succeeded his father Fran\u00e7ois Papa Doc Duvalier as the ruler of Haiti after his death in 1971 . After assuming power , he introduced cosmetic changes to his father 's regime and delegated much authority to his advisors . Thousands of Haitians were killed or tortured , and hundreds of thousands fled the country during his presidency . He maintained a notoriously lavish lifestyle ( including a state-sponsored US $ 2 million wedding in 1980 ) while poverty among his people remained the most widespread of any country in the Western Hemisphere . Relations with the United States improved after Duvalier 's ascension to the presidency , and later deteriorated under the Carter administration , only to again improve under Ronald Reagan due to the strong anti-communist stance of the Duvaliers . Rebellion against the Duvalier regime broke out in 1985 and Baby Doc fled to France in 1986 on a U.S. Air Force flight . Duvalier unexpectedly returned to Haiti on 16 January 2011 , after two decades in self-imposed exile in France . The following day , he was arrested by Haitian police , facing possible charges for embezzlement . On 18 January , Duvalier was charged with corruption . On 28 February 2013 , Duvalier pleaded not guilty to charges of corruption and human rights abuse . He died of a heart attack on 4 October 2014 , at the age of 63 .",

It occupies the western three-eighths of the island which it shares with the Dominican Republic . To its south-west lies the small island of Navassa Island , which is claimed by Haiti but is disputed as a United States territory under federal administration . Haiti is 27,750 square kilometers ( 10,714 sq mi ) in size and has an estimated population of 11.1 million , making it the most populous country in the Caribbean Community ( CARICOM ) and the second-most populous country in the Caribbean after Cuba . The island was originally inhabited by the indigenous Ta\u00edno people , who migrated from South America . The first Europeans arrived on 5 December 1492 during the first voyage of Christopher Columbus , who initially believed he had found India or China . Columbus subsequently founded the first European settlement in the Americas , La Navidad , on what is now the northeastern coast of Haiti . The island was claimed by Spain and named La Espa\u00f1ola , forming part of the Spanish Empire until the early 17th century . However , competing claims and settlements by the French led to the western portion of the island being ceded to France in 1697 , which was subsequently named Saint-Domingue . French colonists established lucrative sugarcane plantations , worked by vast numbers of slaves brought from Africa , which made the colony one of the richest in the world . In the midst of the French Revolution ( 1789-99 ) , slaves and free people of color launched the Haitian Revolution ( 1791-1804 ) , led by a former slave and the first black general of the French Army , Toussaint Louverture . After 12 years of conflict , Napoleon Bonaparte 's forces were defeated by Louverture 's successor , Jean-Jacques Dessalines ( later Emperor Jacques I ) , who declared Haiti 's sovereignty on 1 January 1804 - the first independent nation of Latin America and the Caribbean , the second republic in the Americas , the first country to abolish slavery , and the only state in history established by a successful slave revolt .",

Micombero was an ethnic Tutsi who began his career as an officer in the Burundian army at the time of Burundi 's independence in 1962 . He studied abroad and was given a ministerial portfolio on his return . He rose to prominence for his role in helping to crush an attempted coup d'\u00e9tat in October 1965 by ethnic Hutu soldiers against the country 's monarchy , itself Tutsi . In its aftermath , in 1965 and 1966 , Micombero himself instigated two further coups against the monarchy which he perceived as too moderate . The first coup forced the incumbent king into exile , propelling Micombero to the role of prime minister . The second abolished the monarchy itself , bringing Micombero to power as the first president of the new Republic of Burundi . Micombero ruled Burundi as a military dictator from 1966 . He led a one-party state which centralised the country 's institutions and adopted a neutral stance in the Cold War . Dissent was repressed and , in 1972 , an attempt to challenge Micombero 's power led to genocidal violence against the Hutu population in which around 100,000 people , mainly Hutus , were killed . His regime finally collapsed in 1976 when he was ousted in a coup d'\u00e9tat by another army officer Jean-Baptiste Bagaza , who installed himself as president .

Despite common misconceptions , Burundi and Rwanda had never been under common rule until the time of European colonisation . Burundi gained independence in 1962 and initially had a monarchy , but a series of assassinations , coups and a general climate of regional instability culminated in the establishment of a republic and one-party state in 1966 . Bouts of ethnic cleansing and ultimately two civil wars and genocides during the 1970s and again in the 1990s left the economy undeveloped and the population as one of the world 's poorest .

The sovereign constitutional monarchy is a federation of seven emirates consisting of Abu Dhabi ( which serves as the capital ) , Ajman , Dubai , Fujairah , Ras Al Khaimah , Sharjah and Umm Al Quwain . Their boundaries are complex , with numerous enclaves within the various emirates . Each emirate is governed by a ruler ; together , they jointly form the Federal Supreme Council . One of the rulers serves as the President of the United Arab Emirates . In 2013 , the UAE 's population was 9.2 million , of which 1.4 million are Emirati citizens and 7.8 million are expatriates . Human occupation of the present UAE has been traced back to the emergence of anatomically modern humans from Africa some 125,000 BCE through finds at the Faya-1 site in Mleiha , Sharjah . Burial sites dating back to the Neolithic Age and the Bronze Age include the oldest known such inland site at Jebel Buhais . Known as Magan to the Sumerians , the area was home to a prosperous Bronze Age trading culture during the Umm Al Nar period , which traded between the Indus Valley , Bahrain and Mesopotamia as well as Iran , Bactria and the Levant . The ensuing Wadi Suq period and three Iron Ages saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior . The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the Sasanians and the subsequent Battle of Dibba . The UAE 's long history of trade led to the emergence of Julfar , in the present-day emirate of Ras Al Khaimah , as a major regional trading and maritime hub in the area .",

To the north and northwest , the country is bordered by China and by Russia along the Amnok ( known as the Yalu in Chinese ) and Tumen rivers , and to the south , it is bordered by South Korea , with the heavily fortified Korean Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) separating the two . Nevertheless , North Korea , like its southern counterpart , claims to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands . In 1910 , Korea was annexed by Imperial Japan . At the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 , Korea was divided into two zones , with the north occupied by the Soviet Union and the south occupied by the United States . Negotiations on reunification failed , and in 1948 , separate governments were formed : the socialist Democratic People 's Republic of Korea in the north , and the capitalist Republic of Korea in the south . An invasion initiated by North Korea led to the Korean War ( 1950-1953 ) . The Korean Armistice Agreement brought about a ceasefire , but no peace treaty was signed . North Korea officially describes itself as a self-reliant socialist state , and formally holds elections , though they have been described by outside observers as sham elections . Outside observers also generally view North Korea as a Stalinist dictatorship , particularly noting the elaborate cult of personality around the Kim dynasty .

The election was marked by controversy as there was evidence of election fraud . Doe had support from the United States ; it was a strategic alliance due to his anti-Soviet stance taken during the years of the Cold War prior to the changes in 1989 that led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union . The first native head of state in the country 's history , Doe was a member of the Krahn ethnic group , a largely rural people . Before the 1980 coup , natives had often held a marginal role in society , which was dominated by the descendants of the Americo-Liberian Pioneers ; composed primarily of free-born American blacks and freed slaves , the Pioneers were the immigrants who had established Liberia in the 1820s and led the country beginning with independence in 1847 .

English is the official language , but over 20 indigenous languages are spoken , representing the numerous ethnic groups who make up more than 95% of the population . The country 's capital and largest city is Monrovia . Liberia began as a settlement of the American Colonization Society ( ACS ) , who believed black people would face better chances for freedom and prosperity in Africa than in the United States . The country declared its independence on July 26 , 1847 . The U.S. did not recognize Liberia 's independence until February 5 , 1862 , during the American Civil War .
