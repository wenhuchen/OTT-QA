Fantasia was first released as a theatrical roadshow held in thirteen U.S. cities from November 13 , 1940 . While acclaimed by critics , it was unable to make a profit due to World War II cutting off distribution to the European market , the film 's high production costs , and the expense of leasing theatres and installing the Fantasound equipment for the roadshow presentations .
