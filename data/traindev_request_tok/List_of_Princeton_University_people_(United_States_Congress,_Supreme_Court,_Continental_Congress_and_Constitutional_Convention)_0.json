Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged into the State of Oklahoma when it became the 46th state to enter the union on November 16 , 1907 . With ancient mountain ranges , prairie , mesas , and eastern forests , most of Oklahoma lies in the Great Plains , Cross Timbers , and the U.S .

New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state by area but the 11th-most populous , with 9 million residents as of 2017 and an area of 8,722.58 square miles , making it the most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states , with its biggest city being Newark . New Jersey lies completely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia . New Jersey was the second-wealthiest U.S. state by median household income as of 2017 . New Jersey was inhabited by Native Americans for more than 2,800 years , with historical tribes such as the Lenape along the coast . In the early 17th century , the Dutch and the Swedes founded the first European settlements in the state . The English later seized control of the region , naming it the Province of New Jersey after the largest of the Channel Islands , Jersey , and granting it as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley , 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton . New Jersey was the site of several important battles during the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century . In the 19th century , factories in the cities Camden , Paterson , Newark , Trenton , Jersey City , and Elizabeth ( known as the Big Six ) , helped drive the Industrial Revolution . New Jersey 's geographic location at the center of the Northeast megalopolis , between Boston and New York City to the northeast , and Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Washington , D.C. , to the southwest , fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century . At the turn of the 21st century , this suburbanization began reverting with the consolidation of New Jersey 's culturally diverse populace toward more urban settings within the state , with towns home to commuter rail stations outpacing the population growth of more automobile-oriented suburbs since 2008 .",

The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery .

The state 's largest city is Baltimore , and its capital is Annapolis . Among its occasional nicknames are Old Line State , the Free State , and the Chesapeake Bay State . It is named after the English queen Henrietta Maria , known in England as Queen Mary , who was the wife of King Charles I. Sixteen of Maryland 's twenty-three counties , as well as the city of Baltimore , border the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay estuary and its many tributaries , which combined total more than 4,000 miles of shoreline . Although one of the smallest states in the U.S. , it features a variety of climates and topographical features that have earned it the moniker of America in Miniature . In a similar vein , Maryland 's geography , culture , and history combine elements of the Mid-Atlantic , Northeastern , and South Atlantic regions of the country . Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century , Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans , mostly by the Algonquin , and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux . As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain , Maryland was founded by George Calvert , a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England . In 1632 , Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter , naming the colony after his wife , Queen Mary ( Henrietta Maria of France ) . Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans , who rejected Catholicism in their settlements , Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration . Accordingly , in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion , which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation . Nevertheless , religious strife was common in the early years , and Catholics remained a minority , albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony .",

The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay , which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna . The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond ; Virginia Beach is the most populous city , and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision . The Commonwealth 's estimated population as of 2018 [ update ] is over 8.5 million . The area 's history begins with several indigenous groups , including the Powhatan . In 1607 the London Company established the Colony of Virginia as the first permanent English colony in the New World . Virginia 's state nickname , the Old Dominion , is a reference to this status . Slave labor and the land acquired from displaced Native American tribes each played a significant role in the colony 's early politics and plantation economy . Virginia was one of the 13 Colonies in the American Revolution . In the American Civil War , Virginia 's Secession Convention resolved to join the Confederacy , and Virginia 's First Wheeling Convention resolved to remain in the Union ; that led to the creation of West Virginia .

Selected by the Senate at large , the president pro tempore has enjoyed many privileges and some limited powers . During the vice president 's absence , the president pro tempore is empowered to preside over Senate sessions . In practice , neither the vice president nor the president pro tempore usually presides ; instead , the duty of presiding officer is rotated among junior U.S. senators of the majority party to give them experience in parliamentary procedure . Since 1890 , the most senior U.S. senator in the majority party has generally been chosen to be president pro tempore and holds the office continuously until the election of another . This tradition has been observed without interruption since 1949 . Since the enactment of the current Presidential Succession Act in 1947 , the president pro tempore is third in the line of succession to the presidency , after the vice president and the speaker of the House of Representatives and ahead of the secretary of state .

Burr shot his political rival Alexander Hamilton in an 1804 duel , during the last full year of his single term as vice president . He was never tried for the illegal duel and all charges against him were eventually dropped , but Hamilton 's death ended Burr 's political career . Burr left Washington , D.C. , and traveled west seeking new opportunities , both economic and political - as well as refuge from the controversy surrounding him in the rest of the country . His activities eventually led to his arrest on charges of treason in 1807 . He was tried and acquitted multiple times , but the fallout left him with large debts and few influential friends .

The vice president is indirectly elected together with the president to a four-year term of office by the people of the United States through the Electoral College . Section 2 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment , ratified in 1967 , created a mechanism for intra-term vice presidential succession , establishing that vice presidential vacancies will be filled by the president and confirmed by both houses of Congress . Prior to 1967 , in the event a vice president succeeded to the presidency , died , or resigned from office , the vice presidency remained vacant until the next presidential and vice presidential terms began . The vice president is also a statutory member of the National Security Council , and the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution . The Office of the Vice President assists and organises the vice president 's official functions . The role of the vice presidency has changed dramatically since the office was created during the 1787 constitutional Convention . Especially over the past 100 years , the vice presidency has evolved into a position of domestic and foreign policy political power , and is now widely seen as an integral part of a president 's administration . As the vice president 's role within the executive branch has expanded , his role within the legislative branch has contracted ; for example , he presides over the Senate only infrequently .",
