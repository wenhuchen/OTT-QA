Macabea does n't even possess the culture of poverty ; she is simply an emptiness . The film is reviewed in Pauline Kael 's ninth collection of movie reviews , Hooked , where she praises it , and particularly the performance of Marcelia Cartaxo . The film gets to you , and the image of Marcelia Cartaxo 's Macabea is what does it - the terrible aloneness of this mass woman , this nothing of a woman whom you would n't notice on the street . Umberto D stood for all the proud , angry old people who could n't live on their pensions , but he was himself too - his own ornery old man .

But Mollberg used unknown actors and the movie was colourised and shot by a handhold camera . Mollberg did not begin directing films for the cinema until he was well into his forties . He made a notable splash on the international festival circuit in 1974 with The Earth Is A Sinful Song ( 1973 ) , his debut feature , an earthy , erotically-charged , blood-soaked tale of a young village girl 's ill-fated affair with a Lapp reindeer herdsman . Based on a novel by the late Timo K.

It also introduced Mollberg 's trademark style : a realistic naturalism full of expressive force with which he merges the people with the scenery , stripping them bare of life 's illusions and the polished veneer of culture ( Sakari Toiviainen ) .
