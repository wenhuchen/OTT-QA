The group includes the Beijing dialect , the basis of Standard Chinese or Standard Mandarin . Because Mandarin originated in North China and most Mandarin dialects are found in the north , the group is sometimes referred to as the Northern dialects ( \u5317\u65b9\u8bdd ; b\u011bif\u0101nghu\u00e0 ) . Many local Mandarin varieties are not mutually intelligible . Nevertheless , Mandarin is often placed first in lists of languages by number of native speakers ( with nearly a billion ) . Mandarin is by far the largest of the seven or ten Chinese dialect groups , spoken by 70 percent of all Chinese speakers over a large geographical area , stretching from Yunnan in the southwest to Xinjiang in the northwest and Heilongjiang in the northeast . This is generally attributed to the greater ease of travel and communication in the North China Plain compared to the more mountainous south , combined with the relatively recent spread of Mandarin to frontier areas . Most Mandarin varieties have four tones . The final stops of Middle Chinese have disappeared in most of these varieties , but some have merged them as a final glottal stop . Many Mandarin varieties , including the Beijing dialect , retain retroflex initial consonants , which have been lost in southern varieties of Chinese . The capital has been within the Mandarin area for most of the last millennium , making these dialects very influential . Some form of Mandarin has served as a national lingua franca since the 14th century .",
  "/wiki/Sino-Tibetan_languages": "Sino-Tibetan , in a few sources also known as Trans-Himalayan , is a family of more than 400 languages , second only to Indo-European in number of native speakers . The Sino-Tibetan language with the most native speakers is Mandarin Chinese ( 920 million ) , although since not all forms of Mandarin are mutually-intelligible , it may be regarded as a complex series of dialect continua . Other Sino-Tibetan languages with large numbers of speakers include Burmese ( 33 million ) and the Tibetic languages ( six million ) . Other languages of the family are spoken in the Himalayas , the Southeast Asian Massif , and the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau ; the latter group , in most cases , have only small speech communities , in remote mountain areas , and as such are poorly documented . While most linguists do not include Kra-Dai and Hmong-Mien languages within Sino-Tibetan , Chinese linguists generally do include them . [ citation needed ] Several low-level subgroups have been securely reconstructed , but reconstruction of a proto-language for the family as a whole is still at an early stage , so the higher-level structure of Sino-Tibetan remains unclear . Although the family is traditionally presented as divided into Sinitic ( i.e . Chinese ) and Tibeto-Burman branches , a common origin of the non-Sinitic languages has never been demonstrated . Several links to other language families have been proposed , but none has broad acceptance .",
  "/wiki/Varieties_of_Chinese": "Chinese , also known as Sinitic , [ a ] is a branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family consisting of hundreds of local language varieties that are not mutually intelligible . The differences are greater than within the Romance languages , with variation particularly strong in the more mountainous southeast . The varieties are typically classified into several groups : Mandarin , Wu , Min , Xiang , Gan , Hakka and Yue , though some varieties remain unclassified . Some authors further divide Mandarin , Yue and especially Min . These groups are neither clades nor individual languages defined by mutual intelligibility , but reflect common phonological developments from Middle Chinese . Chinese varieties differ most in their phonology , and to a lesser extent in vocabulary and syntax . Southern varieties tend to have fewer initial consonants than northern and central varieties , but more often preserve the Middle Chinese final consonants . All have phonemic tones , with northern varieties tending to have fewer distinctions than southern ones . Many have tone sandhi , with the most complex patterns in the coastal area from Zhejiang to eastern Guangdong . Standard Chinese , a form of Mandarin , takes its phonology from the Beijing dialect , with vocabulary from the Mandarin group and grammar based on literature in the modern written vernacular . It is one of the official languages of China . Taiwanese Mandarin is one of the official languages of Taiwan .",

It is a global language , the world 's second-most spoken native language , after Mandarin Chinese , and the world 's fourth-most spoken language , after Mandarin Chinese , English and Hindi . Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages , which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century . The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century , and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo , a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile , in the 13th century . Beginning in 1492 , the Spanish language was taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire , most notably to the Americas , as well as territories in Africa , Oceania and the Philippines . A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist Mario Pei , analyzing the degree of difference from a language 's parent ( Latin , in the case of Romance languages ) by comparing phonology , inflection , syntax , vocabulary , and intonation , indicated the following percentages ( the higher the percentage , the greater the distance from Latin ) : In the case of Spanish , it is one of the closest Romance languages to Latin ( 20% distance ) , only behind Sardinian ( 8% distance ) and Italian ( 12% distance ) . Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin , including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek . Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date , having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula . With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin , this language makes up the second greatest vocabulary source after Latin itself . It has also been influenced by Basque , Iberian , Celtiberian , Visigothic , and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages . Additionally , it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages , particularly other Romance languages - French , Italian , Andalusi Romance , Portuguese , Galician , Catalan , Occitan , and Sardinian - as well as from Quechua , Nahuatl , and other indigenous languages of the Americas . Spanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations .",
  "/wiki/Indo-European_languages": "The Indo-European languages are a language family of several hundred related languages and dialects in Asia and Europe . There are about 445 living Indo-European languages , according to the estimate by Ethnologue , with over two thirds ( 313 ) of them belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch . The Indo-European languages with the greatest numbers of native speakers are Spanish , English , Hindustani ( Hindi/Urdu ) , Portuguese , Bengali , Punjabi , and Russian , each with over 100 million speakers , with German , French , Marathi , Italian , and Persian also having more than 50 million . Today , 46% of the world 's population ( 3.2 billion ) speaks an Indo-European language as a first language , by far the highest of any language family . The Indo-European family includes most of the modern languages of Europe . The language family is also represented in Asia with the exception of East and Southeast Asia . It was prominent ( alongside non-Indo-European languages ) in ancient Anatolia ( present-day Turkey ) , the ancient Tarim Basin ( present-day Northwest China ) and most of Central Asia until the medieval Turkic and Mongol invasions . Outside Eurasia , Indo-European languages are dominant in the Americas and much of Oceania and Africa , having reached there through colonialism during the Age of Discovery and later periods . Indo-European languages are also most commonly present as minority languages or second languages in countries where other families are dominant . With written evidence appearing from the Bronze Age in the form of Mycenaean Greek and the Anatolian languages Hittite and Luwian , the Indo-European family is significant to the field of historical linguistics as possessing the second-longest recorded history , after the Afroasiatic family in the form of the Egyptian language and the Semitic languages of the Near East . In addition , certain extinct language isolates of the Near East and Anatolia , such as Sumerian , Elamite , Hurrian , Hattian , Gutian , and Kassite are also recorded earlier than any Indo-European tongue . All Indo-European languages are descendants of a single prehistoric language , reconstructed as Proto-Indo-European , spoken sometime in the Neolithic era .",

  "/wiki/English_language": "English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and eventually became a global lingua franca . It is named after the Angles , one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name , as England . Both names derive from Anglia , a peninsula in the Baltic Sea . The language is closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon , and its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages , particularly Norse ( a North Germanic language ) , and to a greater extent by Latin and French . English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years . The earliest forms of English , a group of West Germanic ( Ingvaeonic ) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century , are collectively called Old English . Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England ; this was a period in which the language was influenced by French . Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London , the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift . Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States . Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries , English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science , navigation and law . English is the largest language by number of speakers , and the third most-spoken native language in the world , after Standard Chinese and Spanish . It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states .",

The West Germanic languages include the three most widely spoken Germanic languages : English with around 360-400 million native speakers ; [ nb 2 ] German , with over 100 million native speakers ; and Dutch , with 24 million native speakers . Other West Germanic languages include Afrikaans , an offshoot of Dutch , with over 7.1 million native speakers ; Low German , considered a separate collection of unstandardized dialects , with roughly 0.3 million native speakers and probably 6.7-10 million people who can understand it ( at least 5 million in Germany and 1.7 million in the Netherlands ) ; Yiddish , once used by approximately 13 million Jews in pre-World War II Europe , and Scots , both with 1.5 million native speakers ; Limburgish varieties with roughly 1.3 million speakers along the Dutch-Belgian-German border ; and the Frisian languages with over 0.5 million native speakers in the Netherlands and Germany . The largest North Germanic languages are Danish , Norwegian and Swedish , which are mutually intelligible and have a combined total of about 20 million native speakers in the Nordic countries and an additional five million second language speakers ; since the middle ages these languages have however been strongly influenced by the West Germanic language Middle Low German , and Low German words account for about 30-60% of their vocabularies according to various estimates . Other North Germanic languages are Faroese and Icelandic , which are more conservative languages with no significant Low German influence , more complex grammar and limited mutual intelligibility with the others today . The East Germanic branch included Gothic , Burgundian , and Vandalic , all of which are now extinct . The last to die off was Crimean Gothic , spoken until the late 18th century in some isolated areas of Crimea . The SIL Ethnologue lists 48 different living Germanic languages , 41 of which belong to the Western branch and six to the Northern branch ; it places Riograndenser Hunsr\u00fcckisch German in neither of the categories , but it is often considered a German dialect by linguists .

Modern Hindi is the standardised and Sanskritised register of the Hindustani language , which itself is based primarily on the Khariboli dialect of Delhi and other nearby areas of Northern India . Hindi , written in the Devanagari script , is one of the two official languages of the Government of India , along with the English language . It is one of the 22 scheduled languages of the Republic of India .

According to the Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World , Hindustani is an Indo-Aryan language , deriving its base primarily from the Western Hindi dialect of Delhi , also known as Khariboli . Hindustani is a pluricentric language , with two standardised registers , Modern Standard Hindi and Modern Standard Urdu . The term Hindustani was used in the colonial period ; the term Hindi-Urdu has been in common use among scholars since 1980 . Also according to the Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World , Hindustani as a colloquial speech developed over almost seven centuries from 1100 to 1800 . The Muslims conquered northern India from the 10th to the 13th centuries and settled down in the country , bringing with them their Persian language and culture . This mixing of cultures provided the contact situation for the emergence of Hindustani as a lingua franca . According to linguist Colin P. Masica , the term Hindustani was much in vogue during Independence movement as expression of national unity ; after Partition in 1947 and subsequent linguistic polarization it fell into disfavor According to Encyclopaedia Britannica , 1961 , The everyday speech of well over 50,000,000 persons of all communities in the north of India and in West Pakistan is the expression of a common language , Hindustani . The Hindi film industry has employed Hindustani which included many Urdu and Persian words ; Bollywood 's screenplays are written in Hindustani . The language 's core vocabulary is derived from Prakrit ( a descendant of Sanskrit ) , with substantial loanwords from Persian and Arabic ( via Persian ) . The number of speakers can only be estimated . Ethnologue reports that , as of 2019 , Hindi and Urdu together constitute the 3rd-most-spoken language in the world after English and Mandarin , with 785 million native and second-language speakers , though this includes millions who self-reported their language as 'Hindi ' on the Indian census but speak a number of other Hindi languages than Hindustani .",

Japanese has been grouped with language families such as Ainu , Austroasiatic , and the now-discredited Altaic , but none of these proposals has gained widespread acceptance . Little is known of the language 's prehistory , or when it first appeared in Japan . Chinese documents from the 3rd century recorded a few Japanese words , but substantial texts did not appear until the 8th century . During the Heian period ( 794-1185 ) , Chinese had considerable influence on the vocabulary and phonology of Old Japanese . Late Middle Japanese ( 1185-1600 ) included changes in features that brought it closer to the modern language , and the first appearance of European loanwords . The standard dialect moved from the Kansai region to the Edo ( modern Tokyo ) region in the Early Modern Japanese period ( early 17th century-mid-19th century ) . Following the end of Japan 's self-imposed isolation in 1853 , the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly . English loanwords , in particular , have become frequent , and Japanese words from English roots have proliferated . Japanese is an agglutinative , mora-timed language with simple phonotactics , a pure vowel system , phonemic vowel and consonant length , and a lexically significant pitch-accent .

The Dravidian languages are first attested in the 2nd century BCE as Tamil-Brahmi script inscribed on the cave walls in the Madurai and Tirunelveli districts of Tamil Nadu . [ a ] The Dravidian languages with the most speakers are ( in descending order of number of speakers ) Telugu , Tamil , Kannada and Malayalam , all of which have long literary traditions . Smaller literary languages are Tulu and Kodava . There are also small groups of Dravidian-speaking scheduled tribes , who live outside Dravidian-speaking areas , such as the Kurukh in Eastern India and Gondi in Central India . Only two Dravidian languages are spoken exclusively outside the post-1947 state of India : Brahui in the Balochistan region of Pakistan and Afghanistan ; and Dhangar , a dialect of Kurukh , in parts of Nepal and Bhutan . [ better source needed ] Dravidian place names along the Arabian Sea coasts and Dravidian grammatical influence such as clusivity in the Indo-Aryan languages , namely Marathi , Konkani , Gujarati , Marwari , and Sindhi , suggest that Dravidian languages were once spoken more widely across the Indian subcontinent . Though some scholars have argued that the Dravidian languages may have been brought to India by migrations from the Iranian plateau in the fourth or third millennium BCE or even earlier , the Dravidian languages can not easily be connected to any other language family and they could well be indigenous to India .

  "/wiki/Wu_Chinese": "Wu is a group of linguistically similar and historically related Sinitic languages spoken primarily in Shanghai , Zhejiang province , the southern half of Jiangsu province and bordering areas . Major Wu varieties include those of Shanghai , Suzhou , Wuxi , Changzhou , Ningbo , Hangzhou , Shaoxing , Wenzhou , Jinhua and Yongkang . Wu speakers , such as Chiang Kai-shek , Lu Xun and Cai Yuanpei , occupied positions of great importance in modern Chinese culture and politics . Wu can also be found being used in Pingtan , Yue opera , and Shanghai opera , the former which is second only in national popularity to Peking opera ; as well as in the performances of the popular entertainer and comedian Zhou Libo . Wu is also spoken in a large number of diaspora communities , with significant centers of immigration originating from Shanghai , Ningbo , Qingtian and Wenzhou . Suzhou has traditionally been the linguistic center of Wu and was likely the first place the distinct variety of Sinitic known as Wu developed . Suzhou dialect is widely considered to be the most linguistically representative of the family . It was mostly the basis of the Wu lingua franca that developed in Shanghai leading to the formation of standard Shanghainese , which as a center of economic power and possessing the largest population of Wu speakers , has attracted the most attention . Due to the influence of Shanghainese , Wu as a whole is incorrectly labelled in English as simply , Shanghainese , when introducing the language family to non-specialists . Wu is the more accurate terminology for the greater grouping that the Shanghainese variety is part of ; other less precise terms include Jiangnan speech ( \u6c5f\u5357\u8a71 ) , Jiangzhe ( Jiangsu-Zhejiang ) speech ( \u6c5f\u6d59\u8a71 ) , and less commonly Wuyue speech ( \u5433\u8d8a\u8a9e ) . The Wu group ( Southern Wu in particular ) is well known among linguists and sinologists as being one of the most internally diverse among the Sinitic groups , with very little mutual intelligibility between varieties across subgroups . Among speakers of other Sinitic languages , Wu is often subjectively judged to be soft , light , and flowing .",

Outside Turkey , significant smaller groups of speakers exist in Germany , Austria , Bulgaria , North Macedonia , Northern Cyprus , Greece , the Caucasus , and other parts of Europe and Central Asia . Cyprus has requested that the European Union add Turkish as an official language , even though Turkey is not a member state . To the west , the influence of Ottoman Turkish - the variety of the Turkish language that was used as the administrative and literary language of the Ottoman Empire - spread as the Ottoman Empire expanded . In 1928 , as one of Atat\u00fcrk 's Reforms in the early years of the Republic of Turkey , the Ottoman Turkish alphabet was replaced with a Latin alphabet . The distinctive characteristics of the Turkish language are vowel harmony and extensive agglutination . The basic word order of Turkish is subject-object-verb . Turkish has no noun classes or grammatical gender . The language makes usage of honorifics and has a strong T-V distinction which distinguishes varying levels of politeness , social distance , age , courtesy or familiarity toward the addressee . The plural second-person pronoun and verb forms are used referring to a single person out of respect .",
  "/wiki/Turkic_languages": "The Turkic languages are a language family of at least 35 documented languages , spoken by the Turkic peoples of Eurasia from Eastern Europe , the Caucasus , Central Asia and West Asia all the way to North Asia ( particularly in Siberia ) and East Asia . The Turkic languages originated in a region of East Asia spanning Western China to Mongolia , where Proto-Turkic is thought to have been spoken , from where they expanded to Central Asia and farther west during the first millennium . Turkic languages are spoken as a native language by some 170 million people , and the total number of Turkic speakers , including second language speakers , is over 200 million . The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is Turkish , spoken mainly in Anatolia and the Balkans ; its native speakers account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers . Characteristic features such as vowel harmony , agglutination , and lack of grammatical gender , are universal within the Turkic family . There is also a high degree of mutual intelligibility among the various Oghuz languages , which include Turkish , Azerbaijani , Turkmen , Qashqai , Gagauz , Balkan Gagauz Turkish and Oghuz-influenced Crimean Tatar . Although methods of classification vary , the Turkic languages are usually considered to be divided equally into two branches : Oghur , the only surviving member of which is Chuvash , and Common Turkic , which includes all other Turkic languages including the Oghuz subbranch . Turkic languages show some similarities with the Mongolic , Tungusic , Koreanic and Japonic languages . These similarities led some linguists to propose an Altaic language family , though this proposal is widely rejected by historical linguists . Apparent similarities with the Uralic languages even caused these families to be regarded as one for a long time under the Ural-Altaic hypothesis . However , there has not been sufficient evidence to conclude the existence of either of these macrofamilies , the shared characteristics between the languages being attributed presently to extensive prehistoric language contact .",
  "/wiki/Oghuz_languages": "The Oghuz languages are a sub-branch of the Turkic language family , spoken by approximately 108 million people . The three languages with the largest number of speakers are Turkish , Azerbaijani and Turkmen , which combined account for more than 95% of speakers .",

It is a member of the Koreanic language family and is the official and national language of both Koreas : North Korea and South Korea , with different standardized official forms used in each country . It is a recognised minority language in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and Changbai Korean Autonomous County of Jilin province , China . It is also spoken in parts of Sakhalin , Russia , and Central Asia . Historical and modern linguists classify Korean as a language isolate ; however , it does have a few extinct relatives , which together with Korean itself and the Jeju language ( spoken in the Jeju Province and considered somewhat distinct ) form the Koreanic language family . The linguistic homeland of Korean is suggested to be somewhere in Manchuria .",
  "/wiki/Koreanic_languages": "The Koreanic languages are a language family consisting of the modern Korean language together with extinct ancient relatives . The language of Jeju Island , considered by some as a dialect of modern Korean , is distinct enough to be considered a language in its own right by other authorities . This would make Korean and Jeju a small language family . Koreanic is suggested to have originated somewhere in Manchuria and later migrated into the Korean Peninsula .",
  "/wiki/Language_isolate": "A language isolate , in the absolute sense , is a natural language with no demonstrable genealogical ( or genetic ) relationship with other languages , one that has not been demonstrated to descend from an ancestor common with any other language . Language isolates are in effect language families consisting of a single language . Commonly cited examples include Ainu , Basque , Sumerian , Elamite , and Vedda , though in each case a minority of linguists claim to have demonstrated a relationship with other languages . Some sources use the term language isolate to indicate a branch of a larger family with only one surviving member . For instance , Albanian , Armenian and Greek are commonly called Indo-European isolates . While part of the Indo-European family , they do not belong to any established branch ( such as the Romance , Indo-Iranian , Celtic , Slavic or Germanic branches ) , but instead form independent branches . Similarly , within the Romance languages , Sardinian is a relative isolate . However , without a qualifier , isolate is understood to mean having no demonstrable genetic relationship to any other known language . Some languages once seen as isolates may be reclassified as small families . This happened with Japanese ( now included in the Japonic family along with Ryukyuan languages such as Okinawan ) and Korean in Koreanic languages with Jeju language . The Etruscan language of Italy has long been considered an isolate , but some have proposed that it is related to the so-called Tyrsenian languages , an extinct family of closely related ancient languages proposed by Helmut Rix in 1998 , including the Rhaetian language , formerly spoken in the central Alps , and the Lemnian language , formerly spoken on the Greek island of Lemnos . Language isolates may be seen as a special case of unclassified languages that remain unclassified even after extensive efforts .",

It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire , as did all Romance languages . French evolved from Gallo-Romance , the spoken Latin in Gaul , and more specifically in Northern Gaul . Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders . Today , owing to France 's past overseas expansion , there are numerous French-based creole languages , most notably Haitian Creole . A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French . French is an official language in 29 countries across multiple continents , most of which are members of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie ( OIF ) , the community of 84 countries which share the official use or teaching of French . It is spoken as a first language ( in descending order of the number of speakers ) in France , the Canadian provinces of Quebec , Ontario and New Brunswick as well as other Francophone regions , Belgium ( Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region ) , western Switzerland ( cantons of Bern , Fribourg , Geneva , Jura , Neuch\u00e2tel , Vaud , Valais ) , Monaco , partly in Luxembourg , the states of Louisiana , Maine , New Hampshire and Vermont in the United States , and in northwestern Italy ( region of Aosta Valley ) , and by various communities elsewhere . In 2015 , approximately 40% of the francophone population ( including L2 and partial speakers ) lived in Europe , 35% in sub-Saharan Africa , 15% in North Africa and the Middle East , 8% in the Americas , and 1% in Asia and Oceania .

Urdu is the official national language , and lingua franca , of Pakistan . In India , it is one of 22 constitutionally recognised official languages , having official status in the five states of Telangana , Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , Jharkhand and West Bengal , as well as the national capital territory of Delhi . As both registers are composed of the same Indo-Aryan vocabulary base , colloquial Urdu is largely mutually intelligible with colloquial Hindi , with the two registers being grouped together as Hindustani or Hindi-Urdu . With respect to literary vocabulary , however , formal Urdu draws heavily from Persian vocabulary and requires knowledge of some simple Persian grammatical structures , while formal Hindi heavily draws from Sanskrit for its formal and technical vocabulary . Later , Urdu became the official language of government in northern and northwest British India , along with English , from 1837 onwards in place of Persian , which had been used by various Indo-Islamic empires as their language of government . Religious , social , and political factors arose during the colonial period that advocated for a distinction between Urdu and Hindi , leading to the Hindi-Urdu controversy . According to Nationalencyklopedin 's 2010 estimates , Urdu is the 21st most spoken first language in the world , with approximately 66 million who speak it as their native language . According to Ethnologue 's 2018 estimates , Urdu , is the 11th most widely spoken language in the world , with 170 million total speakers , including those who speak it as a second language . If grouped along with Hindi , Hindustani would be the 3rd most spoken language in the world , with approximately 329.1 million native speakers , and 697.4 million total speakers of both Urdu and Hindi ."
