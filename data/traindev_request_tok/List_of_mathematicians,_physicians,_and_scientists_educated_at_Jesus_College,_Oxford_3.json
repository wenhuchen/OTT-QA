  "/wiki/Raman_spectroscopy": "Raman spectroscopy ( /\u02c8r\u0251\u02d0m\u0259n/ ) ; ( named after Indian physicist C. V. Raman ) is a spectroscopic technique typically used to determine vibrational modes of molecules , although rotational and other low-frequency modes of systems may also be observed . Raman spectroscopy is commonly used in chemistry to provide a structural fingerprint by which molecules can be identified . Raman spectroscopy relies upon inelastic scattering of photons , known as Raman scattering . A source of monochromatic light , usually from a laser in the visible , near infrared , or near ultraviolet range is used , although X-rays can also be used . The laser light interacts with molecular vibrations , phonons or other excitations in the system , resulting in the energy of the laser photons being shifted up or down . The shift in energy gives information about the vibrational modes in the system . Infrared spectroscopy typically yields similar , complementary , information . Typically , a sample is illuminated with a laser beam . Electromagnetic radiation from the illuminated spot is collected with a lens and sent through a monochromator . Elastic scattered radiation at the wavelength corresponding to the laser line ( Rayleigh scattering ) is filtered out by either a notch filter , edge pass filter , or a band pass filter , while the rest of the collected light is dispersed onto a detector . Spontaneous Raman scattering is typically very weak ; as a result , for many years the main difficulty in collecting Raman spectra was separating the weak inelastically scattered light from the intense Rayleigh scattered laser light ( referred to as laser rejection ) . Historically , Raman spectrometers used holographic gratings and multiple dispersion stages to achieve a high degree of laser rejection .",

  "/wiki/Walter_H._Stockmayer": "Walter Hugo Stockmayer ( April 7 , 1914 in Rutherford , New Jersey - May 9 , 2004 in Norwich , Vermont ) was an internationally known chemist and university teacher . A former member of the National Academy of Sciences , he was recognized as one of the twentieth century pioneers of polymer science . His specific interest was in theory and experiment for the structure and dynamics of polymer molecules , including various uses of the light scattering method . Stockmayer became interested in the mathematical aspects of physical chemistry as an undergraduate at MIT . A Rhodes Scholarship brought him to Jesus College , Oxford , where he undertook gas kinetics research with D. L. Chapman . He introduced the Stockmayer potential . Stockmayer returned to MIT for Ph.D. research and pursued his study of statistical mechanics , which he later continued at Columbia University . He returned again to MIT in 1943 to study the theory of network formation and the gelation criterion . Stockmayer increasingly directed his attention to theories of polymer solutions , light scattering and chain dynamics . After a Guggenheim Fellowship for the academic year 1954/1955 in Strasbourg , France , he returned once more to MIT , then moved to Dartmouth College in 1961 . There , he worked primarily on copolymers in dilute solution , established the journal Macromolecules , and collaborated with many Japanese scientists . Stockmayer is mentioned as a friend of the author in the novel Breakfast of Champions by Kurt Vonnegut , and is described as a distinguished pianist and a good skier .",
  "/wiki/Rhodes_Scholar": "The Rhodes Scholarship is an international postgraduate award for students to study at the University of Oxford . It was established in 1902 , making it the first large-scale programme of international scholarship . The Rhodes Scholarship was founded by English businessman and politician Cecil John Rhodes , to promote unity between English-speaking nations and instill a sense of civic-minded leadership and moral fortitude in future leaders irrespective of their chosen career paths . Although initially restricted to male applicants from countries which are today within the British Commonwealth , as well as Germany and the United States , today the scholarship is open to applicants from all backgrounds and from across the globe . Since its creation , controversy has surrounded both its former exclusion of women ( thus leading to the establishment of the co-educational Marshall Scholarship ) , and Rhodes ' white supremacist beliefs and legacy of colonialism . Prominent recipients of the Rhodes Scholarship include politicians , academics , scientists , authors and entrepreneurs . Notable American politicians include former president of the United States Bill Clinton , former United States national security advisor and United States ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice , former governor of Louisiana Piyush Bobby Jindal , former United States secretary of the Air Force and former congresswoman Heather Wilson , and former United States secretary of health and human services Sylvia Matthews Burwell . President of Pakistan Wasim Sajjad ; former prime minister of Malta Dom Mintoff ; former Australian prime ministers Tony Abbott , Bob Hawke and Malcolm Turnbull ; and the current deputy prime minister of Canada , Chrystia Freeland are also Rhodes Scholars . Other notable Rhodes Scholars include journalist and American television host Rachel Maddow , author Naomi Wolf , former 2020 presidential candidate and New Jersey senator Cory Booker , 2020 presidential candidate and former mayor of South Bend Pete Buttigieg , former president of Planned Parenthood Leana Wen , Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ronan Farrow , and president of the Walmart Foundation Kathleen McLaughlin . The current Warden and CEO of the Rhodes Trust , Elizabeth Kiss , is also a Rhodes Scholar . Some people offered this scholarship have not accepted it , including Sir Alimuddin Zumla , who declined the scholarship as a teenager to study medicine .",
  "/wiki/Polymer": "A polymer ( /\u02c8p\u0252l\u026am\u0259r/ ; Greek poly- , many + -mer , part ) is a large molecule , or macromolecule , composed of many repeated subunits . Due to their broad range of properties , both synthetic and natural polymers play essential and ubiquitous roles in everyday life . Polymers range from familiar synthetic plastics such as polystyrene to natural biopolymers such as DNA and proteins that are fundamental to biological structure and function . Polymers , both natural and synthetic , are created via polymerization of many small molecules , known as monomers . Their consequently large molecular mass , relative to small molecule compounds , produces unique physical properties including toughness , viscoelasticity , and a tendency to form glasses and semicrystalline structures rather than crystals . The terms polymer and resin are often synonymous with plastic . The term polymer derives from the Greek word \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03c2 ( polus , meaning many , much ) and \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ( meros , meaning part ) , and refers to a molecule whose structure is composed of multiple repeating units , from which originates a characteristic of high relative molecular mass and attendant properties . The units composing polymers derive , actually or conceptually , from molecules of low relative molecular mass . The term was coined in 1833 by J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius , though with a definition distinct from the modern IUPAC definition . The modern concept of polymers as covalently bonded macromolecular structures was proposed in 1920 by Hermann Staudinger , who spent the next decade finding experimental evidence for this hypothesis . Polymers are studied in the fields of biophysics and macromolecular science , and polymer science ( which includes polymer chemistry and polymer physics ) . Historically , products arising from the linkage of repeating units by covalent chemical bonds have been the primary focus of polymer science ; emerging important areas of the science now focus on non-covalent links .",
