  "/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire": "The Holy Roman Empire ( Latin : Sacrum Imperium Romanum ; German : Heiliges R\u00f6misches Reich ) , also known as Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation , was a multi-ethnic complex of territories in Western and Central Europe that developed during the Early Middle Ages and continued until its dissolution in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars . The largest territory of the empire after 962 was the Kingdom of Germany , though it also included the neighboring Kingdom of Bohemia and Kingdom of Italy , plus numerous other territories , and soon after the Kingdom of Burgundy was added . Its size gradually diminished over time , particularly from 1648 onward , and by the time of its dissolution , it largely contained only German-speaking territories ( although Switzerland and East Prussia were not included ) , plus the Kingdom of Bohemia which was bordered by the German lands on three sides . At the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 , most of the Holy Roman Empire was included in the German Confederation . On 25 December 800 , Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish king Charlemagne as Emperor , reviving the title in Western Europe , more than three centuries after the fall of the earlier ancient Western Roman Empire in 476 . The title continued in the Carolingian family until 888 and from 896 to 899 , after which it was contested by the rulers of Italy in a series of civil wars until the death of the last Italian claimant , Berengar I , in 924 . The title was revived again in 962 when Otto I was crowned emperor , fashioning himself as the successor of Charlemagne and beginning a continuous existence of the empire for over eight centuries . Some historians refer to the coronation of Charlemagne as the origin of the empire , while others prefer the coronation of Otto I as its beginning . Scholars generally concur , however , in relating an evolution of the institutions and principles constituting the empire , describing a gradual assumption of the imperial title and role . The exact term Holy Roman Empire was not used until the 13th century , but the concept of translatio imperii , [ d ] the notion that he - the sovereign ruler - held supreme power inherited from the ancient emperors of Rome , was fundamental to the prestige of the emperor . The office of Holy Roman Emperor was traditionally elective , although frequently controlled by dynasties . The mostly German prince-electors , the highest-ranking noblemen of the empire , usually elected one of their peers as King of the Romans , and he would later be crowned emperor by the Pope ; the tradition of papal coronations was discontinued in the 16th century .",

Its continental European territory is situated on the Iberian Peninsula . Its territory also includes two archipelagoes : the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa , and the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea . The African enclaves of Ceuta , Melilla , and Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera make Spain the only European country to have a physical border with an African country ( Morocco ) . [ h ] Several small islands in the Alboran Sea are also part of Spanish territory . The country 's mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar ; to the north and northeast by France , Andorra , and the Bay of Biscay ; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean . With an area of 505,990 km2 ( 195,360 sq mi ) , Spain is the largest country in Southern Europe , the second largest country in Western Europe and the European Union , and the fourth largest country in the European continent . By population ( about 47 million ) , Spain is the sixth largest in Europe and the fifth in the European Union . Spain 's capital and largest city is Madrid ; other major urban areas include Barcelona , Valencia , Seville , Zaragoza , M\u00e1laga and Bilbao . Modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 35,000 years ago . Iberian cultures along with ancient Phoenician , Greek , Celtic and Carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under Roman rule around 200 BCE , after which the region was named Hispania , based on the earlier Phoenician name Sp ( a ) n or Spania . At the end of the Western Roman Empire the Germanic tribal confederations migrated from Central Europe , invaded the Iberian peninsula and established relatively independent realms in its western provinces , including the Suebi , Alans and Vandals .",

It is the westernmost sovereign state of mainland Europe , being bordered to the west and south by the Atlantic Ocean and to the north and east by Spain . Its territory also includes the Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira , both autonomous regions with their own regional governments . Portugal is the oldest nation state on the Iberian Peninsula and one of the oldest in Europe and the world , its territory having been continuously settled , invaded and fought over since prehistoric times . The pre-Celtic people , Iberians , Celts , Carthaginians and Romans were followed by the invasions of the Visigoths and Suebi Germanic peoples . After the Muslim conquests of the Iberian Peninsula , most of the territory was part of Al-Andalus until their expulsion . Portugal as a country was established during the early Christian Reconquista . Founded in 868 , the County of Portugal gained prominence after the Battle of S\u00e3o Mamede in 1128 . The Kingdom of Portugal was later proclaimed following the Battle of Ourique in 1139 , and independence from Le\u00f3n was recognised by the Treaty of Zamora in 1143 . On 12 December 2017 , the Portuguese Navy commemorated the 700th anniversary of its official creation by King Denis of Portugal . Tracing its origins back to the 12th century , it is the oldest continuously serving navy in the world . In the 15th and 16th centuries , Portugal established the first global empire , becoming one of the world 's major economic , political and military powers .",

It was de facto dissolved by an emergency decree transferring powers of the Prussian government to German Chancellor Franz von Papen in 1932 and de jure by an Allied decree in 1947 . For centuries , the House of Hohenzollern ruled Prussia , successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army . Prussia , with its capital first in K\u00f6nigsberg and then , in 1701 , in Berlin , decisively shaped the history of Germany . In 1871 , most German states ( notably excluding Austria and Switzerland ) united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership . In November 1918 , the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 1918-19 . The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republic - the Free State of Prussia , a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933 . From 1933 , Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup , when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its Gleichschaltung laws in pursuit of a unitary state . With the end of the Nazi regime , in 1945 , the division of Germany into Allied occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the Oder-Neisse line , which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union , the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto . Prussia existed de jure until its formal abolition by the Allied Control Council Enactment No . 46 of 25 February 1947 . The name Prussia derives from the Old Prussians ; in the 13th century , the Teutonic Knights - an organized Catholic medieval military order of German crusaders - conquered the lands inhabited by them .",
  "/wiki/Denmark\u2013Norway": "Denmark-Norway ( Danish and Norwegian : Danmark-Norge ) , also known as the Dano-Norwegian Realm , the Oldenburg Monarchy , or the Oldenburg realms , was an early modern multi-national and multi-lingual real union consisting of the Kingdom of Denmark , the Kingdom of Norway ( including the Norwegian overseas possessions : the Faroe Islands , Iceland , Greenland , and the Norwegian possessions ) , the Duchy of Schleswig , and the Duchy of Holstein . The state also claimed sovereignty over two historical peoples : Wends and Gutes . Denmark-Norway had several colonies , namely the Danish Gold Coast , the Nicobar Islands , Serampore , Tharangambadi , and the Danish West Indies . The state 's inhabitants were mainly Danes , Norwegians , and Germans , and also included Faroese , Icelanders and Inuit in the Norwegian overseas possessions , a Sami minority in northern Norway , as well as indigenous peoples and enslaved Africans in the colonies .

Margrete I was ruler of Norway from her son 's death in 1387 until her own death in 1412 . Denmark , Norway , and Sweden established and formed the Kalmar Union in 1397 . Following Sweden 's departure in 1523 , the union was effectively dissolved . From 1536/1537 , Denmark and Norway formed a personal union that would eventually develop into the 1660 integrated state called Denmark-Norway by modern historians , at the time sometimes referred to as the Twin Kingdoms , the Monarchy , or simply His Majesty .

Even after 1660 , Denmark-Norway consisted of three formally separate parts , and Norway kept its separate laws and some institutions , and separate coinage and army . The Dano-Norwegian union lasted until 1814 , when the Treaty of Kiel decreed that Norway ( except for the Faroe Islands , Iceland , and Greenland ) be ceded to Sweden .",

It was a predecessor state of the Netherlands and the first fully independent Dutch nation state . The small republic of around 1.5 million inhabitants distinguished itself by world trade through the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and the Dutch West India Company ( WIC ) , by its great military successes against ostensibly stronger countries such as Spain and England , by its huge fleet ( with 2,000 ships , larger than that of England and France combined ) , by the flourishing of arts ( painters such as Rembrandt , Johannes Vermeer and many others ) and sciences ( including Hugo Grotius and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek ) , and by its relatively tolerant atmosphere towards different religions and ideas ( freedom of thought ) .

It suffered many invasions by the English , but under Robert I it fought a successful War of Independence and remained an independent state throughout the late Middle Ages . Following the annexation of the Northern Isles from the Kingdom of Norway in 1472 and the final capture of the Royal Burgh of Berwick by the Kingdom of England in 1482 , the territory of the Kingdom of Scotland corresponded to that of modern-day Scotland , bounded by the North Sea to the east , the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west , and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the southwest . In 1603 , James VI of Scotland became King of England , joining Scotland with England in a personal union . In 1707 , the two kingdoms were united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain under the terms of the Acts of Union . The Crown was the most important element of government . The Scottish monarchy in the Middle Ages was a largely itinerant institution , before Edinburgh developed as a capital city in the second half of the 15th century . The Crown remained at the centre of political life and in the 16th century emerged as a major centre of display and artistic patronage , until it was effectively dissolved with the Union of Crowns in 1603 . The Scottish Crown adopted the conventional offices of western European monarchical states of the time and developed a Privy Council and great offices of state . Parliament also emerged as a major legal institution , gaining an oversight of taxation and policy , but was never as central to the national life . In the early period , the kings of the Scots depended on the great lords - the mormaers and to\u00edsechs - but from the reign of David I , sheriffdoms were introduced , which allowed more direct control and gradually limited the power of the major lordships .",

By 1913 , the British Empire held sway over 412 million people , 23% of the world population at the time , and by 1920 , it covered 35,500,000 km2 ( 13,700,000 sq mi ) , 24% of the Earth 's total land area . As a result , its political , legal , linguistic , and cultural legacy is widespread . At the peak of its power , the phrase the empire on which the sun never sets was often used to describe the British Empire , because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories . During the Age of Discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries , Portugal and Spain pioneered European exploration of the globe , and in the process established large overseas empires .

The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) .

The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England .

It dominated trade on the Mediterranean Sea , including commerce between Europe and North Africa , as well as Asia . The Venetian navy was used in the Crusades , most notably in the Fourth Crusade . However , Venice perceived Rome as an enemy and maintained high levels of religious and ideological independence personified by the Patriarch of Venice and a highly-developed independent publishing industry that served as a haven from Roman Catholic censorship for many centuries . Venice achieved territorial conquests along the Adriatic Sea . Venice became home to an extremely wealthy merchant class , who patronized renowned art and architecture along the city 's lagoons .",

It borders Hungary to the north , Romania to the northeast , Bulgaria to the southeast , North Macedonia to the south , Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to the west , and Montenegro to the southwest . The country claims a border with Albania through the disputed territory of Kosovo . [ a ] Serbia 's population numbers approximately seven million . Its capital , Belgrade , ranks among the largest citi\u0435s in southeastern Europe . Inhabited since the Paleolithic Age , the territory of modern-day Serbia faced Slavic migrations to Southeastern Europe in the 6th century , establishing several regional states in the early Middle Ages at times recognised as tributaries to the Byzantine , Frankish and Hungarian kingdoms . The Serbian Kingdom obtained recognition by the Holy See and Constantinople in 1217 , reaching its territorial apex in 1346 as the relatively short-lived Serbian Empire . By the mid-16th century , the Ottomans annexed the entirety of modern-day Serbia ; their rule was at times interrupted by the Habsburg Empire , which began expanding towards Central Serbia from the end of the 17th century while maintaining a foothold in Vojvodina . In the early 19th century , the Serbian Revolution established the nation-state as the region 's first constitutional monarchy , which subsequently expanded its territory . Following disastrous casualties in World War I , and the subsequent unification of the former Habsburg crownland of Vojvodina ( and other lands ) with Serbia , the country co-founded Yugoslavia with other South Slavic peoples , which would exist in various political formations until the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s . During the breakup of Yugoslavia , Serbia formed a union with Montenegro , which was peacefully dissolved in 2006 and restoring Serbia 's independence as a sovereign state for the first time since the late 1910s . In 2008 , the parliament of the province of Kosovo unilaterally declared independence , with mixed responses from the international community .",

It was founded at the end of the 13th century in northwestern Anatolia in the town of S\u00f6\u011f\u00fct ( modern-day Bilecik Province ) by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman I . Although initially the dynasty was of Turkic origin , it was Persianised in terms of language , culture , literature and habits . After 1354 , the Ottomans crossed into Europe , and with the conquest of the Balkans , the Ottoman beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire . The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror . During the 16th and 17th centuries , at the height of its power under the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent , the Ottoman Empire was a multinational , multilingual empire controlling most of Southeast Europe , parts of Central Europe , Western Asia , parts of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus , North Africa and the Horn of Africa . At the beginning of the 17th century , the empire contained 32 provinces and numerous vassal states . Some of these were later absorbed into the Ottoman Empire , while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries . [ note 7 ] With Constantinople as its capital and control of lands around the Mediterranean Basin , the Ottoman Empire was at the centre of interactions between the Eastern and Western worlds for six centuries . While the empire was once thought to have entered a period of decline following the death of Suleiman the Magnificent , this view is no longer supported by the majority of academic historians . The empire continued to maintain a flexible and strong economy , society and military throughout the 17th and much of the 18th century . However , during a long period of peace from 1740 to 1768 , the Ottoman military system fell behind that of their European rivals , the Habsburg and Russian empires .",

Approximately 70 to 80 percent of the country 's citizens identify as Turkish , while Kurds are the largest minority at anywhere from 15 to 20 percent of the population . At various points in its history , the region has been inhabited by diverse civilisations including the Assyrians , Greeks , Thracians , Phrygians , Urartians , and Armenians . Hellenization started during the era of Alexander the Great and continued into the Byzantine era . The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , and their victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 symbolises the start and foundation of Turkey . The Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243 , when it disintegrated into small principalities called beyliks . Beginning in the late 13th century , the Ottomans started uniting beyliks and conquering the Balkans . After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople in 1453 , Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I . During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent the Ottoman Empire encompassed much of Southeast Europe , West Asia and North Africa and became a world power ."
