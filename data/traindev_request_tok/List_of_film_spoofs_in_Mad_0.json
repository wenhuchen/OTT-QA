  "/wiki/Nautical_fiction": "Nautical fiction , frequently also naval fiction , sea fiction , naval adventure fiction or maritime fiction , is a genre of literature with a setting on or near the sea , that focuses on the human relationship to the sea and sea voyages and highlights nautical culture in these environments . The settings of nautical fiction vary greatly , including merchant ships , liners , naval ships , fishing vessels , life boats , etc. , along with sea ports and fishing villages . When describing nautical fiction , scholars most frequently refer to novels , novellas , and short stories , sometimes under the name of sea novels or sea stories . These works are sometimes adapted for the theatre , film and television . The development of nautical fiction follows with the development of the English language novel and while the tradition is mainly British and North American , there are also significant works from literatures in Japan , France , Scandinavia , and other Western traditions . Though the treatment of themes and settings related to the sea and maritime culture is common throughout the history of western literature , nautical fiction , as a distinct genre , was first pioneered by James Fenimore Cooper ( The Pilot , 1824 ) and Frederick Marryat ( Frank Mildmay , 1829 and Mr Midshipman Easy 1836 ) at the beginning of the 19th century . There were 18th century and earlier precursors that have nautical settings , but few are as richly developed as subsequent works in this genre . The genre has evolved to include notable literary works like Herman Melville 's Moby Dick ( 1851 ) , Joseph Conrad 's Lord Jim ( 1899-1900 ) , popular fiction like C.S . Forester 's Hornblower series ( 1937-67 ) , and works by authors that straddle the divide between popular and literary fiction , like Patrick O'Brian 's Aubrey-Maturin series ( 1970-2004 ) . Because of the historical dominance of nautical culture by men , they are usually the central characters , except for works that feature ships carrying women passengers . For this reason , nautical fiction is often marketed for men . Nautical fiction usually includes distinctive themes , such as a focus on masculinity and heroism , investigations of social hierarchies , and the psychological struggles of the individual in the hostile environment of the sea .",
