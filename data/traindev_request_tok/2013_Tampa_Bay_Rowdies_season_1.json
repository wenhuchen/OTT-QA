The owners of the current club announced their intention to use the old Rowdies ' trademarks at its introductory press conference in 2008 . However , licensing issues forced the club to use the name FC Tampa Bay until December 2011 , when it gained full rights to the Rowdies name and other intellectual property . The current Rowdies have always used the same green and yellow color scheme and hoops as the original team , even when they could not yet use the Rowdies name . The Rowdies captured the NASL championship in Soccer Bowl 2012 , and their team shield includes two stars : one for their 2012 win and one for the 1975 Soccer Bowl championship won by the original Rowdies .
