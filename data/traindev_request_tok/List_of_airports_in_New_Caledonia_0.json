Magenta took its name from an aniline dye made and patented in 1859 by the French chemist Fran\u00e7ois-Emmanuel Verguin , who originally called it fuchsine . It was renamed to celebrate the Italian-French victory at the Battle of Magenta fought between the French and Austrians on June 4 , 1859 , near the Italian town of Magenta in Lombardy .
