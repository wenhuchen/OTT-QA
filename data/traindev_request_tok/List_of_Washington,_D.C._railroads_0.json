  "/wiki/Baltimore_and_Ohio_Railroad": "The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ( reporting marks B & O , BO ) was the first common carrier railroad and the oldest railroad in the United States , with its first section opening in 1830 . Merchants from the city of Baltimore , which had benefitted to some extent from the construction of the National Road early in the century , wanted to continue to compete for trade with trans-Appalachian settlers with the newly constructed Erie Canal ( which served New York City ) , another canal being proposed by Pennsylvania ( which would have connected Philadelphia and Pittsburgh ) , the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal ( which connected to the nation 's capital , Washington , D.C. ) , and the James River Canal , which directed traffic toward Richmond and Norfolk , Virginia . At first the B & O was located entirely in the state of Maryland , its original line extending from the port of Baltimore west to Sandy Hook . Because of competition with the C & O canal for trade with coal fields in western Maryland , it could not use the C & O right of way . Thus , to continue westward while minimizing high-cost track through the Appalachian Mountains , the B & O chose to cross the Potomac River into Virginia ( now West Virginia ) , near the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers . From there track continued through Virginia from Harpers Ferry to a point just west of the junction of Patterson Creek and the North Branch Potomac River , where it crossed back into Maryland to reach Cumberland , the terminus of the National Road . From there the B & O extended to the Ohio River at Wheeling and a few years later also to Parkersburg , West Virginia ( below rapids which made navigation difficult during parts of the year ) . It proved crucial to Union success during the American Civil War , although the conflict also caused considerable damage ( and repair costs ) . After the war 's end , the B & O consolidated several feeder lines in Virginia and West Virginia , as well as expanded westward into Ohio ( including a junction at Portsmouth ) , Indiana and Illinois . B & O advertising later carried the motto : Linking 13 Great States with the Nation . After several mergers , the B & O became part of the CSX Transportation ( CSX ) network . The B & O also includes the Leiper Railroad , the first permanent horse-drawn railroad in the U.S. At the end of 1970 , the B & O operated 5,552 miles of road and 10,449 miles of track , not including the Staten Island Rapid Transit ( SIRT ) or the Reading and its subsidiaries .",
  "/wiki/Chesapeake_and_Ohio_Railway": "The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway ( reporting marks C & O , CO ) was a Class I railroad formed in 1869 in Virginia from several smaller Virginia railroads begun in the 19th century . Led by industrialist Collis P. Huntington , it reached from Virginia 's capital city of Richmond to the Ohio River by 1873 , where the railroad town ( and later city ) of Huntington , West Virginia , was named for him . Tapping the coal reserves of West Virginia , the C & O 's Peninsula Extension to new coal piers on the harbor of Hampton Roads resulted in the creation of the new City of Newport News . Coal revenues also led the forging of a rail link to the Midwest , eventually reaching Columbus , Cincinnati and Toledo in Ohio and Chicago , Illinois . By the early 1960s the C & O was headquartered in Cleveland , Ohio , USA . In 1972 , under the leadership of Cyrus Eaton , it became part of the Chessie System , along with the Baltimore and Ohio and Western Maryland Railway . The Chessie System was later combined with the Seaboard Coast Line and Louisville and Nashville , both the primary components of the Family Lines System , to become a key portion of CSX Transportation ( CSXT ) in the 1980s . C & O 's passenger services ended in 1971 with the formation of Amtrak . Today Amtrak 's tri-weekly Cardinal passenger train follows the historic and scenic route of the C & O through the New River Gorge in one of the more rugged sections of the Mountain State . The rails of the former C & O also continue to transport intermodal and freight traffic , as well as West Virginia bituminous coal east to Hampton Roads and west to the Great Lakes as part of CSXT , a Fortune 500 company which was one of seven Class I railroads operating in North America at the beginning of the 21st century . At the end of 1970 C & O operated 5067 miles ( 8 155 km ) of road on 10219 miles ( 16 446 km ) of track , not including WM or B & O and its subsidiaries .",
  "/wiki/Pennsylvania_Railroad": "The Pennsylvania Railroad ( reporting mark PRR , legal name The Pennsylvania Railroad Company , also known as the Pennsy ) was an American Class I railroad that was established in 1846 and was headquartered in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . It was so named because it was established in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania . By 1882 , the Pennsylvania Railroad had become the largest railroad ( by traffic and revenue ) , the largest transportation enterprise , and the largest corporation in the world . Its budget was second only to the U.S. government . The corporation still holds the record for the longest continuous dividend history : it paid out annual dividends to shareholders for more than 100 consecutive years . Over the years , it acquired , merged with or owned part of at least 800 other rail lines and companies . At the end of 1926 , it operated 11,640.66 miles ( 18,733.83 kilometers ) of rail line ; [ notes 1 ] in the 1920s , it carried nearly three times the traffic as other railroads of comparable length , such as the Union Pacific and Atchison , Topeka & Santa Fe railroads . Its only formidable rival was the New York Central ( NYC ) , which carried around three-quarters of the Pennsy 's ton-miles . In 1968 , the Pennsylvania Railroad absorbed its rival New York Central Railroad and the railroad eventually went by the name of Penn Central Transportation Company , or Penn Central for short , the railroad filed for bankruptcy within two years . : Chapter 1 Bankruptcy continued and on April 1 , 1976 , the railroad gave up its railroad assets , along with the assets of several other failing northeastern railroads , to a new railroad named Consolidated Rail Corporation , or Conrail for short . Conrail was itself purchased and split up in 1999 with 58 percent of the system going to the Norfolk Southern Railway ( NS ) , including nearly all of the remaining former Pennsylvania Railroad .

  "/wiki/Consolidated_Rail_Corporation": "Conrail ( formally the Consolidated Rail Corporation , with reporting mark CR ) was the primary Class I railroad in the Northeastern United States between 1976 and 1999 . The trade name Conrail is a portmanteau based on the company 's legal name , and while it no longer operates trains , it continues to do business as an asset management and network services provider in three Shared Assets Areas that were excluded from the division of its operations during its acquisition by CSX Corporation and the Norfolk Southern Railway . The Federal Government created Conrail to take over the potentially-profitable lines of multiple bankrupt carriers , including the Penn Central Transportation Company and Erie Lackawanna Railway . After railroad regulations were lifted by the 4R Act and the Staggers Act , Conrail began to turn a profit in the 1980s and was privatized in 1987 . The two remaining Class I railroads in the East , CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway ( NS ) , agreed in 1997 to acquire the system and split it into two roughly-equal parts ( alongside three residual shared-assets areas ) , returning rail freight competition to the Northeast by essentially undoing the 1968 merger of the Pennsylvania Railroad and New York Central Railroad that created Penn Central . Following approval by the Surface Transportation Board , CSX and NS took control in August 1998 , and on June 1 , 1999 , began operating their respective portions of Conrail . The old company remains a jointly-owned subsidiary , with CSX and NS owning respectively 42 percent and 58 percent of its stock , corresponding to how much of Conrail 's assets they acquired . Each parent , however , has an equal voting interest . The primary asset retained by Conrail is ownership of the three Shared Assets Areas in New Jersey , Philadelphia , and Detroit . Both CSX and NS have the right to serve all shippers in these areas , paying Conrail for the cost of maintaining and improving trackage . They also make use of Conrail to perform switching and terminal services within the areas , but not as a common carrier , since contracts are signed between shippers and CSX or NS . Conrail also retains various support facilities including maintenance-of-way and training , as well as a 51 percent share in the Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad .",
  "/wiki/Norfolk_Southern_Railway": "The Norfolk Southern Railway ( reporting mark NS ) is a Class I freight railroad in the United States .

NS is responsible for maintaining 28,400 miles ( 45,700 km ) , with the remainder being operated under trackage rights from other parties responsible for maintenance . The most common commodity hauled on the railway is coal from mines in Indiana , Kentucky , Pennsylvania , Tennessee , Virginia , and West Virginia . The railway also offers the largest intermodal network in eastern North America . NS is a major transporter of domestic and export coal . The railway 's major sources of the mineral are located in : Pennsylvania 's Cambria and Indiana counties , as well as the Monongahela Valley ; West Virginia ; and the Appalachia regions of Virginia , Kentucky , and Tennessee . In Pennsylvania , NS also receives coal through interchange with R.J. Corman Railroad/Pennsylvania Lines at Cresson , Pennsylvania , originating in the Clearfield Cluster . NS 's export of West Virginia bituminous coal begins transport on portions of the well-engineered former Virginian Railway and the former N & W double-tracked line in Eastern Virginia to its Lambert 's Point coal pier on Hampton Roads at Norfolk .
