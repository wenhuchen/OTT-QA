  "/wiki/Woody_Allen": "Heywood Woody Allen ( born Allan Stewart Konigsberg ; December 1 , 1935 ) is an American director , writer , actor , and comedian whose career spans more than six decades . He began his career as a comedy writer in the 1950s , writing jokes and scripts for television and publishing several books of short humor pieces . In the early 1960s , he performed as a stand-up comedian , emphasizing monologues rather than traditional jokes , where he developed the persona of an insecure , intellectual , fretful nebbish , which he maintains is quite different from his real-life personality . In 2004 Comedy Central ranked Allen fourth on a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians , while a UK survey ranked Allen the third-greatest comedian . By the mid-1960s Allen was writing and directing films , first specializing in slapstick comedies before moving into dramatic material influenced by European art cinema during the 1970s , and alternating between comedies and dramas to the present . He is often identified as part of the New Hollywood wave of filmmakers of the mid-1960s to late 1970s . Allen often stars in his films , typically in the persona he developed as a standup . Some of the best-known of his over 50 films are Annie Hall ( 1977 ) , Manhattan ( 1979 ) , Hannah and Her Sisters ( 1986 ) , Crimes and Misdemeanors ( 1989 ) , and Midnight in Paris ( 2011 ) . In 2007 he said Stardust Memories ( 1980 ) , The Purple Rose of Cairo ( 1985 ) , and Match Point ( 2005 ) were his best films . Critic Roger Ebert described Allen as a treasure of the cinema . Allen has received many accolades and honors . He has won four Academy Awards : three for Best Original Screenplay and one for Best Director .",
