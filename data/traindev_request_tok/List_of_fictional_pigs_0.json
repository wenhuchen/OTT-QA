Erikson 's series is extremely complex with a wide scope , and presents the narratives of a large cast of characters spanning thousands of years across multiple continents . His plotting presents a complicated series of events in the world upon which the Malazan Empire is located . Each of the first five novels is relatively self-contained , in that each resolves its respective primary conflict ; but many underlying characters and events are interwoven throughout the works of the series , binding it together .

The series has received widespread critical acclaim , with reviewers praising the epic scope , plot complexity and characterizations , and fellow authors such as Glen Cook ( The Black Company ) and Stephen R.

Freddy is introduced as the smallest and cleverest of the pigs on the Bean farm . He is initially just one of the ensemble , but he becomes the central character shortly into the series .

A recurring villain is the slimy but dignified Simon , who leads a gang of criminal rats . Human characters include Mr. and Mrs. Bean ( who own the farm ) , the population of local Centerboro , and human villains .

As the series progresses , the Bean Farm animals attain national fame for their ability to talk and read , and the humans whom they encounter are taken aback at first ( though only momentarily ) to find themselves conversing with animals . The animals and humans do not age , although the stories reflect the social conditions at the time of writing ; for example , the books published during World War II feature scrap drives and victory gardens .",
