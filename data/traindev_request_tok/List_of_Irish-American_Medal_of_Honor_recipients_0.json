  "/wiki/United_States_Army": "The United States Army ( USA ) is the land warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces . It is one of the eight U.S. uniformed services , and is designated as the Army of the United States in the U.S. Constitution . As the oldest and most senior branch of the U.S. military in order of precedence , the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army , which was formed ( 14 June 1775 ) to fight the American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) - before the United States of America was established as a country . After the Revolutionary War , the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784 to replace the disbanded Continental Army . The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army , and considers its institutional inception to be the origin of that armed force in 1775 . As a uniformed military service , the U.S. Army is part of the Department of the Army , which is one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense . The U.S. Army is headed by a civilian senior appointed civil servant , the secretary of the Army ( SECARMY ) and by a chief military officer , the chief of staff of the Army ( CSA ) who is also a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . It is the largest military branch , and in the fiscal year 2017 , the projected end strength for the Regular Army ( USA ) was 476,000 soldiers ; the Army National Guard ( ARNG ) had 343,000 soldiers and the U.S. Army Reserve ( USAR ) had 199,000 soldiers ; the combined-component strength of the U.S. Army was 1,018,000 soldiers . As a branch of the armed forces , the mission of the U.S. Army is to fight and win our Nation 's wars , by providing prompt , sustained land dominance , across the full range of military operations and the spectrum of conflict , in support of combatant commanders . The branch participates in conflicts worldwide and is the major ground-based offensive and defensive force of the United States .",

  "/wiki/Maryland": "Maryland ( US : /\u02c8m\u025br\u0259l\u0259nd/ ( listen ) MERR-\u0259-l\u0259nd ) [ a ] is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the eastern United States , bordering Virginia , West Virginia , and the District of Columbia to its south and west ; Pennsylvania to its north ; and Delaware and the Atlantic Ocean to its east . The state 's largest city is Baltimore , and its capital is Annapolis . Among its occasional nicknames are Old Line State , the Free State , and the Chesapeake Bay State . It is named after the English queen Henrietta Maria , known in England as Queen Mary , who was the wife of King Charles I. Sixteen of Maryland 's twenty-three counties , as well as the city of Baltimore , border the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay estuary and its many tributaries , which combined total more than 4,000 miles of shoreline . Although one of the smallest states in the U.S. , it features a variety of climates and topographical features that have earned it the moniker of America in Miniature . In a similar vein , Maryland 's geography , culture , and history combine elements of the Mid-Atlantic , Northeastern , and South Atlantic regions of the country . Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century , Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans , mostly by the Algonquin , and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux . As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain , Maryland was founded by George Calvert , a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England . In 1632 , Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter , naming the colony after his wife , Queen Mary ( Henrietta Maria of France ) . Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans , who rejected Catholicism in their settlements , Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration . Accordingly , in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion , which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation . Nevertheless , religious strife was common in the early years , and Catholics remained a minority , albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony .",

Alternatively , it could have been derived from master of the quarterdeck where the helmsman and captain controlled the ship . The term 's first use in English was as a naval term , which entered English in the 15th century via the equivalent French and Dutch naval titles quartier-ma\u00eetre and kwartier-meester , respectively .

The city is just 21 miles ( 34 km ) south of the historic commonwealth ( state ) capital city of Richmond . The city 's unique industrial past and its location as a transportation hub combined to create wealth for Virginia and the Middle Atlantic and Upper South regions of the nation . Early in the colonial era of the 18th century , Petersburg was the final destination on the Upper Appomattox Canal Navigation System because of its location on the Appomattox River with its connection to the James River to the east at the Atlantic Seaboard fall line ( the head of navigation of rivers on the U.S. East Coast ) and the tying in with the James River shipping traffic was a strategic place for transportation and commercial activities . It connected commerce as far inland as Farmville , Virginia at the foothills of the Blue Ridge and the Appalachian Mountains chain , to shipping further east into the Chesapeake Bay and North Atlantic Ocean . For similar reasons , 17th century era Fort Henry was built at the order of the Virginia House of Burgesses at Petersburg in 1645 to protect the river traffic .

Two related battles were fought nearby on May 3 in the vicinity of Fredericksburg . The campaign pitted Union Army Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker 's Army of the Potomac against an army less than half its size , General Robert E. Lee 's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia . Chancellorsville is known as Lee 's perfect battle because his risky decision to divide his army in the presence of a much larger enemy force resulted in a significant Confederate victory . The victory , a product of Lee 's audacity and Hooker 's timid decision-making , was tempered by heavy casualties , including Lt. Gen. Thomas J. Stonewall Jackson . Jackson was hit by friendly fire , requiring his left arm to be amputated . He died of pneumonia eight days later , a loss that Lee likened to losing his right arm . Lee 's difficulty in replacing his lost men as well as his inability to prevent the Union withdrawal effectively have led to his great victory being regarded as a Pyrrhic one . The Chancellorsville campaign began with the crossing of the Rappahannock River by the Union army on the morning of April 27 , 1863 . Union cavalry under Maj. Gen.

Vicksburg was the last major Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River ; therefore , capturing it completed the second part of the Northern strategy , the Anaconda Plan .

The United States declared victory because the Federal offensive continued and Lee 's army suffered losses that could not be replaced .

The battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war and is often described as the war 's turning point . Union Maj. Gen. George Meade 's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia , halting Lee 's invasion of the North . After his success at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863 , Lee led his army through the Shenandoah Valley to begin his second invasion of the North - the Gettysburg Campaign . With his army in high spirits , Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , or even Philadelphia . Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln , Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved his army in pursuit , but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade . Elements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1 , 1863 , as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there , his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it . Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig . Gen. John Buford , and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry . However , two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north , collapsing the hastily developed Union lines , sending the defenders retreating through the streets of the town to the hills just to the south . On the second day of battle , most of both armies had assembled . The Union line was laid out in a defensive formation resembling a fishhook .",
