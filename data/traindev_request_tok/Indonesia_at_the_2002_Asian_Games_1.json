  "/wiki/Hasan_Basri": "Ab\u016b Sa\u02bf\u012bd b. Abi l-\u1e24asan Yas\u0101r al-Ba\u1e63r\u012b , often referred to as \u1e24asan of Basra ( Arabic : \u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0635\u0631\u064a , \u1e24asan al-Ba\u1e63r\u012b ; 642 - 15 October 728 ) for short , or reverentially as Imam \u1e24asan al-Ba\u1e63r\u012b in Sunni Islam , [ citation needed ] was an early Muslim preacher , ascetic , theologian , exegete , scholar , judge , and mystic . Born in Medina in 642 , Hasan belonged to the second generation of Muslims , all of whom would subsequently be referred to as the t\u0101bi\u02bf\u016bn in Sunni Islamic piety . In fact , Hasan rose to become one of the most celebrated of the t\u0101bi\u02bf\u016bn , enjoying an acclaimed scholarly career and an even more remarkable posthumous legacy in Islamic scholarship . Hasan , revered for his austerity and support for renunciation ( zuhd ) , preached against worldliness and materialism during the early days of the Umayyad Caliphate , with his passionate sermons casting a deep impression on his contemporaries . His close relationships with several of the most prominent companions of the prophet Muhammad only strengthened his standing as a teacher and scholar of the Islamic sciences . The particular disciplines in which he is said to have excelled included exegesis ( tafs\u012br ) of the Quran , whence his name is invariably encountered in classical and medieval commentaries on the scripture , as well as theology and mysticism . Regarding the last of these , it is important to note that Hasan became a tremendously important figure in the development of Sufism with his name occurring in many mystical silsilas ( chains of teachers and their disciples ) going back to Mu\u1e25ammad in the writings of Sunni mystics from the ninth-century onwards . In the words of one scholar , Hasan stands as the great patriarch of early Sufism . As scholars have noted , very few of Hasan 's original writings survive , with his proverbs and maxims on various subjects having been transmitted primarily through oral tradition by his numerous disciples . While fragments of his famed sermons do survive in the works of later authors , the only complete manuscripts we have bearing his name are apocryphal works such as the Ris\u0101lat al-qadar il\u0101 \u02bfAbd al-Malik ( Epistle to \u02bfAbd al-Malik against the Predestinarians ) , a pseudopigraphical text from the ninth or early-tenth century , and another letter of an ascetic and hortatory character addressed to Umar II ( d. 720 ) , which is likewise deemed spurious . Traditionally , Hasan has been commemorated as an outstanding figure by all the Sunni schools of thought , and was frequently designated as one the well respected of the early Islamic community in later writings by such important Sunni thinkers as Abu Talib al-Makki ( d. 996 ) , Abu Nu ` aym ( d. 1038 ) , Ali Hujwiri ( d. 1077 ) , Ibn al-Jawzi ( d. 1201 ) , and Attar of Nishapur ( d. 1221 ) . In his famed \u1e32\u016bt al-\u1e33ul\u016bb , the most important work of Basran Sunni mysticism , Abu Talib al-Makki says of Hasan : \u1e24asan is our Im\u0101m in this doctrine which we represent .",
