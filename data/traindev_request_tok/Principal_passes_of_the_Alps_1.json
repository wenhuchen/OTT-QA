It runs under Col du Fr\u00e9jus in the Cottian Alps between Modane in France and Bardonecchia in Italy . It is one of the major trans-Alpine transport routes between France and Italy being used for 80% of the commercial road traffic . Construction of the 13 km ( 8.1 mi ) long tunnel started in 1974 , and it came into service on 12 July 1980 , leading to the closure of the motorail shuttle service in the Fr\u00e9jus rail tunnel . It cost 2 billion francs ( equivalent to \u20ac700 million at 2005 prices ) . It is the tenth longest road tunnel in the world . The French section is managed by the French company SFTRF , and the Italian section by the Italian company SITAF . ( The French politician Pierre Dumas was chairman of SFTRF from 1962 to 1989 ) . The tunnel can be reached from the Italian side by the A32 Torino-Bardonecchia motorway , or by SS335 from Oulx , which joins SS24 ( del Monginevro ) , and reaches Bardonecchia after 20 km ( 12 mi ) . From the French side , it can be reached by the A43 ( lAutoroute de la Maurienne ) from Lyon and Chamb\u00e9ry . A toll is charged to all traffic .

The agreement between France and Italy on building a tunnel was signed in 1949 . Two operating companies were founded , each responsible for one half of the tunnel : the French Autoroutes et tunnel du Mont-Blanc ( ATMB ) , founded on 30 April 1958 , and the Italian Societ\u00e0 italiana per azioni per il Traforo del Monte Bianco ( SITMB ) , founded on 1 September 1957 .

The tunnel was completed in 1967 and is 6,596 metres ( 21,640 ft ) long . Since the opening of the tunnel , the Val Mesolcina , one of the Italian-speaking southern valleys of Graub\u00fcnden , is now connected all-year round with the rest of the canton . The San Bernardino Tunnel is part of the A13 as a single carriageway freeway and therefore passes through one bore without a central physical structure . As there is only one lane per direction , overtaking ( passing other vehicles ) inside the tunnel is not permitted . The speed limit of 80 km/h ( 50 mph ) is enforced by means of speed-check cameras . This road tunnel is considerably less prone to traffic jams than the St. Gotthard Tunnel . [ citation needed ] The old name Vogelberg may refer to the migratory birds who pass by here every year in large flocks . These have now also discovered the tunnel as a shortcut . Sometimes , the traffic must be stopped so that the birds find their way undisturbed . [ citation needed ]",
