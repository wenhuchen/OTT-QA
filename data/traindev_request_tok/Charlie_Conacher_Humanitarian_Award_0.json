  "/wiki/1979\u201380_NHL_season": "The 1979-80 NHL season was the 63rd season of the National Hockey League . This season saw the addition of four teams from the disbanded World Hockey Association as expansion franchises . The Edmonton Oilers , Winnipeg Jets , New England Whalers ( later renamed Hartford Whalers at the insistence of the Boston Bruins ) , and Quebec Nordiques joined the NHL , bringing the total to 21 teams . The other two WHA teams ( Birmingham Bulls and Cincinnati Stingers ) were paid to disband . The New York Islanders won their first Stanley Cup , defeating the Philadelphia Flyers in six games , in the finals . The season also marked the eighth and final season for the Flames in Atlanta before the franchise relocated to Calgary . The NHL would return to the Georgia capital in 1999 with the Thrashers , but that team would ultimately relocate away from Atlanta as well becoming the second ( and current ) incarnation of the Winnipeg Jets . The collapse of the WHA also saw the much hyped super-star rookie Wayne Gretzky come to the NHL with the Edmonton Oilers . Gretzky would tie Marcel Dionne for the scoring lead with 137 points and capture the Hart Memorial Trophy as the most valuable player while Dionne took home the Art Ross Trophy as the leading scorer by virtue of having scored two more goals . Gretzky aside , many players made their debut in the NHL this season , both due to the WHA merger and to a change in the rules for the Entry Draft allowing eighteen- and nineteen-year-olds to be drafted for the first time ; no fewer than seven Hall of Famers ( Gretzky , Ray Bourque , Mark Messier , Mike Gartner , Michel Goulet , Mark Howe , and an undrafted Joe Mullen ) debuted this season , along with numerous other perennial stars . The big story of the regular season was the record-breaking undefeated streak compiled by the Philadelphia Flyers . After starting the season with a 5-2 win over the New York Islanders and a 9-2 loss to the Atlanta Flames , the Flyers did not lose again for nearly three months , earning at least one point in every game between a 4-3 win over Toronto on October 14 , 1979 , and a 4-2 win over Buffalo on January 6 , 1980 , earning a 35 game record of 25-0-10 .",
  "/wiki/Wayne_Gretzky": "Wayne Douglas Gretzky CC ( /\u02c8\u0261r\u025btski/ ; born January 26 , 1961 ) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player and former head coach . He played 20 seasons in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) for four teams from 1979 to 1999 . Nicknamed The Great One , he has been called the greatest hockey player ever by many sportswriters , players , and the NHL itself . Gretzky is the leading scorer in NHL history , with more goals and assists than any other player . He garnered more assists than any other player scored total points , and is the only NHL player to total over 200 points in one season - a feat he accomplished four times . In addition , Gretzky tallied over 100 points in 16 professional seasons , 14 of them consecutive . At the time of his retirement in 1999 , he held 61 NHL records : 40 regular season records , 15 playoff records , and 6 All-Star records . Born and raised in Brantford , Ontario , Canada , Gretzky honed his skills at a backyard rink and regularly played minor hockey at a level far above his peers . Despite his unimpressive stature , strength and speed , Gretzky 's intelligence and reading of the game were unrivaled . He was adept at dodging checks from opposing players , and consistently anticipated where the puck was going to be and executed the right move at the right time . Gretzky became known for setting up behind his opponent 's net , an area that was nicknamed Gretzky 's office . In 1978 , Gretzky signed with the Indianapolis Racers of the World Hockey Association ( WHA ) , where he briefly played before being traded to the Edmonton Oilers .",
