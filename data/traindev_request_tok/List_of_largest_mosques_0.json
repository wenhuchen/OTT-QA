It is a pluricentric language predominantly spoken and used officially within Iran , Afghanistan and Tajikistan in three mutually intelligible standard varieties , namely Iranian Persian , Dari Persian ( officially named Dari since 1958 ) and Tajiki Persian ( officially named Tajik since the Soviet era ) . It is also spoken natively in the Tajik variety by a significant population within Uzbekistan , as well as within other regions with a Persianate history in the cultural sphere of Greater Iran . It is written officially within Iran and Afghanistan in the Persian alphabet , a derivation of the Arabic script , and within Tajikistan in the Tajik alphabet , a derivation of Cyrillic . The Persian language is a continuation of Middle Persian , the official religious and literary language of the Sasanian Empire ( 224-651 CE ) , itself a continuation of Old Persian , which was used in the Achaemenid Empire ( 550-330 BC ) . It originated in the region of Fars ( Persia ) in southwestern Iran . Its grammar is similar to that of many European languages . Throughout history , Persian has been a prestigious cultural language used by various empires in Western Asia , Central Asia , and South Asia . Old Persian written works are attested in Old Persian cuneiform on several inscriptions from between the 6th and the 4th centuries BC , and Middle Persian literature is attested in Aramaic-derived scripts ( Pahlavi and Manichaean ) on inscriptions from the time of the Parthian Empire and in books centered in Zoroastrian and Manichaean scriptures from between the 3rd to the 10th century AD . New Persian literature began to flourish after the Arab conquest of Iran with its earliest records from the 9th century , since then adopting the Arabic script . Persian was the first language to break through the monopoly of Arabic on writing in the Muslim world , with the writing of Persian poetry developed as a court tradition in many eastern courts . Some of the famous works of medieval Persian literature are the Shahnameh of Ferdowsi , the works of Rumi , the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam , the Panj Ganj of Nizami Ganjavi , the Div\u0101n of Hafez , The Conference of the Birds by Attar of Nishapur , and the miscellanea of Gulistan and Bustan by Saadi Shirazi .",

The empire fell to Alexander the Great in the fourth century BCE and was divided into several Hellenistic states . An Iranian rebellion established the Parthian Empire in the third century BCE , which was succeeded in the third century CE by the Sasanian Empire , a leading world power for the next four centuries . Arab Muslims conquered the empire in the seventh century CE , and the subsequent Islamization of Iran led to the decline of the once dominant Zoroastrian religion .

Its history dates back to at least 5,000 BC with characteristic examples distributed over a vast area from Turkey and Iraq to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan , and from the Caucasus to Zanzibar . Persian buildings vary from peasant huts to tea houses , and garden pavilions to some of the most majestic structures the world has ever seen . In addition to historic gates , palaces , and mosques , the rapid growth of cities such as the capital Tehran has brought about a wave of demolition and new construction . Iranian architecture displays great variety , both structural and aesthetic , from a variety of traditions and experience . Without sudden innovations , and despite the repeated trauma of invasions and cultural shocks , it has achieved an individuality distinct from that of other Muslim countries . Its paramount virtues are : a marked feeling for form and scale ; structural inventiveness , especially in vault and dome construction ; a genius for decoration with a freedom and success not rivaled in any other architecture . Traditionally , the guiding formative motif of Iranian architecture has been its cosmic symbolism by which man is brought into communication and participation with the powers of heaven . This theme has not only given unity and continuity to the architecture of Persia , but has been a primary source of its emotional character as well . According to American historian and archaeologist Arthur Pope , the supreme Iranian art , in the proper meaning of the word , has always been its architecture . The supremacy of architecture applies to both pre- and post-Islamic periods .",

It encompasses both secular and religious styles from the early history of Islam to the present day . Early Islamic architecture was influenced by Roman , Byzantine , Persian , Mesopotamian and all other lands which the Muslims conquered in the seventh and eighth centuries . Further east , it was also influenced by Chinese and Indian architecture as Islam spread to Southeast Asia . Later it developed distinct characteristics in the form of buildings , and the decoration of surfaces with Islamic calligraphy and geometric and interlace patterned ornament . New architectural elements like cylindrical minarets , pointed arch , muqarnas , arabesque , multifoil were invented . The principal Islamic architectural types for large or public buildings are : the mosque , the tomb , the palace , and the fort .

As a result , many European languages have also borrowed many words from it . Arabic influence , mainly in vocabulary , is seen in European languages - mainly Spanish and to a lesser extent Portuguese and Catalan - owing to both the proximity of Christian European and Muslim Arab civilizations and almost 800 years of Arabic culture and language presence in the Iberian Peninsula , referred to in Arabic as al-Andalus .

The Ottomans achieved the highest level architecture in their lands hence or since . They mastered the technique of building vast inner spaces confined by seemingly weightless yet massive domes , and achieving perfect harmony between inner and outer spaces , as well as articulated light and shadow . Islamic religious architecture which until then consisted of simple buildings with extensive decorations , was transformed by the Ottomans through a dynamic architectural vocabulary of vaults , domes , semi domes and columns .

Two major rivers , the Tigris and Euphrates , run south through Iraq and into the Shatt al-Arab near the Persian Gulf . These rivers provide Iraq with significant amounts of fertile land . The region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers , historically known as Mesopotamia , is often referred to as the cradle of civilisation . It was here that mankind first began to read , write , create laws and live in cities under an organised government - notably Uruk , from which Iraq is derived . The area has been home to successive civilisations since the 6th millennium BC . Iraq was the centre of the Akkadian , Sumerian , Assyrian and Babylonian empires .",

Urdu is the official national language , and lingua franca , of Pakistan . In India , it is one of 22 constitutionally recognised official languages , having official status in the five states of Telangana , Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , Jharkhand and West Bengal , as well as the national capital territory of Delhi . As both registers are composed of the same Indo-Aryan vocabulary base , colloquial Urdu is largely mutually intelligible with colloquial Hindi , with the two registers being grouped together as Hindustani or Hindi-Urdu . With respect to literary vocabulary , however , formal Urdu draws heavily from Persian vocabulary and requires knowledge of some simple Persian grammatical structures , while formal Hindi heavily draws from Sanskrit for its formal and technical vocabulary . Later , Urdu became the official language of government in northern and northwest British India , along with English , from 1837 onwards in place of Persian , which had been used by various Indo-Islamic empires as their language of government . Religious , social , and political factors arose during the colonial period that advocated for a distinction between Urdu and Hindi , leading to the Hindi-Urdu controversy . According to Nationalencyklopedin 's 2010 estimates , Urdu is the 21st most spoken first language in the world , with approximately 66 million who speak it as their native language . According to Ethnologue 's 2018 estimates , Urdu , is the 11th most widely spoken language in the world , with 170 million total speakers , including those who speak it as a second language . If grouped along with Hindi , Hindustani would be the 3rd most spoken language in the world , with approximately 329.1 million native speakers , and 697.4 million total speakers of both Urdu and Hindi .",

  "/wiki/International_Style_(architecture)": "The International Style or internationalism is a major architectural style that was developed in the 1920s and 1930s and was closely related to modernism and modern architecture . It was first defined by Museum of Modern Art curators Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson in 1932 , based on works of architecture from the 1920s . The terms rationalist architecture and modern movement are often used interchangeably with International Style , although the former is mostly used in the English-speaking world to specifically refer to the Italian rationalism of architects such as Giuseppe Terragni and Gino Pollini , or even the International Style that developed in Europe as a whole . It is defined by the Getty Research Institute as the style of architecture that emerged in Holland , France , and Germany after World War I and spread throughout the world , becoming the dominant architectural style until the 1970s . The style is characterized by an emphasis on volume over mass , the use of lightweight , mass-produced , industrial materials , rejection of all ornament and colour , repetitive modular forms , and the use of flat surfaces , typically alternating with areas of glass .",

Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity .

It developed the styles of earlier Muslim dynasties in India as an amalgam of Islamic , Persian , Turkish and Indian architecture . Mughal buildings have a uniform pattern of structure and character , including large bulbous domes , slender minarets at the corners , massive halls , large vaulted gateways , and delicate ornamentation ; grandiose architecture was the most visible of the ways that the Mughals used to assert their sense of superiority and their supremacy over what in many ways remained to them an alien land . Examples of the style can be found in modern-day India , Afghanistan , Bangladesh , and Pakistan . The Mughal dynasty was established after the victory of Babur at Panipat in 1526 . During his five-year reign , Babur took considerable interest in erecting buildings , though few have survived . His grandson Akbar built widely , and the style developed vigorously during his reign . Among his accomplishments were Agra Fort , the fort-city of Fatehpur Sikri , and the Buland Darwaza . Akbar 's son Jahangir commissioned the Shalimar Gardens in Kashmir .

Javanese is one of the Austronesian languages , but it is not particularly close to other languages and is difficult to classify . Its closest relatives are the neighbouring languages such as Sundanese , Madurese and Balinese . Most speakers of Javanese also speak Indonesian , the standardized form of Malay spoken in Indonesia , for official and commercial purposes as well as a means to communicate with non-Javanese-speaking Indonesians . There are speakers of Javanese in Malaysia ( concentrated in the states of Selangor and Johor ) and Singapore . Javanese is also spoken by traditional immigrant communities of Javanese descent in Suriname ( the Dutch colony of Surinam until 1975 ) and in New Caledonia .",

  "/wiki/Surabaya": "Surabaya ( Indonesian pronunciation : [ sura\u02c8baja ] ( listen ) ) is the capital of the Indonesian province of East Java and the second-largest city in the country , after Jakarta . The city has a population of over 3 million within its city limits and over 10 million in the Surabaya metropolitan area , making it the second-largest metropolitan area in Indonesia . Located on northeastern Java on the Madura Strait , it is one of the earliest port cities in Southeast Asia . According to the National Development Planning Agency , Surabaya is one of the four main central cities of Indonesia , alongside Jakarta , Medan , and Makassar . The city was settled in 10th century by Kingdom of Janggala , one of the two Javanese kingdoms that was formed in 1045 when Airlangga abdicated his throne in favour of his two sons . In the late 15th and 16th centuries , Surabaya grew to be a duchy , a major political and military power as well as a port in eastern Java , probably under Majapahit empire . At that time , Surabaya was already a major trading port , owing to its location on the River Brantas delta and on the trade route between Malacca and the Spice Islands via the Java Sea . During the decline of Majapahit , the lord of Surabaya resisted the rise of the Demak Sultanate , and only submitted to its rule in 1530 . Surabaya became independent after the death of Sultan Trenggana of Demak in 1546 . In the 18th and 19th centuries , Surabaya was the largest city in the Dutch East Indies , larger than Batavia ( present day Jakarta ) and the centre of trading in the nation , which was then a competitor of Shanghai and Hong Kong . The city is known as Kota Pahlawan ( city of heroes ) due to the importance of the Battle of Surabaya in galvanizing Indonesian and international support for Indonesian independence during the Indonesian National Revolution . Today the city remains one of the important entertainment , financial , industrial , transportational , and commercial hubs of the Indonesian archipelago , arguably second only to Jakarta , and the Port of Tanjung Perak is Indonesia 's second-busiest seaport located on northern Surabaya .",

Their boundaries are complex , with numerous enclaves within the various emirates . Each emirate is governed by a ruler ; together , they jointly form the Federal Supreme Council . One of the rulers serves as the President of the United Arab Emirates . In 2013 , the UAE 's population was 9.2 million , of which 1.4 million are Emirati citizens and 7.8 million are expatriates . Human occupation of the present UAE has been traced back to the emergence of anatomically modern humans from Africa some 125,000 BCE through finds at the Faya-1 site in Mleiha , Sharjah . Burial sites dating back to the Neolithic Age and the Bronze Age include the oldest known such inland site at Jebel Buhais . Known as Magan to the Sumerians , the area was home to a prosperous Bronze Age trading culture during the Umm Al Nar period , which traded between the Indus Valley , Bahrain and Mesopotamia as well as Iran , Bactria and the Levant . The ensuing Wadi Suq period and three Iron Ages saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior . The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the Sasanians and the subsequent Battle of Dibba . The UAE 's long history of trade led to the emergence of Julfar , in the present-day emirate of Ras Al Khaimah , as a major regional trading and maritime hub in the area .",
  "/wiki/Persian_architecture": "Iranian architecture or Persian architecture ( Persian : \u0645\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0649 \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646\u06cc , Mem\u0101ri e Ir\u0101ni ) is the architecture of Iran and parts of the rest of West Asia , the Caucasus and Central Asia . Its history dates back to at least 5,000 BC with characteristic examples distributed over a vast area from Turkey and Iraq to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan , and from the Caucasus to Zanzibar . Persian buildings vary from peasant huts to tea houses , and garden pavilions to some of the most majestic structures the world has ever seen . In addition to historic gates , palaces , and mosques , the rapid growth of cities such as the capital Tehran has brought about a wave of demolition and new construction . Iranian architecture displays great variety , both structural and aesthetic , from a variety of traditions and experience . Without sudden innovations , and despite the repeated trauma of invasions and cultural shocks , it has achieved an individuality distinct from that of other Muslim countries . Its paramount virtues are : a marked feeling for form and scale ; structural inventiveness , especially in vault and dome construction ; a genius for decoration with a freedom and success not rivaled in any other architecture . Traditionally , the guiding formative motif of Iranian architecture has been its cosmic symbolism by which man is brought into communication and participation with the powers of heaven . This theme has not only given unity and continuity to the architecture of Persia , but has been a primary source of its emotional character as well . According to American historian and archaeologist Arthur Pope , the supreme Iranian art , in the proper meaning of the word , has always been its architecture . The supremacy of architecture applies to both pre- and post-Islamic periods .",
