  "/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox": "The Boston Red Sox are an American professional baseball team based in Boston , Massachusetts . They compete in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) as a member club of the American League ( AL ) East division . The team have won nine World Series championships , tied for the third-most of any MLB team , and they have played in 13 . Their most recent World Series appearance and win was in 2018 . In addition , they won the 1904 American League pennant , but were not able to defend their 1903 World Series championship when the New York Giants refused to participate in the 1904 World Series . Founded in 1901 as one of the American League 's eight charter franchises , the Red Sox ' home ballpark has been Fenway Park since 1912 . The Red Sox name was chosen by the team owner , John I. Taylor , circa 1908 , following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the Boston Red Stockings , including the forerunner of the Atlanta Braves . The Red Sox were a dominant team in the new league , defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World Series in 1903 and winning four more championships by 1918 . However , they then went into one of the longest championship droughts in baseball history , dubbed the Curse of the Bambino after its alleged inception due to the Red Sox ' sale of Babe Ruth to the rival New York Yankees two years after their world championship in 1918 , an 86-year wait before the team 's sixth World Championship in 2004 . The team 's history during that period was punctuated with some of the most memorable moments in World Series history , including Enos Slaughter 's mad dash in 1946 , the Impossible Dream of 1967 , Carlton Fisk 's home run in 1975 , and Bill Buckner 's error in 1986 . Following their victory in the 2018 World Series , they became the first team to win four World Series trophies in the 21st century , with championships in 2004 , 2007 , 2013 and 2018 . The team 's history has also been marked by the team 's intense rivalry with the New York Yankees , arguably the fiercest and most historic in North American professional sports .",
  "/wiki/American_League_Park": "American League Park , known by historians as American League Park I , was a baseball park that formerly stood in Washington , D.C. , at the corner of Florida Avenue and Trinidad Avenue NE on land previously belonging to the Washington Brick Company . It hosted the Washington Senators from the 1901 season through the 1903 season . On March 20 , 1901 , the district commissioners granted permission to the American League to establish a baseball park at the location following an application including plans and specifications for the grand stand and the other supporting structures . Snowden Ashford was the building inspector who handled the case . The land had been previously occupied by the Washington Brick Company in an area sparsely built at the time ; the closest buildings were located more than 50 feet ( 15 m ) from the outlines of the grounds . Therefore , it was considered that it would not cause more menace to the area then if a lumber yard was established there . No specific regulations for the establishment of baseball grounds were in place in the District of Columbia at the time . No opposition from nearby landowners was received , therefore permission was granted . The grandstands were made out of wood as most ballparks of the time . The left-field line ran north-south , with the left field measuring 290 feet ( 88 m ) . Boundary Field , in Northwest DC , had been the preferred site for the American League Senators , but its usage had been blocked by the National League , which still had rights to the site despite no longer having a franchise in Washington . Once peace was reached between the leagues , the Senators moved to that site for the 1904 season , which became known as American League Park II or National Park .",

The Senators ' pitching had always been bad , and indeed , they would allow the most runs in the AL , but without Delahanty the offense sputtered to a halt .
