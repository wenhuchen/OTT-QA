Since the Americas extend 14,000 km ( 8,700 mi ) from north to south , the climate and ecology vary widely , from the arctic tundra of Northern Canada , Greenland , and Alaska , to the tropical rain forests in Central America and South America . Humans first settled the Americas from Asia between 42,000 and 17,000 years ago . A second migration of Na-Dene speakers followed later from Asia . The subsequent migration of the Inuit into the neoarctic around 3500 BCE completed what is generally regarded as the settlement by the indigenous peoples of the Americas . The first known European settlement in the Americas was by the Norse explorer Leif Erikson . However , the colonization never became permanent and was later abandoned .

Long an important trading center in the Persian Gulf , Manama is home to a very diverse population . After periods of Portuguese and Persian control and invasions from the ruling dynasties of Saudi Arabia and Oman , Bahrain established itself as an independent nation during the 19th century period of British hegemony . Although the current twin cities of Manama and Muharraq appear to have been founded simultaneously in the 1300s , Muharraq took prominence due to its defensive location and was thus the capital of Bahrain until 1337 . Manama became the mercantile capital and was the gateway to the main Bahrain Island . In the 20th century , Bahrain 's oil wealth helped spur fast growth and in the 1990s a concerted diversification effort led to expansion in other industries and helped transform Manama into an important financial hub in the Middle East . Manama was designated as the 2012 capital of Arab culture by the Arab League , and a beta global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network in 2018 .",
