  "/wiki/Regiment": "A regiment is a military unit . Their role and size varies markedly , depending on the country and the arm of service . In Medieval Europe , the term regiment denoted any large body of front-line soldiers , recruited or conscripted in one geographical area , by a leader who was often also the feudal lord of the soldiers . By the end of the 17th century , regiments in most European armies were permanent units , numbering about 1,000 men and under the command of a colonel .",
  "/wiki/Brigade": "A brigade is a major tactical military formation that is typically composed of three to six battalions plus supporting elements . It is roughly equivalent to an enlarged or reinforced regiment . Two or more brigades may constitute a division . Brigades formed into divisions are usually infantry or armored ( sometimes referred to as combined arms brigades ) . In addition to combat units , they may include combat support units or sub-units , such as artillery and engineers , and logistic units or sub-units . Historically , such brigades have sometimes been called brigade-groups . On operations , a brigade may comprise both organic elements and attached elements , including some temporarily attached for a specific task . Brigades may also be specialized and comprise battalions of a single branch , for example cavalry , mechanized , armored , artillery , air defence , aviation , engineers , signals or logistic . Some brigades are classified as independent or separate and operate independently from the traditional division structure . The typical NATO standard brigade consists of approximately 3,200 to 5,500 troops . However , in Switzerland and Austria , the numbers could go as high as 11,000 troops . The Soviet Union , its forerunners and successors , mostly use regiment instead of brigade , and this was common in much of Europe until after World War II .",
  "/wiki/Division_(military_unit)": "A division is a large military unit or formation , usually consisting of between 10,000 and 25,000 soldiers . In most armies , a division is composed of several regiments or brigades ; in turn , several divisions typically make up a corps . Historically , the division has been the default combined arms unit capable of independent operations . Smaller combined arms units , such as the American regimental combat team ( RCT ) during World War II , were used when conditions favored them . In recent times , modern Western militaries have begun adopting the smaller brigade combat team ( similar to the RCT ) as the default combined arms unit , with the division they belong to being less important . While the focus of this article is on army divisions , in naval usage , division has a completely different meaning , referring to either an administrative/functional sub-unit of a department ( e.g. , fire control division of the weapons department ) aboard naval and coast guard ships , shore commands , and in naval aviation units ( including navy , marine corps , and coast guard aviation ) , to a sub-unit of several ships within a flotilla or squadron , or to two or three sections of aircraft operating under a designated division leader . Some languages , like Russian , Serbo-Croatian and Polish , also use a similar word , divizion/dywizjon , for a battalion-size artillery or cavalry unit . In administrative/functional sub-unit usage , unit size varies widely , though typically divisions number far fewer than 100 people and are roughly equivalent in function and organizational hierarchy/command relationship to a platoon or flight [ citation needed ] .",
