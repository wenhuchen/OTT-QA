  "/wiki/Monkey": "Monkey is a common name that may refer to groups or species of mammals , in part , the simians of infraorder Simiiformes . The term is applied descriptively to groups of primates , such as families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys . Many monkey species are tree-dwelling ( arboreal ) , although there are species that live primarily on the ground , such as baboons . Most species are also active during the day ( diurnal ) . Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent , especially the Old World monkeys of Catarrhini . Simians and tarsiers emerged within haplorrhines some 60 million years ago . New World monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the simians some 35 million years ago . Old World monkeys and Hominoidea emerged within the catarrhine monkeys some 25 million years ago . Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus [ 35-32 million years ago ] , eosimiidea and sometimes even the Catarrhini group are also considered monkeys by primatologists . Lemurs , lorises , and galagos are not monkeys ; instead they are strepsirrhine primates . Like monkeys , tarsiers are haplorhine primates ; however , they are also not monkeys . Apes emerged within monkeys as sister of the Cercopithecidae in the Catarrhini , so cladistically they are monkeys as well .",

Macaques are principally frugivorous , although their diet also includes seeds , leaves , flowers , and tree bark . Some species , such as the crab-eating macaque , subsist on a diet of invertebrates and occasionally small vertebrates . On average , southern pig-tailed macaques in Malaysia eat about 70 large rats each per year . All macaque social groups are matriarchal , arranged around dominant females . Macaques are found in a variety of habitats throughout the Asian continent and are highly adaptable . Certain species have learned to live with humans and have become invasive in some human-settled environments , such as the island of Mauritius and Silver Springs State Park in Florida . Macaques can be a threat to wildlife conservation as well as to human well-being via carrying transmittable and fatal diseases . Currently , invasive species of macaques are handled with several control methods .",

They are also notable for their ability to be easily bred in captivity . Disproportionately long limbs and long prehensile tails make them one of the largest New World monkeys and give rise to their common name .

They primarily eat fruits , but will also occasionally consume leaves , flowers , and insects . Due to their large size , spider monkeys require large tracts of moist evergreen forests , and prefer undisturbed primary rainforest . They are social animals and live in bands of up to 35 individuals but will split up to forage during the day . Recent meta-analyses on primate cognition studies indicated spider monkeys are the most intelligent New World monkeys . They can produce a wide range of sounds and will bark when threatened ; other vocalisations include a whinny similar to a horse and prolonged screams . They are an important food source due to their large size , so are widely hunted by local human populations ; they are also threatened by habitat destruction due to logging and land clearing .",

Singapore is located about one degree ( 137 kilometres or 85 miles ) north of the equator , and is situated off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula , and by extension , the southernmost extremity of continental Asia . The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia 's Riau Islands , its northern , western , and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia , and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east . It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south , and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans , being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east . The country 's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets , the combined area of which has increased by almost 25% since the country 's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects . Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history , modern Singapore , then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate , was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles , a British colonial officer , established a trading post of the East India Company on the island . In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond . During the Second World War , Imperial Japan successfully invaded Singapore , resulting in an interregnum of British rule corresponding with a brief Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 . Following Japan 's surrender in 1945 , the Straits Settlements were dissolved , with Singapore being returned to British control as a standalone crown colony in 1946 .",
