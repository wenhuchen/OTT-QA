He temporarily served on Yu Liang 's staff , but subsequently declined an invitation by Yu Liang 's younger brother Yu Yi ( \u5ebe\u7ffc ) to serve on his staff , and he lived the life of a hermit . Gradually , officials and commoners began to believe that he had the ability to guide the Jin state to great things , and people even observed his behavior to venture guesses as to what the fortunes of the state would be . In 346 , he finally agreed to join the government as the governor of the capital region . In 348 , after Huan Wen destroyed Cheng Han and merged its territory into Jin 's , key officials of the Jin imperial government began to fear that he would use his military might to try to dominate the government .

He also wrote poems to try to discourage Cao Rui from military and palace-building projects . When Sun Quan , the emperor of Wei 's rival state Eastern Wu , led an army to attack the Wei stronghold at Hefei in 234 , Liu Shao suggested to Cao Rui to send his forces to cut off Sun Quan 's supply route rather than engage Sun Quan directly - a strategy that forced Sun Quan to withdraw .

He served as the Inspector of Yang Province during the reign of the third Wei emperor , Cao Fang . In 254 , when the Wei regent Sima Shi , who effectively controlled the Wei government , deposed Cao Fang and replaced him with Cao Mao , Wen Qin was deeply displeased because his loyalty was to the Wei emperor and not the Sima family . In the following year , he and another Wei general , Guanqiu Jian , started a rebellion in Shouchun ( present-day Shou County , Anhui ) against Sima Shi . However , Sima Shi managed to suppress the rebellion within months ; Guanqiu Jian was killed while Wen Qin and his family escaped and defected to Wei 's rival state , Eastern Wu . In 257 , when another Wei general Zhuge Dan started a rebellion in Shouchun against the Wei regent Sima Zhao ( Sima Shi 's brother and successor ) , Wen Qin and some Wu forces came to Shouchun to support Zhuge Dan . Sima Zhao led Wei forces to besiege Shouchun and the siege dragged on until early 258 . As the situation became more dire , relations between Wen Qin and Zhuge Dan deteriorated , especially since they did not trust each other before . Zhuge Dan eventually had Wen Qin executed .

He formally began his political career in 208 under the Han dynasty 's Imperial Chancellor Cao Cao ; [ a ] quickly rising through the ranks . His success in both handling domestic and military affairs , such as in governance and the promotion of agriculture , serving as a capable adviser , repelling incursions and invasions led by Shu and Wu forces , speedily crushing Meng Da 's rebellion , and conquering the Gongsun-led Liaodong commandery , all managed to garner him great prestige over the decades . He is perhaps best known for defending Wei from a series of invasions between 231 and 234 led by Wei 's rival state Shu . In 239 , he was made to preside as a regent for the young Cao Fang - after the latter 's adoptive father , Cao Rui , had died - along with another co-regent , Cao Shuang . Although amicable at first , the relationship soon deteriorated in light of Cao Shuang 's corruption , extravagance , and attempts to curtail Sima Yi 's political influence . In 249 , after carefully planning and building up support , he ousted Cao Shuang from power in a coup d'\u00e9tat and had him and his associates executed . Sima Yi would go on to serve as the de facto primary authority in Wei after this event , although in 251 he faced some opposition in the form of Wang Ling 's rebellion , which he swiftly dealt with . He died later that year , on 7 September 251 , at the age of 71 or ( more likely ) 72 , with his eldest son , Sima Shi , succeeding his position . For the remainder of Wei 's history , state power would increasingly rest in the hands of the Sima clan , which paved the way for the establishment of the Jin dynasty , which was founded by Sima Yi 's grandson , Sima Yan , in 266 .

He served as an official of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period of China . Born in the late Eastern Han dynasty , Zhang Zhao started his career as a scholar in his native Xu Province before the chaos towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty forced him to flee south to the Jiangdong ( or Wu ) region for shelter . In Jiangdong , Zhang Zhao became an adviser to the rising warlord Sun Ce . After Sun Ce 's death in the year 200 , Zhang Zhao played a key supporting role to Sun Ce 's younger brother and successor , Sun Quan , as he consolidated power and his control over the Jiangdong territories . In 208 , Zhang Zhao strongly urged Sun Quan to surrender to Cao Cao , a rival warlord , because he believed that they stood no chance against an impending invasion by Cao Cao . However , Sun Quan refused to listen to Zhang Zhao and instead heeded the advice of Lu Su and Zhou Yu . Sun Quan 's forces ultimately scored a decisive victory over Cao Cao at the Battle of Red Cliffs in the winter of 208 . From 200 until his death in 236 , Zhang Zhao served under Sun Quan through the collapse of the Eastern Han dynasty and into the Three Kingdoms period after Sun Quan became the founding emperor of the Eastern Wu state . Throughout his career , Zhang Zhao was known for being a stern , uncompromising and intimidating figure who commanded respect from both his colleagues and Sun Quan . Despite Zhang Zhao 's seniority and experience , Sun Quan passed him over twice as a candidate for the position of Imperial Chancellor in 222 and 225 as he believed that Zhang Zhao was so headstrong and stubborn that he would not be able to effectively lead the administration . Nevertheless , Sun Quan paid his due respects to Zhang Zhao as a mentor-like figure who saw him through his formative years to his accession to the throne .",
