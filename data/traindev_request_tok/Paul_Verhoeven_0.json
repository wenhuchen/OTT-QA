In the United States , the film was rated NC-17 for nudity and erotic sexuality throughout , some graphic language , and sexual violence . Showgirls was the first ( and to date only ) NC-17 rated film to be given a wide release in mainstream theaters . Distributor United Artists dispatched several hundred staffers to theaters across North America playing Showgirls to ensure that patrons would not sneak into the theater from other films , and to make sure film-goers were over the age of 17 . Audience restriction due to the NC-17 rating coupled with poor reviews resulted in the film becoming a box office bomb , grossing just $ 37 million . Despite a negative theatrical and critical consensus , Showgirls enjoyed success on the home video market , generating more than $ 100 million from video rentals , allowing the film to turn a profit and become one of MGM 's top 20 all-time bestsellers .
