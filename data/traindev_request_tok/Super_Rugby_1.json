As part of a second attempt to introduce Super Rugby into the Eastern Cape , after finishing bottom of the 2012 Super Rugby table , the South African Rugby Union mandated that the Lions be replaced in the 2013 competition by the Southern Kings from Port Elizabeth . The Lions exclusion lasted just one season as they regained their place in Super Rugby for the 2014 season by beating the Southern Kings in a two leg playoff after the Kings finished bottom of the 2013 South African conference . During the 2016 Super Rugby season play-offs , the Lions defeated the South Island teams ( Crusaders and Highlanders ) to reach the championship final , in which they were defeated 20-3 by the Hurricanes .",
  "/wiki/Highlanders_(rugby_union)": "The Highlanders ( formerly the Otago Highlanders and currently known as the Pulse Energy Highlanders for sponsorship reasons ) is a New Zealander professional rugby union team based in Dunedin that compete in Super Rugby . The team was formed in 1996 to represent the lower South Island in the newly formed Super 12 competition , and includes the Otago , North Otago and Southland unions . The Highlanders take their name from the Scottish immigrants that helped found the Otago , North Otago , and Southland regions in the 1840s and 1850s . Their main ground through the 2011 Super Rugby season was Carisbrook in Dunedin , with home games occasionally being played in Invercargill and Queenstown . The Highlanders moved into Carisbrook 's replacement , Forsyth Barr Stadium at University Plaza , for the 2012 season ; the stadium opened in time for the 2011 Rugby World Cup , but after the Super Rugby season . They finished the inaugural season eighth , and the following season finished last after winning only three of eleven matches .

  "/wiki/Queensland_Reds": "The Queensland Reds is the rugby union team for the Australian state of Queensland that competes in the Southern Hemisphere 's Super Rugby competition . Prior to 1996 they were a representative team selected from the rugby union club competitions in Queensland .

From 1996 to 2005 they were one of three Australian teams competing in the Super 12 competition , alongside the New South Wales Waratahs and the ACT Brumbies . Queensland finished as minor premiers in 1996 and 1999 . From 2006 to 2010 , they competed in the expanded Super 14 competition as one of four Australian sides . Beginning in 2011 , they are one of five Australian sides in the expanded and renamed Super Rugby , winning the competition in its first season in its new format . In 2012 they finished first in the Australian conference .",
  "/wiki/Stormers": "The Stormers ( known for sponsorship reasons as the DHL Stormers ) is a South African professional rugby union team based in Cape Town in the Western Cape , competing in the Super Rugby competition . They have never won a tournament , but their home stadium , Newlands , typically draws the highest average attendance figures of any ground in Super Rugby . [ citation needed ] They are centred on the Western Province Currie Cup side , but also draw players from the Boland Cavaliers ( covering the Cape Winelands and West Coast districts , with home matches in Wellington ) . Through 2005 , they also drew players from the SWD Eagles ( George ) , which meant that they drew players from all three unions in the Western Cape Province . However , the general realignment of franchise areas resulting from the expansion of the competition resulted in the Eagles being moved to the area of the Southern Spears ( later succeeded by the Southern Kings ) . Prior to 1998 , South Africa did not use a franchise system for the Super 12 , instead sending the top four unions from its domestic competition , the Currie Cup , into the Super 12 . In 1996 , the Stormers qualified and competed in the Super 12 as Western Province . In 1997 , they did not qualify , the 4th South African team being the Orange Free State ( now the Free State Cheetahs at Currie Cup level ; the region would later be represented in Super 12 by the Cats ( now known as the Lions ) and in Super 14 by the Cheetahs ) . The Stormers played their first ever final , against the Bulls in front of 36,000 fans in Johannesburg , in 2010 after beating the Waratahs in the semi-final stage but ultimately lost to the Bulls . In the two previous years in which they reached the semi-finals , 1999 and 2004 , they were eliminated by the Highlanders and Crusaders . They made consecutive home semifinals in 2011 and 2012 , but lost both at Newlands to the Crusaders and the Sharks respectively . In 2015 they won the South African conference for a third time , before losing their home quarterfinal against the Brumbies .",
