  "/wiki/Field_Lacrosse": "Field lacrosse is a full contact outdoor men 's sport played with ten players on each team . The sport originated among Native Americans , and the modern rules of field lacrosse were initially codified by Canadian William George Beers in 1867 . Field lacrosse is one of three major versions of lacrosse played internationally . The other versions , women 's lacrosse ( established in the 1890s ) and box lacrosse ( originated in the 1930s ) , are played under significantly different rules . The object of the game is to use a lacrosse stick , or crosse , to catch , carry , and pass a solid rubber ball in an effort to score by shooting the ball into the opponent 's goal . The triangular head of the lacrosse stick has a loose net strung into it that allows the player to hold the lacrosse ball . In addition to the lacrosse stick , players are required to wear a certain amount of protective equipment . Defensively the object is to keep the opposing team from scoring and to dispossess them of the ball through the use of stick checking and body contact . The rules limit the number of players in each part of the field . It is sometimes referred to as the fastest sport on two feet . Lacrosse is governed internationally by the 62-member World Lacrosse , which sponsors the World Lacrosse Championships once every four years . A former Olympic sport , attempts to reinstate it to the Olympics have been hampered by insufficient international participation and the lack of standard rules between the men 's and women 's games .",

Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time . Players gain cosmetic rewards that do not affect gameplay , such as character skins and victory poses , as they play the game . The game was initially launched with only casual play , but a competitive ranked mode , various 'arcade ' game modes , and a player-customizable server browser were added after release . Additionally , Blizzard has added new characters , maps , and game modes post-release , all free of charge , with the only additional cost to players being optional loot boxes to earn cosmetic items . It was released for PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , and Windows in May 2016 , and Nintendo Switch in October 2019 . Overwatch is Blizzard 's fourth major franchise and came about following the 2014 cancellation of the ambitious massively multiplayer online role-playing game Titan . A portion of the Titan team came up with the concept of Overwatch , based on the success of team-based first-person shooters like Team Fortress 2 and the popularity of multiplayer online battle arena games , creating a hero-based shooter that emphasized teamwork . Some elements of Overwatch borrow assets and concepts from the canceled Titan project . After establishing the narrative of an optimistic near-future Earth setting after a global crisis , the developers aimed to create a diverse cast of heroes that spanned genders and ethnicities as part of this setting . Significant time is spent adjusting the balance of the characters , making sure that new players would still be able to have fun while skilled players would present each other with a challenge .",

The team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated . Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running ( dribbling ) or by passing it to a teammate , both of which require considerable skill . On offense , players may use a variety of shots - the lay-up , the jump shot , or a dunk ; on defense , they may steal the ball from a dribbler , intercept passes , or block shots ; either offense or defense may collect a rebound , that is , a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard . It is a violation to lift or drag one 's pivot foot without dribbling the ball , to carry it , or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling . The five players on each side at a time fall into five playing positions the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach 's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) .

A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate ( the place where the player started as a batter ) . The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner . The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely . A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called out can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner , either immediately or during teammates ' turns batting . The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners out , which forces them out of the field of play .
