The term may also be used in other countries worldwide but it originated within the United States Armed Forces . This system is designed to allow a single commander to exercise command and control of all military forces in the AOR , regardless of their branch of service . The President of the United States signed the U.S. Unified Command Plan ( UCP ) 2008 on 17 December 2008 , establishing the up-to-date boundaries for the newest Command , United States Africa Command ( USAFRICOM ) , and all changes to boundaries of the other Commands .

There are almost as many definitions of Eastern Europe as there are scholars of the region . A related United Nations paper adds that every assessment of spatial identities is essentially a social and cultural construct . One definition describes Eastern Europe as a cultural entity : the region lying in Europe with the main characteristics consisting of Greek , Byzantine , Eastern Orthodox , Russian , and some Ottoman cultural influences . Another definition was created during the Cold War and used more or less synonymously with the term Eastern Bloc .

The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical social construct , with no clear physical separation between them ; thus , in some parts of the world , Eurasia is recognized as the largest of the six , five , or even four continents on Earth . In geology , Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock . However , the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on paleomagnetic data . Eurasia covers around 55,000,000 square kilometres ( 21,000,000 sq mi ) , or around 36.2% of the Earth 's total land area . The landmass contains well over 5 billion people , equating to approximately 70% of the human population . Humans first settled in Eurasia between 60,000 and 125,000 years ago . Some major islands , including Great Britain , Iceland , and Ireland , and those of Japan , the Philippines and Indonesia , are often included under the popular definition of Eurasia , in spite of being separate from the contiguous landmass . Physiographically , Eurasia is a single continent . The concepts of Europe and Asia as distinct continents date back to antiquity and their borders are geologically arbitrary . In ancient times the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara , along with their associated straits , were seen as separating the continents , but today the Ural and Caucasus ranges are more seen as the main delimiters between the two .",

Burial sites dating back to the Neolithic Age and the Bronze Age include the oldest known such inland site at Jebel Buhais . Known as Magan to the Sumerians , the area was home to a prosperous Bronze Age trading culture during the Umm Al Nar period , which traded between the Indus Valley , Bahrain and Mesopotamia as well as Iran , Bactria and the Levant . The ensuing Wadi Suq period and three Iron Ages saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior . The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the Sasanians and the subsequent Battle of Dibba . The UAE 's long history of trade led to the emergence of Julfar , in the present-day emirate of Ras Al Khaimah , as a major regional trading and maritime hub in the area .",
