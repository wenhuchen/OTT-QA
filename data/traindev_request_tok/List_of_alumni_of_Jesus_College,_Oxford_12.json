  "/wiki/India": "India ( Hindi : Bh\u0101rat ) , officially the Republic of India ( Hindi : Bh\u0101rat Ga\u1e47ar\u0101jya ) , is a country in South Asia . It is the seventh-largest country by area , the second-most populous country , and the most populous democracy in the world . Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south , the Arabian Sea on the southwest , and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast , it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west ; [ e ] China , Nepal , and Bhutan to the north ; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east . In the Indian Ocean , India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives ; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia . Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",

  "/wiki/Modern_History": "The history of the world , in common parlance , is the history of humanity ( or human history ) , as determined from archeology , anthropology , genetics , linguistics , and other disciplines ; and , for periods since the invention of writing , from recorded history and from secondary sources and studies . Humanity 's written history was preceded by its prehistory , beginning with the Palaeolithic Era ( Old Stone Age ) , followed by the Neolithic Era ( New Stone Age ) . The Neolithic saw the Agricultural Revolution begin , between 8000 and 5000 BCE , in the Near East 's Fertile Crescent . During this period , humans began the systematic husbandry of plants and animals . As agriculture advanced , most humans transitioned from a nomadic to a settled lifestyle as farmers in permanent settlements . The relative security and increased productivity provided by farming allowed communities to expand into increasingly larger units , fostered by advances in transportation . Whether in prehistoric or historic times , people always needed to be near reliable sources of potable water . Settlements developed on river banks as early as 3000 BCE in Mesopotamia , on the banks of Egypt 's Nile River , in the Indus River valley , and along China 's rivers . As farming developed , grain agriculture became more sophisticated and prompted a division of labour to store food between growing seasons . Labour divisions led to the rise of a leisured upper class and the development of cities , which provided the foundation for civilization . The growing complexity of human societies necessitated systems of accounting and writing . With civilizations flourishing , ancient history ( Antiquity , including the Classical Age , up to about 500 CE ) saw the rise and fall of empires .",

In addition , there may be up to eight replacement players on the bench , numbered 16-23 . Players are not restricted to a single position , although they generally specialise in just one or two that suit their skills and body types . Players that play multiple positions are called utility players . Forwards compete for the ball in scrums and line-outs and are generally bigger and stronger than the backs . Props push in the scrums , while the hooker tries to secure the ball for their team by hooking it back with their heel . The hooker is also the one who is responsible for throwing the ball in at line-outs , where it is mostly competed for by the locks , who are generally the tallest players on the team . The flankers and number eight are expected to be the first players to arrive at a breakdown and play an important role in securing possession of the ball for their team . The backs play behind the forwards and are usually more lightly built and faster . Successful backs are skilful at passing and kicking . Full-backs need to be good defenders and kickers , and have the ability to catch a kicked ball . The wingers are usually among the fastest players in a team and score many of the tries .",

  "/wiki/Biochemistry": "Biochemistry , sometimes called biological chemistry , is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms . Biochemical processes give rise to the complexity of life . A sub-discipline of both biology and chemistry , biochemistry can be divided in three fields ; structural biology , enzymology and metabolism . Over the last decades of the 20th century , biochemistry has through these three disciplines become successful at explaining living processes . Almost all areas of the life sciences are being uncovered and developed by biochemical methodology and research . Biochemistry focuses on understanding the chemical basis which allows biological molecules to give rise to the processes that occur within living cells and between cells , which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of tissues , organs , and organism structure and function . Biochemistry is closely related to molecular biology , the study of the molecular mechanisms of biological phenomena . Much of biochemistry deals with the structures , functions and interactions of biological macromolecules , such as proteins , nucleic acids , carbohydrates and lipids , which provide the structure of cells and perform many of the functions associated with life . The chemistry of the cell also depends on the reactions of smaller molecules and ions . These can be inorganic , for example water and metal ions , or organic , for example the amino acids , which are used to synthesize proteins . The mechanisms by which cells harness energy from their environment via chemical reactions are known as metabolism . The findings of biochemistry are applied primarily in medicine , nutrition , and agriculture .",
