  "/wiki/For-profit_university": "Proprietary colleges are for-profit colleges and universities . They are operated by their owners or investors , rather than a not-for-profit institution , religious organization , or government . Because they are not funded by tax money , their long-term sustainability is dependent on the value they provide relative to the perceived value of a degree from a higher educational institution overall . The increased reliance on federal student aid funds by these for profit schools is of growing concern . Since federal student loans are typically guaranteed by the government , for-profit colleges can reap a profit from taxpayers even if students drop out after enrolling , do not complete a degree , or the degree turns out to be nearly worthless for future employment . Students can be stuck with large and unmanageable debt loads , defaulting at a significantly higher rate than students at traditional non-profit institutions . Non-profit institutions generally depend in part on academic excellence and creating graduates that succeed in their fields , while for-profit schools are often based on attracting large numbers of students with few requirements in terms of academic qualifications for entry , because federal loans are provided for good and bad students alike . Some institutions in this category are regionally accredited , while many others are not . Sometimes a proprietary college may also overlap with the sector of non-degree granting business colleges . Students should exercise caution , before enrolling , about the validity and transferability of the degrees and credits earned at proprietary colleges . If a college is not regionally accredited , its credits will probably not be accepted by other colleges , and its degrees or certificates may not be recognized by employers . Every college claims to be accredited , but except in some specific areas such as nursing , regional accreditation is by far the most important type of accreditation .",
