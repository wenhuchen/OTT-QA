[ d ] It is one of two cities in Kentucky designated as first-class , the other being Lexington , the state 's second-largest city . [ e ] Louisville is the historical seat and , since 2003 , the nominal seat of Jefferson County , on the Indiana border . Named after King Louis XVI of France , Louisville was founded in 1778 by George Rogers Clark , making it one of the oldest cities west of the Appalachians . With nearby Falls of the Ohio as the only major obstruction to river traffic between the upper Ohio River and the Gulf of Mexico , the settlement first grew as a portage site . It was the founding city of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad , which grew into a 6,000-mile ( 9,700 km ) system across 13 states . Today , the city is known as the home of legendary boxer Muhammad Ali , the Kentucky Derby , Kentucky Fried Chicken ( KFC ) , the University of Louisville and its Cardinals , Louisville Slugger baseball bats , and three of Kentucky 's six Fortune 500 companies : Humana , Kindred Healthcare , and Yum ! Brands . Muhammad Ali International Airport , Louisville 's main commercial airport , hosts UPS 's worldwide hub . Since 2003 , Louisville 's borders have been the same as those of Jefferson County , after a city-county merger . The official name of this consolidated city-county government is the Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Government , abbreviated to Louisville Metro . Despite the merger and renaming , the term Jefferson County continues to be used in some contexts in reference to Louisville Metro , particularly including the incorporated cities outside the balance which make up Louisville proper .",
