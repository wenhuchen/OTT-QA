  "/wiki/EGOT": "EGOT , an acronym for the Emmy , Grammy , Oscar , and Tony Awards , is the designation given to people who have won all four awards . Respectively , these awards honor outstanding achievements in television , recording , film , and theater . Achieving the EGOT has been referred to as the grand slam of show business . As of 2020 [ update ] , fifteen people have accomplished this feat . The EGOT acronym was coined by actor Philip Michael Thomas in late 1984 , when his role on the new hit show Miami Vice brought instant fame , stating a desire to achieve the EGOT within five years . However , he intended that the E should be for the Primetime Emmy Award , and not a Daytime Emmy nor any of the awards presented at the other types of Emmy ceremonies . Nevertheless , two of the 15 EGOT winners have won only the Daytime Emmy . The term entered into public consciousness in the 2010s after a series-long arc in the 4th season of the sitcom 30 Rock featured the character of Tracy Jordan ( portrayed by Tracy Morgan ) setting out to achieve the EGOT . A variation of the accomplishment is the PEGOT , though there are conflicting definitions . Some sources state that the P refers to the Peabody Award , while others claim it means the Pulitzer Prize . As of 2019 [ update ] , only Barbra Streisand , Mike Nichols and Rita Moreno have achieved this status by winning the Peabody , while Richard Rodgers and Marvin Hamlisch have won the Pulitzer .",

Caesar was considered a sketch comic and actor , as opposed to a stand-up comedian . He also relied more on body language , accents , and facial contortions than simply dialogue . Unlike the slapstick comedy which was standard on TV , his style was considered avant garde in the 1950s . He conjured up ideas and scene and used writers to flesh out the concept and create the dialogue . Among the writers who wrote for Caesar early in their careers were Mel Brooks , Neil Simon , Larry Gelbart , Carl Reiner , Michael Stewart , Mel Tolkin , Selma Diamond , and Woody Allen . Sid 's was the show to which all comedy writers aspired . It was the place to be , said Steve Allen . His TV shows ' subjects included satires of real life events and people - and parodies of popular film genres , theater , television shows , and opera . But unlike other comedy shows at the time , the dialogue was considered sharper , funnier , and more adult-oriented ."
