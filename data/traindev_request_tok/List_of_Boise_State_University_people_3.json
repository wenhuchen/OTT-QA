  "/wiki/Voyager_1": "Voyager 1 is a space probe that was launched by NASA on September 5 , 1977 . Part of the Voyager program to study the outer Solar System , Voyager 1 was launched 16 days after its twin , Voyager 2 . Having operated for 42 years , 5 months and 12 days as of February 18 , 2020 , the spacecraft still communicates with the Deep Space Network to receive routine commands and to transmit data to Earth . Real-time distance and velocity data is provided by NASA and JPL . At a distance of 148.67 AU ( 22.2 billion km ; 13.8 billion mi ) from Earth as of January 19 , 2020 it is the most distant man-made object from Earth . The probe 's objectives included flybys of Jupiter , Saturn , and Saturn 's largest moon , Titan . Although the spacecraft 's course could have been altered to include a Pluto encounter by forgoing the Titan flyby , exploration of the moon took priority because it was known to have a substantial atmosphere . Voyager 1 studied the weather , magnetic fields , and rings of the two planets and was the first probe to provide detailed images of their moons . After completing its primary mission with the flyby of Saturn on November 12 , 1980 , Voyager 1 became the third of five artificial objects to achieve the escape velocity required to leave the Solar System . [ citation needed ] On August 25 , 2012 , Voyager 1 became the first spacecraft to cross the heliopause and enter the interstellar medium . In a further testament to the robustness of Voyager 1 , the Voyager team completed a successful test of the spacecraft 's trajectory correction maneuver ( TCM ) thrusters in late 2017 ( the first time these thrusters were fired since 1980 ) , a project enabling the mission to be extended by two to three years .

It is the only spacecraft to have visited either of these two ice giant planets . Voyager 2 is the fourth of five spacecraft to achieve the Solar escape velocity , which will allow it to leave the Solar System . Its primary mission ended with the exploration of the Neptunian system on October 2 , 1989 , after having visited the Uranian system in 1986 , the Saturnian system in 1981 , and the Jovian system in 1979 . Voyager 2 is now in its extended mission to study the outer reaches of the Solar System and has been operating for 42 years , 5 months and 28 days as of February 17 , 2020 .

It is the fifth space probe to achieve the escape velocity needed to leave the Solar System . On January 19 , 2006 , New Horizons was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station by an Atlas V rocket directly into an Earth-and-solar escape trajectory with a speed of about 16.26 km/s ( 10.10 mi/s ; 58,500 km/h ; 36,400 mph ) . It was the fastest man-made object ever launched from Earth . After a brief encounter with asteroid 132524 APL , New Horizons proceeded to Jupiter , making its closest approach on February 28 , 2007 , at a distance of 2.3 million kilometers ( 1.4 million miles ) . The Jupiter flyby provided a gravity assist that increased New Horizons ' speed ; the flyby also enabled a general test of New Horizons ' scientific capabilities , returning data about the planet 's atmosphere , moons , and magnetosphere . Most of the post-Jupiter voyage was spent in hibernation mode to preserve on-board systems , except for brief annual checkouts . On December 6 , 2014 , New Horizons was brought back online for the Pluto encounter , and instrument check-out began . On January 15 , 2015 , the spacecraft began its approach phase to Pluto . On July 14 , 2015 , at 11:49 UTC , it flew 12,500 km ( 7,800 mi ) above the surface of Pluto , making it the first spacecraft to explore the dwarf planet .
