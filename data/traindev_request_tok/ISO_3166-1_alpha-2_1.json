It is about 1,600 kilometres ( 1,000 mi ) from the coast of Africa and 2,250 kilometres ( 1,400 mi ) from the coast of Brazil . It is governed as part of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena , Ascension and Tristan da Cunha , of which the main island , Saint Helena , is around 1,300 kilometres ( 800 mi ) to the southeast . The territory also includes the sparsely-populated Tristan da Cunha archipelago , some 3,730 kilometres ( 2,300 mi ) to the south , about halfway to the Antarctic Circle . The island is named after the day of its recorded discovery , Ascension Day . It was an important safe haven and coaling station to mariners and for commercial airliners during the days of international air travel by flying boats . During World War II it was an important naval and air station , especially providing antisubmarine warfare bases in the Battle of the Atlantic . Ascension Island was garrisoned by the British Admiralty from 22 October 1815 to 1922 . The island is the location of RAF Ascension Island , which is a Royal Air Force station , a European Space Agency rocket tracking station , an Anglo-American signals intelligence facility and the BBC World Service Atlantic Relay Station . The island was used extensively as a staging point by the British military during the Falklands War . Ascension Island hosts one of four ground antennas ( others are on Kwajalein Island , Diego Garcia , and Cape Canaveral ) that assist in the operation of the Global Positioning System ( GPS ) navigational system . NASA operates a Meter Class Autonomous Telescope ( MCAT ) on Ascension Island for tracking orbital debris , which is potentially hazardous to operating spacecraft and astronauts , at a facility called the John Africano NASA/AFRL Orbital Debris Observatory .",

It is a global language , the world 's second-most spoken native language , after Mandarin Chinese , and the world 's fourth-most spoken language , after Mandarin Chinese , English and Hindi . Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages , which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century . The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century , and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo , a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile , in the 13th century . Beginning in 1492 , the Spanish language was taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire , most notably to the Americas , as well as territories in Africa , Oceania and the Philippines . A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist Mario Pei , analyzing the degree of difference from a language 's parent ( Latin , in the case of Romance languages ) by comparing phonology , inflection , syntax , vocabulary , and intonation , indicated the following percentages ( the higher the percentage , the greater the distance from Latin ) : In the case of Spanish , it is one of the closest Romance languages to Latin ( 20% distance ) , only behind Sardinian ( 8% distance ) and Italian ( 12% distance ) . Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin , including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek . Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date , having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula . With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin , this language makes up the second greatest vocabulary source after Latin itself . It has also been influenced by Basque , Iberian , Celtiberian , Visigothic , and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages . Additionally , it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages , particularly other Romance languages - French , Italian , Andalusi Romance , Portuguese , Galician , Catalan , Occitan , and Sardinian - as well as from Quechua , Nahuatl , and other indigenous languages of the Americas .

The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas .",

  "/wiki/European_Commission": "The European Commission ( EC ) is the executive branch of the European Union , responsible for proposing legislation , implementing decisions , upholding the EU treaties and managing the day-to-day business of the EU . Commissioners swear an oath at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg City , pledging to respect the treaties and to be completely independent in carrying out their duties during their mandate . The Commissioners are proposed by the Council of the European Union , on the basis of suggestions made by the national governments , and then appointed by the European Council after the approval of the European Parliament . It is common , although not a formal requirement , that the commissioners have previously held senior political positions , such as being a member of the European Parliament or a government minister . This EU institution operates as a cabinet government , with 27 members of the Commission ( informally known as commissioners ) . There is one member per member state , but members are bound by their oath of office to represent the general interest of the EU as a whole rather than their home state . One of the 27 is the Commission President ( currently Ursula von der Leyen ) proposed by the European Council and elected by the European Parliament . The Council of the European Union then nominates the other members of the Commission in agreement with the nominated President , and the 27 members as a single body are then subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament . The current Commission is the Von der Leyen Commission , which took office in December 2019 , following the European Parliament elections in May of the same year . The term Commission is variously used , either in the narrow sense of the 27-member College of Commissioners ( or College ) or to also include the administrative body of about 32,000 European civil servants who are split into departments called directorates-general and services . The procedural languages of the Commission are English , French and German . The Members of the Commission and their cabinets ( immediate teams ) are based in the Berlaymont building in Brussels .",
  "/wiki/United_Nations": "The United Nations ( UN ) is an intergovernmental organization that aims to maintain international peace and security , develop friendly relations among nations , achieve international cooperation , and be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations . It is the largest , most familiar , most internationally represented and most powerful intergovernmental organization in the world . The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City ; other main offices are in Geneva , Nairobi , Vienna and The Hague . The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars , succeeding the ineffective League of Nations . On 25 April 1945 , 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter , which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945 , when the UN began operations . Pursuant to the Charter , the organization 's objectives include maintaining international peace and security , protecting human rights , delivering humanitarian aid , promoting sustainable development , and upholding international law . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; this number grew to 193 in 2011 , representing the vast majority of the world 's sovereign states . The organization 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies . Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring , reporting and confidence-building roles . UN membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s . Since then , 80 former colonies have gained independence , including 11 trust territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council . By the 1970s , the UN 's budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping .",
