In the 1920s Mizner was the best-known and most-discussed living American architect . :5 Palm Beach , Florida , which he transformed , was his home , and most of his houses are there . He believed that architecture should also include interior and garden design , and set up Mizner Industries to have a reliable source of components . He was an architect with a philosophy and a dream . :5 Boca Raton , Florida , began as Mizner 's project . The 6-foot-2-inch ( 1.88 m ) , 250-pound ( 110 kg ) bon vivant epitomized the society architect . Rejecting other modern architects for producing a characterless copybook effect , he sought to make a building look traditional and as though it had fought its way from a small , unimportant structure to a great , rambling house that took centuries of different needs and ups and downs of wealth to accomplish . I sometimes start a house with a Romanesque corner , pretend that it has fallen into disrepair and been added to in the Gothic spirit , when suddenly the great wealth of the New World has poured in and the owner had added a very rich Renaissance addition . Or as he described his own never-built castle , drawings of which were part of his promotional literature , it would be a Spanish fortress of the twelfth century captured from its owner by a stronger enemy who , after taking it , adds on one wing and another , and then loses it in turn to another who builds to suit his taste . :21 As these quotes suggest , many Mizner buildings contain styles from more than one period , but all foreign .",
