  "/wiki/Independent_school": "An independent school is independent in its finances and governance . Also known as private schools , non-governmental , privately funded , or non-state schools , they are not administered by local , state or national governments . They are usually not dependent upon national or local government to finance their financial endowment . They are typically governed by a board of governors which is elected independently of government , and has a system of governance that ensures its independent operation . Children who attend private schools may be there because they are dissatisfied with public schools in their area . They may be selected for their academic prowess , or prowess in other fields , or sometimes their religious background . Private schools retain the right to select their students and are funded in whole or in part by charging their students for tuition , rather than relying on taxation through public ( government ) funding ; at some private schools students may be able to get a scholarship , lowering this tuition fee , dependent on a student 's talents or abilities ( e.g . sport scholarship , art scholarship , academic scholarship ) , need for financial aid , or tax credit scholarships that might be available . Some private schools are associated with a particular religion , such as Judaism , Roman Catholicism , or Lutheranism . For the past century , roughly one in 10 U.S. families has chosen to enroll their children in private school . Independent schools may have a religious affiliation , but the precise usage of the term excludes parochial ( and other ) schools if there is a financial dependence upon , or governance subordinate to , outside organizations . These definitions generally apply equally to both primary and secondary education .",
