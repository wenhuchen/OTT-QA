  "/wiki/NY_55": "New York State Route 55 ( NY 55 ) is a 122.45-mile-long ( 197.06 km ) east-west state highway in southern New York , running from the Pennsylvania state line at the Delaware River in Barryville to the Connecticut state line at Wingdale . It is the only other state highway beside NY 7 to completely cross the state , from border to border , in an east-west direction , although NY 17 does so and is partially east-west . It also forms a concurrency when it joins US 44 for 33 miles ( 53 km ) . Together with NY 52 , which it closely parallels and briefly joins in downtown Liberty , it forms the latitudinal backbone of the Hudson Valley region for non-interstate traffic . It offers the traveler a wide variety of landscapes , from farmlands , mountains and forests to the urban center of Poughkeepsie . Sights along the way include two of New York City 's major reservoirs in the Catskills , a dramatic crossing of the Shawangunk Ridge , and the Mid-Hudson Bridge .",

  "/wiki/NY_52": "New York State Route 52 ( NY 52 ) is a 108.72-mile-long ( 174.97 km ) state highway in the southeastern part of the state . It generally runs from west to east through five counties , beginning at the Pennsylvania state line in the Delaware River near Narrowsburg , crossing the Hudson River on the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge , and ending in Carmel . NY 52 and NY 55 , both major east-west routes of the Mid-Hudson Region , run parallel to each other , intersecting in downtown Liberty . With the exception of the section overlapping Interstate 84 ( I-84 ) , most of Route 52 is a two-lane road through lightly developed rural areas . The road west of the Hudson River serves a number of small communities in the southern Catskills and Hudson Valley , such as the villages of Jeffersonville , Ellenville and Walden . East of the Hudson , it closely parallels I-84 after leaving it at the village of Fishkill . It once passed through the cities of Newburgh and Beacon , following a ferry between them , but since the bridge 's construction Route 52 runs concurrently with I-84 just to their north . Much of what is today Route 52 was built as private turnpikes in the early 19th century . After their operating companies folded later in the century , the state took over the roads in the 1890s . While some portions of today 's Route 52 were included in New York 's first designations of state highways , it was not until a 1930 renumbering that Route 52 took that number . At that time it followed most of its present alignment , but continued east of its present terminus to NY 22 . The truncation to its junction with US 6 in Carmel came later in the 1930s , along with an exchange of alignments between routes 52 and 216 .",
