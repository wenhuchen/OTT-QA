  "/wiki/Win_(baseball)": "In baseball and softball , a pitcher 's win-loss record ( also referred to simply as their record ) indicates the number of wins ( denoted W ) and losses ( denoted L ) they have been credited with . For example , a 20-10 win-loss record would represent 20 wins and 10 losses . In each game , one pitcher on the winning team is awarded a win ( the winning pitcher ) and one pitcher on the losing team is given a loss ( the losing pitcher ) in their respective statistics . These pitchers are collectively known as the pitchers of record . The designation of win or loss for a pitcher is known as a decision , and only one pitcher for each team receives a decision . A starting pitcher who does not receive credit for a win or loss is said to have no decision . In certain situations , another pitcher on the winning team who pitched in relief of the winning pitcher can be credited with a save , and holds can be awarded to relief pitchers on both sides , but these are never awarded to the same pitcher who is awarded the win . The decisions are awarded by the official scorer of the game in accordance with the league 's rules . The official scorer does not assign a winning or losing pitcher in some games which are forfeited , such as those that are tied at the time of forfeiture . If the game is tied ( a rare event ) , no pitcher is awarded any decision . A pitcher 's winning percentage is calculated by dividing the number of wins by the number of decisions ( wins plus losses ) , and it is commonly expressed with three decimal places .",

  "/wiki/Rich_Gossage": "Richard Michael Goose Gossage ( born July 5 , 1951 ) is a former Major League Baseball right-handed relief pitcher . During a 22-year baseball career ( from 1972-1994 ) , he pitched for nine different teams , spending his best years with the New York Yankees and San Diego Padres . The nickname Goose came about when a friend did not like his previous nickname Goss , and noted he looked like a goose when he extended his neck to read the signs given by the catcher when he was pitching . Although Gossage is otherwise generally referred to as Rich in popular media , a baseball field named after him bears the name Rick . In the late 1970s and early 1980s , he was one of the earliest manifestations of the dominating modern closer , with wild facial hair and a gruff demeanor to go along with his blistering fastball . He led the American League in saves three times and was runner-up twice ; by the end of the 1987 season he ranked second in major-league career saves , trailing only Rollie Fingers , although by the end of his career his total of 310 had slipped to fourth all-time . When he retired he also ranked third in major-league career games pitched ( 1,002 ) , and he remains third in wins in relief ( 115 ) and innings pitched in relief ( 1,556\u2154 ) ; his 1,502 strikeouts place him behind only Hoyt Wilhelm among pitchers who pitched primarily in relief . He also is the career leader in blown saves ( 112 ) . From 1977 through 1983 he never recorded an earned run average over 2.62 , including a mark of 0.77 in 1981 , and in 1980 he finished third in AL voting for both the MVP Award and Cy Young Award as the Yankees won a division title . Respected for his impact in crucial games , Gossage recorded the final out to clinch a division , league , or World Series title seven times . His eight All-Star selections as a reliever were a record until Mariano Rivera passed him in 2008 ; he was also selected once as a starting pitcher . He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008 .",
  "/wiki/Save_(baseball)": "In baseball , a save ( abbreviated SV or S ) is credited to a pitcher who finishes a game for the winning team under certain prescribed circumstances . Most commonly a pitcher earns a save by entering in the ninth inning of a game in which his team is winning by three or fewer runs and finishing the game by pitching one inning without losing the lead . The number of saves or percentage of save opportunities successfully converted are oft-cited statistics of relief pitchers , particularly those in the closer role . The save statistic was created by journalist Jerome Holtzman in 1959 to measure the effectiveness of relief pitchers and was adopted as an official MLB statistic in 1969 . The save has been retroactively measured for pitchers before that date . Mariano Rivera is MLB 's all-time leader in regular-season saves with 652 .",
  "/wiki/Mariano_Rivera": "Mariano Rivera ( born November 29 , 1969 ) is a Panamanian-American former professional baseball pitcher who played 19 seasons in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) for the New York Yankees , from 1995 to 2013 . Nicknamed Mo and Sandman , he spent most of his career as a relief pitcher and served as the Yankees ' closer for 17 seasons . A thirteen-time All-Star and five-time World Series champion , he is MLB 's career leader in saves ( 652 ) and games finished ( 952 ) . Rivera won five American League ( AL ) Rolaids Relief Man Awards and three Delivery Man of the Year Awards , and he finished in the top three in voting for the AL Cy Young Award four times . He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame as part of its class of 2019 in his first year of eligibility , and was the first player ever to be elected unanimously by the Baseball Writers ' Association of America ( BBWAA ) . Raised in the modest Panamanian fishing village of Puerto Caimito , Rivera was an amateur player until he was signed by the Yankees organization in 1990 . He debuted in the major leagues in 1995 as a starting pitcher , before permanently converting to a relief pitcher late in his rookie year . After a breakthrough season in 1996 as a setup man , he became the Yankees ' closer in 1997 . In the following seasons , he established himself as one of baseball 's top relievers , leading the major leagues in saves in 1999 , 2001 , and 2004 . Rivera primarily threw a sharp-moving , mid-90s mile-per-hour cut fastball that frequently broke hitters ' bats and earned a reputation as one of the league 's toughest pitches to hit . With his presence at the end of games , signaled by his foreboding entrance song Enter Sandman , Rivera was a key contributor to the Yankees ' success in the late 1990s and early 2000s . An accomplished postseason performer , he was named the 1999 World Series Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) and the 2003 AL Championship Series MVP , and he holds several postseason records , including lowest earned run average ( ERA ) ( 0.70 ) and most saves ( 42 ) .",
  "/wiki/300_save_club": "In Major League Baseball ( MLB ) , the 300 save club is the group of pitchers who have recorded 300 or more regular-season saves in their careers . Most commonly a relief pitcher ( reliever or closer ) earns a save by being the final pitcher of a game in which his team is winning by three or fewer runs and pitching at least one inning without losing the lead . The final pitcher of a game can earn a save by getting at least one batter out to end the game with the winning run on base , at bat , or on deck , or by pitching the last three innings without relinquishing the lead , regardless of score . The statistic was created by Jerome Holtzman in 1959 to measure the effectiveness of relief pitchers and was adopted as an official statistic by MLB in 1969 . The save has been retroactively measured for past pitchers where applicable . Hoyt Wilhelm retired in 1972 and recorded just 31 saves from 1969 onwards , for example , but holds 228 total career saves . Mariano Rivera holds the MLB save record with 652 . Only Rivera and Trevor Hoffman have exceeded 500 or 600 saves , and Hoffman was the first to achieve either . Rivera , Hoffman , Lee Smith , Francisco Rodr\u00edguez , John Franco , and Billy Wagner are the only pitchers to have recorded 400 or more saves . Rollie Fingers was the first player to record 300 saves , reaching the mark on August 21 , 1982 . Kenley Jansen is the most recent , achieving his 300th on September 25 , 2019 . In total , 30 players have recorded 300 or more saves in their career .",

A strikeout is a statistic recorded for both pitchers and batters , and is denoted by K. A strikeout looking - in which the batter does not swing and the third strike is called by the umpire - is usually denoted by a \ua4d8 . Although a strikeout suggests that the pitcher dominated the batter , the free-swinging style that generates home runs also leaves batters susceptible to striking out . Some of the greatest home run hitters of all time - such as Alex Rodriguez , Reggie Jackson , and Jim Thome - were notorious for striking out .",

He also pitched for the Houston Astros . Pettitte won five World Series championships with the Yankees and was a three-time All-Star . He ranks as MLB 's all-time postseason wins leader with 19 . Pettitte was drafted by the Yankees organization in 1990 , and he signed with them roughly a year later . After debuting in the major leagues in 1995 , Pettitte finished third in voting for the American League ( AL ) Rookie of the Year Award . In 1996 , he led the AL with 21 wins and was runner-up for the AL Cy Young Award . Two years later , he was the Yankees ' Opening Day starter . Pettitte established himself as one of the Core Four players who contributed to the Yankees ' late-1990s dynasty that produced four championships . Pettitte won the 2001 AL Championship Series Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) Award in helping his team win the pennant . After spending nine seasons with the Yankees - a stint in which he won at least 12 games each season - Pettitte signed with the Astros in 2004 . He rejoined the Yankees in 2007 and later that season admitted to using human growth hormone to recover from an elbow injury in 2002 .",
  "/wiki/Shutouts_in_baseball": "In Major League Baseball , a shutout ( denoted statistically as ShO or SHO ) refers to the act by which a single pitcher pitches a complete game and does not allow the opposing team to score a run . If two or more pitchers combine to complete this act , no pitcher is awarded a shutout , although the team itself can be said to have shut out the opposing team . The ultimate single achievement among pitchers is a perfect game , which has been accomplished 23 times in over 135 years , most recently by F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez of the Seattle Mariners on August 15 , 2012 . By definition , a perfect game is counted as a shutout . A no-hitter completed by one pitcher is also a shutout unless the opposing team manages to score through a series of errors , base on balls , catcher 's interferences , dropped third strikes , or hit batsmen . The all-time career leader in shutouts is Walter Johnson , who pitched for the Washington Senators from 1907-1927 . He accumulated 110 shutouts , which is 20 more than the second place leader , Pete Alexander . The most shutouts recorded in one season was 16 , which was a feat accomplished by both Pete Alexander ( 1916 ) and George Bradley ( 1876 ) . These records are considered among the most secure records in baseball , because pitchers today rarely earn more than one or two shutouts per season with a heavy emphasis on pitch count and relief pitching . Complete games themselves have also become rare among starting pitchers . The current leader among active players for career shutouts is Clayton Kershaw , who has thrown 15 .",

  "/wiki/Innings_pitched": "In baseball , innings pitched ( IP ) are the number of innings a pitcher has completed , measured by the number of batters and baserunners that are put out while the pitcher is on the pitching mound in a game . Three outs made is equal to one inning pitched . One out counts as one-third of an inning , and two outs counts as two-thirds of an inning . Sometimes , the statistic is written 34.1 , 72.2 , or 91.0 , for example , to represent \u200b34 1\u20443 innings , \u200b72 2\u20443 innings , and 91 innings exactly , respectively . Runners left on base by a pitcher are not counted in determining innings pitched . It is possible for a pitcher to enter a game , give up several hits and possibly even several runs , and be removed before achieving any outs , thereby recording a total of zero innings pitched . Alternatively , it is possible for a pitcher to enter a situation where there are two runners on base and no outs . He 'll throw one pitch which will result in a triple play , and for that one pitch he 'll be credited with a full inning pitched .",
  "/wiki/Games_started": "In baseball statistics , games started ( denoted by GS ) indicates the number of games that a pitcher has started for his team . A pitcher is credited with starting the game if he throws the first pitch to the first opposing batter . If a player is listed in the starting lineup as the team 's pitcher , but is replaced before facing an opposing batter , the player is credited with a game pitched but not a game started ; there have been instances in major league history in which a starting pitcher was removed before his first pitch due to an injury , perhaps suffered while batting or running the bases during the top half of the first inning . The all-time leader for games started is Cy Young with 815 over a 22-year career . The players with the most starts in a single season are Pud Galvin and Will White , each with 75 games started . For position players , games started is also used to denote the number of times their names appear in a team 's starting lineup during the season .",

Rivera is the only pitcher in MLB history to finish more than 900 career games . Trevor Hoffman and Lee Smith are the only other pitchers to finish more than 800 games in their careers .",
  "/wiki/Complete_game": "In baseball , a complete game ( denoted by CG ) is the act of a pitcher pitching an entire game without the benefit of a relief pitcher . A pitcher who meets this criterion will be credited with a complete game regardless of the number of innings played - pitchers who throw an entire official game that is shortened by rain will still be credited with a complete game , while starting pitchers who are relieved in extra innings after throwing nine or more innings will not be credited with a complete game . A starting pitcher who is replaced by a pinch hitter in the final half inning of a game will still be credited with a complete game . The frequency of complete games has evolved since the early days of baseball . The complete game was essentially an expectation in the early 20th century and pitchers completed almost all of the games they started . In modern baseball , the feat is much more rare and no pitcher has reached 30 complete games in a season since 1975 ; in the 21st century , a pitcher has thrown 10 or more complete games in a season only twice .",

A pitcher , he played in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) from 1924 through 1947 . He played for the Boston Red Sox , New York Yankees , and Chicago White Sox . Ruffing is most remembered for his time with the highly successful Yankees teams of the 1930s and 1940s . Ruffing dropped out of school as a child to work in a coal mine in his native Illinois . He played for the mine 's company baseball team as an outfielder and first baseman . After he lost four toes from his left foot in a mining accident , he became unable to run in the field , and switched to pitching . He played in minor league baseball in 1923 and 1924 before making his MLB debut with the Red Sox . After struggling with Boston , pitching to a 36-96 win-loss record , the Red Sox traded Ruffing to the Yankees , where he became successful , pitching as the Yankees ' ace through 1946 . After one season with the White Sox , Ruffing retired from pitching to work in coaching . He served as a bullpen coach for the White Sox , a pitching coach for the New York Mets . Ruffing was a member of six World Series championship teams with the Yankees .",
  "/wiki/Base_on_balls": "A base on balls ( BB ) , also known as a walk , occurs in baseball when a batter receives four pitches that the umpire calls balls , and is in turn awarded first base without the possibility of being called out . The base on balls is defined in Section 2.00 of baseball 's Official Rules , and further detail is given in 6.08 ( a ) . It is , however , considered a faux pas for a professional player to actually walk to first base ; the batter-runner and any advancing runners normally jog on such a play . The term base on balls distinguishes a walk from the other manners in which a batter can be awarded first base without liability to be put out ( e.g. , hit by pitch ( HBP ) , catcher 's interference ) . Though a base on balls , catcher 's interference , or a batter hit by a pitched ball all result in the batter ( and possibly runners on base ) being awarded a base , the term walk usually refers only to a base on balls , and not the other methods of reaching base without the bat touching the ball . An important difference is that for a hit batter or catcher 's interference , the ball is dead and no one may advance unless forced ; the ball is live after a walk ( see below for details ) . A batter who draws a base on balls is commonly said to have been walked by the pitcher . When the batter is walked , runners advance one base without liability to be put out only if forced to vacate their base to allow the batter to take first base . If a batter draws a walk with the bases loaded , all preceding runners are forced to advance , including the runner on third base who is forced to home plate to score a run ; when a run is forced on a walk , the batter is credited with an RBI per rule 10.04 . Receiving a base on balls does not count as a hit or an at bat for a batter but does count as a time on base and a plate appearance . Therefore , a base on balls does not affect a player 's batting average , but it can increase his on-base percentage . A hit by pitch is not counted statistically as a walk , though the effect is mostly the same , with the batter receiving a free pass to first base .",

  "/wiki/Wild_pitch": "In baseball , a wild pitch ( WP ) is charged against a pitcher when his pitch is too high , too short , or too wide of home plate for the catcher to control with ordinary effort , thereby allowing a baserunner , perhaps even the batter-runner on an uncaught third strike , to advance . A wild pitch usually passes the catcher behind home plate , often allowing runners on base an easy chance to advance while the catcher chases the ball down . Sometimes the catcher may block a pitch , and the ball may be nearby , but the catcher has trouble finding the ball , allowing runners to advance . A closely related statistic is the passed ball . As with many baseball statistics , whether a pitch that gets away from a catcher is counted as a wild pitch or a passed ball is at the discretion of the official scorer . The benefit of the doubt is usually given to the catcher if there is uncertainty ; therefore , most of these situations are scored as wild pitches . If the pitch was so low as to touch the ground , or so high that the catcher has to jump to get to it , or so wide that the catcher has to lunge for it , it is usually then considered a wild pitch and not a passed ball . Because the pitcher and catcher handle the ball much more than other fielders , certain misplays on pitched balls are defined in Rule 10.13 as wild pitches and passed balls . No error shall be charged when a wild pitch or passed ball is scored .",
  "/wiki/Hit_by_pitch": "In baseball , hit by pitch ( HBP ) is an event in which a batter or his clothing or equipment ( other than his bat ) is struck directly by a pitch from the pitcher ; the batter is called a hit batsman ( HB ) . A hit batsman is awarded first base , provided that ( in the plate umpire 's judgment ) he made an honest effort to avoid the pitch , although failure to do so is rarely called by an umpire . Being hit by a pitch is often caused by a batter standing too close to , or crowding , home plate .",
  "/wiki/Jack_Warhop": "John Milton Warhop ( July 4 , 1884 - October 4 , 1960 ) was an American baseball pitcher who played eight seasons in Major League Baseball from 1908 to 1915 for the New York Highlanders/New York Yankees . He is best known for giving up Babe Ruth 's first two career home runs . Considered by baseball insiders and historians as an unlucky pitcher , Warhop had a career 69-92 win-loss record , but with a 3.12 earned run average while playing for mostly second division Highlanders/Yankees teams . Of his 92 losses , the Yankees did not score a run in 23 , and he holds the MLB record for losing the most 1-0 games with five in 1914 . He was released after the 1915 season and played a number of seasons in minor league baseball and semi-professional teams until his late 40s or early 50s . Warhop had an underhand submarine delivery , which gave him the nickname Crab . He was also known for his rather small size , which is a subject of some conflict , although most historians and statisticians agree that he measured between 5 feet , 8 inches , used by several historians like Marty Appel or 5 feet 9 inches , used by Baseball-Reference.com ."
