  "/wiki/Belo_Monte_Dam": "The Belo Monte Dam ( formerly known as Karara\u00f4 ) is a hydroelectric dam complex on the northern part of the Xingu River in the state of Par\u00e1 , Brazil . After its completion , with the installation of its 18th turbine , on November 2019 , the installed capacity of the dam complex is 11,233 megawatts ( MW ) , which makes it the second largest hydroelectric dam complex in Brazil and fourth largest in the world by installed capacity , behind the Three Gorges Dam and the Xiluodu Dam in China and the Brazilian-Paraguayan Itaipu Dam . Considering the oscillations of flow river , guaranteed minimum capacity generation from the Belo Monte Dam would measure 4,571 MW , 39% of its maximum capacity . Brazil 's rapid economic growth over the last decade has provoked a huge demand for new and stable sources of energy , especially to supply its growing industries . In Brazil , hydroelectric power plants produce over 85% of the electrical energy . The Government has decided to construct new hydroelectric dams to guarantee national energy security . However , there is opposition both within Brazil and among the international community to the project 's potential construction regarding its economic viability , the generation efficiency of the dams and in particular its impacts on the region 's people and environment . In addition , critics worry that construction of the Belo Monte Dam could make the construction of other dams upstream- which could have greater impacts- more viable . Plans for the dam began in 1975 but were soon shelved due to controversy ; they were later revitalized in the late 1990s . In the 2000s , the dam was redesigned , but faced renewed controversy and controversial impact assessments were carried out . On 26 August 2010 , a contract was signed with Norte Energia to construct the dam once the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources ( IBAMA ) had issued an installation license . A partial installation license was granted on 26 January 2011 and a full license to construct the dam was issued on 1 June 2011 .",

At 8.5 million square kilometers ( 3.2 million square miles ) and with over 211 million people , Brazil is the world 's fifth-largest country by area and the sixth most populous . Its capital is Bras\u00edlia , and its most populous city is S\u00e3o Paulo . The federation is composed of the union of the 26 states , the Federal District , and the 5,570 municipalities . It is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas ; it is also one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations , due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world . Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east , Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers ( 4,655 mi ) . It borders all other countries in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent 's land area . Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest , home to diverse wildlife , a variety of ecological systems , and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats . This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries , and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection . Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral , who claimed the area for the Portuguese Empire . Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 , when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro .

Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",
