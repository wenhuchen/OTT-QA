Emerging around 1150 as a corporation associated with the cathedral school of Notre Dame de Paris , it was considered the second oldest university in Europe . Officially chartered in 1200 by King Philip II of France and recognised in 1215 by Pope Innocent III , it was later often nicknamed after its theological College of Sorbonne , in turn founded by Robert de Sorbon and chartered by French King Saint Louis around 1257 . [ citation needed ] Internationally highly reputed for its academic performance in the humanities ever since the Middle Ages - notably in theology and philosophy - it introduced several academic standards and traditions that have endured ever since and spread internationally , such as doctoral degrees and student nations . Vast numbers of popes , royalty , scientists , and intellectuals were educated at the University of Paris . A few of the colleges of the time are still visible close to Pantheon and Luxembourg Gardens : Coll\u00e8ge des Bernardins ( 18 , rue de Poissy 75005 ) , Hotel de Cluny ( 6 , Place Paul Painleve 75005 ) , College Sainte Barbe ( 4 , rue Valette 75005 ) , College d'Harcourt ( 44 Boulevard Saint-Michel 75006 ) , and Cordeliers ( 21 , Rue Ecole de Medecine 75006 ) .

Racine was primarily a tragedian , producing such examples of neoclassical perfection as Ph\u00e8dre , Andromaque , and Athalie . He did write one comedy , Les Plaideurs , and a muted tragedy , Esther for the young . Racine 's plays displayed his mastery of the dodecasyllabic ( 12 syllable ) French alexandrine . His writing is renowned for its elegance , purity , speed , and fury , and for what American poet Robert Lowell described as a diamond-edge , and the glory of its hard , electric rage . Racine 's dramaturgy is marked by his psychological insight , the prevailing passion of his characters , and the nakedness [ clarification needed ] of both plot and stage . The linguistic effects of Racine 's poetry are widely considered to be untranslatable , although many eminent poets have attempted to translate Racine 's work into English , including Lowell , Richard Wilbur , Ted Hughes , Tony Harrison , and Derek Mahon , and Friedrich Schiller into German . The latest translations of Racine 's plays into English have been by Alan Hollinghurst ( Berenice , Bajazet ) , by RADA director Edward Kemp ( Andromache ) , Neil Bartlett , and poet Geoffrey Alan Argent , who earned a 2011 American Book Award for the translating The Complete Plays of Jean Racine .",

His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise more often than those of any other playwright today .

Born into a prosperous family and having studied at the Coll\u00e8ge de Clermont ( now Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand ) , Moli\u00e8re was well suited to begin a life in the theatre . Thirteen years as an itinerant actor helped him polish his comic abilities while he began writing , combining Commedia dell'arte elements with the more refined French comedy . Through the patronage of aristocrats including Philippe I , Duke of Orl\u00e9ans - the brother of Louis XIV - Moli\u00e8re procured a command performance before the King at the Louvre . Performing a classic play by Pierre Corneille and a farce of his own , The Doctor in Love , Moli\u00e8re was granted the use of salle du Petit-Bourbon near the Louvre , a spacious room appointed for theatrical performances .
