The National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs ( NL ) was formed in Chicago , Illinois by businessman , and owner of the Chicago White Stockings ( now known as , the Chicago Cubs ) , William Hulbert , for the purpose of replacing the NA , which he believed to have been corrupt , mismanaged , full of rowdy , drunken ballplayers , and under the influence of the gambling community . One of the new rules put into place by the new league was that all teams had to be located in cities that had a population of 75,000 or more . The initial NL season began with eight teams , and they were asked to play seventy games between April 22 and October 21 . The NL is considered to be the first major league , although it has been argued that the NA can make that claim .",

The team is the forerunner of , but not directly connected with , the current St. Louis Cardinals Major League Baseball team . After the conclusion of the 1877 season , a game-fixing scandal involving two players the Brown Stockings had acquired led the team to resign its membership in the NL . The club then declared bankruptcy and folded . The Brown Stockings did not meet a complete demise , however . Organized by outfielder Ned Cuthbert , a few members of the former club continued to play the following year , though not now bound to any league . They played whomever they could , wherever they could , and still managed to draw crowds and make a profit , leading to play again the following two years . The Brown Stockings regained some of their former success - enough of it that , despite the recent scandal , fans of the team seemed to exhibit a short memory and began to show interest in recreating another professional St. Louis baseball team . In 1881 , when German immigrant Chris von der Ahe - owner of a grocery store and saloon who was initially ignorant about baseball - saw the popularity of the club , he bought them out and soon became interested in having the team compete in a professional league . Together with beer magnates in five other cities , the American Association was formed in late 1881 , and professional baseball flourished in St. Louis - this time , with the resurrected Brown Stockings the next year .",

  "/wiki/Walter_Johnson": "Walter Perry Johnson ( November 6 , 1887 - December 10 , 1946 ) , nicknamed Barney and The Big Train , was a Major League Baseball right-handed pitcher . He played his entire 21-year baseball career for the Washington Senators ( 1907-1927 ) . He later served as manager of the Senators from 1929 through 1932 and of the Cleveland Indians from 1933 through 1935 . Often thought of as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history , Johnson established several pitching records , some of which remain unbroken nine decades after he retired from baseball . He remains by far the all-time career leader in shutouts with 110 , second in wins with 417 , and fourth in complete games with 531 . He held the career record in strikeouts for nearly 56 years , with 3,508 , from the end of his career in 1927 until the 1983 season , when three players ( Steve Carlton , Nolan Ryan and Gaylord Perry ) finally passed the mark . Johnson was the only player in the 3,000 strikeout club ( achieved 22 July 1923 ) for 51 years ( less 5 days ) until Bob Gibson recorded his 3,000th strikeout on 17 July 1974 . Johnson led the league in strikeouts a Major League record 12 times - one more than current strikeout leader Nolan Ryan - including a record eight consecutive seasons . He is the only pitcher in major league history to record over 400 wins and strike out over 3,500 batters . In 1936 , Johnson was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame as one of its first five inaugural members . His gentle nature was legendary , and to this day he is held up as an example of good sportsmanship , while his name has become synonymous with friendly competition .",
  "/wiki/Washington_Senators_(1901\u201360)": "The Washington Senators baseball team was one of the American League 's eight charter franchises . Now known as the Minnesota Twins , the club was founded in Washington , D.C. in 1901 as the Washington Senators . In 1905 , the team changed its official name to the Washington Nationals . The name Nationals appeared on the uniforms for only two seasons , and was then replaced with the W logo for the next 52 years . However , the names Senators , Nationals and shorter Nats were used interchangeably by fans and media for the next 60 years ; in 2005 , the latter two names were revived for the current National League franchise that had previously played in Montreal . For a time , from 1911 to 1933 , the Senators were one of the more successful franchises in Major League Baseball . The team 's rosters included Baseball Hall of Fame members Goose Goslin , Sam Rice , Joe Cronin , Bucky Harris , Heinie Manush and one of the greatest players and pitchers of all time , Walter Johnson . But the Senators are remembered more for their many years of mediocrity and futility , including six last-place finishes in the 1940s and 1950s . Joe Judge , Cecil Travis , Buddy Myer , Roy Sievers and Eddie Yost were other notable Senators players whose careers were spent in obscurity due to the team 's lack of success .",

It was a revival of the nickname that fans gave to the Cleveland Spiders while Louis Sockalexis , a Native American , was playing for the team .

The Red Sox were a dominant team in the new league , defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World Series in 1903 and winning four more championships by 1918 . However , they then went into one of the longest championship droughts in baseball history , dubbed the Curse of the Bambino after its alleged inception due to the Red Sox ' sale of Babe Ruth to the rival New York Yankees two years after their world championship in 1918 , an 86-year wait before the team 's sixth World Championship in 2004 .

  "/wiki/Federal_League": "The Federal League of Base Ball Clubs , known simply as the Federal League , was an American professional baseball league that played its first season in 1913 and operated as a third major league , in competition with the established National and American Leagues , from 1914 to 1915 . The Federal League came together in early 1913 through the work of John T. Powers , and immediately challenged the operations of organized baseball . Playing in what detractors called the outlaw league allowed players to avoid the restrictions of the organized leagues ' reserve clause . The competition of another , better paying league caused players ' salaries to skyrocket , demonstrating the bargaining potential of free agency for the first time . Interference by the National and American Leagues in their operations caused the Federal League to fold after the 1915 season . This resulted in a landmark federal lawsuit , Federal Baseball Club v. National League , in which the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ruled that the Sherman Antitrust Act did not apply to Major League Baseball . The Federal League left its mark on baseball history in the field now known as Wrigley Field , which was originally built for the Chicago Whales Federal League team . The league itself and many sports writers considered it a major league during its existence ; organized baseball recognized its major league status in 1968 . It would be the last independent major league outside the established structure of professional baseball to make it to the playing field , and would be the last serious attempt to create a third major league until the abortive Continental League of 1960 ."
