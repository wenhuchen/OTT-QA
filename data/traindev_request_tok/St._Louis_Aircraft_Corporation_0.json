  "/wiki/Curtiss_JN-4": "The Curtiss JN-4 Jenny was one of a series of JN biplanes built by the Curtiss Aeroplane Company of Hammondsport , New York , later the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company . Although the Curtiss JN series was originally produced as a training aircraft for the U.S. Army , the Jenny ( the common nickname derived from JN-4 , with an open-topped four appearing as a Y ) continued after World War I as a civil aircraft , as it became the backbone of American postwar [ civil ] aviation . Thousands of surplus Jennys were sold at bargain prices to private owners in the years after the war and became central to the barnstorming era that helped awaken the U.S. to civil aviation through much of the 1920s .",
