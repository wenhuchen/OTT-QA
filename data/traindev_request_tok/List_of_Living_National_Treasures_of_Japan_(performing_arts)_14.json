  "/wiki/Gagaku": "Gagaku ( \u96c5\u697d , imperial court music and dances , lit . elegant music ) is a type of Japanese classical music that has been performed at the Imperial Court in Kyoto for several centuries since the 7th century . It is today performed by the Board of Ceremonies in the Tokyo Imperial Palace . This kind of music was first imported into Japan from China ; however , artistically it differs from the music of the corresponding Chinese form yayue which is a term reserved for ceremonial music . Gagaku consists of three primary repertoires :",
  "/wiki/Noh": "Noh ( \u80fd , N\u014d , derived from the Sino-Japanese word for skill or talent ) , is a major form of classical Japanese dance-drama that has been performed since the 14th century . Developed by Kan'ami and his son Zeami , it is the oldest major theatre art that is still regularly performed today . Although the terms Noh and n\u014dgaku are sometimes used interchangeably , n\u014dgaku encompasses both Noh and ky\u014dgen . Traditionally , a full n\u014dgaku program includes five Noh plays with comedic ky\u014dgen plays in between ; an abbreviated program of two Noh plays with one ky\u014dgen piece has become common today . Optionally , an okina play may be presented in the very beginning of n\u014dgaku presentation . Noh is often based on tales from traditional literature with a supernatural being transformed into human form as a hero narrating a story . Noh integrates masks , costumes and various props in a dance-based performance , requiring highly trained actors and musicians . Emotions are primarily conveyed by stylized conventional gestures while the iconic masks represent the roles such as ghosts , women , children , and the elderly . Written in late middle Japanese , the text vividly describes the ordinary people of the twelfth to sixteenth centuries . [ attribution needed ] Having a strong emphasis on tradition rather than innovation , Noh is extremely codified and regulated by the iemoto system .",
  "/wiki/Bunraku": "Bunraku ( \u6587\u697d ) , also known as Ningy\u014d j\u014druri ( \u4eba\u5f62\u6d44\u7460\u7483 ) , is a form of traditional Japanese puppet theatre , founded in Osaka in the beginning of the 17th century . Three kinds of performers take part in a bunraku performance : the Ningy\u014dtsukai or Ningy\u014dzukai ( puppeteers ) , the Tay\u016b ( chanters ) , and shamisen musicians . Occasionally other instruments such as taiko drums will be used . The most accurate term for the traditional puppet theater in Japan is ningy\u014d j\u014druri ( \u4eba\u5f62\u6d44\u7460\u7483 ) . The combination of chanting and shamisen playing is called j\u014druri and the Japanese word for puppet ( or dolls , generally ) is ningy\u014d . It is used in many plays . Bunraku puppetry has been a documented traditional activity for Japanese people for hundreds of years .",

Kabuki theatre is known for the stylization of its drama and for the elaborate make-up worn by some of its performers .

  "/wiki/Japanese_traditional_dance": "Japanese traditional dance has a long history , the oldest known ones may be among those transmitted through the kagura tradition , or folk dances relating to food producing activities such as planting rice ( dengaku ) and fishing , including rain dances . There are large number of these traditional dances , which are often subfixed -odori , -asobi , and -mai , and may be specific to a region or village . Mai and Odori are the two main groups of Japanese dances , and the term Buy\u014d ( \u821e\u8e0a ) was coined in modern times as a general term for dance , by combining mai ( \u821e , which can also be pronounced bu ) and odori ( \u8e0a , can also be pronounced y\u014d ) . Mai is a more reserved genre of dance that often has circling movements , and dances of the Noh theatre are of this tradition . A variation of the Mai style of Japanese dance is the Kyomai or Kyoto-style dance . Kyomai developed in the 17th century Tokugawa cultural period . It is heavily influenced by the elegance and sophistication of the manners often associated with the Imperial Court in Kyoto . [ citation needed ] Odori has more vigorous stepping movements and is more energetic , and dances of the kabuki theatre belong to this category .",
  "/wiki/Kumi_Odori": "Kumi odori ( \u7d44\u8e0a , Okinawan : Kumi wudui ) is a form of narrative traditional Ry\u016bky\u016ban dance . Kumi odori or Kumi wudui means combination dance or ensemble dance . Originating in the Ry\u016bky\u016ban capital of Shuri , Okinawa in 1719 , the original purpose of this dance was to provide amusement and diversions , which were termed ukwanshin , for the Chinese diplomats who traveled to Ry\u016bky\u016b . Tamagusuku Chokun , a Ry\u016bky\u016ban courtier who lived from 1684-1734 , is credited with the establishment of kumi odori as a frequently presented court demonstration . An amalgamation of several different types of East Asian dance , the kumi odori has continued to hold a place in Okinawan culture , and is now recognized by the Japanese government as an Important Intangible Cultural Property . In 2010 it was inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity . It remains today a prime example of native art sustained by the people of Okinawa .",
  "/wiki/Buy\u014d": "Buy\u014d ( \u821e\u8e0a ) , or Nichibu ( \u65e5\u821e ) short for Nihon buy\u014d/Nippon buy\u014d ( \u65e5\u672c\u821e\u8e0a ) meaning Japanese dance , refers to a traditional Japanese performing art that may be a dance sometimes mixed with pantomime . It begins with early dance traditions such as mai and odori , with major development in the early Edo period ( early 17th century ) in the form of kabuki dances , which incorporated elements from the older dance genres . Although the term Nihon buy\u014d means Japanese dance , it is not meant to refer to Japanese dance in general , rather it refers to a few dance genres such as kabuki buy\u014d performed in theatre , Kamigata mai that encompasses the style of dancing performed by geisha , as well as some Japanese dances with modern choreography . Nihon buy\u014d differs from other Japanese traditional dances in that it is a more refined style of dancing intended as entertainment on a public stage or in private functions . The term buy\u014d is a modern coinage during the Meiji period as a term for dance , and the writer Tsubouchi Sh\u014dy\u014d is believed to be the first to use the term Nihon buy\u014d . Prior to this , dance was generally referred according to its particular dance genre , such as mai and odori . The term is a combination of mai ( \u821e , which can also be pronounced bu ) and odori ( \u8e0a , can also be pronounced y\u014d ) . Sh\u014dy\u014d intended Nihon buy\u014d to be a term for Furigoto Geki ( \u632f\u4e8b\u5287 ) , a form of dance drama in Kabuki plays , but it has now become a term that covers several Japanese dance styles , including the modern dance form Sosaku Buy\u014d . As a genre of dance that has multiple influences and borrowings from many different dance traditions that developed over a long period , one that overlaps with theatre and has many different schools , there is some difficulty in defining and categorizing Nihon buy\u014d .",
  "/wiki/Traditional_Japanese_Music": "Traditional Japanese music or \u90a6\u697d ( h\u014dgaku ) , meaning literally ( home ) country music ( as opposed to \u6d0b\u697d ( y\u014dgaku ) - Western music ) is the folk or traditional music of Japan . Japan 's Ministry of Education classifies H\u014dgaku as a category separate from other traditional forms of music , such as Gagaku ( court music ) or Sh\u014dmy\u014d ( Buddhist chanting ) , but most ethnomusicologists view H\u014dgaku , in a broad sense , as the form from which the others were derived . Outside of ethnomusicology , however , H\u014dgaku usually refers to Japanese music from around the 17th to the mid-19th century . Within this framework , there are three types of traditional music in Japan : theatrical , court music ( called gagaku ) , and instrumental .",
  "/wiki/J\u014druri_(music)": "J\u014druri ( \u6d44\u7460\u7483 ) is a form of traditional Japanese narrative music in which a tay\u016b ( \u592a\u592b ) sings to the accompaniment of a shamisen . As a form of storytelling , the emphasis is on the lyrics and narration rather than the music itself . According to Asai Ry\u014di , the first to have ever employed the shamisen during his storytelling instead of the biwa was chanter Sawazumi . The story he narrated on that occasion was J\u014druri J\u016b-ni-dan z\u014dshi , one of the many existing versions of the J\u014druri Monogatari , which tells the tale of the tragic love between Minamoto no Yoshitsune and J\u014druri-hime . Following this event , every tale sung to the accompaniment of a shamisen is associated with J\u014druri ."
