  "/wiki/Champoeg_Meetings": "The Champoeg Meetings were the first attempts at formal governance by European-American and French Canadian pioneers in the Oregon Country on the Pacific Northwest coast of North America . Between 1841 and 1843 , a series of public councils was held at Champoeg , a settlement on the French Prairie of the Willamette River valley in present-day Marion County , Oregon , and at surrounding settlements . The meetings were organized by newly arrived settlers as well as Protestant missionaries from the Methodist Mission and Catholic Jesuit priests from Canada . Since the first decade of the 19th century , a small but growing number of pioneers had settled in the Oregon Country , mostly to pursue business interests in the North American fur trade . Despite its economic value , the region was so vast and remote that it was left unorganized for several decades , with no European-American government in place to set laws and resolve disputes . Prior to the Champoeg Meetings , the closest thing to a government in the Oregon Country was the privately owned Hudson 's Bay Company , which effected a loose authority mainly through the efforts of Dr. John McLoughlin at Fort Vancouver in present-day Vancouver , Washington . Uncertainty about settling the estate of prominent settler Ewing Young in 1841 stirred a group of settlers led by missionary Jason Lee to advocate for a settler-run local government in the region . The assemblies at Champoeg addressed issues of probate law and estate administration , how to reward hunters who killed animals preying on livestock , and how to compromise on a system of leadership for the proposed government . The meetings eventually culminated in a vote on May 2 , 1843 , which concluded in favor of forming what became the Provisional Government of Oregon . Though primarily supported by American pioneers and opposed by French Canadian settlers in anticipation of the region 's annexation by the United States , several French Canadians also voted in favor of forming a provisional government . A state park and marker at the site of the May 2 vote commemorate the proceedings , as well as a large mural behind the desk of the Oregon Speaker of the House at the Oregon State Capitol in Salem .",
