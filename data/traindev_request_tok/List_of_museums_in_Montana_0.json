  "/wiki/American_Old_West": "The American frontier includes the geography , history , folklore , and cultural expression of life in the forward wave of American expansion that began with English colonial settlements in the early 17th century and ended with the admission of the last remaining western territories as states in 1912 . This era of massive migration and settlement was particularly encouraged by President Thomas Jefferson following the Louisiana Purchase , giving rise to the expansionist philosophy known as Manifest Destiny . A frontier is a zone of contact at the edge of a line of settlement . Leading theorist Frederick Jackson Turner went deeper , arguing that the frontier was the defining process of American civilization : The frontier , he asserted , promoted the formation of a composite nationality for the American people . He theorized it was a process of development : This perennial rebirth , this fluidity of American life , this expansion westward.furnish [ es ] the forces dominating American character . Turner 's ideas since 1893 have inspired generations of historians ( and critics ) to explore multiple individual American frontiers , but the popular folk frontier concentrates on the conquest and settlement of Native American lands west of the Mississippi River , in what is now the Midwest , Texas , the Great Plains , the Rocky Mountains , the Southwest , the West Coast , and Hawaii . In 19th- and early 20th-century media , enormous popular attention was focused on the Western United States in the second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century , from the 1850s to the 1910s , a period sometimes called the Old West or the Wild West . Such media typically exaggerated the romance , anarchy , and chaotic violence of the period for greater dramatic effect . This eventually inspired the Western genre of film , which spilled over into television shows , novels , and comic books , as well as children 's toys , games and costumes . As defined by Hine and Faragher , frontier history tells the story of the creation and defense of communities , the use of the land , the development of markets , and the formation of states . They explain , It is a tale of conquest , but also one of survival , persistence , and the merging of peoples and cultures that gave birth and continuing life to America . Turner himself repeatedly emphasized how the availability of free land to start new farms attracted pioneering Americans : The existence of an area of free land , its continuous recession , and the advance of American settlement westward , explain American development .",

  "/wiki/Butte,_Montana": "Butte is the county seat of Silver Bow County , Montana , United States . In 1977 , the city and county governments consolidated to form the sole entity of Butte-Silver Bow . The city covers 718 square miles ( 1,860 km2 ) , and , according to the 2010 census , has a population of 33,503 , making it Montana 's fifth largest city . It is served by Bert Mooney Airport with airport code BTM . Established in 1864 as a mining camp in the northern Rocky Mountains on the Continental Divide , Butte experienced rapid development in the late-nineteenth century , and was Montana 's first major industrial city . In its heyday between the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries , it was one of the largest copper boomtowns in the American West . Employment opportunities in the mines attracted surges of Asian and European immigrants , particularly the Irish ; as of 2017 , Butte has the largest population of Irish Americans per capita of any city in the United States . Butte was also the site of various historical events involving its mining industry and active labor unions and Socialist politics , the most famous of which was the labor riot of 1914 . Despite the dominance of the Anaconda Copper Mining Company , Butte was never a company town . Other major events in the city 's history include the 1917 Speculator Mine disaster , the largest hard rock mining disaster in world history . Over the course of its history , Butte 's mining and smelting operations generated an excess of $ 48 billion worth of ore , but also resulted in numerous environmental implications for the city : The upper Clark Fork River , with headwaters at Butte , is the largest Superfund site in the United States , and the city is also home to the Berkeley Pit . In the late-twentieth century , cleanup efforts from the EPA were instated , and the Butte Citizens Technical Environmental Committee was established in 1984 .",
