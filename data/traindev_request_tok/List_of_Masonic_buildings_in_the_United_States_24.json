  "/wiki/Greek_Revival": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland .",

Napoleon took a scientific expedition with him to Egypt . Publication of the expedition 's work , the Description de l'\u00c9gypte , began in 1809 and was published as a series through 1826 .

  "/wiki/Osiris": "Osiris is the god of fertility , agriculture , the afterlife , the dead , resurrection , life , and vegetation in ancient Egyptian religion . He was classically depicted as a green-skinned deity with a pharaoh 's beard , partially mummy-wrapped at the legs , wearing a distinctive atef crown , and holding a symbolic crook and flail . He was one of the first to be associated with the mummy wrap . When his brother , Set , cut him up into pieces after killing him , Isis , his wife , found all the pieces and wrapped his body up . Osiris was at times considered the eldest son of the god Geb and the sky goddess Nut , as well as being brother and husband of Isis , with Horus being considered his posthumously begotten son . He was also associated with the epithet Khenti-Amentiu , meaning Foremost of the Westerners , a reference to his kingship in the land of the dead . Through syncretism with Iah , he is also a god of the Moon . Osiris was considered the brother of Isis , Set , Nephthys , and Horus the Elder , and father of Horus the Younger . The first evidence of the worship of Osiris was found in the middle of the Fifth dynasty of Egypt ( 25th century BC ) , although it is likely that he was worshiped much earlier ; the Khenti-Amentiu epithet dates to at least the first dynasty , and was also used as a pharaonic title . Most information available on the myths of Osiris is derived from allusions contained in the Pyramid Texts at the end of the Fifth Dynasty , later New Kingdom source documents such as the Shabaka Stone and the Contending of Horus and Seth , and much later , in narrative style from the writings of Greek authors including Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus . Osiris was the judge of the dead and the underworld agency that granted all life , including sprouting vegetation and the fertile flooding of the Nile River . He was described as He Who is Permanently Benign and Youthful and the Lord of Silence .",
  "/wiki/Aswan_Dam": "The Aswan Dam , or more specifically since the 1960s , the Aswan High Dam , is an embankment dam built across the Nile in Aswan , Egypt , between 1960 and 1970 . Its significance largely eclipsed the previous Aswan Low Dam initially completed in 1902 downstream . Based on the success of the Low Dam , then at its maximum utilization , construction of the High Dam became a key objective of the government following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 ; with its ability to better control flooding , provide increased water storage for irrigation and generate hydroelectricity the dam was seen as pivotal to Egypt 's planned industrialization . Like the earlier implementation , the High Dam has had a significant effect on the economy and culture of Egypt . Before the High Dam was built , even with the old dam in place , the annual flooding of the Nile during late summer had continued to pass largely unimpeded down the valley from its East African drainage basin . These floods brought high water with natural nutrients and minerals that annually enriched the fertile soil along its floodplain and delta ; this predictability had made the Nile valley ideal for farming since ancient times . However , this natural flooding varied , since high-water years could destroy the whole crop , while low-water years could create widespread drought and associated famine . Both these events had continued to occur periodically . As Egypt 's population grew and technology increased , both a desire and the ability developed to completely control the flooding , and thus both protect and support farmland and its economically important cotton crop . With the greatly increased reservoir storage provided by the High Aswan Dam , the floods could be controlled and the water could be stored for later release over multiple years . The Aswan Dam was designed by the Moscow-based Hydroproject Institute .",
