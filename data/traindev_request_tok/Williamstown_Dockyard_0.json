  "/wiki/HMAS_Adelaide_(L01)": "HMAS Adelaide ( L01 ) is the second of two Canberra-class landing helicopter dock ( LHD ) ships of the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . Construction of the ship started at Navantia 's Spanish shipyard with steel-cutting in February 2010 . The ship was laid down in February 2011 , and launched on 4 July 2012 . Delivery to Australia for fitting out at BAE Systems Australia 's facilities in Victoria was scheduled for 2013 , but did not occur until early 2014 . Despite construction delays and predictions the ship was commissioned in December 2015 .",
  "/wiki/Canberra-class_landing_helicopter_dock": "The Canberra class is a ship class of two landing helicopter dock ( LHD ) ships built for the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . Planning to upgrade the navy 's amphibious fleet began in 2000 , based on Australian experiences leading the International Force for East Timor peacekeeping operation . With a new climate for growing Australian Navy spending , a desire existed for forward defence capability for landing and supporting troops on Asian territory , that had never existed in Australian history , even with the old Majestic-class light fleet carriers , HMAS Melbourne and HMAS Sydney in the 1970s . In 2004 , French company Direction des Constructions Navales ( DCN ) and Spanish company Navantia were invited to tender proposals , with DCN offering the Mistral-class amphibious assault ship and Navantia proposing the Buque de Proyecci\u00f3n Estrat\u00e9gica design ( later commissioned as Juan Carlos I ) . The Spanish design was selected in 2007 , with Navantia responsible for construction of the ships from the keel to the flight deck , and BAE Systems Australia handling the fabrication of the superstructure and fitting out . Construction of the first ship , HMAS Canberra , commenced in late 2008 , with the hull launched in early 2011 , and sea trials in early 2014 . Canberra was commissioned in November 2014 . Work on the second vessel , HMAS Adelaide , started in early 2010 . Adelaide was commissioned in December 2015 . They are the largest vessels ever operated by the RAN , with a displacement of 27,500 tonnes ( 27,100 long tons ; 30,300 short tons ) . The ships are home-ported at Fleet Base East in Sydney ( which has prompted complaints from nearby residents about machinery noise , exhaust fumes , and blocked views ) and will regularly operate out of Townsville , the location of Lavarack Barracks , home of the Australian Army 's 3rd Brigade . In addition to being located in North Queensland close to Asia and the Pacific Islands , one of the 3rd Brigade 's infantry battalions , the 2nd Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( 2 RAR ) , was selected to become the Army 's specialist amphibious infantry battalion .",
  "/wiki/HMAS_Anzac_(D59)": "HMAS Anzac ( D59 ) was a Battle-class destroyer of the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . Named after the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps , the destroyer was commissioned in 1951 . The ship served on two tours of duty during the Korean War , and attempts to distinguish herself from British ships led to the practice of red kangaroo symbols on Australian warships . During 1956 , Anzac served during the Malayan Emergency . In 1960 , a malfunction in the destroyer 's gun direction equipment caused Anzac to fire directly on sister ship HMAS Tobruk during a gunnery exercise , with Tobruk left unrepairable . In 1961 , the destroyer was reclassified as a training vessel . Anzac remained in service until 1974 , and was sold for breaking a year later .",

Built in three groups , the first group were ordered under the 1942 naval estimates . A modified second and third group , together with two ships of an extended design were planned for the 1943 and 1944 estimates . Most of these ships were cancelled when it became apparent that the war was being won and the ships would not be required , although two ships of the third group , ordered for the RAN , were not cancelled and were subsequently completed in Australia . Seven Battles were commissioned before the end of World War II , but only Barfleur saw action , with the British Pacific Fleet .",
  "/wiki/HMAS_Anzac_(FFH_150)": "HMAS Anzac ( FFH 150 ) is the lead ship of the Anzac-class frigates in use with the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) and the Royal New Zealand Navy ( RNZN ) . Entering Australian service in 1996 , the frigate operated as part of the INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce in 1999 . In 2003 , she was involved in the Battle of Al Faw , and became the first RAN ship to fire in anger since the Vietnam War . The ship is operational as of 2018 .",
  "/wiki/Anzac-class_frigate": "The Anzac class ( also identified as the ANZAC class and the MEKO 200 ANZ type ) is a ship class of ten frigates ; eight operated by the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) and two operated by the Royal New Zealand Navy ( RNZN ) . During the 1980s , the RAN began plans to replace the River-class destroyer escorts ( based on the British Leander Class ) with a mid-capability patrol frigate , and settled on the idea of modifying a proven foreign design for Australian conditions . Around the same time , the RNZN was seeking to replace their Leander-class frigates while maintaining blue-water capabilities . A souring of relations between New Zealand and the United States of America in relation to New Zealand 's nuclear-free zone and the ANZUS security treaty prompted New Zealand to seek improved ties with other nations , particularly Australia . As both nations were seeking warships of similar capabilities , the decision was made in 1987 to collaborate on their acquisition . The project name ( and later , the class name ) is taken from the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps of the First World War . Twelve ship designs were tendered in 1986 . By 1989 , the project had selected a proposal by Germany 's Blohm + Voss , based on their MEKO 200 design , to be built in Australia by AMECON at Williamstown , Victoria . The modular design of the frigates allowed sections to be constructed at Whangarei , New Zealand and Newcastle , New South Wales in addition to Williamstown . The RAN ordered eight ships , while the RNZN ordered two and had the option to add two more . The frigate acquisition was controversial and widely opposed in New Zealand , and as a result , the additional ships were not ordered . In 1992 , work started on the frigates ; 3,600-tonne ( 3,500-long-ton ) ships capable of a 27-knot ( 50 km/h ; 31 mph ) top speed , and a range of 6,000 nautical miles ( 11,000 km ; 6,900 mi ) at 18 knots ( 33 km/h ; 21 mph ) .",

  "/wiki/Bathurst-class_corvette": "The Bathurst-class corvettes were a class of general purpose vessels produced in Australia during World War II . Originally classified as minesweepers , but widely referred to as corvettes , the Bathurst-class vessels fulfilled a broad anti-submarine , anti-mine , and convoy escort role . Sixty Bathurst-class corvettes were built in eight Australian shipyards to an Australian design . 36 were constructed for the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , 20 were built on British Admiralty orders but manned and commissioned by the RAN , and 4 served in the Royal Indian Navy . Three more were ordered for construction in India , but were cancelled . Although designed for the anti-submarine and anti-mine role , the Bathursts operated as maids-of-all-work during the war ; serving as troop and supply transports , supporting amphibious landings , providing air defence for convoys and disabled ships , participating in shore bombardments , and undertaking hydrographic surveys . Three ships were lost during the war - one to Japanese air attack and two to collisions with friendly merchant ships - while a fourth struck a friendly mine while sweeping the Great Barrier Reef in 1947 and sank . After the war , the Admiralty ships were sold to the Turkish Navy , Royal Netherlands Navy , and civilian operators , while several RAN-owned vessels were transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy , temporarily reactivated to facilitate National Service Training , or sold to civilians . Four of the Netherlands Bathursts were sold onward to the Indonesian Navy , one of which was destroyed in 1956 by rebels opposing the 'Guided Democracy ' political system . The rest of the RAN and Admiralty ships were sold for scrap to help fund other projects . Two vessels are preserved as museum ships .",
