  "/wiki/German_battleship_Tirpitz": "Tirpitz was the second of two Bismarck-class battleships built for Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine ( navy ) during World War II . Named after Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz , the architect of the Kaiserliche Marine ( Imperial Navy ) , the ship was laid down at the Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven in November 1936 and her hull was launched two and a half years later . Work was completed in February 1941 , when she was commissioned into the German fleet . Like her sister ship Bismarck , Tirpitz was armed with a main battery of eight 38-centimetre ( 15 in ) guns in four twin turrets . After a series of wartime modifications she was 2000 tonnes heavier than Bismarck , making her the heaviest battleship ever built by a European navy . After completing sea trials in early 1941 , Tirpitz briefly served as the centrepiece of the Baltic Fleet , which was intended to prevent a possible break-out attempt by the Soviet Baltic Fleet . In early 1942 , the ship sailed to Norway to act as a deterrent against an Allied invasion . While stationed in Norway , Tirpitz was also intended to be used to intercept Allied convoys to the Soviet Union , and two such missions were attempted in 1942 . This was the only feasible role for her , since the St Nazaire Raid had made operations against the Atlantic convoy lanes too risky . Tirpitz acted as a fleet in being , forcing the British Royal Navy to retain significant naval forces in the area to contain the battleship . In September 1943 , Tirpitz , along with the battleship Scharnhorst , bombarded Allied positions on Spitzbergen , the only time the ship used her main battery in an offensive role . Shortly thereafter , the ship was damaged in an attack by British mini-submarines and subsequently subjected to a series of large-scale air raids .",
  "/wiki/Bismarck-class_battleship": "The Bismarck class was a pair of fast battleships built for Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine shortly before the outbreak of World War II . The ships were the largest and most powerful warships built for the Kriegsmarine ; displacing more than 41,000 metric tons ( 40,000 long tons ) normally , they were armed with a battery of eight 38 cm ( 15 in ) guns and were capable of a top speed of 30 knots ( 56 km/h ; 35 mph ) . Bismarck was laid down in July 1936 and completed in September 1940 , while her sister Tirpitz 's keel was laid in October 1936 and work finished in February 1941 . The ships were ordered in response to the French Richelieu-class battleships and they were designed with the traditional role of engaging enemy battleships in home waters in mind , though the German naval command envisioned employing the ships as long-range commerce raiders against British shipping in the Atlantic Ocean . As such , their design represented strategic confusion that dominated German naval construction in the 1930s . Both ships had short service careers . Bismarck conducted only one operation , Operation Rhein\u00fcbung , a sortie into the North Atlantic to raid supply convoys sent from North America to Great Britain . During the operation , she destroyed the British battlecruiser HMS Hood and damaged the new battleship Prince of Wales in the Battle of the Denmark Strait . Bismarck was defeated and sunk in a final engagement after a three-day chase by the Royal Navy . Disagreements over the cause of the sinking persist with chiefly British sources claiming responsibility for the sinking of the ship . Evidence reviewed by Robert Ballard and James Cameron indicates that her loss was most likely due to scuttling as originally claimed by her surviving crew-members . Tirpitz 's career was less dramatic ; she operated in the Baltic Sea briefly in 1941 before being sent to Norwegian waters in 1942 , where she acted as a fleet in being , threatening the convoys from Britain to the Soviet Union .",
  "/wiki/German_cruiser_Admiral_Hipper": "Admiral Hipper , the first of five ships of her class , was the lead ship of the Admiral Hipper class of heavy cruisers which served with Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine during World War II . The ship was laid down at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg in July 1935 and launched February 1937 ; Admiral Hipper entered service shortly before the outbreak of war , in April 1939 . The ship was named after Admiral Franz von Hipper , commander of the German battlecruiser squadron during the Battle of Jutland in 1916 and later commander-in-chief of the German High Seas Fleet . She was armed with a main battery of eight 20.3 cm ( 8.0 in ) guns and , although nominally under the 10,000-long-ton ( 10,000 t ) limit set by the Anglo-German Naval Agreement , actually displaced over 16,000 long tons ( 16,000 t ) . Admiral Hipper saw a significant amount of action during the war , notably present during the Battle of the Atlantic . She led the assault on Trondheim during Operation Weser\u00fcbung ; while en route to her objective , she sank the British destroyer HMS Glowworm . In December 1940 , she broke out into the Atlantic Ocean to operate against Allied merchant shipping , though this operation ended without significant success . In February 1941 , Admiral Hipper sortied again , sinking several merchant vessels before eventually returning to Germany via the Denmark Strait . The ship was then transferred to northern Norway to participate in operations against convoys to the Soviet Union , culminating in the Battle of the Barents Sea on 31 December 1942 , where she sank the destroyer Achates and the minesweeper Bramble but was in turn damaged and forced to withdraw by the light cruisers HMS Sheffield and HMS Jamaica . Disappointed by the failure to sink merchant ships in that battle , Adolf Hitler ordered the majority of the surface warships scrapped , though Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz was able to persuade Hitler to retain the surface fleet . As a result , Admiral Hipper was returned to Germany and decommissioned for repairs . The ship was never restored to operational status , however , and on 3 May 1945 , Royal Air Force bombers severely damaged her while she was in Kiel .",
  "/wiki/Admiral_Hipper-class_cruiser": "The Admiral Hipper class was a group of five heavy cruisers built by Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine beginning in the mid-1930s . The class comprised Admiral Hipper , the lead ship , Bl\u00fccher , Prinz Eugen , Seydlitz , and L\u00fctzow . Only the first three ships of the class saw action with the German Navy during World War II . Work on Seydlitz stopped when she was approximately 95 percent complete ; it was decided to convert her into an aircraft carrier , but this was not completed either . L\u00fctzow was sold incomplete to the Soviet Union in 1940 . Admiral Hipper and Bl\u00fccher took part in Operation Weser\u00fcbung , the invasion of Norway in April 1940 . Bl\u00fccher was sunk by Norwegian coastal defenses outside Oslo while Admiral Hipper led the attack on Trondheim . She then conducted sorties into the Atlantic to attack Allied merchant shipping . In 1942 , she was deployed to northern Norway to attack shipping to the Soviet Union , culminating in the Battle of the Barents Sea in December 1942 , where she was damaged by British cruisers . Prinz Eugen saw her first action during Operation Rhein\u00fcbung with the battleship Bismarck . She eventually returned to Germany during the Channel Dash in 1942 , after which she too went to Norway . After being torpedoed by a British submarine , she returned to Germany for repairs .",

The ship was named after the First World War German naval officer Friedrich Ihn . At the beginning of World War II , the ship was initially deployed to blockade the Polish coast , but she was quickly transferred to the German Bight to lay defensive minefields in German waters . In late 1939 and early 1940 , the ship laid multiple offensive minefields off the English coast that claimed 18 merchant ships and a destroyer . Ihn was under repair during the Norwegian Campaign of early 1940 and was transferred to France later that year . After a lengthy refit in Germany , she returned to France in early 1941 where she escorted returning warships , commerce raiders , and supply ships through the Bay of Biscay for several months . She remained in Germany for the rest of the year after returning in July . The ship was transferred to France in early 1942 to escort the capital ships as they sailed through the English Channel to return to Germany ( the Channel Dash ) . Ihn was then transferred to Norway where she participated in several unsuccessful attacks on convoys to the Soviet Union . Afterwards she returned to Germany and remained there for the rest of the year . The ship spent most of 1943 in the northern Norway although she was mostly inactive because of fuel shortages . Ihn was ordered home for a long refit late in the year and she was sent to southern Norway upon its completion in mid-1944 .",
  "/wiki/German_World_War_II_destroyers": "At the outbreak of the Second World War Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine had 21 destroyers ( Ger : Zerst\u00f6rer ) in service , while another one was just being completed . These 22 vessels - comprising 3 classes ( Type 34 , 34A and 36 ) - had all been built in the 1930s , making them modern vessels ( no destroyers remained in German hands following the close of the First World War ) . [ note 1 ] Including that final pre-war vessel , a further 19 were brought into service during the war and more were captured from opposing navies , including the Italian Navy ( Regia Marina ) after the Italian Armistice with the Allies in 1943 . German destroyer classes were generally known by the year of their design . Because of their size , use and weaponry , some vessels classified as fleet torpedo boats , Flottentorpedoboot , are also described . During World War II , destroyers were administratively grouped into one of several destroyer flotillas . Class general characteristics are taken from the first of each class , and may differ slightly for individual ships , particularly when they were refitted . Post-war , some surviving ships had significant changes to armament .",

In late 1939 the ship laid multiple offensive minefields off the English coast that claimed nine merchant ships and she crippled a British destroyer during one of these missions . Hans Lody was under repair for most of the Norwegian Campaign and was transferred to France in late 1940 where she participated in several engagements with British ships , crippling another destroyer . The ship returned to Germany in late 1940 for a refit and was transferred to Norway in June 1941 as part of the preparations for Operation Barbarossa , the German invasion of the Soviet Union . Hans Lody spent some time at the beginning of the campaign conducting anti-shipping patrols in Soviet waters , but these were generally fruitless . She escorted a number of German convoys in the Arctic later in the year before returning to Germany in September for machinery repairs . The ship returned to Norway in mid-1942 , but was badly damaged when she ran aground in July and did not return until April 1943 . Hans Lody participated in the German attack ( Operation Zitronella ) on the Norwegian island of Spitzbergen , well north of the Arctic Circle and then spent the next six months on convoy duties in southern Norway .

She covered her sister ships over the next few months as they laid offensive minefields in English waters in late 1939-early 1940 . She participated in the early stages of the Norwegian Campaign by transporting troops to the Trondheim area in early April 1940 and was transferred to France later that year where the ship covered another minelaying sortie before engine problems caused her to return to Germany in November for repairs . Theodor Riedel was badly damaged when she ran aground three days after her repairs were completed and was out of action until May 1942 . The ship was transferred to Norway in 1942 and ran aground yet again as she prepared to attack one of the convoys to Russia in July . Repairs were completed in December and Theodor Riedel participated in the Battle of the Barents Sea at the end of the year and in the German attack on Spitzbergen in mid-1943 .

They began escorting convoys and minelayers as they laid their minefields in the North Sea and English Channel in July . Most of the boats were transferred to Norway in November where they made an unsuccessful attempt to attack shipping along the Scottish coast that saw one boat sunk . They were all refitted in early 1941 and nearly half the class was deployed afterwards in the Baltic Sea where they supported German operations after Operation Barbarossa began in June . Four of the boats were placed in reserve at one point or another during the year because of manpower shortages , something that would happen in 1942 as well .

Despite violating the weight limit , the design for the ships incorporated several radical innovations to save weight . They were the first major warships to use welding and all-diesel propulsion . Due to their heavy armament of six 28 cm ( 11 in ) guns and lighter weight , the British began referring to the vessels as pocket battleships . The Deutschland-class ships were initially classified as Panzerschiffe but the Kriegsmarine reclassified them as heavy cruisers in February 1940 . The three ships were built between 1929 and 1936 by the Deutsche Werke in Kiel and the Reichsmarinewerft in Wilhelmshaven , seeing much service with the German Navy . All three vessels served on non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War . While on patrol , Deutschland was attacked by Republican bombers , and in response , Admiral Scheer bombarded the port of Almer\u00eda . In 1937 , Admiral Graf Spee represented Germany at the Coronation Review for Britain 's King George VI . For the rest of their peacetime careers , the ships conducted a series of fleet maneuvers in the Atlantic and visited numerous foreign ports in goodwill tours .
