  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Croatia_(Habsburg)": "The Kingdom of Croatia ( Croatian : Kraljevina Hrvatska ; Latin : Regnum Croatiae Hungarian : Horv\u00e1t Kir\u00e1lys\u00e1g German : K\u00f6nigreich Kroatien ) was part of the Habsburg Monarchy that existed between 1527 and 1868 ( also known between 1804 and 1867 as the Austrian Empire ) , as well as a part of the Lands of the Hungarian Crown , but was subject to direct Imperial Austrian rule for significant periods of time , including its final years . Its capital was Zagreb . Until the 18th century , the Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia included only a small north-western part of present-day Croatia around Zagreb , and a small strip of coastland around Rijeka that was not part of the Ottoman Empire or part of the Habsburg Military Frontier . Between 1744 and 1868 the Kingdom of Croatia included a subordinate autonomous kingdom , the Kingdom of Slavonia . The territory of the Slavonian kingdom was recovered from the Ottoman Empire , and was subsequently part of the Habsburg Military Frontier for a period . In 1744 these territories were organized as the Kingdom of Slavonia and included within the Kingdom of Croatia as an autonomous part . In 1868 both were merged again into the newly formed Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia .",
  "/wiki/Habsburg_Monarchy": "Habsburg Monarchy ( or Habsburg Empire ) is an umbrella term used by historians for the lands and kingdoms of the House of Habsburg , especially for those of the Austrian line . Although from 1438 until 1806 ( with the exception of 1742-1745 ) the head of the House of Habsburg was also Holy Roman Emperor , the Empire itself is not considered a part of the Habsburg Monarchy . The formation of the Habsburg Monarchy began with the election of Rudolf I as King of Germany in 1273 and his acquisition of the Duchy of Austria for his house in 1282 . In 1482 , Maximilian I acquired the Netherlands through marriage . Both these territories lay within the Empire and passed to his grandson and successor , Charles V , who also inherited Spain and its colonies and ruled the Habsburg Empire at its greatest territorial extent . The abdication of Charles V in 1556 led to a broad division of the Habsburg holdings between his brother Ferdinand I , who was his deputy in the Austrian lands since 1521 and the elected king of Hungary and Bohemia since 1526 , and his son Philip II of Spain . The Spanish branch ( which also held the Netherlands , Burgundy and lands in Italy ) went extinct in 1700 . The Austrian branch ( which also had the Imperial throne and ruled Hungary , Bohemia and all the crowns entailed to them ) was itself divided between different branches of the family from 1564 until 1665 , but thereafter it remained a single personal union . The Habsburg monarchy was thus a union of crowns - with no single constitution or shared institutions outside of the Habsburg court itself - composed of territories within and outside the Holy Roman Empire , united only in the person of the monarch . The dynastic composite entities were the most dominant on the European continent in the early modern era . This gradually changed in the early 19th century . From 1804 to 1867 the Habsburg Monarchy was formally unified as the Austrian Empire , and from 1867 to 1918 as the Austro-Hungarian Empire.It collapsed following defeat in the First World War .",
  "/wiki/Ottoman_wars_in_Europe": "The Ottoman wars in Europe were a series of military conflicts between the Ottoman Empire and various European states dating from the Late Middle Ages up through the early 20th century . The earliest conflicts began during the Byzantine-Ottoman wars , waged in Anatolia in the late 13th century before entering Europe in the mid 14th century , followed by the Bulgarian-Ottoman wars and the Serbian-Ottoman wars waged beginning in the mid 14th century . Much of this period was characterized by Ottoman expansion into the Balkans . The Ottoman Empire made further inroads into Central Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries , culminating in the peak of Ottoman territorial claims in Europe . The Ottoman-Venetian Wars spanned four centuries , starting in 1423 and lasting until 1718 . This period witnessed the fall of Negroponte in 1470 , the fall of Famagusta ( Cyprus ) in 1571 , the defeat of the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571 ( at that time the largest naval battle in history ) , the fall of Candia ( Crete ) in 1669 , the Venetian reconquest of Morea ( Peloponnese ) in the 1680s and its loss again in 1715 . The island of Corfu under Venetian rule remained the only Greek island not conquered by the Ottomans . In the late seventeenth century , European powers began to consolidate against the Ottomans and formed the Holy League , reversing a number of Ottoman land gains during the Great Turkish War of 1683-99 . Nevertheless , Ottoman armies were able to hold their own against their European rivals until the second half of the eighteenth century . In the nineteenth century the Ottomans were confronted with insurrection from their Serbian ( 1804-1817 ) and Greek ( 1821-1832 ) subjects . This occurred in tandem with the Russo-Turkish wars , which further destabilized the empire . The final retreat of Ottoman rule came with the First Balkan War ( 1912-1913 ) , followed by the signing of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres at the close of World War I .",
  "/wiki/Little_War_in_Hungary": "Habsburg-Ottoman wars in Hungary , from 1526 to 1568 , were wars between the Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire , waged on the territory of the Kingdom of Hungary and several adjacent lands in Southeastern Europe . The Habsburgs and the Ottomans engaged in a series of military campaigns against one another in Hungary between 1526 and 1568 . While overall the Ottomans had the upper hand , the war failed to produce any decisive result . The Ottoman army remained very powerful in the open field but it often lost a significant amount of time besieging the many fortresses of the Hungarian frontier and its communication lines were now dangerously overstretched . At the end of the conflict , Hungary had been split into several different zones of control , between the Ottomans , Habsburgs , and Transylvania , an Ottoman vassal state .",

It emerged as the rank of field marshal ( German : Feldmarschall ) came to be used for the highest army commander in the 17th century ( having originally been the equivalent of a cavalry colonel ) . In German-speaking countries the commander-in-chief usually appointed an under marshal ( Untermarschall ) or lieutenant field marshal to support and represent the field marshal .

  "/wiki/French_Revolutionary_Wars": "The French Revolutionary Wars were a series of sweeping military conflicts lasting from 1792 until 1802 and resulting from the French Revolution . They pitted France against Great Britain , Austria , Prussia , Russia and several other monarchies . They are divided in two periods : the War of the First Coalition ( 1792-97 ) and the War of the Second Coalition ( 1798-1802 ) . Initially confined to Europe , the fighting gradually assumed a global dimension . After a decade of constant warfare and aggressive diplomacy , France had conquered a wide array of territories , from the Italian Peninsula and the Low Countries in Europe to the Louisiana Territory in North America . French success in these conflicts ensured the spread of revolutionary principles over much of Europe . As early as 1791 , the other monarchies of Europe looked with outrage at the revolution and its upheavals ; and they considered whether they should intervene , either in support of King Louis XVI , to prevent the spread of revolution , or to take advantage of the chaos in France . Anticipating an attack [ citation needed ] , France declared war on Prussia and Austria in the spring of 1792 and they responded with a coordinated invasion that was eventually turned back at the Battle of Valmy in September . This victory emboldened the National Convention to abolish the monarchy . A series of victories by the new French armies abruptly ended with defeat at Neerwinden in the spring of 1793 . The French suffered additional defeats in the remainder of the year and these difficult times allowed the Jacobins to rise to power and impose the Reign of Terror to unify the nation . In 1794 , the situation improved dramatically for the French as huge victories at Fleurus against the Austrians and at the Black Mountain against the Spanish signaled the start of a new stage in the wars .",
  "/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars": "The Napoleonic Wars ( 1803-1815 ) were a series of major conflicts pitting the French Empire and its allies , led by Napoleon I , against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions , financed and usually led by the United Kingdom . The wars stemmed from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and its resultant conflict . The wars are often categorised into five conflicts , each termed after the coalition that fought Napoleon : the Third Coalition ( 1805 ) , the Fourth ( 1806-07 ) , the Fifth ( 1809 ) , the Sixth ( 1813 ) , and the Seventh ( 1815 ) . Napoleon , upon ascending to First Consul of France in 1799 , had inherited a chaotic republic ; he subsequently created a state with stable finances , a strong bureaucracy , and a well-trained army . In 1805 , Austria and Russia started the Third Coalition and waged war against France . In response , Napoleon defeated the allied Russo-Austrian army at Austerlitz in December 1805 , which is considered his greatest victory . At sea , the British severely defeated the joint Franco-Spanish navy in the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805 . This victory secured British control of the seas and prevented the invasion of Britain itself . Concerned about increasing French power , Prussia led the creation of the Fourth Coalition with Russia , Saxony and Sweden , and the resumption of war in October 1806 . Napoleon quickly defeated the Prussians in Jena and the Russians in Friedland , bringing an uneasy peace to the continent . The peace failed , though , as war broke out in 1809 , when the badly prepared Fifth Coalition , led by Austria , was quickly defeated in Wagram . Hoping to isolate Britain economically , Napoleon launched an invasion of Portugal , the only remaining British ally in continental Europe .",

  "/wiki/Seven_Years'_War": "The Seven Years ' War was a global war fought between 1756 and 1763 . It involved all five European great powers of the time plus many of the middle powers and spanned five continents , affecting Europe , the Americas , West Africa , India , and the Philippines . The conflict split Europe into two coalitions : one was led by the Kingdom of Great Britain and included the Kingdom of Prussia , the Kingdom of Portugal , the Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg ( also named Hanover ) , and a few other small German states ; while the other was led by the Kingdom of France and included the Austrian-led Holy Roman Empire , including the Electorate of Saxony and most of the smaller German states , the Russian Empire ( until 1762 ) , the Kingdom of Spain , and Sweden . The Dutch Republic , Denmark-Norway , the Italian States , and the Ottoman Empire did not participate . Meanwhile , in India , some regional polities within the increasingly fragmented Mughal Empire , with the support of the French , failed to defeat a British attempt to conquer Bengal . Although Anglo-French skirmishes over their American colonies had begun in 1754 , with what became known in the United States as the French and Indian War , the large-scale conflict that drew in most of the European powers was centered on Austria 's desire to recover Silesia from Prussia . Seeing the opportunity to curtail Britain 's and Prussia 's ever-growing might , France and Austria put aside their ancient rivalry to form a grand coalition of their own , bringing most of the other European powers to their side . Faced with this sudden turn of events , Britain aligned itself with Prussia , in a series of political manoeuvres known as the Diplomatic Revolution . However , French efforts ended in failure when the Anglo-Prussian coalition prevailed , and Britain 's rise as among the world 's predominant powers destroyed France 's supremacy in Europe , thus altering the European balance of power .",
  "/wiki/War_of_the_Bavarian_Succession": "The War of the Bavarian Succession ( German : Bayerischer Erbfolgekrieg ; 3 July 1778 - 21 May 1779 ) was a dispute between the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy and an alliance of Saxony and Prussia over succession to the Electorate of Bavaria after the extinction of its ruling House of Wittelsbach . The Habsburgs sought to acquire Bavaria , and the alliance opposed them , favoring another branch of the Wittelsbachs . Both sides mobilized large armies , but the only fighting in the war was a few minor skirmishes . However , thousands of soldiers died from disease and starvation , earning the conflict the name Kartoffelkrieg ( Potato War ) in Prussia and Saxony ; in Habsburg Austria , it was sometimes called the Zwetschgenrummel ( Plum Fuss ) . On 30 December 1777 , Maximilian Joseph , the last of the junior line of Wittelsbach , died of smallpox , leaving no children . Charles IV Theodore , a scion of a senior branch of the House of Wittelsbach , held the closest claim of kinship , but he also had no legitimate children to succeed him . His cousin , Charles II August , Duke of Zweibr\u00fccken , therefore had a legitimate legal claim as Charles Theodore 's heir presumptive . Across Bavaria 's southern border , Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II coveted the Bavarian territory and had married Maximilian Joseph 's sister Maria Josepha in 1765 to strengthen any claim he could extend . His agreement with the heir , Charles Theodore , to partition the territory neglected any claims of the heir presumptive , Charles August . Acquiring territory in the German-speaking states was an essential part of Joseph 's policy to expand his family 's influence in Central Europe . For Frederick the Great , Joseph 's claim threatened the Prussian ascendancy in German politics , but he questioned whether he should preserve the status quo through war , diplomacy , or trade . Empress Maria Theresa , who co-ruled with Joseph , considered any conflict over the Bavarian electorate not worth bloodshed , and neither she nor Frederick saw any point in pursuing hostilities .",

It was formed when the Austrian Empire adopted a new constitution ; as a result Austria ( Cisleithania ) and Hungary ( Transleithania ) were placed on equal footing . It dissolved when its member states proclaimed sovereignty and independence following the First World War . The union was established by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 on 30 March 1867 in the aftermath of the Austro-Prussian War . It consisted of two monarchies ( Austria and Hungary ) , and one autonomous region : the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia under the Hungarian crown , which negotiated the Croatian-Hungarian Settlement in 1868 . It was ruled by the House of Habsburg , and constituted the last phase in the constitutional evolution of the Habsburg Monarchy . Following the 1867 reforms , the Austrian and Hungarian states were co-equal in power . Foreign and military affairs came under joint oversight , but all other governmental faculties were divided between respective states . Austria-Hungary was a multinational state and one of Europe 's major powers at the time . Austria-Hungary was geographically the second-largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire , at 621,538 km2 ( 239,977 sq mi ) , and the third-most populous ( after Russia and the German Empire ) .

  "/wiki/World_War_I": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",
