The columns were made in Savannah and the mirrors and cornices were made in England . Fine furniture and imported curtains came from New York City and Chicago . The 24 foot by 35 foot banquet room and the old stone kitchen were located in a separate building connected to the main home by a breezeway . The last Anderson to live in the home was Miss Pink Anderson . This was during the Great Depression and there was no money to maintain the home . The formal gardens and fountain were long gone and vines and undergrowth had taken over . The home sat empty for many years until it was purchased in 1962 by Ernest Walker who painted and remodeled the home . The roof of the old kitchen and dining room had fallen in , with only the 16-18 walls standing , and was demolished .",
