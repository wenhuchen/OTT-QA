From the selection of a host city in a neutral country to the exclusion of Japan and Germany , the political atmosphere of the post-war world was inescapable during the Games . The organizing committee faced several challenges due to the lack of financial and human resources consumed by the war . These were the first of two winter Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Sigfrid Edstr\u00f6m . There were 28 nations that marched in the opening ceremonies on January 30 , 1948 .

Notable performances were turned in by figure skaters Dick Button and Barbara Ann Scott and skier Henri Oreiller .
