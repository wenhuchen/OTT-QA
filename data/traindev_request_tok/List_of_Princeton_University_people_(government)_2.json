The title is commonly rendered in English as Mayor of Mexico City or ( less frequently ) as Governor of the Federal District ( as the position was known in the early post-Revolution years ) , but in reality the position does not correspond exactly to either the mayor of a municipality ( presidente municipal ) or the governor of a state ( gobernador ) as they are understood in Mexican law .

  "/wiki/U.S._Secretary_of_Defense": "The secretary of defense ( SecDef ) is the leader and chief executive officer of the United States Department of Defense , the executive department of the Armed Forces of the U.S . The secretary of defense 's position of command and authority over the U.S. military is second only to that of the president . This position corresponds to what is generally known as a defense minister in many other countries . The secretary of defense is appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate , and is by custom a member of the Cabinet and by law a member of the National Security Council . The secretary of defense is a statutory office , and the general provision in 10 U.S.C . \u00a7 113 provides that subject to the direction of the President , its occupant has authority , direction and control over the Department of Defense . The same statute further designates the secretary as the principal assistant to the President in all matters relating to the Department of Defense . To ensure civilian control of the military , no one may be appointed as the secretary of defense within seven years of serving as a commissioned officer of a regular ( i.e. , non-reserve ) component of an armed force . Subject only to the orders of the president , the secretary of defense is in the chain of command and exercises command and control , for both operational and administrative purposes , over all Department of Defense forces - the Army , Marine Corps , Navy , and Air Force - as well as the U.S. Coast Guard when its command and control is transferred to the Department of Defense . Only the secretary of defense ( or the president or Congress ) can authorize the transfer of operational control of forces between the three military departments ( the departments of the Army , Navy , and Air Force ) and the 10 Combatant Commands ( Africa Command , Central Command , European Command , Indo-Pacific Command , Northern Command , Southern Command , Cyber Command , Special Operations Command , Strategic Command , Transportation Command ) . Because the Office of Secretary of Defense is vested with legal powers that exceed those of any commissioned officer , and is second only to the president in the military hierarchy , its incumbent has sometimes unofficially been referred to as a de facto deputy commander-in-chief . ( The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the principal military adviser to the secretary of defense and the president , and while the chairman may assist the secretary and president in their command functions , the chairman is not in the chain of command . )",

The state seceded and was part of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War , after which it had several governors appointed by the President of the United States and the military occupation . During Reconstruction , it had two Republican governors , but after local rule was re-established , Democrats would be the only party elected for the next 131 years . The longest-serving governors are George Busbee , Joe Frank Harris , Zell Miller , Sonny Perdue , and Nathan Deal , each of whom served two full four-year terms ; Joseph E.
