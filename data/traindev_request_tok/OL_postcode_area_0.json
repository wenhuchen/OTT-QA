  "/wiki/Chadderton": "Chadderton ( pop . 34,818 ) is a town within the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham , in Greater Manchester , England . It lies along the course of the River Irk and the Rochdale Canal , on undulating land in the foothills of the Pennines , 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) west of Oldham , 4.5 miles ( 7.2 km ) south of Rochdale and 6 miles ( 9.7 km ) northeast of the city of Manchester . Historically part of Lancashire , Chadderton 's early history is marked by its status as a manorial township , with its own line of lords and overlords , who included the Asshetons , Chethams , Radclyffes and Traffords . Chadderton in the Middle Ages was chiefly distinguished by its two mansions , Foxdenton Hall and Chadderton Hall , and by the prestigious families who occupied them . Farming was the main industry of the area , with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the domestic system . Chadderton 's urbanisation and expansion largely coincided with developments in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution and the Victorian era . A late-19th-century factory-building boom transformed Chadderton from a rural township into a major mill town - one of several in its region - and the second most populous urban district in the United Kingdom . More than 50 cotton mills had been built in Chadderton by 1914 . Although Chadderton 's industries declined during the mid-20th century , the town continued to grow as a result of suburbanisation and urban renewal . The legacy of the town 's industrial past remains visible in its landscape of red-brick cotton mills , now used as warehouses or distribution centres . Some of these are listed buildings because of their architectural , historical and cultural significance .",

It is the administrative centre of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham , which had a population of 230,800 in 2015 . Historically in Lancashire , and with little early history to speak of , Oldham rose to prominence in the 19th century as an international centre of textile manufacture . It was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution , and among the first ever industrialised towns , rapidly becoming one of the most important centres of cotton and textile industries in England . At its zenith , it was the most productive cotton spinning mill town in the world , producing more cotton than France and Germany combined . Oldham 's textile industry fell into decline in the mid-20th century ; the town 's last mill closed in 1998 . The demise of textile processing in Oldham depressed and heavily affected the local economy . Today Oldham is a predominantly residential town , and the improvement of the town centre is the focus of a project for transforming Oldham into a centre for further education and the performing arts . It is , however , still distinguished architecturally by the surviving cotton mills and other buildings associated with that industry . As of 2001 , the town had a population of 103,544 and an area of around 26 square miles ( 67 km2 ) .",

The borough is named after its largest town , Oldham , but also includes the outlying towns of Chadderton , Failsworth , Royton and Shaw and Crompton , the village of Lees , and the parish of Saddleworth . Although a 20th-century creation , the borough has Neolithic , Bronze Age and Roman heritage . It encompasses several former mill towns , which expanded and coalesced during the late 19th century as a result of population growth and advances in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution . Although some parts contiguous with the city of Manchester are highly industrialised and densely populated , about two-thirds of the borough is composed of rural open space ; the eastern half stretches across the South Pennines . For its first 12 years the borough had a two-tier system of local government ; Oldham Council shared power with the Greater Manchester County Council . Since the Local Government Act 1985 Oldham Council has effectively been a unitary authority , serving as the sole executive , deliberative and legislative body responsible for local policy , setting council tax , and allocating budget in the district . The Metropolitan Borough of Oldham has two civil parishes and 20 electoral wards . Noted as one of the more unpopular amalgamations of territory created by local government reform in the 1970s , the Oldham borough underwent a \u00a3100,000 rebranding exercise in early 2008 . The town has no listed buildings with a Grade I rating , and the borough 's architecture has been described as mediocre . There have been calls for the borough to be renamed , but that possibility was dismissed during the rebranding of 2008 .",

Historically part of Lancashire , Royton and its surroundings have provided evidence of ancient British , Roman and Viking activity in the area . During the Middle Ages , Royton formed a small township centred on Royton Hall , a manor house owned by a long succession of dignitaries which included the Byrons and Radcliffes . A settlement expanded outwards from the hall which , by as late as 1780 , contained only a few straggling and mean-built cottages . Farming was the main industry of this rural area , with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the domestic system . Royton has the distinction of being the first town where a powered cotton mill was built ; at Thorp in 1764 , and is one of the first localities in the world to have adopted the factory system . The introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution facilitated a process of unplanned urbanisation in the area , and by the mid-19th century Royton had emerged as a mill town . At its zenith , there were 40 cotton mills - some of the largest in the United Kingdom - employing 80% of the local population . Imports of foreign cotton goods began the decline in Royton 's textile industry during the mid-20th century , and its last mill closed in 2002 . Today , fewer than a dozen mills are still standing , the majority of which are used for light engineering or as distribution centres . Despite an economic depression brought about by the demise of cotton spinning , Royton 's population has continued to grow as a result of intensive housing redevelopment which has modernised its former Edwardian districts .",

It is regularly referred to as Shaw . Historically in Lancashire , Crompton ( as it was originally known ) and its surroundings have provided evidence of ancient British and Anglian activity in the area . During the Middle Ages , Crompton formed a small township of scattered woods , farmsteads , moorland and swamp with a small and close community of families . The local lordship was weak or absent , and so Crompton failed to emerge as a manor with its own lord and court . Farming was the main industry of this broadly independent and self-supporting rural area , with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the domestic system . The introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution initiated a process of rapid and unplanned urbanisation . A building boom began in Crompton during the mid-19th century , when suitable land for factories in Oldham was becoming scarce . By the late 19th century Crompton had emerged as a densely populated mill town . Forty-eight cotton mills - some of the largest in the United Kingdom - have been recorded as existing in the area . At its spinning zenith , as a result of an interwar economic boom associated with the textile industry , Shaw and Crompton was reported to have had more millionaires per capita than any other town in the world .",

Evidence of Stone Age , Bronze Age , and Viking activity has been discovered in Ashton-under-Lyne . The Ashton part of the town 's name probably dates from the Anglo-Saxon period , and derives from Old English meaning settlement by ash trees . The origin of the under-Lyne suffix is less clear ; it possibly derives from the British lemo meaning elm or from Ashton 's proximity to the Pennines . In the Middle Ages , Ashton-under-Lyne was a parish and township and Ashton Old Hall was held by the de Asshetons , lords of the manor . Granted a Royal Charter in 1414 , the manor spanned a rural area consisting of marshland , moorland , and a number of villages and hamlets . Until the introduction of the cotton trade in 1769 , Ashton was considered bare , wet , and almost worthless . The factory system , and textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution triggered a process of unplanned urbanisation in the area , and by the mid-19th century Ashton had emerged as an important mill town at a convergence of newly constructed canals and railways . Ashton-under-Lyne 's transport network allowed for an economic boom in cotton spinning , weaving , and coal mining , which led to the granting of municipal borough status in 1847 .

It lies at the northern fringe of Rochdale , along the course of Buckley Brook , upon an eminence of ground by the South Pennines . It is 1.2 miles ( 1.9 km ) south-southwest of the village of Wardle and 1.3 miles ( 2.1 km ) north-northeast of Rochdale 's town centre . Buckley spans a watercourse , a prison , farmland and residential properties . Buckley emerged as a constituent community of the manor of Hundersfield following the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain . Although the name Buckley is of Old English derivation , the settlement 's medieval history is tied closely to a Norman family who were granted the estate as a gift for their services given in the Norman conquest of England ; they subsequently adopted the surname 'de Buckley ' . Members of the Buckleys of Buckley family appear throughout the High Middle Ages in legal charters related to Buckley , the surrounding area , and its manor house Buckley Hall . Throughout the Late Middle Ages and the Early Modern Period , Buckley was the principal estate of the township of Wardleworth . The Buckleys of Buckley Hall continued to hold positions of regional importance , such as priests , gentry and military officers , but their size and influence diminished through death and migration prompting the obsolescence of the Buckley estate . Industrialisation resulted in the neighbouring town of Rochdale to encroach on Buckley ; the area was absorbed into the Municipal Borough of Rochdale in the 1870s . Although continuously occupied and revamped during the 18th and 19th centuries , Buckley Hall became unoccupied in the 1880s . The Brothers of Charity , an institute of the Catholic Church , successfully agitated for the purchase of Buckley Hall and its conversion into an orphanage for Catholic boys .",

Multiple small craters can still be picked out on both hillsides , one of which contains the Summit Tunnel trans-Pennine railway line , which may have been an alternative target for a raid primarily aimed at the Manchester area ; its easterly Yorkshire end is less than \u00bc mile away . The road was quickly repaired , the canal was shored up with earth from the former floodplain of Walsden Water ( which is why the pitches are above the natural ground level ) and the whole bombing incident was hushed up .

In 2001 , Littleborough and its suburbs of Calderbrook , Shore and Smithy Bridge , had a population of 13,807 . Historically a part of Lancashire , Littleborough and its surroundings have provided evidence of Neolithic , Celtic , Roman and Anglo-Saxon activity in the area . During the Middle Ages , Littleborough was a hamlet in the manor of Hundersfield , parish of Rochdale and hundred of Salford . It was focussed upon the junction of two ancient routes over the Pennines - one of which may have been a Roman road - that joined to cross the River Roch . By 1472 , Littleborough consisted of a chapel , a cluster of cottages , and an inn , and its inhabitants were broadly farmers who were spurred to weave wool by merchants who passed between the markets at Rochdale and Halifax . When cotton was introduced as a base to make textiles , Littleborough experienced an influx of families , mostly from the neighbouring West Riding of Yorkshire . Affluent homes and estates were established on Littleborough 's fringes . In the late 18th century , the low-altitude Summit Gap between Littleborough and Walsden was approved as the best route over the Pennines for the Rochdale Canal and the Manchester to Leeds railway ; Hollingworth Lake was built at Littleborough 's south side as a feeder reservoir to regulate the waters of the canal . This infrastructure encouraged industrialists to modify Littleborough 's traditional handloom cloth workshops with a mechanised form of textile production . Attracted to the area 's natural resources and modern infrastructure , coal mining , engineering ventures and increasingly large textile mills contributed to Littleborough 's population growth and urbanisation , sealing its status as a mill town .",

Milnrow is adjacent to junction 21 of the M62 motorway , and includes the village of Newhey , and hamlets at Tunshill and Ogden . Historically in Lancashire , Milnrow during the Middle Ages was one of several hamlets in the township of Butterworth and parish of Rochdale . The settlement was named by the Anglo-Saxons , but the Norman conquest of England resulted in its ownership by minor Norman families , such as the Schofields and Cleggs . In the 15th century , their descendants successfully agitated for a chapel of ease by the banks of the River Beal , triggering its development as the main settlement in Butterworth . Milnrow was primarily used for marginal hill farming during the Middle Ages , and its population did not increase much until the dawn of the woollen trade in the 17th century . With the development of packhorse routes to emerging woollen markets in Yorkshire , the inhabitants of Milnrow adopted the domestic system , supplementing their income by fellmongering and producing flannel in their weavers ' cottages . Coal mining and metalworking also flourished in the Early Modern period , and the farmers , colliers and weavers formed a close-knit population of independent-minded workers . The hamlets of Butterworth coalesced around the commercial and ecclesiastical centre in Milnrow as demand for the area 's flannel grew .",
