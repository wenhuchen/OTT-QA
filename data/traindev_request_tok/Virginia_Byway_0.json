West Virginia was admitted to the Union on June 20 , 1863 , and was a key border state during the war . It was the only state to form by separating from a Confederate state , the first to separate from any state since Maine separated from Massachusetts , and was one of two states admitted to the Union during the American Civil War ( the other being Nevada ) . While a portion of its residents held slaves , most of the residents were yeoman farmers , and the delegates provided for gradual abolition of slavery in the new state Constitution . The Census Bureau and the Association of American Geographers classify West Virginia as part of the Southern United States . However , the Bureau of Labor Statistics classifies the state as a part of the Mid-Atlantic region .

  "/wiki/Gilberts_Corner,_VA": "Gilberts Corner is an unincorporated area at the intersection of U.S. Route 50 and U.S. Route 15 in Loudoun County , Virginia located in Aldie , east of the historic Village of Aldie . There are no residences at this intersection , however , its name is attributed to the surrounding area . Gilberts Corner is named after the gas station/restaurant that sits at the northeast quadrant of the crossroads . It gained prominence in the 1920s when the Carolina Road ( now Watson Road ) was a toll road and U.S. Route 15 was extended south from Leesburg to U.S. Route 50 . Due to increased traffic from toll evaders , U.S. Route 15 eventually was extended even farther south . The gas station/restaurant closed in the 1980s and is currently in the process of being renovated . Due to heavy traffic in the area , many commuters avoided the intersection altogether by going through Lenah and taking U.S. Route 15 south .",
