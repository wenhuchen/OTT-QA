The early sleds were adapted from boys ' delivery sleds and toboggans . These eventually evolved into bobsleighs , luges and skeletons . Initially the tourists would race their hand-built contraptions down the narrow streets of St. Moritz , however , as collisions increased growing opposition from St Moritz residents led to bobsledding being eventually banned from public highways . In the winter of 1884 , Badrutt had a purpose-built run constructed near the hamlet of Cresta . The Cresta Run remains the oldest in the world and is the home of the St. Moritz Tobogganing Club .
