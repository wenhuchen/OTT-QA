  "/wiki/John_Walker_(painter)": "John Walker ( born 1939 ) is an English painter and printmaker . He has been called one of the standout abstract painters of the last 50 years . Walker studied in Birmingham at the Moseley School of Art , and later the Birmingham School of Art and Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re in Paris . Some of his early work was inspired by abstract expressionism and post-painterly abstraction , and often combined apparently three-dimensional shapes with flatter elements . These pieces are usually rendered in acrylic paint . In the early 1970s , Walker made a series of large Blackboard Pieces using chalk first exhibited at the opening of Ikon Gallery , in Birmingham Shopping Centre , Birmingham in 1972 and the Juggernaut works which also use dry pigment . From the late 1970s , his work marked allusions to earlier painters , such as Francisco Goya , \u00c9douard Manet and Henri Matisse , either through the quoting of a pictorial motif , or the use of a particular technique . Also during this time , he began to use oil paint more in his work . His paintings of the 1970s are also notable for what has come to be termed canvas collage - the application of glued-on , separately painted patches of canvas to the main canvas ( see the external link below for an example and image ) . After spending some time in Australia , Walker got a position at the Victoria College of the Arts in Melbourne .

Her work draws from a range of sources , from myths to science , grappling with a plethora of unconventional , visceral materials that included chocolate , lambs tongues and rotting vegetable matter . Her skilled use of traditional fabrication methods and sophisticated technologies transform these unusual materials into complex installations . Maureen Paley noted that Helen was always talking about craftsmanship - a constant fount of information . Binary oppositions was a strong theme in Chadwick 's work ; seductive/repulsive , male/female , organic/man-made . Her combinations emphasise yet simultaneously dissolve the contrasts between them . Her gender representations forge a sense of ambiguity and a disquieting sexuality blurring the boundaries of ourselves as singular and stable beings .",

They are generally sombre and thickly impastoed , often set in unsettling interiors and urban landscapes .

He is reportedly the United Kingdom 's richest living artist , with his wealth valued at \u00a3215m in the 2010 Sunday Times Rich List . During the 1990s his career was closely linked with the collector Charles Saatchi , but increasing frictions came to a head in 2003 and the relationship ended . Death is a central theme in Hirst 's works . He became famous for a series of artworks in which dead animals ( including a shark , a sheep and a cow ) are preserved - sometimes having been dissected - in formaldehyde . The best-known of these was The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living , a 14-foot ( 4.3 m ) tiger shark immersed in formaldehyde in a clear display case . He has also made spin paintings , created on a spinning circular surface , and spot paintings , which are rows of randomly coloured circles created by his assistants . In September 2008 , Hirst made an unprecedented move for a living artist by selling a complete show , Beautiful Inside My Head Forever , at Sotheby 's by auction and bypassing his long-standing galleries . The auction raised \u00a3111 million ( $ 198 million ) , breaking the record for a one-artist auction as well as Hirst 's own record with \u00a310.3 million for The Golden Calf , an animal with 18-carat gold horns and hooves , preserved in formaldehyde .

  "/wiki/Steven_Pippin": "Steven Pippin ( born 1960 at Redhill , Surrey ) is an English artist . Pippin works with converted or improvised photographic equipment and kinetic sculptures . Pippin 's work shows a strong interest in the mechanical , which he has said stems from an early childhood memory of seeing his father surrounded by the wires and tubes of a television set he was repairing . Pippin 's early work was based on converting furniture and everyday objects into makeshift pinhole cameras which he then uses to take sympathetic photographs . Sympathetic photography as seen through photographer Allan Sekula ( 1951-2013 ) , is ethico-political orientation of sensitivity , receptivity , or exposure to bodily vulnerability and suffering . His work often involves a significant amount of planning to overcome the practical problems posed by the chosen object . Pippin typically has to plan and construct a significant amount of supporting equipment in order to achieve his pictures . Frequently the resulting photographs are distorted or otherwise compromised by the manner of their construction , but the imperfections are seen as an important characteristic of the image , giving a link back to the object which was used as a camera . The photographs are always shown alongside an image of the converted object , and for later works , much of the equipment used in the conversion along with supporting documentation . During the digital revolution in 1980 , Pippin began to make a name for himself . He chooses to take more pride in the process of creation than that of the end result . He is one of the many so called artist-engineers who find alternate uses for everyday objects .",

  "/wiki/Anya_Gallaccio": "Anya Gallaccio ( born 1963 ) is a British artist , who creates site-specific , minimalist installations and often works with organic matter ( including chocolate , sugar , flowers and ice ) . Her use of organic materials results in natural processes of transformation and decay , meaning that Gallaccio is unable to predict the end result of her installations . Something which at the start of an exhibition may be pleasurable , such as the scent of flowers or chocolate , would inevitably become increasingly unpleasant over time . The timely and site-specific nature of her work make it notoriously difficult to document . Her work therefore challenges the traditional notion that an art object or sculpture should essentially be a monument within a museum or gallery . Instead her work often lives through the memory of those that saw and experienced it - or the concept of the artwork itself .",
