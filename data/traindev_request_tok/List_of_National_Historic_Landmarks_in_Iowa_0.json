The villages were built and settled by German Pietists , who were persecuted in their homeland by the German state government and the Lutheran Church . Calling themselves the True Inspiration Congregations ( German : Wahre Inspirations Gemeinden ) , they first settled in New York near Buffalo in what is now the town of West Seneca . However , seeking more isolated surroundings , they moved to Iowa ( near present-day Iowa City ) in 1856 . They lived a communal life until 1932 . For eighty years , the Amana Colony maintained an almost completely self-sufficient local economy , importing very little from the industrializing American economy . The Amanians were able to achieve this independence and lifestyle by adhering to the specialized crafting and farming occupations that they had brought with them from Europe . Craftsmen passed their skills and techniques on from one generation to the next . They used hand , horse , wind , and water power , and made their own furniture , clothes , and other goods . The community voted to form a for-profit organization during the Great Depression , the Amana Society , which included the Amana Corporation .
