A longtime confidant of Ulysses S. Grant , Rawlins served on Grant 's staff throughout the war , rising to the rank of brevet major general , and was Grant 's chief defender against allegations of insobriety . He was appointed Secretary of War when Grant was elected President of the United States . Rawlins was a self-made man who overcame an impoverished family background , scanty education , and an absentee father who was prone to drink . After studying law , Rawlins passed the bar in 1854 and started a practice in Galena , Illinois . He was a Douglas Democrat at the outbreak of the Civil War ; a noted public speaker , he gave a notable pro-Union speech at the start of hostilities , and he soon became close friends with Ulysses S. Grant , a Galena resident , United States Military Academy graduate , and Mexican-American War veteran who had served in the Army for 11 years . Rawlins persuaded Grant to drill and muster a local volunteer militia company and send them to the state capital in Springfield so they could be inducted into federal service . After brief service in the Illinois militia as a mustering officer , Grant was soon recommissioned in the Army to serve under Union General John C. Fr\u00e9mont , commander of Union Army forces in the western United States . Rawlins also joined the Union Army and served primarily as an officer on Grant 's staff ; his promotions were linked to Grant 's success on the battlefields and Grant 's advancement in the Union Army under President Abraham Lincoln . Rawlins contracted tuberculosis in 1863 , but continued to serve on Grant 's staff during Reconstruction . After Grant won the 1868 election and assumed the presidency in March 1869 , he named Rawlins as his Secretary of War . His brief tenure was controversial ; he supported insurrection against Spanish rule in Cuba , established an anti-Mormon policy for the Utah Territory , and reduced the authority of General William Tecumseh Sherman , Grant 's successor as commander of the Army .",

The battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war and is often described as the war 's turning point . Union Maj. Gen. George Meade 's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia , halting Lee 's invasion of the North . After his success at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863 , Lee led his army through the Shenandoah Valley to begin his second invasion of the North - the Gettysburg Campaign . With his army in high spirits , Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , or even Philadelphia . Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln , Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved his army in pursuit , but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade . Elements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1 , 1863 , as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there , his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it . Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig . Gen. John Buford , and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry . However , two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north , collapsing the hastily developed Union lines , sending the defenders retreating through the streets of the town to the hills just to the south .

Following the bloody but inconclusive Battle of the Wilderness , Grant 's army disengaged from Confederate General Robert E.

Elements of Lee 's army beat the Union army to the critical crossroads of Spotsylvania Court House , Virginia , and began entrenching . Fighting occurred on and off from May 8 through May 21 , 1864 , as Grant tried various schemes to break the Confederate line . In the end , the battle was tactically inconclusive , but both sides declared victory . The Confederacy declared victory because they were able to hold their defenses . The United States declared victory because the Federal offensive continued and Lee 's army suffered losses that could not be replaced . With almost 32,000 casualties on both sides , Spotsylvania was the costliest battle of the campaign . On May 8 , Union Maj. Gens . Gouverneur K. Warren and John Sedgwick unsuccessfully attempted to dislodge the Confederates under Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson from Laurel Hill , a position that was blocking them from Spotsylvania Court House .
