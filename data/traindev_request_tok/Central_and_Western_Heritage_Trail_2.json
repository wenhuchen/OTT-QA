During the early colonisation of Hong Kong , prisoners in Victoria Prison were forced to parade in public , were often beaten with a cane , and their arms locked with a cangue on which their name and crimes-committed were penned . Policeman , often of Indian descent , would walk the prisoners to a plaza in front of the Man Mo Temple where the lawbreakers were scoffed and condemned by the passers-by .
