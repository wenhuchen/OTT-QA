  "/wiki/Long_snapper": "In gridiron football , the long snapper ( or deep snapper ) is a special teams specialist whose duty is to snap the football over a longer distance , typically around 15 yards during punts , and 7-8 yards during field goals and extra point attempts . During field goal and point after touchdown attempts , the snap is received by the holder , typically 7-8 yards away . During punts , the snap is delivered to the punter from 13-15 yards away . Following a punt snap , the snapper often executes a blocking assignment and then must cover the kick by running downfield and attempting to stop the opposing team 's punt returner from advancing the ball in the opposite direction . If the punt goes uncaught , it is the snapper 's responsibility to make sure the ball does not enter the end zone or bounce backward resulting in loss of yards . The majority of snappers at the highest levels of competition are specialized , meaning that they uniquely play the position of snapper , or have limited responsibilities elsewhere . A good punt snap should hit the target -- the punter 's hands at the abdomen or waistline -- between .65 and .75 seconds and with a tight spiral for easy handling . A bad snap is an off-target snap which causes the delay or failure of a kick or forces the punter into some other potentially compromising situation .",

  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",

The safeties are defensive backs who line up from ten to fifteen yards from the line of scrimmage . There are two variations of the position in a typical American formation : the free safety ( FS ) and the strong safety ( SS ) . Their duties depend on the defensive scheme . The defensive responsibilities of the safety and cornerback usually involve pass coverage towards the middle and sidelines of the field , respectively . While American ( 11-player ) formations generally use two safeties , Canadian ( 12-player ) formations generally have one safety and two defensive halfbacks , a position not used in the American game . As professional and college football have become more focused on the passing game , safeties have become more involved in covering the eligible pass receivers . Safeties are the last line of defense ; they are expected to be reliable tacklers , and many safeties rank among the hardest hitters in football . Safety positions can also be converted cornerbacks , either by design ( Byron Jones ) or as a cornerback ages ( Charles Woodson , DeAngelo Hall , Lardarius Webb , Tramon Williams ) . Historically , in the era of the one-platoon system , the safety was known as the defensive fullback ( specifically the free safety ; the strong safety would be a defensive halfback , a term still in Canadian parlance ) or goaltender .",
