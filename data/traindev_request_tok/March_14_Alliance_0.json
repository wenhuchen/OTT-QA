  "/wiki/Sunni": "Sunni Islam ( /\u02c8su\u02d0ni , \u02c8s\u028ani/ ) is the largest denomination of Islam , followed by 87-90% of the world 's Muslims . Its name comes from the word sunnah , referring to the behaviour of the Islamic prophet Muhammad . The differences between Sunni and Shia Muslims arose from a disagreement over the succession to Muhammad and subsequently acquired broader political significance , as well as theological and juridical dimensions . According to Sunni traditions , Muhammad did not clearly designate a successor and the Muslim community acted according to his sunnah in electing his father-in-law Abu Bakr as the first caliph . This contrasts with the Shia view , which holds that Muhammad announced his son-in-law and cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor , most notably at Ghadir Khumm . Political tensions between Sunnis and Shias continued with varying intensity throughout Islamic history and have been exacerbated in recent times by ethnic conflicts and the rise of Wahhabism . The adherents of Sunni Islam are referred to in Arabic as ahl as-sunnah wa l-jam\u0101\u02bbah ( the people of the sunnah and the community ) or ahl as-sunnah for short . In English , its doctrines and practices are sometimes called Sunnism , while adherents are known as Sunni Muslims , Sunnis , Sunnites and Ahlus Sunnah . Sunni Islam is sometimes referred to as orthodox Islam , though some scholars view this translation as inappropriate . The Quran , together with hadith ( especially those collected in Kutub al-Sittah ) and binding juristic consensus , form the basis of all traditional jurisprudence within Sunni Islam . Sharia rulings are derived from these basic sources , in conjunction with analogical reasoning , consideration of public welfare and juristic discretion , using the principles of jurisprudence developed by the traditional legal schools . In matters of creed , the Sunni tradition upholds the six pillars of iman ( faith ) and comprises the Ash'ari and Maturidi schools of rationalistic theology as well as the textualist school known as traditionalist theology .",

Greek Orthodox Christianity has also traditionally placed heavy emphasis and awarded high prestige to traditions of Eastern Orthodox monasticism and asceticism , with origins in Early Christianity in the Near East and in Byzantine Anatolia . Historically , the term Greek Orthodox has also been used to describe all Eastern Orthodox Churches in general , since Greek in Greek Orthodox can refer to the heritage of the Byzantine Empire . During the first eight centuries of Christian history , most major intellectual , cultural , and social developments in the Christian Church took place within the Empire or in the sphere of its influence , where the Greek language was widely spoken and used for most theological writings . Over time , most parts of the liturgy , traditions , and practices of the church of Constantinople were adopted by all , and still provide the basic patterns of contemporary Orthodoxy . Thus , the Eastern Church came to be called Greek Orthodox in the same way that the Western Church is called Roman Catholic . However , the appellation Greek was abandoned by the Slavic and other Eastern Orthodox churches in connection with their peoples ' national awakenings , from as early as the 10th century A.D . Thus , today it is generally only those churches that are most closely tied to Greek or Byzantine culture that are called Greek Orthodox .",

It is headed by Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rahi since 2011 , seated in Bkerke north of Beirut , Lebanon . Officially known as the Syriac Maronite Church of Antioch , it is part of Syriac Christianity by liturgy and heritage . Establishment of the Maronite Church can be divided into three periods , from the 4th to the 7th centuries . A congregation movement , with Saint Maroun from the Taurus Mountains as an inspirational leader and patron saint , marked the first period . The second began with the establishment of the Monastery of Saint Maroun on the Orontes , built after the Council of Chalcedon to defend the doctrines of the Council . This monastery was described as the greatest monastery in the region of Secunda Syria , with more than 300 hermitages around it , according to ancient records . After 518 , the monastery de facto administered many parishes in Prima Syria , Cole Syria and Phoenicia . The third period was when Sede Vacante followed the Islamic conquest of the region and bishops of the Saint Maroun Monastery elected John Maron as Patriarch around 685 AD , according to the Maronite tradition . The Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch re-established their patriarchate in 751 AD . Other centers of historical importance include Kfarhay , Yanouh , Mayfouq and Qadisha Valley . Although reduced in numbers today , Maronites remain one of the principal ethno-religious groups in Lebanon , with smaller minorities of Maronites in Syria , Cyprus , Israel , and Jordan .",

Tripoli overlooks the eastern Mediterranean Sea , and it is the northernmost seaport in Lebanon . It holds a string of four small islands offshore , and they are also the only islands in Lebanon .

With the formation of Lebanon and the 1948 breakup of the Syrian-Lebanese customs union , Tripoli , once on par in economic and commercial importance to Beirut , was cut off from its traditional trade relations with the Syrian hinterland and therefore declined in relative prosperity .
