Brooklyn has several bridge and tunnel connections to the borough of Manhattan across the East River , and the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge connects it with Staten Island . With a land area of 70.82 square miles ( 183.4 km2 ) and water area of 26 square miles ( 67 km2 ) , Kings County is New York state 's fourth-smallest county by land area and third-smallest by total area , though it is the second-largest among the city 's five boroughs . If each borough were ranked as a city , Brooklyn would rank as the third-most populous in the U.S. , after Los Angeles and Chicago . Brooklyn was an independent incorporated city ( and previously an authorized village and town within the provisions of the New York State Constitution ) until January 1 , 1898 , when , after a long political campaign and public relations battle during the 1890s , according to the new Municipal Charter of Greater New York , Brooklyn was consolidated with the other cities , boroughs , and counties to form the modern City of New York , surrounding the Upper New York Bay with five constituent boroughs . The borough continues , however , to maintain a distinct culture . Many Brooklyn neighborhoods are ethnic enclaves . Brooklyn 's official motto , displayed on the Borough seal and flag , is Eendraght Maeckt Maght , which translates from early modern Dutch as Unity makes strength . In the first decades of the 21st century , Brooklyn has experienced a renaissance as an avant-garde destination for hipsters , with concomitant gentrification , dramatic house price increases and a decrease in housing affordability . Since the 2010s , Brooklyn has evolved into a thriving hub of entrepreneurship , high technology startup firms , postmodern art and design .",

Prospect Park opened in 1867 , though it was not substantially complete until 1873 . The park subsequently underwent numerous modifications and expansions to its facilities . Several additions to the park were completed in the 1890s , in the City Beautiful architectural movement . In the early 20th century , New York City Department of Parks and Recreation ( NYC Parks ) commissioner Robert Moses started a program to clean up Prospect Park . A period of decline in the late 20th century spurred the creation of the Prospect Park Alliance , which refurbished many parts of the park starting in the late 1980s . Main attractions of the park include the 90-acre ( 36 ha ) Long Meadow ; the Picnic House ; Litchfield Villa ; Prospect Park Zoo ; the Boathouse ; Concert Grove ; Brooklyn 's only lake , covering 60 acres ( 24 ha ) ; and the Prospect Park Bandshell that hosts free outdoor concerts in the summertime .
