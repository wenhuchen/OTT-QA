Lestander started as a cross-country skier , but he was also an experienced hunter , and thus ended up with biathlon . At the 1960 Olympics he placed 15th out of 30 in skiing , but became the first international competitor to ever hit all 20 targets , and hence won the gold medal . His rival Aleksandr Privalov needed to clear three targets out of five at the last post to win the event , but managed only two , and ended up with a bronze medal . Meanwhile , the fastest skier Victor Arbez hit only 2 targets out of 20 , and placed 25th overall . Next year Lestander finished ninth individually at the World Championships in Ume\u00e5 and third with the Swedish team . He retired the same year , never winning a Swedish Championship . Lestander lived all his life in Arjeplog , where a square is named after him . He is a cousin of the forest worker and Left Party Member of Parliament Paul Lestander .
