  "/wiki/NY_17": "New York State Route 17 ( NY 17 ) is a major state highway that extends for 397 miles ( 638.91 km ) through the Southern Tier and Downstate regions of New York in the United States . It begins at the Pennsylvania state line in Mina and follows the Southern Tier Expressway east through Corning to Binghamton and the Quickway from Binghamton east to Woodbury , where it turns south to follow the Orange Turnpike to the New Jersey state line near Suffern , where it connects to New Jersey Route 17 . From the Pennsylvania border to the village of Waverly and from Binghamton to Windsor , NY 17 is concurrent with Interstate 86 ( I-86 ) . Eventually , the entire east-west portion of NY 17 from the Pennsylvania border to Woodbury will become I-86 as projects to upgrade the route to Interstate Highway standards are completed . At 397 miles , NY 17 is the longest state route in New York , and its second-longest highway of any kind besides the Thruway . It serves 11 counties ( Chautauqua , Cattaraugus , Allegany , Steuben , Chemung , Tioga , Broome , Delaware , Sullivan , Orange , and Rockland ) , passes through the cities of Salamanca , Olean , Corning , Elmira , and Binghamton , and enters the vicinity of several others , including Jamestown and Middletown . As it proceeds across the state , it intersects many of New York 's Interstate and U.S . Highways , including U.S. Route 219 ( US 219 ) in Salamanca , I-99 and US 15 near Corning , I-81 in Binghamton , and I-84 near Middletown . The portion of NY 17 in the vicinity of Waverly is actually located in Pennsylvania ; however , it is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) . The route was assigned in 1924 , extending from Westfield to Suffern via at-grade highways . It was moved onto the Quickway and the Southern Tier Expressway as sections of both were completed from the 1950s to the 1980s . Two of NY 17 's suffixed routes , NY 17C and NY 17M , follow substantial portions of NY 17 's pre-freeway alignment .",

  "/wiki/NY_206": "New York State Route 206 ( NY 206 ) is a 74.57-mile-long ( 120.01 km ) state highway in the Southern Tier of New York in the United States . It runs through some lightly populated regions along the state 's southern border , from Central New York to the Catskills . It begins near a busy intersection with Interstate 81 ( I-81 ) at Whitney Point and runs east from there through Greene . The eastern terminus is located at a junction with NY 17 ( future I-86 ) at Roscoe in Sullivan County . It is one of the longest three-digit routes in New York , and the only long one not associated with a two-digit route or a former U.S. Route . Yet due to its location it sees little traffic , although for much of its length it follows the route of a main 19th century thoroughfare , the Catskill Turnpike . It is primarily a long shortcut around Binghamton . NY 206 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , but only from Bainbridge to Downsville . NY 206 was extended west to Whitney Point in the early 1940s ; another extension in the late 1970s moved the route 's eastern terminus to Roscoe . Prior to becoming NY 206 , the Whitney Point-Greene segment was once New York State Route 219 and New York State Route 383 while the portion from Coventry to Bainbridge was previously New York State Route 218 .",
