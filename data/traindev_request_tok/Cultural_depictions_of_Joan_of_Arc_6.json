  "/wiki/Hundred_Years'_War": "The Hundred Years ' War was a series of conflicts from 1337 to 1453 , waged between the House of Plantagenet , rulers of England and the French House of Valois , over the right to rule the Kingdom of France . Each side drew many allies into the war . It was one of the most notable conflicts of the Middle Ages , in which five generations of kings from two rival dynasties fought for the throne of the largest kingdom in Western Europe . The war marked both the height of chivalry and its subsequent decline , and the development of strong national identities in both countries . Tensions between the French and English crowns had gone back centuries to the origins of the English royal family , which was French ( Norman , and later , Angevin ) in origin . English monarchs had therefore historically held titles and lands within France , which made them vassals to the kings of France . The status of the English king 's French fiefs was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages . French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power , stripping away lands as the opportunity arose , particularly whenever England was at war with Scotland , an ally of France . English holdings in France had varied in size , at some points dwarfing even the French royal domain ; by 1337 , however , only Gascony was English . In 1328 , Charles IV of France died without sons or brothers and a new principle disallowed female succession . Charles 's closest male relative was his nephew Edward III of England , whose mother , Isabella of France , was Charles 's sister . Isabella claimed the throne of France for her son , but the French [ who ? ]",

He was Emperor of the French as Napoleon I from 1804 until 1814 and again briefly in 1815 during the Hundred Days . Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars . He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles , building a large empire that ruled over much of continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815 . He is considered one of the greatest commanders in history , and his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide . Napoleon 's political and cultural legacy has endured as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history . He was born Napoleone Buonaparte ( Italian : [ napole\u02c8o\u02d0ne \u02ccbw\u0254na\u02c8parte ] ) in Corsica to a relatively modest Italian family from minor nobility . He was serving as an artillery officer in the French army when the French Revolution erupted in 1789 . He rapidly rose through the ranks of the military , seizing the new opportunities presented by the Revolution and becoming a general at age 24 . The French Directory eventually gave him command of the Army of Italy after he suppressed the 13 Vend\u00e9miaire revolt against the government from royalist insurgents . At age 26 , he began his first military campaign against the Austrians and the Italian monarchs aligned with the Habsburgs - winning virtually every battle , conquering the Italian Peninsula in a year while establishing sister republics with local support , and becoming a war hero in France . In 1798 , he led a military expedition to Egypt that served as a springboard to political power .",
  "/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_I": "Elizabeth I ( 7 September 1533 - 24 March 1603 ) was Queen of England and Ireland from 17 November 1558 until her death on 24 March 1603 . Sometimes called the Virgin Queen , Gloriana or Good Queen Bess , Elizabeth was the last of the five monarchs of the House of Tudor . Elizabeth was the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn , his second wife , who was executed two-and-a-half years after Elizabeth 's birth . Anne 's marriage to Henry VIII was annulled , and Elizabeth was declared illegitimate . Her half-brother , Edward VI , ruled until his death in 1553 , bequeathing the crown to Lady Jane Grey and ignoring the claims of his two half-sisters , the Roman Catholic Mary and the younger Elizabeth , in spite of statute law to the contrary . Edward 's will was set aside and Mary became queen , deposing Lady Jane Grey . During Mary 's reign , Elizabeth was imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels . In 1558 upon Mary 's death , Elizabeth succeeded her half-sister to the throne and set out to rule by good counsel . She depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers , led by William Cecil , 1st Baron Burghley . One of her first actions as queen was the establishment of an English Protestant church , of which she became the Supreme Governor . This Elizabethan Religious Settlement was to evolve into the Church of England . It was expected that Elizabeth would marry and produce an heir ; however , despite numerous courtships , she never did .",
  "/wiki/Florence_Nightingale": "Florence Nightingale , OM , RRC , DStJ ( /\u02c8na\u026at\u026an\u0261e\u026al/ ; 12 May 1820 - 13 August 1910 ) was an English social reformer and statistician , and the founder of modern nursing . Nightingale came to prominence while serving as a manager and trainer of nurses during the Crimean War , in which she organised care for wounded soldiers . She gave nursing a favourable reputation and became an icon of Victorian culture , especially in the persona of The Lady with the Lamp making rounds of wounded soldiers at night . Recent commentators have asserted Nightingale 's Crimean War achievements were exaggerated by media at the time , but critics agree on the importance of her later work in professionalising nursing roles for women . In 1860 , Nightingale laid the foundation of professional nursing with the establishment of her nursing school at St Thomas ' Hospital in London . It was the first secular nursing school in the world , and is now part of King 's College London . In recognition of her pioneering work in nursing , the Nightingale Pledge taken by new nurses , and the Florence Nightingale Medal , the highest international distinction a nurse can achieve , were named in her honour , and the annual International Nurses Day is celebrated on her birthday . Her social reforms included improving healthcare for all sections of British society , advocating better hunger relief in India , helping to abolish prostitution laws that were harsh for women , and expanding the acceptable forms of female participation in the workforce . Nightingale was a prodigious and versatile writer . In her lifetime , much of her published work was concerned with spreading medical knowledge . Some of her tracts were written in simple English so that they could easily be understood by those with poor literary skills . She was also a pioneer in data visualization with the use of infographics , effectively using graphical presentations of statistical data .",

Freud was born to Galician Jewish parents in the Moravian town of Freiberg , in the Austrian Empire . He qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1881 at the University of Vienna . Upon completing his habilitation in 1885 , he was appointed a docent in neuropathology and became an affiliated professor in 1902 . Freud lived and worked in Vienna , having set up his clinical practice there in 1886 . In 1938 , Freud left Austria to escape the Nazis . He died in exile in the United Kingdom in 1939 . In founding psychoanalysis , Freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association and discovered transference , establishing its central role in the analytic process . Freud 's redefinition of sexuality to include its infantile forms led him to formulate the Oedipus complex as the central tenet of psychoanalytical theory . His analysis of dreams as wish-fulfillments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the underlying mechanisms of repression . On this basis Freud elaborated his theory of the unconscious and went on to develop a model of psychic structure comprising id , ego and super-ego . Freud postulated the existence of libido , a sexualised energy with which mental processes and structures are invested and which generates erotic attachments , and a death drive , the source of compulsive repetition , hate , aggression and neurotic guilt .",
