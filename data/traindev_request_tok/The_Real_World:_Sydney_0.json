Prior to the 18th century , they were concentrated in what is now southwestern North Carolina , southeastern Tennessee , edges of western South Carolina , northeastern Georgia and northeastern Alabama . The Cherokee language is part of the Iroquoian language group . In the 19th century , James Mooney , an American ethnographer , recorded one oral tradition that told of the tribe having migrated south in ancient times from the Great Lakes region , where other Iroquoian-speaking peoples lived ; however , anthropologist Thomas R. Whyte writes that the origin of the proto-Iroquoian language was likely the Appalachian region and the split between Northern and Southern Iroquoian languages began 4,000 years ago . By the 19th century , European settlers in the United States classified the Cherokee of the Southeast as one of the Five Civilized Tribes , because they were agrarian and lived in permanent villages and began to adopt some cultural and technological practices of the European American settlers . Today there are three federally recognized Cherokee tribes : the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in North Carolina , the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians ( UKB ) in Oklahoma , and the Cherokee Nation ( CN ) in Oklahoma . The Cherokee Nation has more than 300,000 tribal members , making it the largest of the 567 federally recognized tribes in the United States . In addition , numerous groups claim Cherokee lineage , and some of these are state-recognized . A total of more than 819,000 people are estimated to claim having Cherokee ancestry on the US census , which includes persons who are not enrolled members of any tribe . Of the three federally recognized Cherokee tribes , the Cherokee Nation and the UKB have headquarters in Tahlequah , Oklahoma . The UKB are mostly descendants of Old Settlers , Cherokee who migrated to Arkansas and Oklahoma about 1817 prior to Indian Removal . They are related to the Cherokee who were later forcibly relocated there in the 1830s under the Indian Removal Act .",

  "/wiki/North_Georgia_Technical_College": "North Georgia Technical College 's Clarkesville Campus originally was the home of the Georgia Ninth District School of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts ( The A & M ) , which was active from 1907 until 1933 . From 1938 to 1943 , the campus was home of Habersham College and the National Youth Administration , one of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's programs during the Great Depression . Recognizing the need for occupational training for Georgians , the Georgia General Assembly created a vocational division in the State Board of Education , which approved a plan creating a system of state vocational schools in October 1943 . The initial location for North Georgia Trade and Vocational School was chosen in 1943 , and the school accepted its first student in February 1944 . As the demand for technical training grew , more courses were added . In 1962 , the name of the school was changed to North Georgia Technical and Vocational School . On July 1 , 1985 , North Georgia Tech was placed under the governance of the new state board , which today is called the Technical College System of Georgia . In 1987 , the name was changed to North Georgia Technical Institute . The Clarkesville Campus of North Georgia Technical College is located in a mountain setting off Georgia Highway 197 one and one-half miles north of Clarkesville , the county seat of Habersham County .

  "/wiki/Guitar": "The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that usually has six strings . It is typically played with both hands by strumming or plucking the strings with either a guitar pick or the fingers/fingernails of one hand , while simultaneously fretting ( pressing the strings against the frets ) with the fingers of the other hand . The sound of the vibrating strings is projected either acoustically , by means of the hollow chamber of the guitar ( for an acoustic guitar ) , or through an electrical amplifier and a speaker . The guitar is a type of chordophone , traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut , nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning . The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern , the vihuela , the four-course Renaissance guitar , and the five-course baroque guitar , all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument . There are three main types of modern acoustic guitar : the classical guitar ( Spanish guitar/nylon-string guitar ) , the steel-string acoustic guitar , and the archtop guitar , which is sometimes called a jazz guitar . The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings ' vibration , amplified by the hollow body of the guitar , which acts as a resonating chamber . The classical guitar is often played as a solo instrument using a comprehensive finger-picking technique where each string is plucked individually by the player 's fingers , as opposed to being strummed . The term finger-picking can also refer to a specific tradition of folk , blues , bluegrass , and country guitar playing in the United States . The acoustic bass guitar is a low-pitched instrument that is one octave below a regular guitar . Electric guitars , introduced in the 1930s , use an amplifier and a loudspeaker that both makes the sound of the instrument loud enough for the performers and audience to hear , and , given that it produces an electric signal when played , that can electronically manipulate and shape the tone using an equalizer ( e.g. , bass and treble tone controls ) and a huge variety of electronic effects units , the most commonly used ones being distortion ( or overdrive ) and reverb . Early amplified guitars employed a hollow body , but solid wood guitars began to dominate during the 1960s and 1970s , as they are less prone to unwanted acoustic feedback howls .",

While the university was integrated that year , the use of Confederate symbols and motifs has remained a controversial aspect of the school 's identity and culture . In response the university has taken measures to rebrand its image , including effectively banning the display of Confederate flags in Vaught-Hemingway Stadium in 1997 , officially abandoning the Colonel Reb mascot in 2003 , and removing Dixie from the Pride of the South marching band 's repertoire in 2016 . In 2018 , following a racially charged rant on social media by an alumnus and academic building namesake , former Chancellor Jeffrey Vitter reaffirmed the university 's commitment to honest and open dialogue about its history , and in making its campuses more welcoming and inclusive .",
  "/wiki/Emancipation_of_minors": "Emancipation of minors is a legal mechanism by which a child before attaining the age of majority ( sometimes called a minor ) is freed from control by their parents or guardians , and the parents or guardians are freed from any and all responsibility toward the child . Children before that age are normally considered legally incompetent to enter into contracts and to handle their own affairs . Emancipation overrides that presumption and allows emancipated children to legally make certain decisions on their own behalf . Depending on jurisdiction , a child may be emancipated by acts such as marriage , attaining economic self-sufficiency , obtaining an educational degree or diploma , or participating in a form of military service . In the United States , all states have some form of emancipation of minors . Even without a court proceeding , some jurisdictions will find a minor to be emancipated for purposes of making a decision in the absence of the minor 's parents or guardians . For example , a child in most jurisdictions can enter into a binding contract to procure their own basic needs . However , in such cases where a child 's needs are not provided for by a parent , a child will often be deemed a ward of the state and have a court appointed guardian placed in the role of the parent .",
