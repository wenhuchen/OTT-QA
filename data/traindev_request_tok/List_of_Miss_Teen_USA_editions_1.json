  "/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina": "Charleston is the oldest and largest city in the U.S. state of South Carolina . The city is the county seat of Charleston County , and the principal city in the Charleston-North Charleston-Summerville Metropolitan Statistical Area . The city lies just south of the geographical midpoint of South Carolina 's coastline and is located on Charleston Harbor , an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean formed by the confluence of the Ashley , Cooper , and Wando rivers . Charleston had an estimated population of 136,208 in 2018 . The estimated population of the Charleston metropolitan area , comprising Berkeley , Charleston , and Dorchester counties , was 787,643 residents as of 2018 , the third-largest in the state and the 78th-largest metropolitan statistical area in the United States . Charleston was founded in 1670 as Charles Town , honoring King Charles II of England . Its initial location at Albemarle Point on the west bank of the Ashley River ( now Charles Towne Landing ) was abandoned in 1680 for its present site , which became the fifth-largest city in North America within ten years . One of the key cities in the British colonization of the Americas , Charles Town played a major role in the slave trade , which laid the foundation for the city 's size and wealth , and was dominated by a slavocracy of plantation owners and slave traders . Independent Charleston slave traders like Joseph Wragg were the first to break through the monopoly of the Royal African Company , pioneering the large-scale slave trade of the 18th century . Historians estimate that nearly half of all Africans brought to America arrived in Charleston , most at Gadsden 's Wharf . Despite its size , it remained unincorporated throughout the colonial period ; its government was handled directly by a colonial legislature and a governor sent by London , England . Election districts were organized according to Anglican parishes , and some social services were managed by Anglican wardens and vestries .",

Immigrants from some Caribbean , Central American , and South American nations and their descendants may or may not also self-identify with the term . African-American history starts in the 16th century , with peoples from West Africa forcibly taken as slaves to Latin America , and in the 17th century with West African slaves taken to English colonies in North America . After the founding of the United States , black people continued to be enslaved , and the last four million black slaves were only liberated after the Civil War in 1865 .
