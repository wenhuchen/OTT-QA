He is recognised as one of the great prose stylists of the English language in the 20th century . Waugh was the son of a publisher , educated at Lancing College and then at Hertford College , Oxford . He worked briefly as a schoolmaster before he became a full-time writer . As a young man , he acquired many fashionable and aristocratic friends and developed a taste for country house society . He travelled extensively in the 1930s , often as a special newspaper correspondent ; he reported from Abyssinia at the time of the 1935 Italian invasion . He served in the British armed forces throughout the Second World War , first in the Royal Marines and then in the Royal Horse Guards . He was a perceptive writer who used the experiences and the wide range of people whom he encountered in his works of fiction , generally to humorous effect . Waugh 's detachment was such that he fictionalised his own mental breakdown which occurred in the early 1950s . Waugh converted to Catholicism in 1930 after his first marriage failed . His traditionalist stance led him to strongly oppose all attempts to reform the Church , and the changes by the Second Vatican Council ( 1962-65 ) greatly disturbed his sensibilities , especially the introduction of the vernacular Mass .",

  "/wiki/The_Jungle_Book": "The Jungle Book ( 1894 ) is a collection of stories by the English author Rudyard Kipling . Most of the characters are animals such as Shere Khan the tiger and Baloo the bear , though a principal character is the boy or man-cub Mowgli , who is raised in the jungle by wolves . The stories are set in a forest in India ; one place mentioned repeatedly is Seonee ( Seoni ) , in the central state of Madhya Pradesh . A major theme in the book is abandonment followed by fostering , as in the life of Mowgli , echoing Kipling 's own childhood . The theme is echoed in the triumph of protagonists including Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and The White Seal over their enemies , as well as Mowgli 's . Another important theme is of law and freedom ; the stories are not about animal behaviour , still less about the Darwinian struggle for survival , but about human archetypes in animal form . They teach respect for authority , obedience , and knowing one 's place in society with the law of the jungle , but the stories also illustrate the freedom to move between different worlds , such as when Mowgli moves between the jungle and the village . Critics have also noted the essential wildness and lawless energies in the stories , reflecting the irresponsible side of human nature . The Jungle Book has remained popular , partly through its many adaptations for film and other media . Critics such as Swati Singh have noted that even critics wary of Kipling for his supposed imperialism have admired the power of his storytelling . The book has been influential in the scout movement , whose founder , Robert Baden-Powell , was a friend of Kipling 's . Percy Grainger composed his Jungle Book Cycle around quotations from the book .",

Kipling in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was among the United Kingdom 's most popular writers . Henry James said , Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius , as distinct from fine intelligence , that I have ever known . In 1907 , he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature , as the first English-language writer to receive the prize , and at 41 , its youngest recipient to date . He was also sounded for the British Poet Laureateship and several times for a knighthood , but declined both . Following his death in 1936 , his ashes were interred at Poets ' Corner , part of the South Transept of Westminster Abbey .

Kesey was born in La Junta , Colorado , and grew up in Springfield , Oregon , graduating from the University of Oregon in 1957 . He began writing One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest in 1960 following the completion of a graduate fellowship in creative writing at Stanford University ; the novel was an immediate commercial and critical success when published two years later . During this period , Kesey participated in government studies involving hallucinogenic drugs ( including mescaline and LSD ) to supplement his income . Following the publication of One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest , he moved to nearby La Honda , California , and began hosting happenings with former colleagues from Stanford , miscellaneous bohemian and literary figures ( most notably Neal Cassady ) , and other friends collectively known as the Merry Pranksters ; these parties , known as Acid Tests , integrated the consumption of LSD with multimedia performances . He mentored the Grateful Dead ( the de facto house band of the Acid Tests ) throughout their incipience and continued to exert a profound influence upon the group throughout their long career . Sometimes a Great Notion - an epic account of the vicissitudes of an Oregon logging family that aspired to the modernist grandeur of William Faulkner 's Yoknapatawpha saga - was a commercial success that polarized critics and readers upon its release in 1964 , although Kesey regarded the novel as his magnum opus . In 1965 , following an arrest for marijuana possession and subsequent faked suicide , Kesey was imprisoned for five months . Shortly thereafter , he returned home to the Willamette Valley and settled in Pleasant Hill , Oregon , where he maintained a secluded , family-oriented lifestyle for the rest of his life .

  "/wiki/The_Foundation_Pit": "The Foundation Pit ( Russian : \u041a\u043e\u0442\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d , kotlovan ) is a gloomy symbolic and semi-satirical novel by Andrei Platonov . The plot of the novel concerns a group of workers living in the early Soviet Union . They attempt to dig out a huge foundation pit on the base of which a gigantic house will be built for the country 's proletarians . The workers dig each day but slowly cease to understand the meaning of their work . The enormous foundation pit sucks out all of their physical and mental energy . In terms of creative works , Platonov depicted one of the first state-controlled dystopias of the 20th century . The novel is often compared to George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty-Four and Aldous Huxley 's Brave New World . However , both English novels were published long before a translation of The Foundation Pit became available . [ citation needed ] Platonov 's work is a representation of the conflict that arose between Russian individuals and the increasingly collectivized Soviet state in the late 1920s . The Foundation Pit critiques Joseph Stalin 's domestic policies and questions the validity of any regime advocating the belief that the only existence a person can have is being one part of a whole . [ citation needed ] Finished in 1930 , the novel was not published in the Soviet Union until 1987 due to censorship .",

  "/wiki/That_Hideous_Strength": "That Hideous Strength ( subtitled A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-Ups ) is a 1945 novel by C. S. Lewis , the final book in Lewis 's theological science fiction Space Trilogy . The events of this novel follow those of Out of the Silent Planet and Perelandra ( also titled Voyage to Venus ) and once again feature the philologist Elwin Ransom . Yet unlike the principal events of those two novels , the story takes place on Earth rather than in space or on other planets in the solar system . The story involves an ostensibly scientific institute , the N.I.C.E. , which is a front for sinister supernatural forces . The novel was heavily influenced by the writing of Lewis 's friend and fellow Inkling Charles Williams , and is markedly dystopian in style . In the book 's preface Lewis acknowledges science-fiction writer Olaf Stapledon and his work : Mr. Stapledon is so rich in invention that he can well afford to lend , and I admire his invention ( though not his philosophy ) so much that I should feel no shame to borrow . In the foreword , Lewis states that the novel 's point is the same as that in his non-fiction work The Abolition of Man , which argues that there are natural laws and objective values , which education should teach children to recognise . The novel 's title is taken from a poem written by David Lyndsay in 1555 , Ane Dialog betuix Experience and ane Courteour , also known as The Monarche . The couplet in question , The shadow of that hyddeous strength , sax myle and more it is of length , refers to the Tower of Babel .",
  "/wiki/C._S._Lewis": "Clive Staples Lewis ( 29 November 1898 - 22 November 1963 ) was a British writer and lay theologian . He held academic positions in English literature at both Oxford University ( Magdalen College , 1925-1954 ) and Cambridge University ( Magdalene College , 1954-1963 ) . He is best known for his works of fiction , especially The Screwtape Letters , The Chronicles of Narnia , and The Space Trilogy , and for his non-fiction Christian apologetics , such as Mere Christianity , Miracles , and The Problem of Pain . Lewis and fellow novelist J. R. R. Tolkien were close friends . They both served on the English faculty at Oxford University and were active in the informal Oxford literary group known as the Inklings . According to Lewis 's memoir Surprised by Joy , he was baptised in the Church of Ireland , but fell away from his faith during adolescence . Lewis returned to Anglicanism at the age of 32 , owing to the influence of Tolkien and other friends , and he became an ordinary layman of the Church of England . Lewis 's faith profoundly affected his work , and his wartime radio broadcasts on the subject of Christianity brought him wide acclaim . Lewis wrote more than 30 books which have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold millions of copies . The books that make up The Chronicles of Narnia have sold the most and have been popularised on stage , TV , radio , and cinema . His philosophical writings are widely cited by Christian apologists from many denominations . In 1956 , Lewis married American writer Joy Davidman ; she died of cancer four years later at the age of 45 .",
  "/wiki/Logres": "Logres ( also Logris or Loegria ) is King Arthur 's realm in the Matter of Britain . It derives from the medieval Welsh word Lloegyr , a name of uncertain origin referring to England ( Lloegr in modern Welsh ) . In Arthurian contexts , Logres is often used to describe the Brittonic territory roughly corresponding to the borders of England before the area was taken by the Anglo-Saxons . According to Geoffrey of Monmouth 's influential pseudohistory Historia Regum Britanniae , the realm was named after the legendary king Locrinus , the oldest son of Brutus of Troy . In his Historia , Geoffrey uses the word Loegria to describe a province containing most of England excluding Cornwall and possibly Northumberland , as in this example from section iv.20 ( from the Puffin Classics translation by Lewis Thorpe ) :"
