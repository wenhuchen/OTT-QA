It lies within the United Kingdom 's second-most populous urban area , with a population of 2.9 million , and second-most populous metropolitan area , with a population of 3.3 million . It is fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south , the Pennines to the north and east , and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation . The local authority for the city is Manchester City Council . The recorded history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort of Mamucium or Mancunium , which was established in about AD 79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell . It is historically a part of Lancashire , although areas of Cheshire south of the River Mersey were incorporated in the 20th century . The first to be included , Wythenshawe , was added to the city in 1931 . Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township , but began to expand at an astonishing rate around the turn of the 19th century . Manchester 's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution , and resulted in it becoming the world 's first industrialised city . Manchester achieved city status in 1853 . The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894 , creating the Port of Manchester and directly linking the city to the Irish Sea , 36 miles ( 58 km ) to the west . Its fortune declined after the Second World War , owing to deindustrialisation , but the IRA bombing in 1996 led to extensive investment and regeneration .",
