Reynolds , the building was constructed by Walter Chrysler , the head of the Chrysler Corporation , and served as the corporation 's headquarters from 1930 until the mid-1950s . The Chrysler Building 's construction was characterized by a competition with 40 Wall Street and the Empire State Building to become the world 's tallest building . Although the Chrysler Building was built and designed specifically for the car manufacturer , the corporation did not pay for its construction and never owned it ; rather , Walter Chrysler decided to pay for it himself so that his children could inherit it . When the Chrysler Building opened , there were mixed reviews of the building 's design , ranging from views of it as inane and unoriginal to the idea that it was modernist and iconic . Perceptions of the building have slowly evolved into its now being seen as a paragon of the Art Deco architectural style ; and in 2007 , it was ranked ninth on the List of America 's Favorite Architecture by the American Institute of Architects .",
