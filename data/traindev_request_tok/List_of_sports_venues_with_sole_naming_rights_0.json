Its name refers to an urban agglomeration of 9,993 km2 ( 3,858 sq mi ) , comprising a metropolitan area with 31 municipalities , and is also the common name for its city centre .

In 1851 , four years after Queen Victoria declared it a city , Melbourne became the capital of the new colony of Victoria . In the wake of the 1850s Victorian gold rush , the city entered a lengthy boom period that , by the late 1880s , had transformed it into one of the world 's largest and wealthiest metropolises . After the federation of Australia in 1901 , it served as interim seat of government of the new nation until Canberra became the permanent capital in 1927 . Today , it is a leading financial centre in the Asia-Pacific region and ranks 15th in the Global Financial Centres Index . Melbourne is home to many of Australia 's best-known landmarks , such as the Melbourne Cricket Ground , the National Gallery of Victoria and the World Heritage-listed Royal Exhibition Building .

Light 's design , now listed as national heritage , set out the city centre in a grid layout , interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares , and entirely surrounded by parklands . Early colonial Adelaide was shaped by the diversity and wealth of its free settlers , in contrast to the convict history of other Australian cities . Until the post-war era , it was Australia 's third-largest city . It has been noted for its leading examples of religious freedom and progressive political reforms , and became known as the City of Churches due to its diversity of faiths .

The first European visitor to Western Australia was the Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog , who visited the Western Australian coast in 1616 . The first European settlement of Western Australia occurred following the landing by Major Edmund Lockyer on 26 December 1826 of an expedition on behalf of the New South Wales colonial government . He established a convict-supported military garrison at King George III Sound , at present-day Albany , and on 21 January 1827 formally took possession of the western third of the continent for the British Crown .

Founded in 1804 as a British penal colony , Hobart is Australia 's second oldest capital city after Sydney , New South Wales .

Penal transportation ended in the 1850s , after which the city experienced periods of growth and decline . The early 20th century saw an economic boom on the back of mining , agriculture and other primary industries , and the loss of men who served in the world wars was counteracted by an influx of immigration .

Geelong is the administrative centre for the City of Greater Geelong municipality , which covers urban , rural and coastal areas surrounding the city , including the Bellarine Peninsula . [ note 1 ] Geelong was named in 1827 , with the name derived from the local Wathaurong Aboriginal name for the region , Djillong , thought to mean land or cliffs or tongue of land or peninsula . Geelong City is also known as the 'Gateway City ' due to its central location to surrounding Victorian regional centres like Ballarat in the north west , Torquay , Great Ocean Road and Warrnambool in the southwest , Hamilton , Colac and Winchelsea to the west , and the state capital of Melbourne in the north east . The area was first surveyed in 1838 , three weeks after Melbourne . The post office was open by June 1840 ( the second to open in the Port Phillip District ) . The first woolstore was erected in this period and it became the port for the wool industry of the Western District . During the gold rush , Geelong experienced a brief boom as the main port to the rich goldfields of the Ballarat district . The city then diversified into manufacturing , and during the 1860s , it became one of the largest manufacturing centres in Australia with its wool mills , ropeworks , and paper mills .",

  "/wiki/Multi-purpose_stadium": "A multi-purpose stadium is a type of stadium designed to be easily used by multiple types of events . While any stadium could potentially host more than one type of sport or event , this concept usually refers to a specific design philosophy that stresses multifunctionality over specificity . It is used most commonly in Canada and the United States , where the two most popular outdoor team sports - football and baseball - require radically different facilities . Football uses a rectangular field ( Canadian football fields are larger than American ones ) , while baseball is played on a diamond and large outfield . This requires a particular design to accommodate both , usually an oval , while some later designs used an octorad . While building stadiums in this way means that sports teams and governments can share costs , it also imposes some challenges . In North America , multipurpose stadiums were built primarily during the 1960s and 1970s as shared home stadiums for Major League Baseball and National Football League or Canadian Football League teams . Some stadiums were renovated to allow multipurpose configurations during the 1980s . This type of stadium is associated with an era of suburbanization , in which many sports teams followed their fans out of large cities into areas with cheaper , plentiful land . They were usually built near highways and had large parking lots , but were rarely connected to public transit . As multipurpose stadiums were rarely ideal for both sports usually housed in them , they had fallen out of favor by the 1990s , with the SkyDome that opened in 1989 being the last such stadium completed to accommodate baseball and football . With the completion of the Truman Sports Complex in Kansas City in 1973 , a model for purpose-built stadiums was laid down .",
