  "/wiki/Atlantic_Hockey": "The Atlantic Hockey Association ( AHA ) is an NCAA Men 's Division I Ice Hockey conference which operates primarily in the northeastern United States . It participates in the NCAA 's Division I as an ice hockey-only conference . Unlike several other college athletic conferences , Atlantic Hockey has no women 's division , though it shares some organizational and administrative roles ( and three universities ) with the women's-only College Hockey America . It was formed in 1997 and began play in the 1998-1999 season as the hockey division of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference ( MAAC ) . Within three years , it was granted an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament . However , in 2003 , Iona and Fairfield dropped hockey , leaving Canisius as the only full MAAC member that sponsored hockey . This proved somewhat problematic for MAAC Hockey , since conference bylaws only allowed full members to vote . On June 30 , 2003 , MAAC Hockey broke off from the MAAC and reorganized as Atlantic Hockey .",
