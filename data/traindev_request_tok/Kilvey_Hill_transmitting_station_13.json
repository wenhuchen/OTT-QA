  "/wiki/Adult_contemporary": "In North American music , adult contemporary music ( AC ) is a form of radio-played popular music , ranging from 1960s vocal and 1970s soft rock music to predominantly ballad-heavy music of the present day , with varying degrees of easy listening , pop , soul , rhythm and blues , quiet storm , and rock influence . Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music . Adult contemporary tends to have lush , soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated . It is usually melodic enough to get a listener 's attention , and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music . Like most of pop music , its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse-chorus structure . The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments ( though bass guitar is usually used ) such as acoustic guitars , pianos , saxophones , and sometimes an orchestral set . The electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched . However , recent adult contemporary music may feature synthesizers ( and other electronics , such as drum machines ) . An AC radio station may play mainstream music , but it excludes hip hop , dance tracks , hard rock , and some forms of teen pop , as these are less popular among adults , the target demographic . AC radio often targets the 25-44 age group , the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s . A common practice in recent years of adult contemporary stations is to play less newer music and more hits of the past . This de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart .",

  "/wiki/Jazz": "Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans , United States . It originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , and developed from roots in blues and ragtime . Jazz is seen by many as America 's classical music . Since the 1920s Jazz Age , jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression . It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles , all linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage with a performance orientation . Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes , call and response vocals , polyrhythms and improvisation . Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression , and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime , as well as European military band music . Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as one of America 's original art forms . As jazz spread around the world , it drew on national , regional , and local musical cultures , which gave rise to different styles . New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s , combining earlier brass-band marches , French quadrilles , biguine , ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation . In the 1930s , heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands , Kansas City jazz , a hard-swinging , bluesy , improvisational style and Gypsy jazz ( a style that emphasized musette waltzes ) were the prominent styles . Bebop emerged in the 1940s , shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging musician 's music which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation .",

  "/wiki/Contemporary_hit_radio": "Contemporary hit radio ( also known as CHR , contemporary hits , hit list , current hits , hit music , top 40 , or pop radio ) is a radio format that is common in the United States , Brazil , United Kingdom , Ireland , Canada , New Zealand , Australia , the Philippines , Indonesia , Malaysia , Singapore , China , Hong Kong , Taiwan , Japan , South Korea , Trinidad and Tobago , and South Africa , that focuses on playing current and recurrent popular music as determined by the top 40 music charts .

The term has also been modified to describe top 50 ; top 30 ; top 20 ; top 10 ; hot 100 ( each with its number of songs ) and hot hits radio formats , but carrying more or less the same meaning and having the same creative point of origin with Todd Storz as further refined by Gordon McLendon as well as Bill Drake .

  "/wiki/Popular_music": "Popular music is music with wide appeal that is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry . These forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training . It stands in contrast to both art music and traditional or folk music . Art music was historically disseminated through the performances of written music , although since the beginning of the recording industry , it is also disseminated through recordings . Traditional music forms such as early blues songs or hymns were passed along orally , or to smaller , local audiences . The original application of the term is to music of the 1880s Tin Pan Alley period in the United States . Although popular music sometimes is known as pop music , the two terms are not interchangeable . Popular music is a generic term for a wide variety of genres of music that appeal to the tastes of a large segment of the population , whereas pop music usually refers to a specific musical genre within popular music . Popular music songs and pieces typically have easily singable melodies . The song structure of popular music commonly involves repetition of sections , with the verse and chorus or refrain repeating throughout the song and the bridge providing a contrasting and transitional section within a piece . In the 2000s , with songs and pieces available as digital sound files , it has become easier for music to spread from one country or region to another . Some popular music forms have become global , while others have a wide appeal within the culture of their origin .",

  "/wiki/Rock_music": "Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as rock and roll in the United States in the early 1950s , and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later , particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom . It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll , a style which drew heavily from the genres of blues , rhythm and blues , and from country music . Rock music also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk , and incorporated influences from jazz , classical and other musical styles . Musically , rock has centered on the electric guitar , usually as part of a rock group with electric bass , drums , and one or more singers . Usually , rock is song-based music with a 4/4 time signature using a verse-chorus form , but the genre has become extremely diverse . Like pop music , lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political . By the late 1960s classic rock period , a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged , including hybrids like blues rock , folk rock , country rock , southern rock , raga rock , and jazz-rock , many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock , which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene . New genres that emerged included progressive rock , which extended the artistic elements ; glam rock , which highlighted showmanship and visual style ; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal , which emphasized volume , power , and speed . In the second half of the 1970s , punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down , energetic social and political critiques . Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave , post-punk and eventually alternative rock . From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge , Britpop , and indie rock . Further fusion subgenres have since emerged , including pop punk , electronic rock , rap rock , and rap metal , as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock 's history , including the garage rock/post-punk and techno-pop revivals at the beginning of the 2000s ."
