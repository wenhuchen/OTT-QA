  "/wiki/Table_tennis": "Table tennis , also known as ping-pong , is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball back and forth across a table using small rackets . The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net . Except for the initial serve , the rules are generally as follows : players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table , and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once . A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules . Play is fast and demands quick reactions . Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent 's options , giving the hitter a great advantage . Table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization International Table Tennis Federation ( ITTF ) , founded in 1926 . ITTF currently includes 226 member associations . The table tennis official rules are specified in the ITTF handbook . Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988 , with several event categories . From 1988 until 2004 , these were men 's singles , women 's singles , men 's doubles and women 's doubles . Since 2008 , a team event has been played instead of the doubles .",

The sport was originally created in 1882 by Jigoro Kano ( \u5609\u7d0d\u6cbb\u4e94\u90ce ) as a physical , mental , and moral pedagogy in Japan . Judo 's most prominent feature is its competitive element , where the objective is to either throw or take down an opponent to the ground , immobilize or otherwise subdue an opponent with a pin , or force an opponent to submit with a joint lock or a choke . Strikes and thrusts by hands and feet as well as weapons defences are a part of judo , but only in pre-arranged forms ( kata , \u5f62 ) and are not allowed in judo competition or free practice ( randori , \u4e71\u53d6\u308a ) . A judo practitioner is called a judoka . The philosophy and subsequent pedagogy developed for judo became the model for other modern Japanese martial arts that developed from kory\u016b ( \u53e4\u6d41 , traditional schools ) . Judo also spawned a number of derivative martial arts across the world , such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu , Krav Maga and Sambo .",

It developed from the indigenous Ryukyuan martial arts ( called te ( \u624b ) , hand ; tii in Okinawan ) under the influence of Kung Fu , particularly Fujian White Crane . Karate is now predominantly a striking art using punching , kicking , knee strikes , elbow strikes and open-hand techniques such as knife-hands , spear-hands and palm-heel strikes . Historically , and in some modern styles , grappling , throws , joint locks , restraints and vital-point strikes are also taught . A karate practitioner is called a karateka ( \u7a7a\u624b\u5bb6 ) , and its plural is karateka or karatekas . The Empire of Japan annexed the Ryukyu Kingdom in 1879 . Karate came to the Japanese archipelago in the early 20th century during a time of migration as Ryukyuans , especially from Okinawa , looked for work in Japan . It was systematically taught in Japan after the Taish\u014d era of 1912-1926 . In 1922 the Japanese Ministry of Education invited Gichin Funakoshi to Tokyo to give a karate demonstration . In 1924 Keio University established the first university karate club in mainland Japan , and by 1932 major Japanese universities had karate clubs . In this era of escalating Japanese militarism , the name was changed [ by whom ? ] from \u5510\u624b ( Chinese hand or Tang hand ) to \u7a7a\u624b ( empty hand ) - both of which are pronounced karate in Japanese - to indicate that the Japanese wished to develop the combat form in Japanese style .",
