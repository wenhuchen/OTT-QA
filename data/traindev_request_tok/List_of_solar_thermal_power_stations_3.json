  "/wiki/Sandstone_Solar_Energy_Project": "The Sandstone Solar Energy Project was an up to 1,600 megawatt ( MW ) solar thermal power project with 16 gigawatt-hours of energy storage , planned just to the east of Tonopah , about 170 miles ( 270 km ) northwest of Las Vegas . The project was about up to eight 200 MW solar towers with integrated molten salt energy storage technology . The project , developed by SolarReserve and owned by Sandstone Solar Energy , LLC . was anticipated to cost about $ 5 billion . Planned energy output is 5,600 GW\u00b7h per year . The project includes heliostats that collect and focus the sun 's thermal energy to heat molten salt flowing through a solar power tower . The molten salt circulates from the tower to a storage tank , where it is then used to produce steam and generate electricity . Excess thermal energy is stored in the molten salt and can be used to generate power for up to ten hours , including during the evening hours and when direct sunlight is not available . The storage technology also eliminates the need for any backup fossil fuels , such as natural gas . Estimated construction start was in 2022 . Each tower was be constructed within a 24-month construction cycle , staggered 6 months , expecting about 5 and half years to complete . In March 2019 , the U.S. Bureau of Land Management confirmed that Sandstone Solar Energy has withdrawn its application for a construction and operation right-of-way on federal land for this project .",

In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia .
