  "/wiki/Iodine_deficiency": "Iodine deficiency is a lack of the trace element iodine , an essential nutrient in the diet . It may result in metabolic problems such as goiter , sometimes as an endemic goiter as well as cretinism due to untreated congenital hypothyroidism , which results in developmental delays and other health problems . Iodine deficiency is an important global health issue , especially for fertile and pregnant women . It is also a preventable cause of intellectual disability . Iodine is an essential dietary mineral for neurodevelopment among offsprings and toddlers . The thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine contain iodine . In areas where there is little iodine in the diet , typically remote inland areas where no marine foods are eaten , iodine deficiency is common . It is also common in mountainous regions of the world where food is grown in iodine-poor soil . Prevention includes adding small amounts of iodine to table salt , a product known as iodized salt . Iodine compounds have also been added to other foodstuffs , such as flour , water and milk , in areas of deficiency . Seafood is also a well known source of iodine . In the U.S. , the use of iodine has decreased over concerns of overdoses since mid-20th century , and the iodine antagonists bromine , perchlorate and fluoride have become more ubiquitous .",
  "/wiki/Hyperplasia": "Hyperplasia ( from ancient Greek \u1f51\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1 huper , over + \u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 plasis , formation ) , or hypergenesis , is an increase in the amount of organic tissue that results from cell proliferation . It may lead to the gross enlargement of an organ , and the term is sometimes confused with benign neoplasia or benign tumor . Hyperplasia is a common preneoplastic response to stimulus . Microscopically , cells resemble normal cells but are increased in numbers . Sometimes cells may also be increased in size ( hypertrophy ) . Hyperplasia is different from hypertrophy in that the adaptive cell change in hypertrophy is an increase in the size of cells , whereas hyperplasia involves an increase in the number of cells .",
  "/wiki/Hypothyroidism": "Hypothyroidism , also called underactive thyroid or low thyroid , is a disorder of the endocrine system in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone . It can cause a number of symptoms , such as poor ability to tolerate cold , a feeling of tiredness , constipation , depression , and weight gain . Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goiter . Untreated cases of hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby or congenital iodine deficiency syndrome . Worldwide , too little iodine in the diet is the most common cause of hypothyroidism . Hashimoto 's thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in countries with sufficient dietary iodine . Less common causes include previous treatment with radioactive iodine , injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland , certain medications , a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth , or previous thyroid surgery . The diagnosis of hypothyroidism , when suspected , can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) and thyroxine levels . Salt iodization has prevented hypothyroidism in many populations . Thyroid hormone replacement with levothyroxine treats hypothyroidism . Medical professionals adjust the dose according to symptoms and normalization of the thyroxine and TSH levels . Thyroid medication is safe in pregnancy .",
  "/wiki/Congenital_hypothyroidism": "Congenital hypothyroidism ( CH ) is thyroid hormone deficiency present at birth . If untreated for several months after birth , severe congenital hypothyroidism can lead to growth failure and permanent intellectual disability . Infants born with congenital hypothyroidism may show no effects , or may display mild effects that often go unrecognized as a problem . Significant deficiency may cause excessive sleeping , reduced interest in nursing , poor muscle tone , low or hoarse cry , infrequent bowel movements , significant jaundice , and low body temperature . Causes of congenital hypothyroidism include iodine deficiency and a developmental defect in the thyroid gland , either due to a genetic defect or of unknown cause . Treatment consists of a daily dose of thyroid hormone ( thyroxine ) by mouth . Because the treatment is simple , effective , and inexpensive , most of the developed world utilizes newborn screening with blood thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) levels to detect congenital hypothyroidism . Most children with congenital hypothyroidism correctly treated with thyroxine grow and develop normally in all respects . Approximately 1 in 4000 newborns has a severe deficiency of thyroid function ; a greater number have a mild or moderate deficiency .",
  "/wiki/Inborn_errors_of_metabolism": "Inborn errors of metabolism form a large class of genetic diseases involving congenital disorders of metabolism . The majority are due to defects of single genes that code for enzymes that facilitate conversion of various substances ( substrates ) into others ( products ) . In most of the disorders , problems arise due to accumulation of substances which are toxic or interfere with normal function , or to the effects of reduced ability to synthesize essential compounds . Inborn errors of metabolism are now often referred to as congenital metabolic diseases or inherited metabolic disorders . The term inborn errors of metabolism was coined by a British physician , Archibald Garrod ( 1857-1936 ) , in 1908 . He is known for work that prefigured the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis , based on his studies on the nature and inheritance of alkaptonuria . His seminal text , Inborn Errors of Metabolism was published in 1923 .",
  "/wiki/Thyroid_hormones": "Thyroid hormones are two hormones produced and released by the thyroid gland , namely triiodothyronine ( T3 ) and thyroxine ( T4 ) . They are tyrosine-based hormones that are primarily responsible for regulation of metabolism . T3 and T4 are partially composed of iodine . A deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of T3 and T4 , enlarges the thyroid tissue and will cause the disease known as simple goitre . The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine ( T4 ) , which has a longer half-life than T3 . In humans , the ratio of T4 to T3 released into the blood is approximately 14:1 . T4 is converted to the active T3 ( three to four times more potent than T4 ) within cells by deiodinases ( 5\u2032-iodinase ) . These are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine ( T1a ) and thyronamine ( T0a ) . All three isoforms of the deiodinases are selenium-containing enzymes , thus dietary selenium is essential for T3 production . Edward Calvin Kendall was responsible for the isolation of thyroxine in 1915 . In 2016 levothyroxine , a manufactured form of thyroxine , was the most prescribed medication in the United States with more than 114 million prescriptions .",
  "/wiki/Hashimoto's_thyroiditis": "Hashimoto 's thyroiditis , also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and Hashimoto 's disease , is an autoimmune disease in which the thyroid gland is gradually destroyed . Early on there may be no symptoms . Over time the thyroid may enlarge , forming a painless goiter . Some people eventually develop hypothyroidism with accompanying weight gain , feeling tired , constipation , depression , and general pains . After many years the thyroid typically shrinks in size . Potential complications include thyroid lymphoma . Hashimoto 's thyroiditis is thought to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors . Risk factors include a family history of the condition and having another autoimmune disease . Diagnosis is confirmed with blood tests for TSH , T4 , and anti-thyroid autoantibodies . Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include Graves disease and nontoxic nodular goiter . Hashimoto 's thyroiditis is typically treated with levothyroxine . If hypothyroidism is not present , some may recommend no treatment while others may treat to try to reduce the size of the goiter .",
  "/wiki/Autoimmune_disease": "An autoimmune disease is a condition arising from an abnormal immune response to a normal body part . There are at least 80 types of autoimmune diseases . Nearly any body part can be involved . Common symptoms include low grade fever and feeling tired . Often symptoms come and go . The cause is generally unknown . Some autoimmune diseases such as lupus run in families , and certain cases may be triggered by infections or other environmental factors . Some common diseases that are generally considered autoimmune include celiac disease , diabetes mellitus type 1 , Graves ' disease , inflammatory bowel disease , multiple sclerosis , psoriasis , rheumatoid arthritis , and systemic lupus erythematosus . The diagnosis can be difficult to determine . Treatment depends on the type and severity of the condition . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) and immunosuppressants are often used . Intravenous immunoglobulin may also occasionally be used .",
  "/wiki/Lymphocyte": "A lymphocyte is one of the subtypes of a white blood cell in a vertebrate 's immune system . Lymphocytes include natural killer cells ( which function in cell-mediated , cytotoxic innate immunity ) , T cells ( for cell-mediated , cytotoxic adaptive immunity ) , and B cells ( for humoral , antibody-driven adaptive immunity ) . They are the main type of cell found in lymph , which prompted the name lymphocyte .",
  "/wiki/Lobulated": "A lobulation is an appearance resembling lobules . For instance , the thyroid gland may become large and lobulated in Hashimoto 's thyroiditis . Fetal lobulation , also known as fetal lobation , of the kidney is evident on scanning . Fetal lobation is a normal stage in the development of the kidney . In the adult a normal anatomic variant is that of persistent fetal lobulation of the kidney that may be mistaken for a tumour .",

  "/wiki/Thyroid_stimulating_hormone": "Thyroid-stimulating hormone ( also known as thyrotropin , thyrotropic hormone , or abbreviated TSH ) is a pituitary hormone that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroxine ( T4 ) , and then triiodothyronine ( T3 ) which stimulates the metabolism of almost every tissue in the body . It is a glycoprotein hormone produced by thyrotrope cells in the anterior pituitary gland , which regulates the endocrine function of the thyroid . In 1916 , Bennett M. Allen and Philip E. Smith found that the pituitary contained a thyrotropic substance .",
  "/wiki/Graves'_disease": "Graves ' disease , also known as toxic diffuse goiter , is an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid . It frequently results in and is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism . It also often results in an enlarged thyroid . Signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism may include irritability , muscle weakness , sleeping problems , a fast heartbeat , poor tolerance of heat , diarrhea and unintentional weight loss . Other symptoms may include thickening of the skin on the shins , known as pretibial myxedema , and eye bulging , a condition caused by Graves ' ophthalmopathy . About 25 to 80% of people with the condition develop eye problems . The exact cause is unclear ; however , it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors . A person is more likely to be affected if they have a family member with the disease . If one twin is affected , a 30% chance exists that the other twin will also have the disease . The onset of disease may be triggered by physical or emotional stress , infection or giving birth . Those with other autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis are more likely to be affected . Smoking increases the risk of disease and may worsen eye problems .",
  "/wiki/Autoantibodies": "An autoantibody is an antibody ( a type of protein ) produced by the immune system that is directed against one or more of the individual 's own proteins . Many autoimmune diseases ( notably lupus erythematosus ) are caused by such autoantibodies .",

  "/wiki/Hyperthyroidism": "Hyperthyroidism is the condition that occurs due to excessive production of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland . Thyrotoxicosis is the condition that occurs due to excessive thyroid hormone of any cause and therefore includes hyperthyroidism . Some , however , use the terms interchangeably . Signs and symptoms vary between people and may include irritability , muscle weakness , sleeping problems , a fast heartbeat , heat intolerance , diarrhea , enlargement of the thyroid , hand tremor , and weight loss . Symptoms are typically less severe in the elderly and during pregnancy . An uncommon complication is thyroid storm in which an event such as an infection results in worsening symptoms such as confusion and a high temperature and often results in death . The opposite is hypothyroidism , when the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone . Graves ' disease is the cause of about 50% to 80% of the cases of hyperthyroidism in the United States . Other causes include multinodular goiter , toxic adenoma , inflammation of the thyroid , eating too much iodine , and too much synthetic thyroid hormone . A less common cause is a pituitary adenoma . The diagnosis may be suspected based on signs and symptoms and then confirmed with blood tests . Typically blood tests show a low thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) and raised T3 or T4 .",
  "/wiki/Thyroiditis": "Thyroiditis is the inflammation of the thyroid gland . The thyroid gland is located on the front of the neck below the laryngeal prominence , and makes hormones that control metabolism .",
  "/wiki/Inflammation": "Inflammation ( from Latin : inflammatio ) is part of the complex biological response of body tissues to harmful stimuli , such as pathogens , damaged cells , or irritants , and is a protective response involving immune cells , blood vessels , and molecular mediators . The function of inflammation is to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury , clear out necrotic cells and tissues damaged from the original insult and the inflammatory process , and initiate tissue repair . The five classical signs of inflammation are heat , pain , redness , swelling , and loss of function ( Latin calor , dolor , rubor , tumor , and functio laesa ) . Inflammation is a generic response , and therefore it is considered as a mechanism of innate immunity , as compared to adaptive immunity , which is specific for each pathogen . Too little inflammation could lead to progressive tissue destruction by the harmful stimulus ( e.g . bacteria ) and compromise the survival of the organism . In contrast , chronic inflammation is associated with various diseases , such as hay fever , periodontal disease , atherosclerosis , and osteoarthritis . Inflammation can be classified as either acute or chronic . Acute inflammation is the initial response of the body to harmful stimuli and is achieved by the increased movement of plasma and leukocytes ( especially granulocytes ) from the blood into the injured tissues . A series of biochemical events propagates and matures the inflammatory response , involving the local vascular system , the immune system , and various cells within the injured tissue . Prolonged inflammation , known as chronic inflammation , leads to a progressive shift in the type of cells present at the site of inflammation , such as mononuclear cells , and is characterized by simultaneous destruction and healing of the tissue from the inflammatory process . Inflammation is not a synonym for infection .",
  "/wiki/Thyroid_cancer": "Thyroid cancer is cancer that develops from the tissues of the thyroid gland . It is a disease in which cells grow abnormally and have the potential to spread to other parts of the body . Symptoms can include swelling or a lump in the neck . Cancer can also occur in the thyroid after spread from other locations , in which case it is not classified as thyroid cancer . Risk factors include radiation exposure at a young age , having an enlarged thyroid , and family history . The four main types are papillary thyroid cancer , follicular thyroid cancer , medullary thyroid cancer , and anaplastic thyroid cancer . Diagnosis is often based on ultrasound and fine needle aspiration . Screening people without symptoms and at normal risk for the disease is not recommended as of 2017 . Treatment options may include surgery , radiation therapy including radioactive iodine , chemotherapy , thyroid hormone , targeted therapy , and watchful waiting . Surgery may involve removing part or all of the thyroid . Five-year survival rates are 98% in the United States . Globally as of 2015 , 3.2 million people have thyroid cancer .",
  "/wiki/Thyroid_neoplasm": "Thyroid neoplasm is a neoplasm or tumor of the thyroid . It can be a benign tumor such as thyroid adenoma , or it can be a malignant neoplasm ( thyroid cancer ) , such as papillary , follicular , medullary or anaplastic thyroid cancer . Most patients are 25 to 65 years of age when first diagnosed ; women are more affected than men . The estimated number of new cases of thyroid cancer in the United States in 2010 is 44,670 compared to only 1,690 deaths . Of all thyroid nodules discovered , only about 5 percent are cancerous , and under 3 percent of those result in fatalities .",
  "/wiki/Thyroid_hormone_insensitivity": "Thyroid hormone resistance ( also resistance to thyroid hormone ( RTH ) , and sometimes Refetoff syndrome ) describes a rare syndrome in which the thyroid hormone levels are elevated but the thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) level is not suppressed , or not completely suppressed as would be expected . The first report of the condition appeared in 1967 . Essentially this is decreased end organ responsiveness to thyroid hormones . A new term impaired sensitivity to thyroid hormone has been suggested in March 2014 by Refetoff et al ."
