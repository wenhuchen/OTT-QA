  "/wiki/CKAT": "CKAT is a Canadian radio station , broadcasting at 600 AM in North Bay , Ontario . The station , owned by Rogers Communications , airs a country music , news and sports format . The station originally launched in 1967 at 93.7 FM , and was acquired by Northern Broadcasting , the owners of CFCH . In 1979 , CKAT adopted a country music format and moved to 101.9 FM . In 1980 , CKAT and CFCH were sold to Telemedia . In 1996 , Telemedia swapped the stations in a move similar to its 1990 switch involving CKSO and CIGM in Sudbury . CKAT took over CFCH 's AM frequency , and CFCH moved to the FM station and adopted the new callsign CKFX . In 2002 , Telemedia sold the stations to Standard Broadcasting , who shortly sold them to Rogers . In fall 2005 , CKAT and CIGM underwent a format change , with country music cut back ( although not entirely eliminated ) in favour of increased news and sports programming . Since the change , both stations used the following slogans such as Today 's Country , News Leader and Sports Leader . The station 's general manager is Peter McKeown , a former morning man for many years on CHUR and CKAT . In 2009 , CKAT 's sister station CIGM in Sudbury ( under the ownership of Rogers Media ) was acquired by Newcap Radio and then converted the station to the FM dial .",
  "/wiki/Country_music": "Country music , also known as country and western ( or simply country ) , and hillbilly music , is a genre of popular music that takes its roots from genres such as American folk music ( especially Appalachian and Western music ) and blues . Its popularized roots originate in the Southern United States of the early 1920s . Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms , folk lyrics , and harmonies mostly accompanied by string instruments such as banjos , electric and acoustic guitars , steel guitars ( such as pedal steels and dobros ) , and fiddles as well as harmonicas . Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history . According to Lindsey Starnes , the term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music ; it came to encompass Western music , which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots , in the mid-20th century . In 2009 in the United States , country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute , and second most popular in the morning commute . The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres . The origins of country music are found in the folk music of working class Americans and/or blue-collar American life , who blended popular songs , Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes , traditional English ballads , cowboy songs , and the musical traditions of various groups of European immigrants .",
  "/wiki/News_radio": "All-news radio is a radio format devoted entirely to the discussion and broadcast of news . All-news radio is available in both local and syndicated forms , and is carried on both major US satellite radio networks . All-news stations can run the gamut from simulcasting an all-news television station like CNN , to a rip and read headline service , to stations that include live coverage of news events and long-form public affairs programming . Many stations brand themselves Newsradio but only run news during the morning and afternoon drive times , or in some cases , broadcast talk radio shows with frequent news updates . These stations are properly labeled as news/talk stations . Also , some National Public Radio stations identify themselves as News and Information stations , which means that in addition to running the NPR news magazines such as Morning Edition and All Things Considered , they run other information and public affairs programs .",
  "/wiki/Sports_radio": "Sports radio ( or sports talk radio ) is a radio format devoted entirely to discussion and broadcasting of sporting events . A widespread programming genre that has a narrow audience appeal , sports radio is characterized by an often-boisterous on-air style and extensive debate and analysis by both hosts and callers . Many sports talk stations also carry play-by-play ( live commentary ) of local sports teams as part of their regular programming . Hosted by Bill Mazer , the first sports talk radio show in history launched in March 1964 on New York 's WNBC ( AM ) . Soon after WNBC launched its program , in 1965 Seton Hall University 's radio station , WSOU , started Hall Line , a call-in sports radio talk show focusing on the team 's basketball program . Having celebrated its 50th anniversary on air during the 2015-2016 season , Hall Line , which broadcasts to central and northern New Jersey as well as all five boroughs of New York , is the oldest and longest running sports talk call-in show in the NY-NJ Metropolitan area , and is believed to be the oldest in the nation . Enterprise Radio Network became the first national all-sports network , operating out of Avon , Connecticut , from New Year 's Day 1981 through late September of that year before going out of business . ER had two channels , one for talk and a second for updates and play-by-play . ER 's talk lineup included current New York Yankees voice John Sterling , New York Mets radio host Ed Coleman and former big-league pitcher Bill Denehy . Sports talk is available in local , network and syndicated forms , is available in multiple languages , and is carried in multiple forms on both major North American satellite radio networks . In the United States , most sports talk-formatted radio stations air syndicated programming from ESPN Radio , SB Nation Radio , Sports Byline USA , Fox Sports Radio , CBS Sports Radio , or NBC Sports Radio , while in the Spanish language , ESPN Deportes Radio is the largest current network . In contrast , Canadian sports talk stations may carry a national brand ( such as TSN Radio or Sportsnet Radio ) but carry mostly local programming , with American-based shows filling in gaps .",

  "/wiki/Public_broadcasting": "Public broadcasting involves radio , television and other electronic-media outlets whose primary mission is public service . In many countries of the world , funding comes from governments , especially via annual fees charged on receivers . In the United States , public broadcasters may receive some funding from both federal and state sources , but generally most of their financial support comes from underwriting by foundations and businesses ( ranging from small shops to corporations ) , along with audience contributions via pledge drives . The great majority operate as private not-for-profit corporations . [ citation needed ] Public broadcasting may be nationally or locally operated , depending on the country and the station . In some countries a single organization runs public broadcasting . Other countries have multiple public-broadcasting organizations operating regionally or in different languages . Historically , public broadcasting was once the dominant or only form of broadcasting in many countries ( with the notable exception of the United States ) . Commercial broadcasting now also exists in most of these countries ; the number of countries with only public broadcasting declined substantially during the latter part of the 20th century .

  "/wiki/Talk_radio": "Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues and consisting entirely or almost entirely of original spoken word content rather than outside music . Most shows are regularly hosted by a single individual , and often feature interviews with a number of different guests . Talk radio typically includes an element of listener participation , usually by broadcasting live conversations between the host and listeners who call in ( usually via telephone ) to the show . Listener contributions are usually screened by a show 's producers in order to maximize audience interest and , in the case of commercial talk radio , to attract advertisers . Generally , the shows are organized into segments , each separated by a pause for advertisements ; however , in public or non-commercial radio , music is sometimes played in place of commercials to separate the program segments . Variations of talk radio include conservative talk , hot talk , liberal talk ( increasingly known as progressive talk ) and sports talk . While talk radio has historically been associated with broadcast radio , starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of live Internet website streaming and podcasts . Now , it is possible for an individual to use a variety of services to host an Internet-based talk-radio show without carriage by a traditional radio station . In addition , TV programming from talk and news outlets such as BBC , CNN , Bloomberg and Fox is now often available expanding the world of talk radio further . Talk radio listening is enjoyed not only on radios , but a wide variety of other devices and services including PCs using iTunes , station directories such as TuneIn , show directory smartphones with apps such as Stitcher and time-shifting services like DAR.fm .",

It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire , as did all Romance languages . French evolved from Gallo-Romance , the spoken Latin in Gaul , and more specifically in Northern Gaul . Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders . Today , owing to France 's past overseas expansion , there are numerous French-based creole languages , most notably Haitian Creole . A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French . French is an official language in 29 countries across multiple continents , most of which are members of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie ( OIF ) , the community of 84 countries which share the official use or teaching of French . It is spoken as a first language ( in descending order of the number of speakers ) in France , the Canadian provinces of Quebec , Ontario and New Brunswick as well as other Francophone regions , Belgium ( Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region ) , western Switzerland ( cantons of Bern , Fribourg , Geneva , Jura , Neuch\u00e2tel , Vaud , Valais ) , Monaco , partly in Luxembourg , the states of Louisiana , Maine , New Hampshire and Vermont in the United States , and in northwestern Italy ( region of Aosta Valley ) , and by various communities elsewhere . In 2015 , approximately 40% of the francophone population ( including L2 and partial speakers ) lived in Europe , 35% in sub-Saharan Africa , 15% in North Africa and the Middle East , 8% in the Americas , and 1% in Asia and Oceania .

  "/wiki/Greater_Sudbury": "Sudbury , officially Greater Sudbury ( French : Grand-Sudbury ) , is a city in Ontario , Canada . It is the largest city in Northern Ontario by population , with a population of 161,531 at the 2016 Canadian Census . By land area , it is the largest in Ontario and the fifth largest in Canada . It is administratively a Unitary authority , and thus not part of any district , county , or regional municipality . The Sudbury region was inhabited by the Ojibwe people of the Algonquin group for thousands of years prior to the founding of Sudbury following the discovery of nickel ore in 1883 during the construction of the transcontinental railway . Greater Sudbury was formed in 2001 by merging the cities and towns of the former Regional Municipality of Sudbury with several previously unincorporated townships . Being located inland , the local climate is extremely seasonal with average January lows of around \u221218 \u00b0C ( 0 \u00b0F ) and average July highs of 25 \u00b0C ( 77 \u00b0F ) . The population resides in an urban core and many smaller communities scattered around 330 lakes and among hills of rock blackened by historical smelting activity . Sudbury was once a major lumber centre and a world leader in nickel mining . Mining and related industries dominated the economy for much of the 20th century . The two major mining companies which shaped the history of Sudbury were Inco , now Vale Limited , which employed more than 25% of the population by the 1970s , and Falconbridge , now Glencore . Sudbury has since expanded from its resource-based economy to emerge as the major retail , economic , health and educational centre for Northeastern Ontario .",

Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music . Adult contemporary tends to have lush , soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated . It is usually melodic enough to get a listener 's attention , and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music . Like most of pop music , its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse-chorus structure . The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments ( though bass guitar is usually used ) such as acoustic guitars , pianos , saxophones , and sometimes an orchestral set . The electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched . However , recent adult contemporary music may feature synthesizers ( and other electronics , such as drum machines ) .

  "/wiki/Classic_hits": "Classic hits is a radio format which generally includes songs from the top 40 music charts from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s , with music from the 1980s serving as the core of the format . Music that was popularized by MTV in the early 1980s and the nostalgia behind it is a major driver to the format . It is considered the successor to the oldies format , a collection of top 40 songs from the late 1950s through the late 1970s that was once extremely popular in the United States . The term is sometimes incorrectly used as a synonym for the adult hits format , which uses a slightly newer music library stretching from all decades to the present with a major focus on 1990s and 2000s rock and alternative songs . In addition , adult hits stations tend to have larger playlists , playing a given song only a few times per week , compared to the tighter libraries on classic hits stations . For example , KRTH , a classic hits station in Los Angeles , plays power songs up to 30 times a week , which is another differentiator compared to other formats that share songs with classic hits libraries . The classic hits format has become extremely popular in the last few years with stations like KRTH , WCBS-FM in New York , and WLS-FM in Chicago having successful ratings with this model . Classic hits was named format of the summer of 2018 by Nielsen Audio 's research team emphasizing the huge popularity of the format . In addition , the Millennial generation is listening to this format in record numbers , according to a Nielsen report . As of December 2019 there are now over 1,100 classic hits stations in the United States , the largest amount in format history ."
