  "/wiki/Stuart_Davenport": "Stuart Davenport ( born 21 September 1962 in Auckland , New Zealand ) is a former professional squash player from New Zealand . He reached the World No . 3 ranking in 1987 . Davenport learned to play squash in Christchurch , and was an outstanding junior ( particularly after a growth spurt aided the physical side of his game after the age of 15 ) . Coached by the legendary Dardir El Bakary , Davenport developed an excellent attacking game with the full array of volleys and attacking strokeplay . In 1980 he led the New Zealand Junior team to third place at the World Junior Championship in Sweden ( after finishing third himself in the individual event ) . That same year he won the British under-19 title , and in 1982 took out the British under-23 championships . A distinguished senior professional career followed , highlights of which included finishing third in the World Individual Championships held in New Zealand in 1983 , and several outstanding efforts for New Zealand in World Teams Championships events .",
  "/wiki/Chris_Dittmar": "Chris Dittmar ( born 16 January 1964 in Adelaide , South Australia ) is an Australian sports commentator who was formerly the World No . 1-ranked men 's squash player . Dittmar is widely considered to be the best player never to have won one of squash 's two biggest titles . He finished runner-up at the World Open five times - in 1983 , 1987 , 1989 , 1990 and 1992 - and was runner-up at the British Open twice - in 1985 and 1993 . Dittmar was perhaps unlucky to have been around during the same era as two great Pakistani players - Jahangir Khan and Jansher Khan . Dittmar provided probably the most consistent challenge of any player to the dominance of these two greats during the 1980s and early-1990s , but never quite managed to break their iron grip on the game . In all seven of the World Open and British Open finals he played in , Dittmar lost to one of the two Khans . There were several occasions in his career when Dittmar managed to beat one of the Khans in a semi-final round , only to lose to the other in the final . Dittmar won what is remembered as one of the sport 's classic matches against Jahangir Khan in the semi-finals of the 1989 World Open in Kuala Lumpur , taking the fifth set 15-13 . The following day in the final , he took a two set lead against Jansher , but tired as the long match wore on and eventually lost in five sets . Dittmar has claimed that the proudest moment of his career came in captaining the Australian team to victory in World Team Squash Championships in 1989 . Australia beat Pakistan 3-0 in the final , with Dittmar contributing a win over Jahangir Khan .",
