( They also had 1962 All-Pro linebackers Dan Currie and Bill Forester . ) Green Bay gave up just 10.8 points per game , shutting out opponents three times . The Packers held opposing QBs to a 43.5 rating , due , in part , to Wood 's league-leading nine interceptions . The Packers ' defense allowed the Giants 291 yards in the NFL championship game , but held the Giants offense scoreless as the Packers won , 16-7 ( New York scored on a blocked punt ) . The Packers ' +267 point differential ( points scored vs. points against ) in 1962 is the best total of any NFL team in the 1960s .

The Oilers went from last place in the East in 1966 ( 3-11 ) to first in 1967 , beating out the New York Jets by a game . Most of the Oilers ' offense centered on big fullback Hoyle Granger , and a midseason quarterback trade for the shifty Pete Beathard ( sending their own starter , Jacky Lee , to the defending champion Kansas City Chiefs ) proved to be the spark that turned Houston 's season around . The two teams had met three weeks earlier in Houston , with Oakland winning 19-7 to clinch the Western division title .

His team backed up his words by controlling most of the game , building a 16-0 lead by the fourth quarter off of a touchdown run by Matt Snell and three field goals by Jim Turner . Colts quarterback Earl Morrall threw three interceptions before being replaced by Johnny Unitas , who then led Baltimore to its only touchdown , during the last few minutes of the game .

  "/wiki/2015_Carolina_Panthers_season": "The 2015 Carolina Panthers season was the franchise 's 21st season in the National Football League ( NFL ) and their fifth under head coach Ron Rivera . This season marked the first time in team history they played on Thanksgiving . Despite waiving longtime running back and franchise rushing leader DeAngelo Williams and losing top wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin to a torn ACL in the preseason , the Panthers had their best regular season in franchise history and one of the best regular seasons in NFL history . They finished the regular season 15-1 , becoming the seventh team to win at least 15 regular season games since the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in 1978 . The Panthers joined the 1984 San Francisco 49ers , 1985 Chicago Bears ( for whom Rivera played as a linebacker ) , 1998 Minnesota Vikings , 2004 Pittsburgh Steelers , 2007 New England Patriots ( who were a perfect 16-0 in the regular season ) and the 2011 Green Bay Packers as the only teams to accomplish this feat . Carolina started the season 14-0 , not only setting franchise records for the best start and the longest single-season winning streak , but also posting the best start to a season by an NFC team since the NFL-AFL merger , breaking the 13-0 record previously shared with the 2009 New Orleans Saints and the aforementioned 2011 Packers . They joined the 1972 Miami Dolphins , 2007 Patriots and 2009 Indianapolis Colts , all from the AFC , as the only teams to reach 14-0 . Carolina clinched their third straight NFC South title on December 6 , when the Atlanta Falcons lost earlier that day , becoming the first team to clinch a playoff berth that season , and giving the Panthers a home playoff game for the third consecutive year . The Panthers ' undefeated streak came to an end at the hands of the Falcons in a Week 16 rematch . A week later , however , Carolina routed the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to finish 15-1 , giving the Panthers home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs for the first time in franchise history . The Panthers had the league 's top offense , and quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) . In the playoffs , the Panthers defeated the Seattle Seahawks 31-24 in the divisional round , avenging their elimination at the hands of the Seahawks from the previous season .",
  "/wiki/Super_Bowl_50": "Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion of the National Football League ( NFL ) for the 2015 season . The American Football Conference ( AFC ) champions Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference ( NFC ) champions Carolina Panthers , 24-10 . The game was played on February 7 , 2016 , at Levi 's Stadium in Santa Clara , California , in the San Francisco Bay Area . As this was the 50th Super Bowl game , the league emphasized the golden anniversary with various gold-themed initiatives during the 2015 season , as well as suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals ( under which the game would have been known as Super Bowl L ) , so the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals 5 and 0 . The Panthers finished the regular season with a 15-1 record , racking up the league 's top offense , and quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) . They defeated the Arizona Cardinals 49-15 in the NFC Championship Game and advanced to their second Super Bowl appearance since the franchise began playing in 1995 . The Broncos finished the regular season with a 12-4 record , bolstered by having the league 's top defense . The Broncos defeated the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots 20-18 in the AFC Championship Game joining the Patriots , Dallas Cowboys , and Pittsburgh Steelers as one of four teams that have made eight appearances in the Super Bowl . This record would later be broken the next season , in 2017 , when the Patriots advanced to their ninth Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl LI . The Broncos took an early lead in Super Bowl 50 and never trailed . Denver recorded seven sacks and forced four turnovers . Carolina likewise kept pace by recording five sacks and forcing two turnovers ."
