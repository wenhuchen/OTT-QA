  "/wiki/Jesse_Bishop": "Jesse Walter Bishop ( March 1 , 1933 - October 22 , 1979 ) was convicted of the murder of David Ballard , aged 22 . In 1977 , Bishop was in the process of robbing El Morocco Casino , a Las Vegas Strip casino , when he was interrupted by Ballard , who had left his nearby wedding reception to intervene . According to a witness , Bishop shot Ballard like a dog . He voluntarily waived appeals following his conviction and was executed in 1979 by the State of Nevada by gas chamber at the age of 46 . He became the first person to be executed in Nevada since 1976 when the death penalty was reinstated , and the third person to be executed in the United States since 1976 , after Gary Gilmore and John Arthur Spenkelink . He was also the last inmate in Nevada to be executed by the gas chamber . Executions thereafter have been carried out by lethal injection in the same chamber . After Bishop 's execution , prison director Charles Wolff said that Bishop was like an iceman and as tough as nails to the end . Bishop had spent twenty years of his life incarcerated for various felony offenses and bragged about having committed an estimated eighteen homicides , most of them drug related .",
  "/wiki/Murder": "Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse , especially the unlawful killing of another human with malice aforethought . This state of mind may , depending upon the jurisdiction , distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide , such as manslaughter . Manslaughter is a killing committed in the absence of malice , brought about by reasonable provocation , or diminished capacity . Involuntary manslaughter , where it is recognized , is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent , recklessness . Most societies consider murder to be an extremely serious crime , and thus that a person convicted of murder should receive harsh punishments for the purposes of retribution , deterrence , rehabilitation , or incapacitation . In most countries , a person convicted of murder generally faces a long-term prison sentence , possibly a life sentence ; and in a few , the death penalty may be imposed .",

  "/wiki/Life_imprisonment": "Life imprisonment ( also known as imprisonment for life , life in prison , whole-life order , a life sentence , a life term , lifelong incarceration , life incarceration or simply life ) is any sentence of imprisonment for a crime under which convicted persons are to remain in prison either for the rest of their natural life or until paroled or otherwise commuted to a fixed term . Crimes for which , in some countries , a person could receive this sentence include murder , attempted murder , conspiracy to commit murder , blasphemy , apostasy , terrorism , severe child abuse , rape , child rape , espionage , treason , high treason , drug dealing , drug trafficking , drug possession , human trafficking , severe cases of fraud , severe cases of financial crimes , aggravated criminal damage in English law , and aggravated cases of arson , kidnapping , burglary , or robbery which result in death or grievous bodily harm , piracy , aircraft hijacking , and in certain cases genocide , ethnic cleansing , crimes against humanity , certain war crimes or any three felonies in case of three strikes law . Life imprisonment ( as a maximum term ) can also be imposed , in certain countries , for traffic offenses causing death . The life sentence does not exist in all countries : Portugal was the first to abolish life imprisonment , in 1884 . Where life imprisonment is a possible sentence , there may also exist formal mechanisms for requesting parole after a certain period of prison time . This means that a convict could be entitled to spend the rest of the sentence ( until that individual dies ) outside prison . Early release is usually conditional on past and future conduct , possibly with certain restrictions or obligations . In contrast , when a fixed term of imprisonment has ended , the convict is free . The length of time served and the conditions surrounding parole vary . Being eligible for parole does not necessarily ensure that parole will be granted . In some countries , including Sweden , parole does not exist but a life sentence may - after a successful application - be commuted to a fixed-term sentence , after which the culprit is released as if the sentence served was that originally imposed . In many countries around the world , particularly in the Commonwealth , courts have the authority to pass prison terms which may amount to de facto life imprisonment .",

  "/wiki/Jimmy_Lerner": "Jimmy Lerner was born June 22 , 1951 and raised in Brooklyn , New York . He spent 18 years as a Pacific Bell ( now part of AT & T ) marketing executive , served for the U.S. Army in Panama , received an M.B.A. and spent time as a taxicab driver . He published his first book in 2002 , You Got Nothing Coming , based on his experiences serving a 2\u00bd year sentence in a Nevada State Prison for the voluntary manslaughter of Mark Slavin in 1998 . In his book Lerner used a pseudonym , Dwayne Hassleman for Slavin . According to Lerner 's account , Slavin was a seemingly ordinary person , but drug addiction left him prone to erratic and often violent behavior . When the two men visited Reno , Nevada to try their luck at the blackjack tables , Slavin assaulted Lerner , then tried to kill him in their room at the Sundowner Hotel and Casino . After Slavin threatened Lerner 's two daughters , Lerner killed Slavin using a belt and a plastic bag . He then called 9-1-1 from the room , and was taken into custody shortly after . Since there was nobody else in the room at the time , Lerner 's version of events could not be verified . The police report and physical evidence contained evidence in conflict with Lerner 's version of events . Slavin had been beaten badly : his eyes were swollen shut and bones protruded through his face . The shapes of a turtle and a steer 's head - decorations from Slavin 's belt - were imprinted on his neck .",

  "/wiki/Andriza_Mircovich": "Andriza ( or Andrew ) Mircovich ( c. 1879 - May 14 , 1913 ) was an Austro-Hungarian national of Montenegrin descent . He was the only prisoner ever to be executed by shooting in the state of Nevada . He had been sentenced to death for the premeditated murder of John Gregovich in Tonopah , Nevada . Mircovich felt that he was owed more money from Gregovich 's administration of his late cousin 's estate and resorted to settling the matter by stabbing Gregovich to death . A 1911 statute was passed by the Nevada Legislature that allowed a death row inmate to opt to die by shooting or hanging ; that statute was repealed in 1921 . Mircovich was insistent on shooting , claiming that hanging often took too long . After the Nevada State Prison warden , George W. Cowing , was unable to find five men to form a firing squad , a shooting machine was requisitioned and built to carry out the execution .",

Parsons hitched a ride with Ernest in California and stabbed him to death at a remote rest area in Utah . After assuming Ernest 's identity , Parsons continued to insist that he was Ernest when he was later arrested . Parsons , who called himself the Rainbow Warrior , pleaded guilty to the murder . During his sentencing hearing , Parsons said that he killed Ernest to fend off a homosexual advance , but was unable to present any evidence to support this claim in his defense . The jury sentenced him to death . In 1999 , Parsons stated that it 's time to move on and dropped his appeals , allowing his execution to proceed . Discussion was later raised whether Rainbow Warrior was a reference to homosexuality or Parsons ' favorite auto racing team . Parsons chose to die by lethal injection , and he shunned attention , describing himself as Utah 's forgotten inmate . His 1999 execution at Utah State Prison was the first to be carried out in a new chamber designed for both lethal injections and firing squads .",

  "/wiki/Robbery": "Robbery is the crime of taking or attempting to take anything of value by force , threat of force , or by putting the victim in fear . According to common law , robbery is defined as taking the property of another , with the intent to permanently deprive the person of that property , by means of force or fear ; that is , it is a larceny or theft accomplished by an assault . Precise definitions of the offence may vary between jurisdictions . Robbery is differentiated from other forms of theft ( such as burglary , shoplifting , pickpocketing , or car theft ) by its inherently violent nature ( a violent crime ) ; whereas many lesser forms of theft are punished as misdemeanors , robbery is always a felony in jurisdictions that distinguish between the two . Under English law , most forms of theft are triable either way , whereas robbery is triable only on indictment . The word rob came via French from Late Latin words ( e.g. , deraubare ) of Germanic origin , from Common Germanic raub theft . Among the types of robbery are armed robbery , which involves the use of a weapon , and aggravated robbery , when someone brings with them a deadly weapon or something that appears to be a deadly weapon . Highway robbery or mugging takes place outside or in a public place such as a sidewalk , street , or parking lot . Carjacking is the act of stealing a car from a victim by force . Extortion is the threat to do something illegal , or the offer to not do something illegal , in the event that goods are not given , primarily using words instead of actions . Criminal slang for robbery includes blagging ( armed robbery , usually of a bank ) or stick-up ( derived from the verbal command to robbery targets to raise their hands in the air ) , and steaming ( organized robbery on underground train systems ) .",
