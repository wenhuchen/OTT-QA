  "/wiki/Celadon": "Celadon is a term for pottery denoting both wares glazed in the jade green celadon color , also known as greenware ( the term specialists now tend to use ) , and a type of transparent glaze , often with small cracks , that was first used on greenware , but later used on other porcelains . Celadon originated in China , though the term is purely European , and notable kilns such as the Longquan kiln in Zhejiang province are renowned for their celadon glazes . Celadon production later spread to other parts of East Asia , such as Japan and Korea as well as Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand . Eventually , European potteries produced some pieces , but it was never a major element there . Finer pieces are in porcelain , but both the color and the glaze can be produced in stoneware and earthenware . Most of the earlier Longquan celadon is on the border of stoneware and porcelain , meeting the Chinese but not the European definitions of porcelain . For many centuries , celadon wares were highly regarded by the Chinese Imperial court , before being replaced in fashion by painted wares , especially the new blue and white porcelain under the Yuan dynasty . The similarity of the color to jade , traditionally the most highly valued material in China , was a large part of its attraction . Celadon continued to be produced in China at a lower level , often with a conscious sense of reviving older styles . In Korea the celadons produced under the Goryeo Dynasty ( 918-1392 ) are regarded as the classic wares of Korean porcelain . The celadon colour is classically produced by firing a glaze containing a little iron oxide at a high temperature in a reducing kiln . The materials must be refined , as other chemicals can alter the color completely .",

Obsidian is produced when felsic lava extruded from a volcano cools rapidly with minimal crystal growth . It is commonly found within the margins of rhyolitic lava flows known as obsidian flows , where the chemical composition ( high silica content ) causes a high viscosity , which , upon rapid cooling , results in a natural glass forming from the lava . The inhibition of atomic diffusion through this highly viscous lava explains the lack of crystal growth . Obsidian is hard , brittle , and amorphous ; it therefore fractures with sharp edges . In the past , it was used to manufacture cutting and piercing tools , and it has been used experimentally as surgical scalpel blades .",

Since the 1980s , scholars have argued that a period previously classified as a transition from the J\u014dmon period should be reclassified as Early Yayoi . The date of the beginning of this transition is controversial , with estimates ranging from the 10th to the 6th centuries BC . The period is named after the neighborhood of Tokyo where archaeologists first uncovered artifacts and features from that era . Distinguishing characteristics of the Yayoi period include the appearance of new Yayoi pottery styles and the start of an intensive rice agriculture in paddy fields . A hierarchical social class structure dates from this period and has its origin in China . Techniques in metallurgy based on the use of bronze and iron were also introduced from China over Korea to Japan in this period . The Yayoi followed the J\u014dmon period ( 14,000-1,000 BC ) and Yayoi culture flourished in a geographic area from southern Ky\u016bsh\u016b to northern Honsh\u016b .
