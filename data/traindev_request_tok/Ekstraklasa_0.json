Located in Kashubia in Eastern Pomerania , Gdynia has a population of 246,309 making it the twelfth-largest city in Poland and the second-largest in the voivodeship after Gda\u0144sk . It is part of a conurbation with the spa town of Sopot , the city of Gda\u0144sk and suburban communities , which together form a metropolitan area called the Tricity ( Tr\u00f3jmiasto ) , with a population of over a million people . For centuries , Gdynia remained a small farming and fishing village on the Baltic coast . At the beginning of the 20th-century Gdynia became a seaside resort town and experienced an inflow of tourists . This triggered an increase in local population . After Poland regained its independence in 1918 , a decision was made to construct a Polish seaport in Gdynia , between the Free City of Danzig ( a semi-autonomous city-state under joint League of Nations and Polish administration ) and German Pomerania , making Gdynia the primary economic hub of the Polish Corridor . It was then that the town was given a more cosmopolitan character with modernism being the dominant architectural style and emerged as a city in 1926 . The rapid development of Gdynia was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II . The German troops refrained from deliberate bombing . The newly built port and shipyard were completely destroyed during the war . The population of the city suffered much heavier losses as most of the inhabitants were evicted and expelled .",
