The release of these additional services and peripherals helped the Xbox brand grow from gaming-only to encompassing all multimedia , turning it into a hub for living-room computing entertainment . Launched worldwide across 2005-2006 , the Xbox 360 was initially in short supply in many regions , including North America and Europe . The earliest versions of the console suffered from a high failure rate , indicated by the so-called Red Ring of Death , necessitating an extension of the device 's warranty period .

  "/wiki/Personal_computer": "A personal computer ( PC ) is a multi-purpose computer whose size , capabilities , and price make it feasible for individual use . Personal computers are intended to be operated directly by an end user , rather than by a computer expert or technician . Unlike large costly minicomputers and mainframes , time-sharing by many people at the same time is not used with personal computers . Institutional or corporate computer owners in the 1960s had to write their own programs to do any useful work with the machines . While personal computer users may develop their own applications , usually these systems run commercial software , free-of-charge software ( freeware ) , which is most often proprietary , or free and open-source software , which is provided in ready-to-run , or binary , form . Software for personal computers is typically developed and distributed independently from the hardware or operating system manufacturers . Many personal computer users no longer need to write their own programs to make any use of a personal computer , although end-user programming is still feasible . This contrasts with mobile systems , where software is often only available through a manufacturer-supported channel , and end-user program development may be discouraged by lack of support by the manufacturer . Since the early 1990s , Microsoft operating systems and Intel hardware dominated much of the personal computer market , first with MS-DOS and then with Microsoft Windows . Alternatives to Microsoft 's Windows operating systems occupy a minority share of the industry . These include Apple 's macOS and free and open-source Unix-like operating systems . The advent of personal computers and the concurrent Digital Revolution have significantly affected the lives of people in all countries .",

It was published in Japan by Sony Computer Entertainment in February 2009 , in North America by Atlus USA in October 2009 , and in PAL territories by Namco Bandai Games in June 2010 . The game is referred to as a spiritual successor to FromSoftware 's King 's Field series . Demon 's Souls is set in Boletaria , a kingdom consumed by a dark being called the Old One following its release through the use of forbidden Soul Arts . Players take on the role of a hero brought to Boletaria to kill its fallen king Allant and pacify the Old One . Gameplay has players navigating five different worlds from a hub called the Nexus , with a heavy emphasis on challenging combat and mechanics surrounding player death and respawning . Online multiplayer allows both player cooperation and world invasions featuring player versus player combat . The game 's early development was troubled due to a lack of coherent vision . Despite such issues , FromSoftware staff member Hidetaka Miyazaki was able to take over the project and helped to turn the title into what it eventually became . The game 's difficulty was intended to both evoke classic video games and provide a sense of challenge and accomplishment for players . This aspect proved demanding for Miyazaki , partly because of his fear that Sony would ask the team to lower the difficulty in order to make the game more accessible . The multiplayer elements were inspired by events in Miyazaki 's life .",

The console is the successor to the PlayStation Portable , and a part of the PlayStation brand of gaming devices ; as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles , it primarily competed with the Nintendo 3DS .

However , in the year after the device 's successful launch , sales of the hardware and its bigger budget games stalled , threatening to end its lifespan . A concentrated effort to attract smaller independent developers in the West , combined with strong support from mid-level Japanese companies , helped keep the platform afloat . While this led to less diversity in its game library , it did garner strong support in JRPGs and visual novels , alongside a wealth of Western-developed indie games , leading it to become a moderate seller in Japan , and build a smaller , yet passionate userbase in the West . While Sony has not released exact sales figures , late-lifespan estimates in sales fall around 15 to 16 million units .",
