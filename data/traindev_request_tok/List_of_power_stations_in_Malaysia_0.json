  "/wiki/Bakun_Dam": "The Bakun Dam is an embankment dam located in Sarawak , Malaysia , on the Balui River , a tributary or source of the Rajang River and some sixty kilometres east of Belaga . As part of the project , the second tallest concrete-faced rockfill dam in the world would be built . It is planned to generate 2,400 megawatts ( MW ) of electricity once completed . The purpose for the dam was to meet growing demand for electricity . However , most of this demand is said to lie in Peninsular Malaysia and not East Malaysia , where the dam is located . Even in Peninsular Malaysia , however , there is an oversupply of electricity , with Tenaga Nasional Berhad being locked into unfavourable purchasing agreements with Independent Power Producers . The original idea was to have 30% of the generated capacity consumed in East Malaysia and the rest sent to Peninsular Malaysia . This plan envisioned 730 km of overhead HVDC transmission lines in East Malaysia , 670 km of undersea HVDC cable and 300 km of HVDC transmission line in Peninsular Malaysia . Future plans for the dam include connecting it to an envisioned Trans-Borneo Power Grid Interconnection , which would be a grid to supply power to Sarawak , Sabah , Brunei , and Kalimantan ( Indonesia ) . There have been mentions of this grid made within ASEAN meetings but no actions have been taken by any party . Bakun Dam came online on 6 August 2011 .
