  "/wiki/South_Carolina's_6th_congressional_district": "The 6th Congressional District of South Carolina is a congressional district in central and eastern South Carolina . It includes all of Allendale , Bamberg , Clarendon , Colleton , Hampton , Jasper and Williamsburg counties and parts of Beaufort , Berkeley , Calhoun , Charleston , Dorchester , Orangeburg , Richland and Sumter counties . The district borders were shifted south in the 2012 redistricting . It lost its share of the North Carolina border , and now takes in part of the area near the South Carolina-Georgia border . The district 's current configuration dates from a deal struck in the early 1990s between state Republicans and Democrats in the South Carolina General Assembly to create a majority-black district . The rural counties of the historical black belt in South Carolina make up much of the district , but it sweeps south to include most of the majority-black precincts in and around Charleston , and sweeps west to include most of the majority-black precincts in and around Columbia . In all of its configurations , its politics have been dominated by black voters in the Columbia and Charleston areas . Following the Reconstruction era , the white Democratic-dominated legislature passed Jim Crow laws , as well as a new constitution in 1895 that effectively disfranchised blacks , crippling the Republican Party in the state . For most of the next 60 years , South Carolina was essentially a one-party state dominated by the Democrats , and blacks were nearly excluded from the political system . Demographic and political changes have included the Great Migration of blacks out of the state during the Jim Crow era in the first half of the 20th century . At the same time , many white Democrats felt chagrin at the national party 's greater support of civil rights for blacks from the 1940s onward , and began splitting their tickets in federal elections . After successes of the Civil Rights Movement in gaining passage of federal legislation in the mid-1960s to enforce their constitutional rights and ability to vote , blacks in South Carolina supported national Democratic candidates .",

He is most remembered for his opinions in Martin v. Hunter 's Lessee and The Amistad case , and especially for his magisterial Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States , first published in 1833 . Dominating the field in the 19th century , this work is a cornerstone of early American jurisprudence . It is the second comprehensive treatise on the provisions of the U.S. Constitution and remains a critical source of historical information about the forming of the American republic and the early struggles to define its law . Story opposed Jacksonian democracy , saying it was oppression of property rights by republican governments when popular majorities began ( in the 1830s ) to restrict and erode the property rights of the minority of rich men . R. Kent Newmyer presents Story as a Statesman of the Old Republic who tried to be above democratic politics and to shape the law in accordance with the republicanism of Alexander Hamilton and John Marshall and the New England Whigs of the 1820s and 1830s , including Daniel Webster . Historians agree that Justice Joseph Story reshaped American law - as much or more than Marshall or anyone else - in a conservative direction that protected property rights . He was uniquely honored in the historical Steven Spielberg film Amistad when he was portrayed by retired Associate Justice of the U. S. Supreme Court Harry Blackmun . Justice Blackmun portrays Justice Story reading the Supreme Court 's decision in the case in which the film was based , and for which Justice Story is most widely remembered , United States v. The Amistad Africans , et al . This is the only time in known film history that an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court has portrayed another Associate Justice . [ citation needed ]",
