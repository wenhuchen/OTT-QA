  "/wiki/Barton_Fink": "Barton Fink is a 1991 American independent period psychological thriller film written , produced , edited and directed by the Coen brothers . Set in 1941 , it stars John Turturro in the title role as a young New York City playwright who is hired to write scripts for a film studio in Hollywood , and John Goodman as Charlie Meadows , the insurance salesman who lives next door at the run-down Hotel Earle . The Coens wrote the screenplay for Barton Fink in three weeks while experiencing difficulty during the writing of Miller 's Crossing . They began filming the former soon after Miller 's Crossing was finished . The film is influenced by works of several earlier directors , particularly Roman Polanski 's Repulsion ( 1965 ) and The Tenant ( 1976 ) . Barton Fink had its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1991 . In a rare sweep , it won the Palme d'Or , as well as awards for Best Director and Best Actor ( Turturro ) . Although the film was a box office disappointment , only grossing $ 6 million against its $ 9 million budget , it received positive reviews and was nominated for 3 Academy Awards . Prominent themes of Barton Fink include the writing process ; slavery and conditions of labor in creative industries ; superficial distinctions between high culture and low culture ; and the relationship of intellectuals with the common man . The diverse elements of the film have led it to defy efforts at genre classification , with the work being variously referred to as a film noir , a horror film , a K\u00fcnstlerroman , and a buddy film . It contains various literary allusions and religious overtones , as well as references to many real-life people and events - most notably the writers Clifford Odets and William Faulkner , of whom the characters of Barton Fink and W. P. Mayhew , respectively , are often seen as fictional representations . Several features of the film 's narrative , particularly an image of a woman at the beach which recurs throughout , have sparked much commentary , with the Coens acknowledging some intentional symbolic elements while denying an attempt to communicate any single message in the film ."
