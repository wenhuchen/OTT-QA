More than one hundred million years ago during the Nevadan orogeny , granite formed deep underground . The range started to uplift four million years ago , and erosion by glaciers exposed the granite and formed the light-colored mountains and cliffs that make up the range . The uplift caused a wide range of elevations and climates in the Sierra Nevada , which are reflected by the presence of five life zones ( areas with similar plant and animal communities ) . Uplift continues due to faulting caused by tectonic forces , creating spectacular fault block escarpments along the eastern edge of the southern Sierra .",

The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) .

The island of Taiwan has an area of 35,808 square kilometres ( 13,826 sq mi ) , with mountain ranges dominating the eastern two-thirds and plains in the western third , where its highly urbanised population is concentrated . Taipei is the capital and largest metropolitan area . Other major cities include Kaohsiung , Taichung , Tainan and Taoyuan . With 23.7 million inhabitants , Taiwan is among the most densely populated states , and is the most populous state and largest economy that is not a member of the United Nations ( UN ) . Taiwanese indigenous peoples settled the island of Taiwan around 6,000 years ago . In the 17th century , Dutch rule opened the island to mass Han immigration . After the brief Kingdom of Tungning in parts of the southern and western areas of the island , the island was annexed in 1683 by the Qing dynasty of China , and ceded to the Empire of Japan in 1895 . Following the surrender of Japan in 1945 , the Republic of China , which had overthrown and succeeded the Qing in 1911 , took control of Taiwan on behalf of the World War II Allies . The resumption of the Chinese Civil War led to the loss of the mainland to the Communist Party of China and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949 . Although the ROC government continued to claim to be the legitimate representative of China , since 1950 its effective jurisdiction has been limited to Taiwan and numerous smaller islands .",

It is the second-largest island in the Mediterranean Sea after Sicily , and is located west of the Italian Peninsula , north of Tunisia , and to the immediate south of the French island of Corsica . The region of Sardinia is one of the five in Italy that enjoy some degree of domestic autonomy , granted by a specific Statute . Its official name is Regione Autonoma della Sardegna ( Sardinian : Regione Aut\u00f2noma de Sardigna , lit . Autonomous Region of Sardinia ) . It is divided into four provinces and a metropolitan city , with Cagliari being the region 's capital and also its largest city . Sardinia 's indigenous language and the other minority languages ( Sassarese , Gallurese , Algherese Catalan and Ligurian Tabarchino ) spoken on the island are recognized by the regional law and enjoy equal dignity with Italian . Sardinia has been inhabited since the Paleolithic . The island 's most iconic civilization is the indigenous Nuragic one , which lasted from the 18th century BC to either 238 BC or the 2nd century AD in some areas and to the 6th century AD in the region known as Barbagia . After a period under a political and economic alliance between the Nuragic Sardinians and the Phoenicians , the island was partly conquered by Carthage and Rome , in the late 6th century BC and in 238 BC respectively ; the Roman occupation lasted for 700 years , followed in the Early Middle Ages by the Vandals and the Byzantines . Since the island was finding itself disconnected from Byzantium 's scope of territorial influence , the Sardinians provided themselves with a self-ruling political organization , leading to the birth of the four Judicates . As the Italian maritime republics of Pisa and Genoa struggled to exercise increasing political interference upon the indigenous states , the Crown of Aragon subsumed the island as the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1324 .",

In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed .

An etymological study published in 2012 concluded that Austrian Stephen L. Endlicher is actually responsible for the name . A linguist and botanist , Endlicher corresponded with experts in the Cherokee language including Sequoyah , whom he admired . He also realized that coincidentally the genus could be described in Latin as sequi ( meaning to follow ) because the number of seeds per cone in the newly-classified genus aligned in mathematical sequence with the other four genera in the suborder .

The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",
  "/wiki/Shinto_shrine": "A Shinto shrine ( \u795e\u793e , jinja , archaic : shinsha , meaning : place of the god ( s ) ) is a structure whose main purpose is to house ( enshrine ) one or more kami . Its most important building is used for the safekeeping of sacred objects , and not for worship . Although only one word ( shrine ) is used in English , in Japanese , Shinto shrines may carry any one of many different , non-equivalent names like gongen , -g\u016b , jinja , jing\u016b , mori , my\u014djin , -sha , taisha , ubusuna , or yashiro . ( For details , see the section Interpreting shrine names . ) Structurally , a Shinto shrine is usually characterized by the presence of a honden [ note 1 ] or sanctuary , where the kami is enshrined . The honden may however be completely absent , as for example when the shrine stands on a sacred mountain to which it is dedicated , and which is worshipped directly . The honden may also be missing when there are nearby altar-like structures called himorogi or objects believed to be capable of attracting spirits called yorishiro that can serve as a direct bond to a kami . There may be a haiden ( \u62dd\u6bbf , meaning : hall of worship ) and other structures as well ( see below ) . However , a shrine 's most important building is used for the safekeeping of sacred objects rather than for worship . Miniature shrines ( hokora ) can occasionally be found on roadsides . Large shrines sometimes have on their precincts miniature shrines , sessha ( \u6442\u793e ) or massha ( \u672b\u793e ) . [ note 2 ] The portable shrines ( mikoshi ) which are carried on poles during festivals ( matsuri ) enshrine kami and are therefore true shrines .",

  "/wiki/J\u014dmon_period": "The J\u014dmon period ( \u7e04\u6587\u6642\u4ee3 , J\u014dmon jidai ) is the time in Japanese prehistory , traditionally dated between c. 14,000-300 BCE , recently refined to about 1000 BCE , during which Japan was inhabited by a hunter-gatherer culture , which reached a considerable degree of sedentism and cultural complexity . The name cord-marked was first applied by the American zoologist and orientalist Edward S. Morse , who discovered sherds of pottery in 1877 and subsequently translated it into Japanese as j\u014dmon . The pottery style characteristic of the first phases of J\u014dmon culture was decorated by impressing cords into the surface of wet clay and is generally accepted to be among the oldest in East Asia and the world . The J\u014dmon period was rich in tools and jewellery made from bone , stone , shell and antler ; pottery figurines and vessels ; and lacquerware . It is often compared to pre-Columbian cultures of the North American Pacific Northwest and especially to the Valdivia culture in Ecuador because in these settings cultural complexity developed within a primarily hunting-gathering context with limited use of horticulture .",
  "/wiki/Japanese_prehistory": "The history of Japan covers Japan and its relation to the world . It is characterized by isolationist , semi-open and expansionist periods . The very first human habitation in the Japanese archipelago has been traced to prehistoric times around 30,000 BC . The J\u014dmon period , named after its cord-marked pottery , was followed by the Yayoi in the first millennium BC when new technologies were introduced from continental Asia . During this period , the first known written reference to Japan was recorded in the Chinese Book of Han in the first century AD . Between the fourth century and the ninth century , Japan 's many kingdoms and tribes gradually came to be unified under a centralized government , nominally controlled by the Emperor . This imperial dynasty continues to reign over Japan . In 794 , a new imperial capital was established at Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) , marking the beginning of the Heian period , which lasted until 1185 . The Heian period is considered a golden age of classical Japanese culture . Japanese religious life from this time and onwards was a mix of native Shinto practices and Buddhism . Over the following centuries , the power of the Emperor and the imperial court gradually declined , passing first to great clans of civilian aristocrats - most notably the Fujiwara - and then to the military clans and their armies of samurai . The Minamoto clan under Minamoto no Yoritomo emerged victorious from the Genpei War of 1180-85 , defeating their rival military clan , the Taira .",

It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel , the Irish Sea , and St George 's Channel . Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles , the third-largest in Europe , and the twentieth-largest on Earth . Geopolitically , Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland ( officially named Ireland ) , which covers five-sixths of the island , and Northern Ireland , which is part of the United Kingdom . In 2011 , the population of Ireland was about 6.6 million , ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain . As of 2016 , 4.8 million live in the Republic of Ireland , and 1.8 million live in Northern Ireland . The geography of Ireland comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain , with several navigable rivers extending inland . Its lush vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature . Much of Ireland was woodland until the end of the Middle Ages . Today , woodland makes up about 10% of the island , compared with a European average of over 33% , and most of it is non-native conifer plantations . There are twenty-six extant land mammal species native to Ireland . The Irish climate is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and thus very moderate , and winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area , although summers are cooler than those in continental Europe ."
