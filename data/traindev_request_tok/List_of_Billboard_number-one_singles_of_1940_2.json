Widely regarded as one of jazz 's finest clarinetists , Shaw led one of the United States ' most popular big bands in the late 1930s through the early 1940s . Though he had numerous hit records , he was perhaps best known for his 1938 recording of Cole Porter 's Begin the Beguine . Before the release of Beguine , Shaw and his fledgling band had languished in relative obscurity for over two years and , after its release , he became a major pop artist within short order . The record eventually became one of the era 's defining recordings . Musically restless , Shaw was also an early proponent of what became known much later as Third Stream music , which blended elements of classical and jazz forms and traditions . His music influenced other musicians , such as Monty Norman in England , with the vamp of the James Bond Theme , possibly influenced by 1938 's Nightmare . Shaw also recorded with small jazz groups drawn from within the ranks of the various big bands he led . He served in the US Navy from 1942 to 1944 , ( during which time he led a morale-building band that toured the South Pacific amidst the chaos of World War II ) and , following his discharge in 1944 , he returned to lead a band through 1945 . Following the breakup of that band , he began to focus on other interests and gradually withdrew from the world of being a professional musician and major celebrity , although he remained a force in popular music and jazz before retiring from music completely in 1954 .",
