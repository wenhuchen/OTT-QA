  "/wiki/Rome": "Rome ( Latin and Italian : Roma [ \u02c8ro\u02d0ma ] ( listen ) ) is the capital city and a special comune of Italy ( named Comune di Roma Capitale ) . Rome also serves as the capital of the Lazio region . With 2,879,728 residents in 1,285 km2 ( 496.1 sq mi ) , it is also the country 's most populated comune . It is the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits . It is the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome , which has a population of 4,355,725 residents , thus making it the second or third most populous metropolitan city in Italy depending on definition . Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula , within Lazio ( Latium ) , along the shores of the Tiber . Vatican City ( the smallest country in the world ) is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome , the only existing example of a country within a city ; for this reason Rome has sometimes been defined as the capital of two states . Rome 's history spans 28 centuries . While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC , the site has been inhabited for much longer , making it one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe . The city 's early population originated from a mix of Latins , Etruscans , and Sabines . Eventually , the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom , the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire , and is regarded by many as the first ever Imperial City and metropolis . It was first called The Eternal City ( Latin : Urbs Aeterna ; Italian : La Citt\u00e0 Eterna ) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC , and the expression was also taken up by Ovid , Virgil , and Livy .",
