  "/wiki/Agriculture": "Agriculture is the science and art of cultivating plants and livestock . Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization , whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities . The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago . After gathering wild grains beginning at least 105,000 years ago , nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago . Pigs , sheep and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago . Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world . Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output , though about 2 billion people still depended on subsistence agriculture into the twenty-first . Modern agronomy , plant breeding , agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers , and technological developments have sharply increased yields , while causing widespread ecological and environmental damage . Selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat , but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage . Environmental issues include contributions to global warming , depletion of aquifers , deforestation , antibiotic resistance , and growth hormones in industrial meat production . Genetically modified organisms are widely used , although some are banned in certain countries . The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods , fibers , fuels and raw materials ( such as rubber ) .",
  "/wiki/Chemicals": "A chemical substance is a form of matter having constant chemical composition and characteristic properties . Some references add that chemical substance can not be separated into its constituent elements by physical separation methods , i.e. , without breaking chemical bonds . Chemical substances can be simple substances , chemical compounds , or alloys . Chemical elements may or may not be included in the definition , depending on expert viewpoint . Chemical substances are often called 'pure ' to set them apart from mixtures . A common example of a chemical substance is pure water ; it has the same properties and the same ratio of hydrogen to oxygen whether it is isolated from a river or made in a laboratory . Other chemical substances commonly encountered in pure form are diamond ( carbon ) , gold , table salt ( sodium chloride ) and refined sugar ( sucrose ) . However , in practice , no substance is entirely pure , and chemical purity is specified according to the intended use of the chemical . Chemical substances exist as solids , liquids , gases , or plasma , and may change between these phases of matter with changes in temperature or pressure . Chemical substances may be combined or converted to others by means of chemical reactions . Forms of energy , such as light and heat , are not matter , and are thus not substances in this regard .",

Tourism can be domestic ( within the traveller 's own country ) or international , and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country 's balance of payments . Tourism numbers declined as a result of a strong economic slowdown ( the late-2000s recession ) between the second half of 2008 and the end of 2009 , and in consequence of the outbreak of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus , but slowly recovered .

  "/wiki/Construction": "Construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure . Construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser , while construction typically takes place on location for a known client .

Construction starts with planning , design , and financing ; it continues until the project is built and ready for use . Large-scale construction requires collaboration across multiple disciplines . A project manager normally manages the budget on the job , and a construction manager , design engineer , construction engineer or architect supervises it . Those involved with the design and execution must consider zoning requirements , environmental impact of the job , scheduling , budgeting , construction-site safety , availability and transportation of building materials , logistics , inconvenience to the public caused by construction delays and bidding .

  "/wiki/Natural_gas": "Natural gas ( also called fossil gas ) is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane , but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes , and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide , nitrogen , hydrogen sulfide , or helium . It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years . The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas . Natural gas is a non-renewable hydrocarbon used as a source of energy for heating , cooking , and electricity generation . It is also used as a fuel for vehicles and as a chemical feedstock in the manufacture of plastics and other commercially important organic chemicals . Natural gas has a complicated effect on climate change ; it itself is a greenhouse gas , and it releases carbon dioxide when burned . However , natural gas use often supplants coal use , which is far more environmentally damaging , leading to lower net carbon dioxide emissions in countries such as the United States . Natural gas is found in deep underground rock formations or associated with other hydrocarbon reservoirs in coal beds and as methane clathrates . Petroleum is another resource and fossil fuel found close to and with natural gas . Most natural gas was created over time by two mechanisms : biogenic and thermogenic . Biogenic gas is created by methanogenic organisms in marshes , bogs , landfills , and shallow sediments .

  "/wiki/Steel": "Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon , and sometimes other elements . Because of its high tensile strength and low cost , it is a major component used in buildings , infrastructure , tools , ships , trains , automobiles , machines , appliances , and weapons . Iron is the base metal of steel . Iron is able to take on two crystalline forms ( allotropic forms ) , body centered cubic and face-centered cubic , depending on its temperature . In the body-centered cubic arrangement , there is an iron atom in the center and eight atoms at the vertices of each cubic unit cell ; in the face-centered cubic , there is one atom at the center of each of the six faces of the cubic unit cell and eight atoms at its vertices . It is the interaction of the allotropes of iron with the alloying elements , primarily carbon , that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties . In pure iron , the crystal structure has relatively little resistance to the iron atoms slipping past one another , and so pure iron is quite ductile , or soft and easily formed . In steel , small amounts of carbon , other elements , and inclusions within the iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations . The carbon in typical steel alloys may contribute up to 2.14% of its weight . Varying the amount of carbon and many other alloying elements , as well as controlling their chemical and physical makeup in the final steel ( either as solute elements , or as precipitated phases ) , slows the movement of those dislocations that make pure iron ductile , and thus controls and enhances its qualities . These qualities include the hardness , quenching behavior , need for annealing , tempering behavior , yield strength , and tensile strength of the resulting steel . The increase in steel 's strength compared to pure iron is possible only by reducing iron 's ductility .",

  "/wiki/Coal": "Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock , formed as rock strata called coal seams . Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements ; chiefly hydrogen , sulfur , oxygen , and nitrogen . Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years . Vast deposits of coal originate in former wetlands - called coal forests - that covered much of the Earth 's tropical land areas during the late Carboniferous ( Pennsylvanian ) and Permian times . As a fossil fuel burned for heat , coal supplies about a quarter of the world 's primary energy and two-fifths of its electricity . Some iron and steel making and other industrial processes burn coal . The extraction and use of coal causes many premature deaths and much illness . The coal industry damages the environment , including by climate change as it is the largest anthropogenic source of carbon dioxide , 14 gigatonne ( Gt ) in 2016 , which is 40% of the total fossil fuel emissions and almost 25% of total global greenhouse gas emissions . As part of the worldwide energy transition many countries have stopped using or use less coal , and the UN Secretary General has asked governments to stop building new coal plants by 2020 . To meet the Paris Agreement target of keeping global warming to well below 2 \u00b0C ( 3.6 \u00b0F ) coal use needs to halve from 2020 to 2030 . The largest consumer and importer of coal is China .

The major source of revenue of a group or company is an indicator of what industry it should be classified in . When a large corporate group has multiple sources of revenue generation , it is considered to be working in different industries . The manufacturing industry became a key sector of production and labour in European and North American countries during the Industrial Revolution , upsetting previous mercantile and feudal economies .
