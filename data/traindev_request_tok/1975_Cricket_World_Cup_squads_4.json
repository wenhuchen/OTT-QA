  "/wiki/First-class_cricket": "First-class cricket is an official classification of the highest-standard international or domestic matches in the sport of cricket . A first-class match is of three or more days ' scheduled duration between two sides of eleven players each and is officially adjudged to be worthy of the status by virtue of the standard of the competing teams . Matches must allow for the teams to play two innings each although , in practice , a team might play only one innings or none at all . First-class cricket ( which for this purpose includes all important matches played before 1895 ) , along with historical single-wicket and the modern limited-overs forms of List A and Twenty20 , is one of the highest-standard forms of cricket . The origin of the term first-class cricket is unknown but it was used loosely before it acquired an official status , effective in 1895 , following a meeting of leading English clubs in May 1894 . Subsequently , at a meeting of the Imperial Cricket Conference ( ICC ) in May 1947 , it was formally defined on a global basis . A significant omission of the ICC ruling was any attempt to define first-class cricket retrospectively . This has left historians , and especially statisticians , with the problem of how to categorise earlier matches , especially those played before 1895 in Great Britain . The solution put forward by the Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians ( ACS ) is to classify all pre-1895 matches of a high standard as important matches . Test cricket , the highest standard of cricket , is statistically a form of first-class cricket , though the term first-class is mainly used to refer to domestic competition . A player 's first-class statistics include any performances in Test matches .",

  "/wiki/Captain_(cricket)": "The captain of a cricket team , often referred to as the skipper , is the appointed leader , having several additional roles and responsibilities over and above those of the other players . As in other sports , the captain is usually experienced and has good communication skills , and is likely to be one of the most regular members of the team , as the captain often has a say in team selection . Before the game the captains toss for innings . During the match the captain decides the team 's batting order , who will bowl each over , and where each fielder will be positioned . While the captain has the final say , decisions are often collaborative . A captain 's knowledge of the complexities of cricket strategy and tactics , and shrewdness in the field , may contribute significantly to the team 's success . Due to the smaller coaching/management role played out by support staff , as well as the need for greater on-field decision-making , the captain of a cricket team typically shoulders more responsibility for results than team captains in other sports .",
  "/wiki/Off_break": "An off break is the type of delivery in the sport of cricket . It is the attacking delivery of an off spin bowler . Off breaks are known as off spinners . An off break is bowled by holding the cricket ball in the palm of the hand with the seam running across under all the fingers . As the ball is released , the fingers roll down the right side of the ball ( for a right-handed bowler ) , giving the ball a clockwise spin as seen from behind . When the ball bounces on the pitch , the spin causes it to deviate towards the right from the bowler 's perspective , this is to the left from the batsman 's point of view or towards the leg side of a right-handed batsman . The ball spins away from the off side . An off spin bowler will bowl mostly off breaks , varying them by adjusting the line and length of the deliveries . Off breaks are considered to be one of the easier spin deliveries for a right-handed batsman to play . This is because the ball moves in towards the batsman 's body , meaning the batsman 's legs are usually in the path of the ball if it misses the bat or takes an edge . This makes it difficult for the bowler to get the batsman out bowled or caught from an off break , but it does mean there is a chance of leg before wicket , assuming the ball has not turned enough to miss the leg stump . A left-handed batsman has more difficulty facing off break bowling , because the ball moves away from his body .",

  "/wiki/Lance_Cairns": "Bernard Lance Cairns ( born 10 October 1949 ) is a former all-rounder who played for the New Zealand cricket team , and is the father of New Zealand cricketer Chris Cairns . He was also known for the unusual bat he played with throughout much of his career . Known as Excalibur , the shoulders of the bat were planed down to form a conical rather than rectangular shape . Cairns was a swing bowler with an unorthodox 'front on ' action . He took 130 Test Match wickets and 89 ODI wickets . He took ten wickets in New Zealand 's first ever win on English soil , at Headingley in 1983 .",
  "/wiki/Pace_bowling": "Pace bowler ( also referred to as fast bowling ) is one of two main approaches to bowling in the sport of cricket , the other being spin bowling . Practitioners of pace bowling are usually known as fast bowlers , quicks , or pacemen . They can also be referred to as a seam bowler , a swing bowler or a 'fast bowler who can swing it ' to reflect the predominant characteristic of their deliveries . Strictly speaking , a pure swing bowler does not need to have a high degree of pace , though dedicated medium-pace swing bowlers are rarely seen at Test level these days . The aim of pace bowling is to deliver the ball in such a fashion as to cause the batsman to make a mistake . The bowler achieves this by making the hard cricket ball deviate from a predictable , linear trajectory at a speed that limits the time the batsman has to compensate for it . For deviation caused by the ball 's stitching ( the seam ) , the ball bounces off the pitch and deflects either away from the batsman 's body , or inwards towards them . Swing bowlers on the other hand also use the seam of the ball but in a different way . To 'bowl swing ' is to induce a curved trajectory of the cricket ball through the air . Swing bowlers use a combination of seam orientation , body position at the point of release , asymmetric ball polishing , and variations in delivery speed to affect an aerodynamic influence on the ball . The ability of a bowler to induce lateral deviation or 'sideways movement ' can make it difficult for the batsman to address the flight of the ball accurately . Beyond this ability to create an unpredictable path of ball trajectory , the fastest bowlers can be equally potent by simply delivering a ball at such a rate that a batsman simply fails to react either correctly , or at all .",

Previously , many players from these regions competed for Wellington . More than a century before the eventual founding of the Central Districts Cricket Association , the first fully recorded cricket match in New Zealand was played in what is now one of its districts , in Nelson , a men 's match in March 1844 . Between October 2016 and February 2019 , the team set a new Central Districts record for the number of consecutive first-class matches without a defeat , with 21 .

  "/wiki/Leg_break": "A leg break is a type of delivery in the sport of cricket . It is a delivery of a right-handed leg spin bowler . A leg break is bowled by holding the cricket ball in the palm of the hand with the seam running across under all the fingers . As the ball is released , the wrist is rotated to the left and the ball flicked by the ring finger , giving the ball an anti-clockwise spin as seen from behind . When the ball bounces on the pitch , the spin causes it to deviate towards the left from the bowler 's perspective ; this is to the right from the batsman 's point of view , or towards the off side of a right-handed batsman . The ball spins away from the leg side , and this is where it gets the name leg break , meaning it breaks away from the leg . The turn is mostly when the ball pitches . A leg spin bowler will bowl mostly leg breaks , varying them by adjusting the line and length , and amount of side spin versus topspin of the deliveries . Leg breaks are considered to be one of the more difficult spin deliveries for a right-handed batsman to play because the ball moves away from their body . This means that any miscalculation can result in an outside edge off the bat and a catch going to the wicket-keeper or slip fielders . Alternatively , for a ball aimed outside the leg stump , the breaking may be so sharp that the ball goes behind a right-handed batsman and hits the stumps - the batsman is then said ( informally ) to be bowled around his legs . The animation on this page illustrates such a delivery .",

  "/wiki/Left-arm_orthodox_spin": "Left-arm orthodox spin , also known as slow left-arm orthodox spin bowling , is a type of left-arm finger off spin bowling in the sport of cricket . Left-arm orthodox spin is bowled by a left-arm bowler using the fingers to spin the ball from right to left of the cricket pitch ( from the bowler 's perspective ) . Left arm orthodox spin bowlers generally attempt to drift the ball in the air into a right-handed batsman , and then turn it away from the batsman ( towards off-stump ) upon landing on the pitch . The drift and turn in the air are attacking techniques . The stock delivery of a left-arm orthodox spin bowler is the left-arm orthodox spinner .
