In 1457 , Rennyo was appointed as the eighth chief abbot of Hongan-ji , on the outskirts of Kyoto Under Rennyo 's leadership , Hongan-ji began to expand the teachings of Shinran 's Pure Land Buddhist even to areas beyond the capital .

In 1471 , he re-established Hongaki-ji at the small village of Yoshizaki on the border of Echizen Province with Kaga Province . His rectory , known as the Yoshizaki-gob\u014d was the location from which he sent out many letters explaining the teachings of his version of the Pure Land faith , known as the Ikk\u014d-sh\u016b , in colloquial Japanese , and was the location at which he reformed the ritual practices of the sect . It was also from this location that he implemented his vision of reforming society by creating a semi-theocratic republic , in which the traditional feudal landlords were replaced by communal landholding by lay followers of the sect , and led by the priesthood . The town of Yoshizaki had residences for both priests and lay followers and provided lodgings and other services , and rapidly attracted large numbers of pilgrims mainly from the northern provinces as far away as Dewa and \u014csh\u016b .

Hosokawa Akiuji had been ordered by Ashikaga Takauji to aid Shiba Takatsune in the defense , and encountered Nitta 's force a short distance from the fortress . The warrior monks of the Heisen-ji monastery , originally part of Nitta 's force , were bribed by Shiba to abandon the attack , and Nitta 's rush to fill the ensuing gap in his formations led to him and his horsemen running into Hosokawa 's . In the battle which followed , Nitta was mortally wounded by an arrow . The following year , upon his enthronement , Emperor Go-Murakami ordered the late Nitta 's brother , Wakiya Yoshisuke , to lead another attack on the fortress .
