The capital of Abyei Area is Abyei Town . Under the terms of the Abyei Protocol , the Abyei Area was declared , on an interim basis , to be simultaneously part of the states of West Kordofan ( Sudan ) and Northern Bahr el Ghazal ( South Sudan ) . In contrast to the borders of the former district , the Abyei Protocol defined the Abyei Area as the area of the nine Ngok Dinka chiefdoms transferred to Kordofan in 1905 . In 2005 , a multinational border commission established this to be those portions of Kordofan south of 10\u00b022\u203230\u2033 N. However , following continued disputes that erupted into violence and threatened the CPA , an international arbitration process redrew Abyei 's boundaries in 2009 to make it significantly smaller , extending no further north than 10\u00b010\u203200 N. This revised border has now been endorsed by all parties to the dispute . [ citation needed ]",

It is disputed between South Sudan and Sudan . Almost all of Kafia Kingi ( except a southern portion south of the Umblasha River ) is within the borders of the Sudanese Radom National Park , a biosphere reserve , of which two-thirds are also within the borders of Kafia Kingi , while another one-third of the National Park is within the Sudanese region of South Darfur . The area was due to be given to South Sudan under the terms of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement which required use of the Sudan north-south line as of 1 January 1956 . It was not until 1960 that the Kafia Kingi area was transferred north of that line and added to Darfur . Sudan controls all or most of this area today , though at times since independence South Sudan forces have briefly controlled large portions . Warlord Joseph Kony is thought to be hiding in Kafia Kingi . The Kafia Kingi region is a known haven for ivory smugglers .

Sudan has a population of 43 million ( 2018 estimate ) and occupies 1,886,068 square kilometres ( 728,215 square miles ) , making it Africa 's third-largest country and also the third-largest in the Arab world . Before South Sudan 's secession from Sudan on 9 July 2011 , the united Sudan was the largest country in Africa and the Arab world by area . Sudan 's predominant religion is Islam , and its official languages are Arabic and English . The capital is Khartoum , located at the confluence of the Blue and White Nile . Since 2011 , Sudan has been the scene of an ongoing military conflict in its southern states . Sudan 's history goes back to the Pharaonic period , witnessing the kingdom of Kerma ( c. 2500 BC-1500 BC ) , the subsequent rule of the Egyptian New Kingdom ( c. 1500 BC-1070 BC ) and the rise of the kingdom of Kush ( c. 785 BC-350 AD ) , which would in turn control Egypt itself for nearly a century . After the fall of Kush , the Nubians formed the three Christian kingdoms of Nobatia , Makuria and Alodia , with the latter two lasting until around 1500 . Between the 14th and 15th centuries much of Sudan was settled by Arab nomads . From the 16th-19th centuries , central and eastern Sudan were dominated by the Funj sultanate , while Darfur ruled the west and the Ottomans the far north . This period saw extensive Islamisation and Arabisation .",

It gained independence from the Republic of the Sudan in 2011 , making it the most recent sovereign state with widespread recognition . Its capital and largest city is Juba . South Sudan is bordered by Sudan to the north , Ethiopia to the east , Kenya to the southeast , Uganda to the south , the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the southwest and the Central African Republic to the west .

Sudan was occupied by Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty and was governed as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium until Sudanese independence in 1956 . Following the First Sudanese Civil War , the Southern Sudan Autonomous Region was formed in 1972 and lasted until 1983 . A second Sudanese civil war soon broke out , ending in 2005 with the Comprehensive Peace Agreement . Later that year , southern autonomy was restored when an Autonomous Government of Southern Sudan was formed . South Sudan became an independent state on 9 July 2011 , following 98.83% support for independence in a January 2011 referendum . It has suffered ethnic violence and endured a civil war since 2013 .

At 592,800 square kilometres ( 228,900 sq mi ) Madagascar is the world 's 2nd largest island country . The nation comprises the island of Madagascar ( the fourth- largest island in the world ) and numerous smaller peripheral islands . Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana , Madagascar split from the Indian subcontinent around 88 million years ago , allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation . Consequently , Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot ; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth . The island 's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats . The archaeological evidence of the earliest human foraging on Madagascar may date up to 10,000 years ago . Human settlement of Madagascar occurred between 350 BC and 550 AD by Indianized Austronesian peoples , arriving on outrigger canoes from Indonesia . The social and religious situation of Indonesia during those times were that of Hinduism and Buddhism , along with native Indonesian culture . These were joined around the 9th century AD by Bantu migrants crossing the Mozambique Channel from East Africa . Other groups continued to settle on Madagascar over time , each one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life . The Malagasy ethnic group is often divided into 18 or more subgroups , of which the largest are the Merina of the central highlands .",

Comprising a territory spanning roughly 298 square kilometres ( 115 sq mi ) , the Maldives is one of the world 's most geographically dispersed sovereign states as well as the smallest Asian country by land area and population , with around 515,696 inhabitants . Mal\u00e9 is the capital and the most populated city , traditionally called the King 's Island for its central location . The Maldives archipelago is located on the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge , a vast submarine mountain range in the Indian Ocean ; this also forms a terrestrial ecoregion , together with the Chagos Archipelago and Lakshadweep . With an average ground-level elevation of 1.5 metres ( 4 ft 11 in ) above sea level , it is the world 's lowest-lying country , with even its highest natural point being one of the lowest in the world , at 5.1 metres ( 17 ft ) . Islam was introduced to the Maldivian archipelago in the 12th century which was consolidated as a sultanate , developing strong commercial and cultural ties with Asia and Africa . From the mid-16th-century , the region came under the increasing influence of European colonial powers , with the Maldives becoming a British protectorate in 1887 . Independence from the United Kingdom was granted in 1965 and a presidential republic was established in 1968 with an elected People 's Majlis . The ensuing decades have been characterised by political instability , efforts at democratic reform , and environmental challenges posed by climate change . The Maldives is a founding member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) .",
  "/wiki/British_Indian_Ocean_Territory": "The British Indian Ocean Territory ( BIOT ) is a British overseas territory of the United Kingdom situated in the Indian Ocean halfway between Tanzania and Indonesia . The territory comprises the seven atolls of the Chagos Archipelago with over 1,000 individual islands - many very small - amounting to a total land area of 60 square kilometres ( 23 sq mi ) . The largest and most southerly island is Diego Garcia , 27 km2 ( 10 sq mi ) , the site of a joint military facility of the United Kingdom and the United States . The only inhabitants are US and British military personnel and associated contractors , who collectively number around 2,500 ( 2012 figures ) . The removal of Chagossians from the Chagos Archipelago occurred between 1968 and 1973 . The Chagossians , then numbering about 2,000 people , were expelled by the British government to Mauritius and Seychelles to allow the United States to build a joint UK/US military base there . Today , the exiled Chagossians are still trying to return , arguing that the forced expulsion and dispossession was illegal . The islands are off-limits to Chagossians , casual tourists , and the media . Since the 1980s the government of Mauritius has sought to regain control over the Chagos Archipelago , which was separated from the British Colony of Mauritius by the UK in 1965 to form the British Indian Ocean Territory . On 23 June 2017 , the United Nations General Assembly ( UNGA ) voted in favour of referring the territorial dispute between Mauritius and the UK to the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) in order to clarify the legal status of the Chagos Islands archipelago in the Indian Ocean . The motion was approved by a majority vote with 94 voting for and 15 against . The British Indian Ocean Territory is one of only two British territories where traffic drives on the right , the other being Gibraltar .",

Across the Gulf of Aden lies Yemen , which does not share a land border with Djibouti . The country has a total area of 23,200 km2 ( 8,958 sq mi ) . The state of Djibouti is predominantly inhabited by two ethnic groups , the Somali and the Afar people , with the former comprising the majority of the population . In antiquity , the territory together with Somalia was part of the Land of Punt . Nearby Zeila , now in Somalia , was the seat of the medieval Adal and Ifat Sultanates . In the late 19th century , the colony of French Somaliland was established following treaties signed by the ruling Somali and Afar sultans with the French and its railroad to Dire Dawa ( and later Addis Ababa ) allowed it to quickly supersede Zeila as the port for southern Ethiopia and the Ogaden . It was subsequently renamed to the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas in 1967 . A decade later , the Djiboutian people voted for independence . This officially marked the establishment of the Republic of Djibouti , named after its capital city . The sovereign state joined the United Nations the same year , on 20 September 1977 In the early 1990s , tensions over government representation led to armed conflict , which ended in a power-sharing agreement in 2000 between the ruling party and the opposition .",

The area , which takes its name from the town of Halayib , is created by the difference in the Egypt-Sudan border between the political boundary set in 1899 by the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium , which runs along the 22nd parallel north , and the administrative boundary set by the British in 1902 , which gave administrative responsibility for an area of land north of the line to Sudan , which was an Anglo-Egyptian client at the time . With the independence of Sudan in 1956 , both Egypt and Sudan claimed sovereignty over the area . Since the mid-1990s , Egypt has administered the area as part of the Red Sea Governorate , following the deployment of Egyptian military units there in the late 1990s , and has been actively investing in it . Egypt has been recently categorical in rejecting international arbitration or even political negotiations regarding the area . The description of the area as a triangle is a rough approximation . Only the southern 290-kilometre ( 180 mi ) demarcation , which follows latitude 22\u00b0 , is a straight line . While the whole area is north of the 22-degree line , a smaller area south of latitude 22\u00b0 , referred to as Bir Tawil , joins the Halayib Triangle at its westernmost point along the latitude line - neither Sudan nor Egypt claims Bir Tawil .

When spoken of in association with the neighbouring Hala'ib Triangle , it is sometimes referred to as the Bir Tawil Triangle , despite the area 's quadrilateral shape ; the two triangles border at a quadripoint . Its terra nullius status results from a discrepancy between the straight political boundary between Egypt and Sudan established in 1899 , and the irregular administrative boundary established in 1902 . Egypt asserts the political boundary , and Sudan asserts the administrative boundary , with the result that the Hala'ib Triangle is claimed by both and Bir Tawil by neither .

Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan , across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia , and across the Mediterranean lie Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , although none share a land border with Egypt . Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",
  "/wiki/Ilemi_Triangle": "The Ilemi Triangle is an area of disputed land in East Africa . Arbitrarily defined , it measures between 10,320 and 14,000 square kilometres ( 3,985 and 5,405 sq mi ) .

Kenya now has de facto control of the area . The dispute arose from unclear wording of the 1914 treaty in which the provisional straight parallel was a temporary line to be used only until a new line ( not finalised until the 1930s ) could allow for the movements of the Turkana people - nomadic herders who had traditionally grazed the area . The perceived economic marginality of the land as well as decades of Sudanese conflicts are two factors that have delayed the resolution of the dispute .",

It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere . About 80 percent of South Africans are of Bantu ancestry , divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different African languages , nine of which have official status . The remaining population consists of Africa 's largest communities of European , Asian ( Indian ) , and multiracial ( Coloured ) ancestry .

  "/wiki/Bantustan": "A Bantustan ( also known as Bantu homeland , black homeland , black state or simply homeland ; Afrikaans : Bantoestan ) was a territory set aside for black inhabitants of South Africa and South West Africa ( now Namibia ) , as part of the policy of apartheid . Ten Bantustans were established in South Africa , and ten in neighbouring South West Africa ( then under South African administration ) , for the purpose of concentrating the members of designated ethnic groups , thus making each of those territories ethnically homogeneous as the basis for creating 'autonomous ' nation states for South Africa 's different black ethnic groups . In terms of the Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act of 1970 , blacks were stripped of their South African citizenship , which deprived them of their few remaining political and civil rights in South Africa , and made them citizens of their designated homelands . The term was first used in the late 1940s and was coined from Bantu ( meaning people in some of the Bantu languages ) and -stan ( a suffix meaning land in the Persian language and some Persian-influenced languages of western , central , and southern Asia ) . It was regarded as a disparaging term by some critics of the apartheid-era government 's homelands . The word bantustan , today , is often used in a pejorative sense when describing a region that lacks any real legitimacy , consists of several unconnected enclaves , or emerges from national or international gerrymandering .

It is bordered by Nigeria to the west and north ; Chad to the northeast ; the Central African Republic to the east ; and Equatorial Guinea , Gabon and the Republic of the Congo to the south . Cameroon 's coastline lies on the Bight of Biafra , part of the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean . Although Cameroon is not an ECOWAS member state , it is geographically and historically in West Africa with the Southern Cameroons which now form her Northwest and Southwest Regions having a strong West African history . The country is sometimes identified as West African and other times as Central African due to its strategic position at the crossroads between West and Central Africa . Cameroon is home to over 250 native languages spoken by nearly 20 million people . The official languages of the country are English and French . Early inhabitants of the territory included the Sao civilisation around Lake Chad and the Baka hunter-gatherers in the southeastern rainforest . Portuguese explorers reached the coast in the 15th century and named the area Rio dos Camar\u00f5es ( Shrimp River ) , which became Cameroon in English . Fulani soldiers founded the Adamawa Emirate in the north in the 19th century , and various ethnic groups of the west and northwest established powerful chiefdoms and fondoms . Cameroon became a German colony in 1884 known as Kamerun . After World War I , the territory was divided between France and the United Kingdom as League of Nations mandates ."
