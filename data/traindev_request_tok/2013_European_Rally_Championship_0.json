The events success could also be attributed to the similar and older Portuguese events the Rali Vinho da Madeira held on the island of Madeira 400 km to the north and Rallye A\u00e7ores which is based on the island of S\u00e3o Miguel Island which is on the mid-Atlantic ridge .

Spain 's world champion , Carlos Sainz won the event in five consecutive years from 1985-1989 in a variety of cars . Fellow Spaniards Jes\u00fas Puras and Luis Monz\u00f3n have taken three wins as has Czech driver Jan Kopeck\u00fd .
