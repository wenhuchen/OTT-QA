Its headquarters is located in the Quartier International of Montreal , Quebec , Canada . The ICAO Council adopts standards and recommended practices concerning air navigation , its infrastructure , flight inspection , prevention of unlawful interference , and facilitation of border-crossing procedures for international civil aviation .

The Air Navigation Commission ( ANC ) is the technical body within ICAO . The Commission is composed of 19 Commissioners , nominated by the ICAO 's contracting states and appointed by the ICAO Council . Commissioners serve as independent experts , who although nominated by their states , do not serve as state or political representatives . International Standards And Recommended Practices are developed under the direction of the ANC through the formal process of ICAO Panels . Once approved by the Commission , standards are sent to the Council , the political body of ICAO , for consultation and coordination with the Member States before final adoption . ICAO is distinct from other international air transport organizations , particularly because it alone is vested with international authority ( among signatory states ) : other organizations include the International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) , a trade association representing airlines ; the Civil Air Navigation Services Organization ( CANSO ) , an organization for Air navigation service providers ( ANSPs ) ; and the Airports Council International , a trade association of airport authorities .",

Situated in the department of El Pet\u00e9n , the site is part of Guatemala 's Tikal National Park and in 1979 it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Tikal was the capital of a conquest state that became one of the most powerful kingdoms of the ancient Maya . Though monumental architecture at the site dates back as far as the 4th century BCE , Tikal reached its apogee during the Classic Period , c. 200 to 900 CE . During this time , the city dominated much of the Maya region politically , economically , and militarily , while interacting with areas throughout Mesoamerica such as the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico . There is evidence that Tikal was conquered by Teotihuacan in the 4th century CE . Following the end of the Late Classic Period , no new major monuments were built at Tikal and there is evidence that elite palaces were burned . These events were coupled with a gradual population decline , culminating with the site 's abandonment by the end of the 10th century . Tikal is the best understood of any of the large lowland Maya cities , with a long dynastic ruler list , the discovery of the tombs of many of the rulers on this list and the investigation of their monuments , temples and palaces .",
