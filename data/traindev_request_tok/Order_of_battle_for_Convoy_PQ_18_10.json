  "/wiki/Kriegsmarine": "The Kriegsmarine ( German pronunciation : [ \u02c8k\u0281i\u02d0ksma\u02cc\u0281i\u02d0n\u0259 ] , lit . War Navy ) was the navy of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1945 . It superseded the Imperial German Navy of the German Empire ( 1871-1918 ) and the inter-war Reichsmarine ( 1919-1935 ) of the Weimar Republic . The Kriegsmarine was one of three official branches , along with the Heer and the Luftwaffe of the Wehrmacht , the German armed forces from 1933 to 1945 . In violation of the Treaty of Versailles , the Kriegsmarine grew rapidly during German naval rearmament in the 1930s . The 1919 treaty had limited the size of the German navy and prohibited the building of submarines . Kriegsmarine ships were deployed to the waters around Spain during the Spanish Civil War ( 1936-1939 ) under the guise of enforcing non-intervention , but in reality supported the Nationalists against the Spanish Republicans . In January 1939 , Plan Z was ordered , calling for surface naval parity with the British Royal Navy by 1944 . When World War II broke out in September 1939 , Plan Z was shelved in favour of a crash building program for submarines ( U-boats ) instead of capital surface warships and land and air forces were given priority of strategic resources . The Commander-in-Chief of the Kriegsmarine ( as for all branches of armed forces during the period of absolute Nazi power ) was Adolf Hitler , who exercised his authority through the Oberkommando der Marine . The Kriegsmarine 's most significant ships were the U-boats , most of which were constructed after Plan Z was abandoned at the beginning of World War II . Wolfpacks were rapidly assembled groups of submarines which attacked British convoys during the first half of the Battle of the Atlantic but this tactic was largely abandoned by May 1943 when U-boat losses mounted .",

  "/wiki/German_submarine_U-703": "German submarine U-703 was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine deployed during the Second World War against allied shipping in the Arctic Ocean . She was a successful boat , which had a far longer service life than most other U-boats , primarily due to the restricted zone of operations in which she fought . Her main mission during the war was to target the Arctic Convoys which carried supplies to the Soviet Union from Britain . At this she was quite successful in her three years of raiding until her presumed demise in 1944 . U-703 was built at Hamburg in Northern Germany on the North Sea . She was completed in the autumn of 1941 , and given to the experienced Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Heinz Bielfeld to command . He took her on her working-up period in which the boat was tested and the crew trained in the Baltic Sea and around the German held coastlines , before being dispatched to Narvik in Norway for her first war patrol in April 1942 ."
