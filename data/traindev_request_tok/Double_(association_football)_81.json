  "/wiki/Highlands_Park_F.C.": "Highlands Park F.C . was a professional association football club in Johannesburg , South Africa , that existed from November 1959 to February 1983 .

Ahead of the 1979 season , the club signed a five-year sponsor deal with Dion , that soon introduced a lot of changes to the club . Beside of changing the players outfit to orange , the club also made an effort to maximise publicity of their new sponsor , by renaming the club to Dion Highlands F.C . in 1979 . As the media however continued referring to the club simply as Highlands , the club made the radical decision in February 1980 , to skip the long lasting historical part of their name , with the official name being changed to Dion F.C . Apparently this change however only lasted for a very short while in 1980 , as the newspapers continued referring to the club as Dion Highlands F.C. , in the subsequent years from 1981 to February 1983 . The club played its last official professional match at 12 February 1983 , where the club lost the final of the special NPSL cup competition known as BP Top Eight Cup , with the score 0-2 to Orlando Pirates .",
