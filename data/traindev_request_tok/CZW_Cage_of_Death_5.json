  "/wiki/Dark_match": "Professional wrestling has accrued a considerable amount of jargon throughout its existence . Much of it stems from the industry 's origins in the days of carnivals and circuses . In the past , professional wrestlers used such terms in the presence of fans so as not to reveal the worked nature of the business . In recent years , widespread discussion on the Internet has popularized these terms . Many of the terms refer to the financial aspects of professional wrestling in addition to in-ring terms .",

These match types can be organized into several loose groups .",
  "/wiki/Greg_Matthews": "Gregory Richard John Mo Matthews ( born 15 December 1959 ) is a former New South Wales and Australian cricket all rounder ( off-spin bowler and left-handed batsman ) who is now a television cricket commentator . When Australian cricket was in the doldrums in the mid-1980s his dashing batsmanship and growing ability as a spin bowler suddenly elevated Matthews to a position of a national hero . He made centuries in times of crisis against New Zealand and India in 1985-86 , took ten wickets in the Tied Test at Madras and batted well against England in 1986-87 . Thereafter his career declined as the effervescent and unorthodox Matthews did not fit in with the rest of the Australian Test team . As Australia rose to dominance in the 1990s Matthews proved to be not good enough in either of the game 's main departments to make a lasting impact as a Test all-rounder and despite a century against England in 1990-91 he played only irregularly and was finally dropped in 1993 . He continued to play with success for New South Wales until he retired in 1997 .",

  "/wiki/Ladder_match": "A ladder match is a type of match in professional wrestling , most commonly one where an item ( usually a title belt ) is hung above the ring , and the winner is the contestant who climbs a ladder and retrieves the item . The ladder itself becomes a key feature of the match , as wrestlers will use the ladder as a weapon to strike the opponent ( s ) , as a launching pad for acrobatic attacks , and frequently these matches include impressive falls from the top of the ladder . However , there were very few matches in which the hung item must be used in a special manner in order to win the match , such as striking the opponent with the item ( see Bam Bam Bigelow Vs. Scott Hall taser match , where one must strike the opponent with the taser , regardless of who retrieved the taser first ) . Ladder matches are often used as a finale to storylines and it is more common to have symbolic briefcases ( usually containing a contract for a future championship match ) or championship belts hung above the ring . Ladder matches and their variants ( such as TLC matches and Full Metal Mayhem ) are often used in feuds that involve a dispute over possession of an item ( such as a stolen title belt or the paperwork for the contractual services of a manager ) . Ladder matches are almost always fought under no disqualification rules .",
