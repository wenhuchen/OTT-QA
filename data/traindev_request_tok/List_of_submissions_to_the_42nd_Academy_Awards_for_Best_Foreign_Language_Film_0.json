  "/wiki/Z_(1969_film)": "Z is a 1969 Algerian-French epic political thriller film directed by Costa-Gavras , with a screenplay by Gavras and Jorge Sempr\u00fan , based on the 1966 novel of the same name by Vassilis Vassilikos . The film presents a thinly fictionalized account of the events surrounding the assassination of democratic Greek politician Grigoris Lambrakis in 1963 . With its satirical view of Greek politics , its dark sense of humor , and its downbeat ending , the film captures the director 's outrage about the junta that ruled Greece at the time of its making . The film stars Jean-Louis Trintignant as the investigating magistrate ( an analogue of Christos Sartzetakis who later served as president of Greece from 1985 to 1990 ) . International stars Yves Montand and Irene Papas also appear , but despite their star billing have very little screen time . Jacques Perrin , who co-produced , plays a key role as a photojournalist . The film 's title refers to a popular Greek protest slogan ( Greek : \u0396\u03b5\u03b9 , IPA : [ \u02c8zi ] ) meaning he lives , in reference to Lambrakis . Z was the first film - and one of only a handful - to be nominated for both the Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Foreign Language Film . It won the latter , as well as the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival , the BAFTA Award for Best Film Music , and the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign-Language Foreign Film ; at the 27th Golden Globe Awards , the producers of Z refused the award to protest against the film 's exclusion from the Best Motion Picture - Drama category .",

Though her film career was brief , she was a trailblazer for socially critical art cinema in Hong Kong 's populist film industry , as well as its first noted woman director . Tang was born in Yunnan province , China . She graduated from the University of Southern California . Tang 's best-known films are her first two , The Arch ( 1968 ) and China Behind ( 1974 ) . The first film looks at the subjugation of women and their sexuality in a traditional village through the story of a widow 's unconsummated passion for a male houseguest . The second follows the harrowing journey of a group of college students trying to cross illegally into Hong Kong from a China torn by the Cultural Revolution . The bleak portrait in China Behind of both communist China and capitalist Hong Kong brought upon it a thirteen-year ban by the British colonial authorities . In addition to their provocative themes , both films used stylistic devices , such as freeze-frames and expressionistic color , possibly inspired by the European art cinema of the 1960s . Tang made two more , less noted , films , Sup Sap Bup Dup ( 1975 ) and The Hong Kong Tycoon ( 1979 ) . She also launched the territory 's first serious film journal , Close-Up , in 1976 .
