  "/wiki/Schenectady,_New_York": "Schenectady ( /sk\u0259\u02c8n\u025bkt\u0259di/ ) is a city in Schenectady County , New York , United States , of which it is the county seat . As of the 2010 census , the city had a population of 66,135 . The name Schenectady is derived from a Mohawk word , skahn\u00e9htati , meaning beyond the pines . Schenectady was founded on the south side of the Mohawk River by Dutch colonists in the 17th century , many from the Albany area . They were prohibited from the fur trade by the Albany monopoly , which kept its control after the English takeover in 1664 . Residents of the new village developed farms on strip plots along the river . Connected to the west via the Mohawk River and Erie Canal , Schenectady developed rapidly in the 19th century as part of the Mohawk Valley trade , manufacturing and transportation corridor . By 1824 more people worked in manufacturing than agriculture or trade , and the city had a cotton mill , processing cotton from the Deep South . Numerous mills in New York had such ties with the South . Through the 19th century , nationally influential companies and industries developed in Schenectady , including General Electric and American Locomotive Company ( ALCO ) , which were powers into the mid-20th century . Schenectady was part of emerging technologies , with GE collaborating in the production of nuclear-powered submarines and , in the 21st century , working on other forms of renewable energy . Schenectady is in eastern New York , near the confluence of the Mohawk and Hudson rivers .",

  "/wiki/NY_5": "New York State Route 5 ( NY 5 ) is a state highway that extends for 370.80 miles ( 596.74 km ) across the state of New York in the United States . It begins at the Pennsylvania state line in the Chautauqua County town of Ripley and passes through Buffalo , Syracuse , Utica , Schenectady , and several other smaller cities and communities on its way to downtown Albany in Albany County , where it terminates at U.S. Route 9 ( US 9 ) , here routed along the service roads for Interstate 787 ( I-787 ) . Prior to the construction of the New York State Thruway , it was one of two main east-west highways traversing upstate New York , the other being US 20 . West of New York , NY 5 continues as Pennsylvania Route 5 ( PA 5 ) to Erie . NY 5 overlaps with US 20 twice along its routing . The second , a 68-mile ( 109 km ) overlap through western and central New York , is the second-longest concurrency in the state , stretching from Avon east to the city of Auburn in Cayuga County . The concurrency is known locally as Routes 5 and 20 . As the route proceeds across the state , it also directly or indirectly meets every major north-south highway in upstate New York , including all three north-south Interstate Highways ( I-390 in Avon , I-81 in Syracuse via US 11 , and I-87 in Albany ) . NY 5 was assigned in 1924 as a true cross-state highway , extending from the Pennsylvania state line in the west to the Massachusetts state line in the east , mostly by way of modern US 20 . At the time , modern NY 5 between Buffalo and Albany was designated as New York State Route 5A . By 1926 , NY 5 was moved onto the routing of NY 5A while the old routing of NY 5 became NY 7 . It was truncated in 1927 to Athol Springs in the west and Albany in the east following the assignment of US 20 , and again in 1930 to downtown Buffalo .",
