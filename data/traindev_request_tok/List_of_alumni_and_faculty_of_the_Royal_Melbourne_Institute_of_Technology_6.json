  "/wiki/Graham_Bennett_(costume_designer)": "Graham Stewart Bennett ( 16 December 1933 - 5 November 2004 ) was an Australian production and costume designer , teacher and artist who worked unofficially with Oscar winner John Truscott and later , as a teacher , inspired Oscar winner Adam Elliot . He attended Scotch College from 1945 to 1949 , then studied art and design at RMIT , then taught in secondary schools in Melbourne and Hamilton . While working by day at Broadmeadows Technical College , he worked at night with his flatmate Truscott on the Melbourne production of Camelot , then the British premiere and then the 1967 movie Camelot . Bennett relied on a semi-abstract feel for the set and costume design . The movie was not to have anything that was referenced to any historical period , he says . I saw the movie a few weeks ago , and even today , it 's very modern , a lot of the design work . For the movie , Bennett designed furnishings such as curtains , and tapestries , the patterns on women 's costumes and men 's jackets , and King Arthur and Guinevere 's crowns . Bennett was unable to share the recognition with John Truscott on the Oscar-winning art direction and costume design in Camelot in 1967 . He was not invited to the ceremony as he did not have a green card he was working illegally in the USA , and could not formally share the awards . I was sitting at home in Burbank , watching with the wardrobe lady , and we drank champagne , and when John ( Truscott ) came home , we drank another bottle of champagne . And the next morning at breakfast , we had the Oscars just sitting there , next to the pepper and salt . Bennett said , Every time I see it [ Camelot ] , I see something that I have n't seen before in the detail .",
  "/wiki/Academy_Award": "The Academy Awards , more popularly known as the Oscars , are awards for artistic and technical merit in the film industry . Given annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ( AMPAS ) , the awards are an international recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements as assessed by the Academy 's voting membership . The various category winners are awarded a copy of a golden statuette , officially called the Academy Award of Merit , although more commonly referred to by its nickname , the Oscar . The statuette depicts a knight rendered in the Art Deco style . The award was originally sculpted by George Stanley from a design sketch by Cedric Gibbons . AMPAS first presented it in 1929 at a private dinner hosted by Douglas Fairbanks in the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel in what would become known as the 1st Academy Awards . The Academy Awards ceremony was first broadcast by radio in 1930 and was televised for the first time in 1953 . It is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony and is now televised live worldwide . It is also the oldest of the four major annual American entertainment awards ; its other three equivalents - the Emmy Awards for television , the Tony Awards for theater , and the Grammy Awards for music - are modeled after the Academy Awards .

  "/wiki/Arctic_Fox": "The Arctic fox ( Vulpes lagopus ) , also known as the white fox , polar fox , or snow fox , is a small fox native to the Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere and common throughout the Arctic tundra biome . It is well adapted to living in cold environments , and is best known for its thick , warm fur that is also used as camouflage . In the wild , most individuals do not live past their first year but some exceptional ones survive up to 11 years . Its body length ranges from 46 to 68 cm ( 18 to 27 in ) , with a generally rounded body shape to minimize the escape of body heat . The Arctic fox preys on many small creatures such as lemmings , voles , ringed seal pups , fish , waterfowl , and seabirds . It also eats carrion , berries , seaweed , and insects and other small invertebrates . Arctic foxes form monogamous pairs during the breeding season and they stay together to raise their young in complex underground dens . Occasionally , other family members may assist in raising their young . Natural predators of the Arctic fox are golden eagles , polar bears , wolverines , red foxes , wolves , and grizzly bears .",
  "/wiki/Pinniped": "Pinnipeds , [ a ] commonly known as seals , [ b ] are a widely distributed and diverse clade of carnivorous , fin-footed , semiaquatic marine mammals . They comprise the extant families Odobenidae ( whose only living member is the walrus ) , Otariidae ( the eared seals : sea lions and fur seals ) , and Phocidae ( the earless seals , or true seals ) . There are 33 extant species of pinnipeds , and more than 50 extinct species have been described from fossils . While seals were historically thought to have descended from two ancestral lines , molecular evidence supports them as a monophyletic lineage ( descended from one ancestral line ) . Pinnipeds belong to the order Carnivora and their closest living relatives are believed to be bears and the superfamily of musteloids ( weasels , raccoons , skunks , and red pandas ) , having diverged about 50 million years ago . Seals range in size from the 1 m ( 3 ft 3 in ) and 45 kg ( 99 lb ) Baikal seal to the 5 m ( 16 ft ) and 3,200 kg ( 7,100 lb ) southern elephant seal , which is also the largest member of the order Carnivora . Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism . They have streamlined bodies and four limbs that are modified into flippers . Though not as fast in the water as dolphins , seals are more flexible and agile . Otariids use their front limbs primarily to propel themselves through the water , while phocids and walruses use their hind limbs . Otariids and walruses have hind limbs that can be pulled under the body and used as legs on land . By comparison , terrestrial locomotion by phocids is more cumbersome .",
  "/wiki/Whale": "Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals . They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea , usually excluding dolphins and porpoises . Whales , dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla , which consists of even-toed ungulates . Their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses , having diverged about 40 million years ago . The two parvorders of whales , baleen whales ( Mysticeti ) and toothed whales ( Odontoceti ) , are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago . Whales consist of eight extant families : Balaenopteridae ( the rorquals ) , Balaenidae ( right whales ) , Cetotheriidae ( the pygmy right whale ) , Eschrichtiidae ( the grey whale ) , Monodontidae ( belugas and narwhals ) , Physeteridae ( the sperm whale ) , Kogiidae ( the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale ) , and Ziphiidae ( the beaked whales ) . Whales are creatures of the open ocean ; they feed , mate , give birth , suckle and raise their young at sea . So extreme is their adaptation to life underwater that they are unable to survive on land . Whales range in size from the 2.6 metres ( 8.5 ft ) and 135 kilograms ( 298 lb ) dwarf sperm whale to the 29.9 metres ( 98 ft ) and 190 metric tons ( 210 short tons ) blue whale , which is the largest known creature that has ever lived . The sperm whale is the largest toothed predator on earth . Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism , in that the females are larger than males . Baleen whales have no teeth ; instead they have plates of baleen , a fringe-like structure used to expel water while retaining the krill and plankton which they feed on ."
