  "/wiki/Poem": "Poetry ( derived from the Greek poiesis , making ) is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language - such as phonaesthetics , sound symbolism , and metre - to evoke meanings in addition to , or in place of , the prosaic ostensible meaning . Poetry has a long history dating back to prehistoric times with hunting poetry in Africa , and to panegyric and elegiac court poetry of the empires of the Nile , Niger , and Volta River valleys . Some of the earliest written poetry in Africa is found among the Pyramid Texts written during the 25th century BCE . The earliest Western Asian epic poetry , the Epic of Gilgamesh , was written in Sumerian . Early poems in the Eurasian continent evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing ; or from a need to retell oral epics , as with the Sanskrit Vedas , the Zoroastrian Gathas , and the Homeric epics , the Iliad and the Odyssey . Ancient Greek attempts to define poetry , such as Aristotle 's Poetics , focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric , drama , song , and comedy . Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition , verse form , and rhyme , and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative prosaic writing . Poetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words , or to evoke emotive responses . Devices such as assonance , alliteration , onomatopoeia , and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects . The use of ambiguity , symbolism , irony , and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations . Similarly , figures of speech such as metaphor , simile , and metonymy create a resonance between otherwise disparate images - a layering of meanings , forming connections previously not perceived . Kindred forms of resonance may exist , between individual verses , in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm .",
