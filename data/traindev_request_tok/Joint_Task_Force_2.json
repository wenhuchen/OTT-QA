Dwight D. Eisenhower was an instructor . It has often been rumored that the 301st , the parent unit of the 66th , was first commanded by Col. George S. Patton , but this appears not to have been the case ; while Patton was the first officer assigned to the Tank Corps , and while the 301st Tank Battalion was the first unit formed , Patton went nearly immediately to France to train Americans attached to Allied commands . The 301st was the only American heavy tank battalion to have seen action in the war .

It was named for a UTM north-south coordinate line ( an Easting , measured in kilometers and readable on GPS receivers ) in the featureless desert that was used as a phase line to measure progress of the offensive as they were going through what the Iraqis thought was trackless desert . The battle was later described in a documentary as the last great tank battle of the 20th century . This battle took place several hours after another , smaller , tank battle known as the Battle of Al Busayyah . The main U.S. unit in the battle was the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment ( 2nd ACR ) , a 4,500 man reconnaissance and security element assigned to VII Corps . It consisted of three ground squadrons ( 1st , 2nd and 3rd ) , an aviation ( attack helicopter ) squadron ( 4th ) , and a support squadron . Each ground squadron was made up of three cavalry troops , a tank company , a self-propelled howitzer battery , and a headquarters troop . Each troop comprised 120 soldiers , 12-13 M3 Bradley fighting vehicles and nine M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks . Task Force 1-41 Infantry breached the berm on the borders between Saudi Arabia and Iraq which was the initial Iraqi defensive positions and performed reconnaissance and counter reconnaissance missions prior to the 2nd ACR 's actions . This generally includes destroying or repelling the Iraqis ' reconnaissance elements and denying their commander any observation of friendly forces . The corps ' main body consisted of the American 2nd Armored Division ( Forward ) , 1st Armored Division ( 1st AD ) , 3rd Armored Division ( 3rd AD ) , 1st Infantry Division ( 1st ID ) , and the British 1st Armoured Division ( 1 AD ) .

The 2nd Armored Division ( Fwd ) 's Task Force 1-41 Infantry would be the spearhead of VII Corps . The British 1st Armoured division was responsible for protecting the right flank of VII Corps , their main adversary being the Iraqi 52nd Armored Division and multiple infantry divisions . It was the final battle of the war before the unilateral ceasefire took effect . One more battle occurred near the oil field at Rumaila after the ceasefire . The Battle of Norfolk has been recognized by some sources as the second largest tank battle in American history and the largest tank battle of the 1st Gulf War . No fewer than 12 divisions participated in the Battle of Norfolk along with multiple brigades and elements of a regiment . American and British forces destroyed approximately 850 Iraqi tanks and hundreds of other types of combat vehicles .
