When the borough was created in the Local Government Act 1972 , a name was sought that would not unduly identify the borough with any of its constituent parts , particularly the former county boroughs of Bootle and Southport . The locality had strong links with both the Earl of Sefton and the Earl of Derby , resident of Knowsley Hall , and given the fact that the immediately adjacent borough was subsequently named Knowsley it seems equally likely that the choice of name was derived from the names of the local nobility .
