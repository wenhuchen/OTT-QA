  "/wiki/Metropolitan_borough": "A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England , and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county . Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972 , metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts . However , all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status ( as well as , in some cases , city status ) . Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985 . However , metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties , such as combined authorities .",
  "/wiki/Metropolitan_Borough_of_Oldham": "The Metropolitan Borough of Oldham is a metropolitan borough of Greater Manchester , England . It has a population of 235,623 , and spans 55 square miles ( 142 km2 ) . The borough is named after its largest town , Oldham , but also includes the outlying towns of Chadderton , Failsworth , Royton and Shaw and Crompton , the village of Lees , and the parish of Saddleworth . Although a 20th-century creation , the borough has Neolithic , Bronze Age and Roman heritage . It encompasses several former mill towns , which expanded and coalesced during the late 19th century as a result of population growth and advances in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution . Although some parts contiguous with the city of Manchester are highly industrialised and densely populated , about two-thirds of the borough is composed of rural open space ; the eastern half stretches across the South Pennines . For its first 12 years the borough had a two-tier system of local government ; Oldham Council shared power with the Greater Manchester County Council . Since the Local Government Act 1985 Oldham Council has effectively been a unitary authority , serving as the sole executive , deliberative and legislative body responsible for local policy , setting council tax , and allocating budget in the district . The Metropolitan Borough of Oldham has two civil parishes and 20 electoral wards . Noted as one of the more unpopular amalgamations of territory created by local government reform in the 1970s , the Oldham borough underwent a \u00a3100,000 rebranding exercise in early 2008 . The town has no listed buildings with a Grade I rating , and the borough 's architecture has been described as mediocre . There have been calls for the borough to be renamed , but that possibility was dismissed during the rebranding of 2008 .",
