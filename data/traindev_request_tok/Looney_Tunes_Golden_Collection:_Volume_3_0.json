  "/wiki/Hare_Force": "Hare Force is a 1944 Warner Bros. cartoon in the Merrie Melodies series , directed by Friz Freleng and starring Bugs Bunny and an old lady . Although the title is an obvious play on Air Force , the cartoon 's plot has nothing to do with the military . As Time Goes By is sung in this short by Sylvester the dog ( not to be confused with Sylvester the cat ) and Bugs at different points . This cartoon is also the first short that uses the refined design of Bugs Bunny outside of a Bob Clampett directed cartoon , though it was slightly tweaked by Freleng in this short .",
  "/wiki/Willoughby_the_Dog": "Willoughby is a minor animated cartoon fictional character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes series of cartoons . He is a hound dog who is characterized by his below-average intelligence and overall gullibility . Willoughby first appeared in the 1940 cartoon Of Fox and Hounds . He was created and voiced by Tex Avery . According to Chuck Jones , the character was based on Lennie , from Of Mice and Men ( of which the title of Of Fox and Hounds is a knockoff ) . [ citation needed ] Critic Steven Hartley described this short as lacking in creativity , originality , excitement , and story construction , particularly compared to Avery 's seminal earlier work A Wild Hare . Willoughby later appears in other Warner Brothers animated shorts , including The Heckling Hare ( 1941 ) , The Crackpot Quail ( 1941 ) , and Nutty News ( 1942 ) , as the lead dog of a fox hunting party . A fundamentally similar character , Laramore , appears in To Duck or Not to Duck ( 1943 ) , albeit with a fully brown coat of fur . Willoughby 's brief career was essentially over before the end of World War II .",

The film was the second Bugs Bunny cartoon to be directed by Frank Tashlin at Warner Bros. , the first being The Unruly Hare ( 1945 ) .

He has one of the more disputed origins in the Warner Bros. cartoon pantheon ( second only to Bugs himself ) . His aim is to hunt Bugs , but he usually ends up seriously injuring himself and other antagonizing characters . He speaks in an unusual way , replacing his Rs and Ls with Ws , so he always refers to Bugs Bunny as a scwewy wabbit . Elmer 's signature catchphrase is , Shhh . Be vewy vewy quiet , I 'm hunting wabbits , as well as his trademark laughter . The best known Elmer Fudd cartoons include Chuck Jones ' work What 's Opera , Doc ? ( one of the few times Fudd bested Bugs , though he felt bad about it ) , the Rossini parody Rabbit of Seville , and the Hunting Trilogy of Rabbit Season/Duck Season shorts ( Rabbit Fire , Rabbit Seasoning , and Duck ! Rabbit , Duck ! ) with Fudd , Bugs Bunny , and Daffy Duck . An earlier character named Egghead set some of Elmer 's aspects before the character 's more conspicuous features were set .",

It stars Bugs Bunny and a pack of dogs ( the leader being a bulldog who resembles Hector ) .

Shield and then he pulls it down during the post-1948 period . This would not occur again until ( Blooper ) Bunny in 1991 .
