  "/wiki/Dutch_oven": "A Dutch oven is a thick-walled cooking pot with a tight-fitting lid . Dutch ovens are usually made of seasoned cast iron ; however , some Dutch ovens are instead made of cast aluminium , or ceramic . Some metal varieties are enameled rather than being seasoned . Dutch ovens have been used as cooking vessels for hundreds of years . They are called casserole dishes in English-speaking countries other than the United States ( casserole means pot in French ) , and cocottes in French . They are similar to both the Japanese tetsunabe and the sa\u010d , a traditional Balkan cast-iron oven , and are related to the South African potjiekos , the Australian Bedourie oven and Spanish cazuela .",

  "/wiki/Sauroposeidon": "Sauroposeidon ( /\u02ccs\u0254\u02d0ro\u028apo\u028a\u02c8sa\u026ad\u0259n/ SOR-o-po-SY-d\u0259n ; meaning lizard earthquake god , after the Greek god Poseidon ) is a genus of sauropod dinosaur known from several incomplete specimens including a bone bed and fossilized trackways that have been found in the American states of Oklahoma , Wyoming , and Texas . The fossils were found in rocks dating from near the end of the Early Cretaceous ( Aptian-early Albian ) , a time when sauropod diversity in North America had greatly diminished . It was the last known North American sauropod prior to an absence of the group on the continent of roughly 40 million years that ended with the appearance of Alamosaurus during the Maastrichtian . While the holotype remains were initially discovered in 1994 , due to their unexpected age and unusual size they were initially misclassified as pieces of petrified wood . A more detailed analysis in 1999 revealed their true nature which resulted in a minor media frenzy , and formal publication of the find the following year . Paleoecological analysis indicates that Sauroposeidon lived on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico , in a river delta . Extrapolations based on the more completely known Brachiosaurus indicate that the head of Sauroposeidon could reach 17-18 m ( 56-59 ft ) in height with its neck extended , which would make it the tallest known dinosaur . With an estimated length of 27-34 m ( 89-112 ft ) and a mass of 40-60 t ( 44-66 short tons ) , it also ranks among the longest and heaviest . However , this animal may not be as closely related to Brachiosaurus as previously thought , so these estimates may be inaccurate . While initially described as a brachiosaurid closely related to Brachiosaurus and Giraffatitan , the discovery of additional remains in the Cloverly Formation of Wyoming suggested that it was in fact more closely related to the titanosaurs , in the group Somphospondyli . Analysis of these remains and comparison with others from Texas supported this conclusion , and demonstrated that the more completely known sauropods from the Twin Mountains Formation ( including a partial skull and fossil trackways ) previously named Paluxysaurus jonesi also belonged to Sauroposeidon . It is the state dinosaur of Texas .",

  "/wiki/Cotton": "Cotton is a soft , fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll , or protective case , around the seeds of the cotton plants of the genus Gossypium in the mallow family Malvaceae . The fiber is almost pure cellulose . Under natural conditions , the cotton bolls will increase the dispersal of the seeds . The plant is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world , including the Americas , Africa , Egypt and India . The greatest diversity of wild cotton species is found in Mexico , followed by Australia and Africa . Cotton was independently domesticated in the Old and New Worlds . The fiber is most often spun into yarn or thread and used to make a soft , breathable textile . The use of cotton for fabric is known to date to prehistoric times ; fragments of cotton fabric dated to the fifth millennium BCE have been found in the Indus Valley Civilization , as well as fabric remnants dated back to 6000 BCE in Peru . Although cultivated since antiquity , it was the invention of the cotton gin that lowered the cost of production that led to its widespread use , and it is the most widely used natural fiber cloth in clothing today . Current estimates for world production are about 25 million tonnes or 110 million bales annually , accounting for 2.5% of the world 's arable land . India is the world 's largest producer of cotton . The United States has been the largest exporter for many years .",

  "/wiki/Square_dance": "A square dance is a dance for four couples ( eight dancers in total ) arranged in a square , with one couple on each side , facing the middle of the square . Square dances were first documented in 16th-century England but were also quite common in France and throughout Europe . They came to North America with the European settlers and have undergone considerable development there . In some countries and regions , through preservation and repetition , square dances have attained the status of a folk dance . The Western American square dance may be the most widely known form worldwide , possibly due to its association in the 20th century with the romanticized image of the American cowboy . Square dancing is , therefore , strongly associated with the United States . Nineteen U.S. states have designated it as their official state dance . The various square dance movements are based on the steps and figures used in traditional folk dances and social dances from many countries . Some of these traditional dances include English country dance , Caledonians and the quadrille . In most American forms of square dance , the dancers are prompted or cued through a sequence of steps ( square dance choreography ) by a caller to the beat ( and , in some traditions , the phrasing ) of music . In some forms of traditional square dancing , the caller may be one of the dancers or musicians , but in modern Western square dancing the caller will be on stage , giving full attention to directing the dancers . Modern Western square dances are not learned as complete routines ; the dancers learn basic movements , each with its own distinctive call , but do not know in what order they will be called .",

  "/wiki/Western_swing": "Western swing music is a subgenre of American country music that originated in the late 1920s in the West and South among the region 's Western string bands . It is dance music , often with an up-tempo beat , which attracted huge crowds to dance halls and clubs in Texas , Oklahoma and California during the 1930s and 1940s until a federal war-time nightclub tax in 1944 contributed to the genre 's decline . The movement was an outgrowth of jazz . The music is an amalgamation of rural , cowboy , polka , folk , Dixieland jazz and blues blended with swing ; and played by a hot string band often augmented with drums , saxophones , pianos and , notably , the steel guitar . The electrically amplified stringed instruments , especially the steel guitar , give the music a distinctive sound . Later incarnations have also included overtones of bebop . Western swing differs in several ways from the music played by the nationally popular horn-driven big swing bands of the same era . In Western bands , even fully orchestrated bands , vocals , and other instruments followed the fiddle 's lead . Additionally , although popular horn bands tended to arrange and score their music , most Western bands improvised freely , either by soloists or collectively . Prominent groups during the peak of Western swing 's popularity included The Light Crust Doughboys , Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys , Milton Brown and His Musical Brownies , Spade Cooley and His Orchestra and Hank Thompson And His Brazos Valley Boys . Contemporary groups include Asleep at the Wheel and the Hot Club of Cowtown . According to Merle Travis , Western swing is nothing more than a group of talented country boys , unschooled in music , but playing the music they feel , beating a solid two-four rhythm to the harmonies that buzz around their brains .",
  "/wiki/Acoustic_guitar": "An acoustic guitar is a musical instrument in the guitar family , that projects the sounds of its vibrating strings acoustically through the air . Originally just called a guitar , the retronym 'acoustic guitar ' came in use to distinguish it from an electric guitar , that relies on an electronic amplification system . The sound waves from the strings of an acoustic guitar resonate through the instrument 's body , amplifying the sound . Typically , a guitar 's body is a sound box , of which the top side serves as a sound board that enhances the vibration sounds of the strings . In standard tuning the guitar 's six strings are tuned ( low to high ) E2 A2 D3 G3 B3 E4 . Guitar strings may be plucked individually with a pick or fingertip , or strummed to play chords . Plucking a string causes it to vibrate at a fundamental pitch determined by the string 's length , mass , and tension . ( Overtones are also present , closely related to harmonics of the fundamental pitch . ) The string causes the soundboard and the air enclosed by the sound box to vibrate . As these have their own resonances , they amplify some overtones more strongly than others , affecting the timbre of the resulting sound .",
