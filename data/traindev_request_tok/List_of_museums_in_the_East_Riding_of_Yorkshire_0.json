  "/wiki/East_Riding_of_Yorkshire": "The East Riding of Yorkshire , or simply East Riding or East Yorkshire , is an area in Northern England and can refer either to the administrative county ( Local Government Area ) of the East Riding of Yorkshire which is a unitary authority , to the ceremonial county ( Lieutenancy ) of the East Riding of Yorkshire or to the easternmost of the three subdivisions ( ridings ) of the traditional county of Yorkshire . No two of these areas share the same geographical boundaries despite sharing the same name . The traditional East Riding of Yorkshire includes parts of ceremonial North Yorkshire such as Filey but not Goole , whereas both the administrative and ceremonial East Riding of Yorkshire include Goole but not those parts of North Yorkshire . Both the traditional and ceremonial East Riding include Kingston upon Hull , but the administrative East Riding does not as Kingston upon Hull is in its own unitary authority . The traditional East Riding covers a larger area than both the ceremonial and administrative East Riding . The East Riding , North Riding and West Riding were treated as three separate counties for many purposes , such as having separate quarter sessions . In 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888 , administrative counties with a county council were created on the historic boundaries . In 1974 both the Local Government Area and the Lieutenancy of the East Riding of Yorkshire were abolished under the Local Government Act 1972 , being succeeded in most of the riding by the newly created Humberside which included parts of the West Riding and parts of Lincolnshire . The modern Local Government Area and the ceremonial East Riding of Yorkshire were formed in 1996 from the northern part of Humberside upon its abolition . At the 2011 Census , the population was 334,179 .

The town is known for Beverley Minster , Beverley Westwood , North Bar ( a 15th-century gate ) and Beverley Racecourse . It inspired the naming of the city of Beverly , Massachusetts , which in turn was the impetus for Beverly Hills , California . The town was originally known as Inderawuda and was founded around 700 AD by Saint John of Beverley during the time of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria . After a period of Viking control , it passed to the Cerdic dynasty , a period during which it gained prominence in terms of religious importance in Great Britain . It continued to grow especially under the Normans when its trading industry was first established . A place of pilgrimage throughout the Middle Ages due to its founder , it eventually became a significant wool-trading town . Beverley was once the tenth-largest town in England , as well as one of the richest , because of its wool and the pilgrims who came to venerate its founding saint , John of Beverley . After the Reformation , the stature of Beverley was much reduced . In the 20th century , Beverley was the administrative centre of the local government district of the Borough of Beverley ( 1974-1996 ) .

  "/wiki/Coble": "The coble is a type of open traditional fishing boat which developed on the North East coast of England . The southern-most examples occur around Hull ( although Cooke drew examples at Yarmouth , see his Shipping and Craft series of drawings of 1829 ) ; the type extends to Burnmouth just across the Scottish border . The distinctive shape of the boat - flat-bottomed and high-bowed - arose to cope with the particular conditions prevalent in this area . Flat bottoms allowed launching from and landing upon shallow , sandy beaches ; an advantage in this part of the coast where the wide bays and inlets provided little shelter from stormy weather . However , fishermen required high bows to sail in the dangerous North Sea and in particular to launch into the surf and to land on the beaches . The design contains relics of Norse influence , though in the main it shows Dutch origin . A Scottish version of the coble , much shallower and beamier than the English type , serves for salmon-fishing off beaches near Arbroath and Montrose in Angus . These cobles have a less refined construction than their southern counterparts . Ghillies employ a smaller , better-built version for fly fishing on Scottish rivers . Local boat-builders constructed the clinker-built cobles locally as required , without the use of plans . The craftsmanship on many boats gave them a long working life . They had a reputation as dangerous to sail for an inexperienced crew , but in the hands of experts could move both safely and speedily .",

It was created to combine the roles of existing bodies that had emerged from a long period of state involvement in heritage protection . In 1999 the organisation merged with the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England and the National Monuments Record , bringing together resources for the identification and survey of England 's historic environment . On 1 April 2015 , English Heritage was divided into two parts : Historic England , which inherited the statutory and protection functions of the old organisation , and the new English Heritage Trust , a charity that would operate the historic properties , and which took on the English Heritage operating name and logo .

  "/wiki/Victorian_era": "In the history of the United Kingdom , the Victorian era was the period of Queen Victoria 's reign , from 20 June 1837 until her death on 22 January 1901 . The era followed the Georgian period and preceded the Edwardian period , and its later half overlaps with the first part of the Belle \u00c9poque era of Continental Europe . In terms of moral sensibilities and political reforms , this period began with the passage of the Reform Act 1832 . There was a strong religious drive for higher moral standards led by the nonconformist churches , such as the Methodists , and the Evangelical wing of the established Church of England . Britain 's relations with the other Great Powers were driven by the colonial antagonism of the Great Game with Russia , climaxing during the Crimean War ; a Pax Britannica of international free trade was maintained by the country 's naval and industrial supremacy . Britain embarked on global imperial expansion , particularly in Asia and Africa , which made the British Empire the largest empire in history . National self-confidence peaked . Ideologically , the Victorian era witnessed resistance to the rationalism that defined the Georgian period and an increasing turn towards romanticism and even mysticism with regard to religion , social values , and arts . Domestically , the political agenda was increasingly liberal , with a number of shifts in the direction of gradual political reform , social reform , and the widening of the franchise . There were unprecedented demographic changes : the population of England and Wales almost doubled from 16.8 million in 1851 to 30.5 million in 1901 , and Scotland 's population also rose rapidly , from 2.8 million in 1851 to 4.4 million in 1901 . However , Ireland 's population decreased sharply , from 8.2 million in 1841 to less than 4.5 million in 1901 , mostly due to emigration and the Great Famine .

  "/wiki/Humber_Limited": "Humber Limited was a British manufacturer of bicycles , motorcycles and motor vehicles incorporated and listed on the stock exchange in 1887 . It took the name Humber & Co Limited because of the high reputation of the products of one of the constituent businesses that had belonged to Thomas Humber . A financial reconstruction in 1899 transferred its business to Humber Limited . From an interest in motor vehicles beginning in 1896 , the motor division became much more important than the cycle division and the cycle trade marks were sold to Raleigh in 1932 . The motorcycles were withdrawn from sale during the depression of the 1930s . Humber is now a dormant marque for automobiles as well as cycles . Following their involvement in Humber through Hillman in 1928 the Rootes brothers acquired 60 per cent of Humber 's ordinary capital , sufficient for a controlling interest . The two Rootes brothers joined the Humber board in 1932 and began to make Humber the holding company for vehicle manufacturing members of what became their Rootes Group . By 1960 annual production was around 200,000 vehicles . Previous insistence on Rootes family control , however , may have led to under-capitalisation of the business . Building a brand new car , the Hillman Imp , proved beyond Humber and Rootes Group resources and their businesses were bought by the Chrysler Corporation in 1967 ."
