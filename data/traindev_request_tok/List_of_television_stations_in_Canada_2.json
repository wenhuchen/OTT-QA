It is centred on the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers , near the longitudinal centre of North America . The city is named after the nearby Lake Winnipeg ; the name comes from the Western Cree words for muddy water . The region was a trading centre for Indigenous peoples long before the arrival of Europeans . French traders built the first fort on the site in 1738 . A settlement was later founded by the Selkirk settlers of the Red River Colony in 1812 , the nucleus of which was incorporated as the City of Winnipeg in 1873 . As at 2016 [ update ] , Winnipeg is the seventh-most populated municipality in Canada , with a resident population of about 778,500 . Being far inland , the local climate is extremely seasonal even by Canadian standards with average January lows of around \u221221 \u00b0C ( \u22126 \u00b0F ) and average July highs of 26 \u00b0C ( 79 \u00b0F ) .

Manitoba covers 649,950 square kilometres ( 250,900 sq mi ) with a widely varied landscape , stretching from the northern oceanic coastline to the southern border with the United States . The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south . Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived on two major river systems , what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system . A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson 's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert 's Land . During the next 200 years , communities continued to grow and evolve , with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg . The assertion of M\u00e9tis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba . There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the M\u00e9tis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion . The resolution of the assertion of the right to representation led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 that created the province . Manitoba 's capital and largest city , Winnipeg , is the eighth-largest census metropolitan area in Canada .",
