  "/wiki/Norman_Bates": "Norman Bates is a fictional character created by American author Robert Bloch as the main antagonist in his 1959 thriller novel Psycho . He was portrayed by Anthony Perkins in the 1960 version of Psycho directed by Alfred Hitchcock and the Psycho franchise . He was also portrayed by Vince Vaughn in the 1998 version of Psycho , and by Freddie Highmore in the television series Bates Motel ( 2013-2017 ) . Unlike the franchise produced by Universal Studios , Norman is not the principal antagonist in Bloch 's subsequent novels and is succeeded by copycat killers who assume Norman 's identity after his death in Psycho II ( 1982 ) . Despite wide-ranging assumptions , the character was not inspired by Wisconsin murderer Ed Gein . Bloch later revealed that he was nearly finished writing Psycho when he first became aware of Gein , and was struck by how closely the imaginary character I 'd created resembled the real Ed Gein both in overt act and apparent motivation .",

  "/wiki/Ishmael_(Moby-Dick)": "Ishmael is a fictional character in Herman Melville 's Moby-Dick ( 1851 ) . Ishmael , the only surviving crewmember of the Pequod , is the narrator of the book . His importance relies on his role as narrator ; as a character , he is only a minor participant in the action and the main protagonist is Captain Ahab . The Biblical name has come to symbolize orphans , exiles , and social outcasts . Because he was the first person narrator , most of the criticism of Moby-Dick either confused Ishmael with the author himself or overlooked him . From the mid-twentieth century onward , critics distinguished Ishmael from Melville , establishing the character 's mystic and speculative consciousness as a central force in contrast to Captain Ahab 's monomaniacal force of will . By contrast with his namesake Ishmael from Genesis , who is banished into the desert , Ishmael is wandering upon the sea . Each Ishmael , however , experiences a miraculous rescue ; in the Bible from thirst , here from drowning .",
