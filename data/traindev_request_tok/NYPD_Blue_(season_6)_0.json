  "/wiki/Bobby_Simone": "Robert Bobby Simone is a fictional character in the television series NYPD Blue . Played by Jimmy Smits he was introduced in the fifth episode of the second season remaining until the fifth episode of the sixth . Simone was introduced to the squad after Andy Sipowicz 's former partner , John Kelly , was forced to leave the NYPD in the face of an IAB witch hunt . His previous job had been as a driver for the police commissioner , a role that initially riled Sipowicz . However , Simone explained that he had asked for the job so he could spend more time with his wife as she was dying from cancer . An early bond and friendship between them was strong enough that Andy asked Simone to step in after John Kelly could n't make it back to New York for Sipowicz 's wedding to Sylvia Costas . Bobby and Andy became great friends and partners , although Bobby did not let Andy get away with making racist comments around him . It is later learned that Bobby was a quiet kid whose passion for raising racing pigeons came from his friendship with a retired boxer ( who later showed early signs of Alzheimer 's ) , and that he had a flashy older friend named Ray DiSalvo whom he idolized - which came back to haunt him when Ray became a petty criminal and tried unsuccessfully to sell Bobby out to IAB for giving him an implicit warning to avoid a drug bust . In the episode Prostrate Before The Law , season five episode 19 , Simone is dealing with a suspect who assumes he is Puerto Rican . Simone retorts that he is of French and Portuguese descent and that his parents met in Belize . Early on in his time in the squad Simone started a relationship with Diane Russell , another detective at the 15th Precinct . According to NYPD guidelines the police department did not allow such couplings for officers who worked in the same precinct , so the couple kept it quiet up until the point that they were married by a justice of the peace ( Lt Arthur Fancy also knew they were dating , but never officially notified the higher-ups about it ) .",
