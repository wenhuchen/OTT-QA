Known for its strength in natural science and engineering , Caltech is often ranked as one of the world 's top-ten universities . Although founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G. Throop in 1891 , the college attracted influential scientists such as George Ellery Hale , Arthur Amos Noyes and Robert Andrews Millikan in the early 20th century . The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910 and the college assumed its present name in 1920 . In 1934 , Caltech was elected to the Association of American Universities , and the antecedents of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , which Caltech continues to manage and operate , were established between 1936 and 1943 under Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n . The university is one among a small group of institutes of technology in the United States which is primarily devoted to the instruction of pure and applied sciences . Caltech has six academic divisions with strong emphasis on science and engineering , managing $ 332 million in 2011 in sponsored research . Its 124-acre ( 50 ha ) primary campus is located approximately 11 mi ( 18 km ) northeast of downtown Los Angeles . First-year students are required to live on campus and 95% of undergraduates remain in the on-campus House System at Caltech . Although Caltech has a strong tradition of practical jokes and pranks , student life is governed by an honor code which allows faculty to assign take-home examinations . The Caltech Beavers compete in 13 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA Division III 's Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference . As of November 2019 [ update ] , Caltech alumni , faculty and researchers include 74 Nobel Laureates ( chemist Linus Pauling being the only individual in history to win two unshared prizes ) , 4 Fields Medalists , and 6 Turing Award winners .",

These ideals , unconventional for the time , are captured in Cornell 's founding principle , a popular 1868 Ezra Cornell quotation : I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study . The university is broadly organized into seven undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions at its main Ithaca campus , with each college and division defining its own admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy . The university also administers two satellite medical campuses , one in New York City and one in Education City , Qatar , and Cornell Tech , a graduate program that incorporates technology , business , and creative thinking . The program moved from Google 's Chelsea Building in New York City to its permanent campus on Roosevelt Island in September 2017 . Cornell is one of ten private land grant universities in the United States and the only one in New York . [ note 1 ] Of its seven undergraduate colleges , three are state-supported statutory or contract colleges through the State University of New York ( SUNY ) system , including its agricultural and human ecology colleges as well as its industrial labor relations school . Of Cornell 's graduate schools , only the veterinary college is state-supported . As a land grant college , Cornell operates a cooperative extension outreach program in every county of New York and receives annual funding from the State of New York for certain educational missions . The Cornell University Ithaca Campus comprises 745 acres , but is much larger when the Cornell Botanic Gardens ( more than 4,300 acres ) and the numerous university-owned lands in New York City are considered .

The Abel Prize 's history dates back to 1899 , when its establishment was proposed by the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie when he learned that Alfred Nobel 's plans for annual prizes would not include a prize in mathematics . In 1902 , King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway indicated his willingness to finance a mathematics prize to complement the Nobel Prizes , but the establishment of the prize was prevented by the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905 . It took almost a century before the prize was finally established by the Government of Norway in 2001 , and it was specifically intended to give the mathematicians their own equivalent of a Nobel Prize . The laureates are selected by the Abel Committee , the members of which are appointed by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters .

Altman used to teach Bankruptcy and Reorganization and Credit Risk Management in the Risk Management Open Enrollment program for Stern Executive Education , as well as on the TRIUM Global Executive MBA Program , an alliance of NYU Stern , the London School of Economics and HEC School of Management , and for both the Master of Science in Global Finance ( MSGF ) and Master of Science in Risk Management Program for Executives ( MSRM ) . MSGF is jointly offered by NYU Stern and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology . He also teaches in the school 's MBA programs and has been a Stern faculty member since 1967 . The Altman Z-score is a multivariate formula for a measurement of the financial health of a company and a powerful diagnostic tool that forecasts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy . Studies measuring the effectiveness of the Z-Score have shown that the model has an 80-90% reliability . Altman 's equation did an excellent job at distinguishing bankrupt and non-bankrupt firms and is used by a large number of investment managers and hedge funds in their investment strategies and management . In addition , his Z-score model has been used by management of distressed companies to avoid having to file for bankruptcy reorganization .
