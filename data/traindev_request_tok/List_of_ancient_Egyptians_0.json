The letters were found in Upper Egypt at el-Amarna , the modern name for the ancient Egyptian capital of Akhetaten , founded by pharaoh Akhenaten ( 1350s-1330s BC ) during the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt . The Amarna letters are unusual in Egyptological research , because they are mostly written in a script known as Akkadian cuneiform , the writing system of ancient Mesopotamia , rather than that of ancient Egypt , and the language used has sometimes been characterised as a mixed language , Canaanite-Akkadian . The written correspondence spans a period of at most thirty years . [ citation needed ] The known tablets total 382 , of which 358 have been published by the Norwegian Assyriologist J\u00f8rgen Alexander Knudtzon 's in his work , Die El-Amarna-Tafeln , which came out in two volumes ( 1907 and 1915 ) and remains the standard edition to this day . The texts of the remaining 24 complete or fragmentary tablets excavated since Knudtzon have also been made available . The Amarna letters are of great significance for biblical studies as well as Semitic linguistics , since they shed light on the culture and language of the Canaanite peoples in pre-biblical times . The letters , though written in Akkadian , are heavily colored by the mother tongue of their writers , who spoke an early form of Canaanite , the language family which would later evolve into its daughter languages , Hebrew and Phoenician .

He is noted for abandoning traditional Egyptian polytheism and introducing worship centered on the Aten ( notably instead of Amun , the temples of which he destroyed , the name of whom he rubbed off and the priests of whom he left without resources ) , which is sometimes described as monolatristic , henotheistic , or even quasi-monotheistic . An early inscription likens the Aten to the sun as compared to stars , and later official language avoids calling the Aten a god , giving the solar deity a status above mere gods . Akhenaten tried to shift his culture from Egypt 's traditional religion , but the shifts were not widely accepted . After his death , his monuments were dismantled and hidden , his statues were destroyed , and his name excluded from the king lists . Traditional religious practice was gradually restored , and when some dozen years later rulers without clear rights of succession from the 18th Dynasty founded a new dynasty , they discredited Akhenaten and his immediate successors , referring to Akhenaten himself as the enemy or that criminal in archival records . The stele of Merneptah values Amun who is represented giving the cemetery of victory to him , and is written on the back of a stele of Akhenaten stolen from one of his temples in Karnak . He was all but lost from history until the discovery during the 19th century of the site of Akhetaten , the city he built and designed for the worship of Aten , at Amarna . Early excavations at Amarna by Flinders Petrie sparked interest in the enigmatic pharaoh , and a mummy found in the tomb KV55 , which was unearthed in 1907 in a dig led by Edward R. Ayrton , is likely that of Akhenaten . DNA analysis has determined that the man buried in KV55 is the father of King Tutankhamun , but its identification as Akhenaten has been questioned . Modern interest in Akhenaten and his queen Nefertiti comes partly from his connection with Tutankhamun ( even though Tutankhamun 's mother was not Nefertiti , but a woman named by archaeologists The Younger Lady ) , partly from the unique style and high quality of the pictorial arts he patronized , and partly from ongoing interest in the religion he attempted to establish .",

Despite Ptolemy IV marrying his sister Arsinoe III in 220 BC , Agathoclea continued to be his favourite . In late c. 210 BC , Agathoclea may have given birth to a son from her affair with Ptolemy IV , who may have died shortly after his birth . On the death of Ptolemy IV in 205 , Agathoclea and her friends kept the event secret , that they might have an opportunity of plundering the royal treasury .

His reign is generally dated from 1526 to 1506 BC . He was a son of Ahmose I and Ahmose-Nefertari , but had at least two elder brothers , Ahmose-ankh and Ahmose Sapair , and was not expected to inherit the throne . However , sometime in the eight years between Ahmose I 's 17th regnal year and his death , his heir apparent died and Amenhotep became crown prince . He then acceded to the throne and ruled for about 21 years . Although his reign is poorly documented , it is possible to piece together a basic history from available evidence . He inherited the kingdom formed by his father 's military conquests and maintained dominance over Nubia and the Nile Delta but probably did not attempt to maintain Egyptian power in the Levant . He continued the rebuilding of temples in Upper Egypt and revolutionized mortuary complex design by separating his tomb from his mortuary temple , setting a trend in royal funerary monuments which would persist throughout the New Kingdom . After his death , he was deified as a patron god of Deir el-Medina .",
