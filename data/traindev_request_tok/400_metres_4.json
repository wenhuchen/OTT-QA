  "/wiki/Canberra": "Canberra ( /\u02c8k\u00e6nb\u0259r\u0259/ ( listen ) ) is the capital city of Australia . Founded following the federation of the colonies of Australia as the seat of government for the new nation , it is Australia 's largest inland city and the eighth-largest city overall . The city is located at the northern end of the Australian Capital Territory ; 280 km ( 170 mi ) south-west of Sydney and 660 km ( 410 mi ) north-east of Melbourne . On 1 January 1901 , federation of the colonies of Australia was achieved . Section 125 of the new Australian Constitution provided that land , situated in New South Wales and at least 100 miles ( 160 km ) from Sydney , would be ceded to the new federal government . Following discussion and exploration of various areas within New South Wales , the Seat of Government Act 1908 was passed in 1908 which specified a capital in the Yass-Canberra region . The land was transferred to the Commonwealth by New South Wales in 1911 , creating the Australian Capital Territory , two years prior to the capital city being founded and formally named as Canberra in 1913 . It is unusual among Australian cities , being an entirely planned city outside of any state , similar to Washington , D.C. in the United States or Bras\u00edlia in Brazil . Following an international contest for the city 's design , a blueprint by American architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin was selected and construction commenced in 1913 . The Griffins ' plan featured geometric motifs such as circles , hexagons and triangles , and was centred on axes aligned with significant topographical landmarks in the Australian Capital Territory . The city 's design was influenced by the garden city movement and incorporates significant areas of natural vegetation . As the seat of the government of Australia , Canberra is home to many important institutions of the federal government , national monuments and museums ."
