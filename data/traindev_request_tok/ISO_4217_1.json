The yuan ( Chinese : \u5143 ; pinyin : yu\u00e1n ) is the basic unit of the renminbi , but is also used to refer to the Chinese currency generally , especially in international contexts where Chinese yuan is widely used to refer to the renminbi . The distinction between renminbi and yuan is that renminbi is the name of the currency and yuan refers to its primary unit . One yuan is subdivided into 10 jiao ( Chinese : \u89d2 ; pinyin : ji\u01ceo ) , and a jiao in turn is subdivided into 10 fen ( Chinese : \u5206 ; pinyin : f\u0113n ) . The renminbi is issued by the People 's Bank of China , the monetary authority of China . The renminbi is sometimes referred to as the redback in the US financial press . Until 2005 , the value of the renminbi was pegged to the US dollar . As China pursued its transition from central planning to a market economy and increased its participation in foreign trade , the renminbi was devalued to increase the competitiveness of Chinese industry . It has previously been claimed that the renminbi 's official exchange rate was undervalued by as much as 37.5% against its purchasing power parity . However more recently , appreciation actions by the Chinese government , as well as quantitative easing measures taken by the American Federal Reserve and other major central banks , have caused the renminbi to be within as little as 8% of its equilibrium value by the second half of 2012 . Since 2006 , the renminbi exchange rate has been allowed to float in a narrow margin around a fixed base rate determined with reference to a basket of world currencies .

With over 7.4 million people of various nationalities [ d ] in a 1,104-square-kilometre ( 426 sq mi ) territory , Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated places in the world . Hong Kong became a colony of the British Empire after Qing Empire ceded Hong Kong Island at the end of the First Opium War in 1842 . The colony expanded to the Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 after the Second Opium War , and was further extended when Britain obtained a 99-year lease of the New Territories in 1898 . The territory was returned to China in 1997 . As a special administrative region , Hong Kong maintains separate governing and economic systems from that of mainland China under the principle of one country , two systems . Originally a sparsely populated area of farming and fishing villages , the territory has become one of the world 's most significant financial centres and commercial ports . It is the world 's tenth-largest exporter and ninth-largest importer . As one of the world 's leading international financial centres , Hong Kong has a major capitalist service economy characterised by low taxation and free trade , and the currency , Hong Kong dollar , is the eighth most traded currency in the world . Hong Kong hosts the largest concentration of ultra high-net-worth individuals of any city in the world . Although the city has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world , there is severe income inequality among its residents .

The origins of the people of Tuvalu are addressed in the theories regarding migration into the Pacific that began about three thousand years ago . During pre-European-contact times there was frequent canoe voyaging between the islands as Polynesian navigation skills are recognised to have allowed deliberate journeys on double-hull sailing canoes or outrigger canoes . The pattern of settlement that is believed to have occurred is that the Polynesians spread out from Samoa and Tonga into the Tuvaluan atolls , with Tuvalu providing a stepping stone to further migration into the Polynesian outliers in Melanesia and Micronesia . In 1568 , Spanish navigator \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a was the first European to sail through the archipelago , sighting the island of Nui during his expedition in search of Terra Australis . The island of Funafuti was named Ellice 's Island in 1819 ; the name Ellice was applied to all of the nine islands after the work of English hydrographer Alexander George Findlay . The Ellice Islands came into Great Britain 's sphere of influence in the late 19th century , as the result of a treaty between Great Britain and Germany relating to the demarcation of the spheres of influence in the Pacific Ocean .",
  "/wiki/Zimbabwean_bonds": "Zimbabwean Bonds are a form of legal tender near money released by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe which attempts to resolve Zimbabwe 's lack of currency . Bonds are pegged against the U.S. dollar at a 1:1 fixed exchange rate and backed by the country 's reserve . Since abandoning the Zimbabwean dollar in 2009 after it went into hyperinflation the country began using a number of foreign currencies including the U.S. dollar , South African rand , British pound and Chinese yuan as a means of exchange . The inability to print these currencies led to a shortage of money with banks issuing limits on withdrawals .",
  "/wiki/Zimbabwe": "Zimbabwe ( /z\u026am\u02c8b\u0251\u02d0bwe\u026a , -wi/ ) , officially the Republic of Zimbabwe , formerly Rhodesia , is a landlocked country located in Southern Africa , between the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers , bordered by South Africa , Botswana , Zambia and Mozambique . The capital and largest city is Harare . The second largest is Bulawayo . A country of roughly 14 million people , Zimbabwe has 16 official languages , with English , Shona , and Ndebele the most common . Since the 11th century , present-day Zimbabwe has been the site of several organised states and kingdoms as well as a major route for migration and trade . The British South Africa Company of Cecil Rhodes first demarcated the present territory during the 1890s ; it became the self-governing British colony of Southern Rhodesia in 1923 . In 1965 , the conservative white minority government unilaterally declared independence as Rhodesia . The state endured international isolation and a 15-year guerrilla war with black nationalist forces ; this culminated in a peace agreement that established universal enfranchisement and de jure sovereignty as Zimbabwe in April 1980 . Zimbabwe then joined the Commonwealth of Nations , from which it was suspended in 2002 for breaches of international law by its then-government , and from which it withdrew in December 2003 . The sovereign state is a member of the United Nations , the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , the African Union ( AU ) , and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa ( COMESA ) . It was once known as the Jewel of Africa for its great prosperity . Robert Mugabe became Prime Minister of Zimbabwe in 1980 , when his ZANU-PF party won the elections following the end of white minority rule ; he was the President of Zimbabwe from 1987 until his resignation in 2017 .",
  "/wiki/RTGS_Dollar": "The RTGS dollar or RTG ( Zimdollar or zollar ) was the only official currency in Zimbabwe from June to November 2019 . It was introduced on 21 February 2019 as part of the February 2019 Monetary Policy that was enacted by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe , John Mangudya . The currency was made up of bond coins , bond notes and RTGS balances . The original bond notes were introduced as part of Zimbabwe 's multi currency system in 2009 . They were renamed RTGS dollars in 2019 , and in June 2019 became the only legal currency in Zimbabwe , replacing the multi-currency system . On 29 October 2019 , when inflation on the RTGS dollar had reached over 300% , the central bank announced a new currency to be introduced in mid November 2019 . The new currency initially traded alongside the RTGS dollar , and was similarly valued . It did not have the same backing as the RTGS dollar ."
