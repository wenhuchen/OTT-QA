  "/wiki/Fitzroy_Football_Club": "The Fitzroy Football Club , nicknamed the Lions or the Roys , is an Australian rules football club formed in 1883 to represent the inner-Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy , Victoria and was a foundation member club of the Victorian Football League ( now the Australian Football League ) on its inception in 1897 . Despite being the first club to win a VFL Grand Final they were not the first team to win a premiership . That honour belongs to the Essendon Football Club who were crowned premiers in 1897 without a Grand Final being played . Although Fitzroy won a total of eight VFL premierships they never won a premiership as the Lions . They won seven premierships ( 1898 , 1899 , 1904 , 1905 , 1913 , 1916 and 1922 ) as the Maroons and one ( 1944 ) as the Gorillas . The decision of the club to change its name to the Lions in 1957 coincided with what history now records as the beginning of decades of poor on-field performance and financial mismanagement that eventually resulted in the club being placed into administration and forced out of the AFL in 1996 . Although the club managed to survive and came out of administration in 1998 it never played in the AFL again . Fitzroy largely resumed its original VFL-AFL identity through its continued use of their 1975-1996 VFL-AFL jumper , their theme song and their 1884-1966 home ground at the Brunswick Street Oval . For a brief time it experimented in partnerships with other semi professional and amateur clubs before incorporating the Fitzroy Reds ( formerly University Reds ) to play in the Victorian Amateur Football Association . They began in the D1 section of the VAFA in 2009 and now , after having been promoted three times ( 2009 , 2012 , 2018 ) play in the Premier B Division . It is also notable for being one of only three clubs ( along with University and Hawthorn ) to have played in the VFA , VFL/AFL and VAFA competitions of Australian rules football .",
