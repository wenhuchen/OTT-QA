  "/wiki/1969_Mid_Ulster_by-election": "The Mid Ulster by-election was held on 17 April 1969 following the death of George Forrest , the Ulster Unionist Party Member of Parliament for Mid Ulster . The two-way contest was unusual in featuring two female candidates . Forrest had held the seat since 1956 , initially winning it as an Independent Unionist , but joining the Ulster Unionist Party ( UUP ) immediately on his election . The seat had been created six years earlier , and during that period had been held by two Nationalist Party members , one Sinn F\u00e9in member , and an Ulster Unionist . At the 1966 general election , Forrest had achieved only a slim majority over former Sinn F\u00e9in MP Tom Mitchell , standing as an Independent Republican . It was clear that the balance between nationalist and unionist voters in the constituency was very close . Since 1966 , the political situation in Northern Ireland had changed . The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association had been formed to campaign for civil rights for nationalists . After its marches were disrupted , leading to the start of The Troubles , more radical groups such as People 's Democracy organised . Among its leaders was radical student Bernadette Devlin , who stood against prominent unionist James Chichester-Clark for the South Londonderry seat at the 1969 Northern Ireland general election in February . Two prominent members of NICRA , Dr Conn McCluskey and his wife Patricia McCluskey , organised a Unity Convention in order to select a single anti-Unionist candidate . After six public meetings between the candidates there were three contenders : Kevin Agnew , a Maghera-based solicitor and member of Sinn F\u00e9in , Austin Currie of the Nationalist Party , and Bernadette Devlin of People 's Democracy .",
  "/wiki/1955_Mid_Ulster_by-election": "The by-election held in Mid Ulster on 11 August 1955 was called as a result of a vote in the British parliament on 18 July 1955 which voted 197 votes to 63 to nullify the result of the previous 1955 UK General Election in the constituency . At that election , Sinn F\u00e9in candidate Tom Mitchell took the seat . In the by-election , Mitchell managed to retain the seat with an increase in the number of votes . In the aftermath of the election , the defeated Unionist candidate successfully lodged a petition to have Mitchell , a convicted felon , removed as Member of Parliament ( MP ) . The seat was subsequently given to Charles Beattie . However , as Beattie was at the time of his appointment a member of an appeals tribunal , considered offices of profit under the Crown , the British House of Commons ruled that this disqualified him from the office of MP . This led to the 1956 Mid Ulster by-election .",
  "/wiki/1928_Ashton-under-Lyne_by-election": "The Ashton-under-Lyne by-election was held on 29 October 1928 . It was notable for having the highest turnout of any Parliamentary by-election in Great Britain . The election was caused by the bankruptcy of Conservative Party Member of Parliament for Ashton-under-Lyne Cornelius Homan . Although Homan had only represented the constituency since the 1924 general election , Ashton had been represented by Conservatives for many years , and Labour had never taken the seat . However , the Conservatives had never achieved a large majority in the seat , and as both Labour and the Liberal Party had gained several seats in recent by-elections , it was thought that both would mount a strong challenge . As a result , interest in the by-election was high . Labour stood Albert Bellamy , while the Conservatives stood Gordon Touche , and the Liberals put up William Gilbert Greenwood , an accountant .",

It was seen by many as a rerun of the earlier contest in April . The by-election was caused by the death of the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands .",
  "/wiki/1956_Mid_Ulster_by-election": "The by-election held in Mid Ulster on 8 May 1956 was called because both candidates in the 1955 Mid Ulster by-election were disqualified . Tom Mitchell was disqualified from assuming office because he was a convicted felon . Charles Beattie was awarded the seat but he was also disqualified because he held an office of profit under the Crown .",

  "/wiki/1957_Carmarthen_by-election": "The Carmarthen by-election of 1957 in Carmarthenshire , Wales , was notable for resulting in the nadir of the British Liberal Party and for being the first election in the United Kingdom in which two women competed for the same seat . The seat became vacant as a result of the death of Sir Rhys Hopkin Morris on 22 November 1956 . The Liberal Party was in a period of decline and Hopkin Morris had been one of only six Liberal Members of Parliament . Hopkin Morris 's majorities had been narrow and it was recognised that a significant number of voters had favoured him personally and might not transfer their allegiance to a new Liberal candidate . Further distress for the Liberals was caused by the announcement that Lady Megan Lloyd George , a former Liberal MP with a national reputation , would be running as the Labour candidate . Previously selected prospective candidate for Labour , Brynley Thomas , stood down in her favour . The local Liberals created another dilemma by choosing John Morgan Davies as their candidate ; the Liberals were seeking to challenge the ruling Conservatives over the ongoing Suez Crisis and Morgan Davies , like Hopkin Morris , had publicly taken a pro-government stand on the issue . Jo Grimond , who had assumed leadership of the Liberal Party only a few weeks before , had to choose whether to support or disown Morgan Davies . He chose to support him . The other candidate who ran for the seat was Jennie Eirian Davies of Plaid Cymru . The Conservatives did not run a candidate . This was the second to last by-election in Great Britain , during the 20th Century , in which they did not stand , the last being the unusual circumstances of the 1963 Bristol South East by-election .",
  "/wiki/April_1981_Fermanagh_and_South_Tyrone_by-election": "The by-election held in Fermanagh and South Tyrone on 9 April 1981 is considered by many to be the most significant by-election held in Northern Ireland during the Troubles . It saw the first electoral victory for militant Irish republicanism , which the following year entered electoral politics in full force as Sinn F\u00e9in . The successful candidate was the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands , who died twenty-six days later . The by-election was caused by the death of the sitting MP , Frank Maguire .",

  "/wiki/1950_Brighouse_and_Spenborough_by-election": "The Brighouse and Spenborough by-election , 1950 was a parliamentary by-election held in the United Kingdom on 4 May 1950 for the House of Commons in the marginal constituency of Brighouse and Spenborough . The seat became vacant on the death of Frederick Arthur Cobb , who has been the local Member of Parliament ( MP ) for only 3 months , since the general election in February 1950 . He had previously been the MP for Elland from 1945 . The result was a narrow hold for the Labour Party . The winning candidate was Lewis John Edwards , former Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade , who had lost his seat in the general election . He went on to hold Brighouse and Spenborough until his death in 1959 , when the resulting by-election in 1960 was narrowly won by the Conservative and National Liberal candidate Michael Shaw ."
