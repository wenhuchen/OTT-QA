  "/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)": "The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States , along with its main rival , the Republican Party . Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison 's Democratic-Republican Party , the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson , making it the world 's oldest active political party . In its early years , the Party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s , the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform . Well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings ; following the New Deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South . The New Deal Coalition of 1932-1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction - many of whom were Catholics based in the cities . After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the core bases of the two parties shifted , with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic . The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s . White evangelicals and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local levels since the 1990s . People living in urban areas , women , college graduates , sexual and gender minorities , millennials , and black , Latino , Jewish , Muslim and Asian Americans tend to support the Democratic Party . The Democratic Party 's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality , along with the welfare state . It seeks to provide government regulation in the economy .",

  "/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)": "The Whig Party was a political party active in the middle of the 19th century in the United States of America . Alongside the Democratic Party , it was one of the two major parties in the United States during the late 1830s , the 1840s , and the early 1850s , part of the Second Party System . Four U.S. presidents were affiliated with the Whig party for at least part of their respective terms . Other influential party leaders include Henry Clay , Daniel Webster , William Seward , John J. Crittenden , and Truman Smith . The Whigs emerged in the 1830s in opposition to President Andrew Jackson , pulling together former members of the National Republican Party , the Anti-Masonic Party , and disaffected Democrats . The Whigs had some links to the defunct Federalist Party , but the Whig Party was not a direct successor to that party and many Whig leaders , including Clay , had aligned with the rival Democratic-Republican Party . In the 1836 presidential election , four different Whig candidates received electoral votes , but the party failed to defeat Jackson 's chosen successor , Martin Van Buren . Whig nominee William Henry Harrison unseated Van Buren in the 1840 presidential election , but died just one month into his term . Harrison 's successor , John Tyler , was expelled from the party in 1841 after clashing with Clay and other Whig Party leaders over economic policies such as the re-establishment of a national bank . Clay won his party 's nomination in the 1844 presidential election but was defeated by Democrat James K. Polk , who subsequently presided over the Mexican-American War . Whig nominee Zachary Taylor won the 1848 presidential election , but Taylor died in 1850 and was succeeded by Millard Fillmore . Fillmore , Clay , Daniel Webster , and Democrat Stephen A. Douglas led the passage of the Compromise of 1850 , which helped to defuse sectional tensions in the aftermath of the Mexican-American War .",

A longtime anti-slavery activist , after leaving the Jacksonians in the 1830s , Brainerd was active in the Whig , Liberty , and Free Soil parties , and was one of the organizers of the Republican Party when it was formed as the main anti-slavery party in the mid-1850s . Brainerd 's longtime commitment to the cause of abolition was recognized in 1854 , when opponents of slavery in the Vermont General Assembly chose him to fill a five-month vacancy in the United States Senate . A native of East Hartford , Connecticut , Brainerd was raised by an uncle from the age of nine , and grew up in Troy , New York and St. Albans , Vermont . He taught school and worked as a store clerk , then began a business career of his own while still a teenager .

  "/wiki/Free_Soil_Party_(United_States)": "The Free Soil Party was a short-lived political party in the United States active from 1848 to 1854 , when it merged into the Republican Party . The party was largely focused on the single issue of opposing the expansion of slavery into the western territories of the United States . The Free Soil Party formed during the 1848 presidential election , which took place in the aftermath of the Mexican-American War and debates over the extension of slavery into the Mexican Cession . After the Whig Party and the Democratic Party nominated presidential candidates who were unwilling to rule out the extension of slavery into the Mexican Cession , anti-slavery Democrats and Whigs joined with members of the abolitionist Liberty Party to form the new Free Soil Party . Running as the Free Soil presidential candidate , former President Martin Van Buren won 10.1 percent of the popular vote , the strongest popular vote performance by a third party up to that point in U.S. history . Though Van Buren and many other Free Soil supporters rejoined the Democrats or the Whigs immediately after the 1848 election , Free Soilers retained a presence in Congress over the next six years . Led by individuals like Salmon P. Chase of Ohio , John P. Hale of New Hampshire , and Charles Sumner of Massachusetts , the Free Soilers strongly opposed the Compromise of 1850 , which temporarily settled the issue of slavery in the Mexican Cession . Hale ran as the party 's presidential candidate in the 1852 presidential election , taking just under five percent of the vote . The 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act repealed the long-standing Missouri Compromise and outraged many Northerners , contributing to the collapse of the Whigs and spurring the creation of a new , broad-based anti-slavery party known as the Republican Party . Most Free Soilers joined the Republican Party , which emerged as the dominant political party in the United States in the subsequent Third Party System ( 1856-1894 ) .",
