He has maintained worldwide renown as a leading musician of his era , one whose poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation . Chopin was born Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin in the Duchy of Warsaw and grew up in Warsaw , which in 1815 became part of Congress Poland . A child prodigy , he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20 , less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising . At 21 , he settled in Paris . Thereafter - in the last 18 years of his life - he gave only 30 public performances , preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon . He supported himself by selling his compositions and by giving piano lessons , for which he was in high demand . Chopin formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his other musical contemporaries ( including Robert Schumann ) . After a failed engagement to Maria Wodzi\u0144ska from 1836 to 1837 , he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer Amantine Dupin ( known by her pen name , George Sand ) . A brief and unhappy visit to Majorca with Sand in 1838-39 would prove one of his most productive periods of composition . In his final years , he was supported financially by his admirer Jane Stirling , who also arranged for him to visit Scotland in 1848 . For most of his life , Chopin was in poor health .",
  "/wiki/Ballades_(Chopin)": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin 's four ballades are single-movement pieces for solo piano , composed between 1831 and 1842 . They are considered to be some of the most challenging pieces in the standard piano repertoire . The term ballade was used by Chopin in the sense of a balletic interlude or dance-piece , equivalent to the old Italian ballata , but the term may also have connotations of the medieval heroic ballad , a narrative minstrel-song , often of a fantastical character . There are dramatic and dance-like elements in Chopin 's use of the genre , and he may be said to be a pioneer of the ballade as an abstract musical form . The four ballades are said to have been inspired by poet Adam Mickiewicz . The exact inspiration for each individual ballade , however , is unclear and disputed . Though the ballades do not conform exactly to sonata form , the ballade form created by Chopin for his four ballades is a distinct variant of sonata form with specific discrepancies , such as the mirror reprise ( presenting the two expositional themes in reverse order during the recapitulation ) . [ citation needed ] The ballades have directly influenced composers such as Franz Liszt and Johannes Brahms who , after Chopin , wrote ballades of their own . Besides sharing the title , the four ballades are entities distinct from each other . According to composer and music critic Louis Ehlert , Each [ ballade ] differs entirely from the others , and they have but one thing in common - their romantic working out and the nobility of their motifs . Modern theorists have shown , however , that the ballades do have much in common , such as the ballade meter ( 64 or 68 ) and certain formal practices like the mirror reprise and delaying the structural dominant . The four ballades are among the most enduring of Chopin 's compositions and are frequently performed in concerts .",

The author of the tune is unknown , and it may originate in plainchant ; but an attribution to the composer John Bull is sometimes made . God Save the Queen is the national anthem of the United Kingdom and one of two national anthems used by New Zealand since 1977 , as well as for several of the UK 's territories that have their own additional local anthem . It is also the royal anthem - played specifically in the presence of the monarch - of all the aforementioned countries , as well as Australia ( since 1984 ) , Canada ( since 1980 ) , Barbados and Tuvalu . In countries not previously part of the British Empire , the tune of God Save the Queen has provided the basis for various patriotic songs , though still generally connected with royal ceremony .

Veyret , written and published in 1846 . It opens with Allegro maestoso , 34 time . This work was slow to gain favor with musicians , due to its harmonic complexity and intricate form . Arthur Hedley was one of the first critics to speak positively of the work , writing in 1947 that it 'works on the hearer 's imagination with a power of suggestion equaled only by the F minor Fantasy or the fourth Ballade ' , although Arthur Rubinstein , Leff Pouishnoff , Claudio Arrau and Vladimir Horowitz had been including it in their programs some decades earlier . It is intimately indebted to the polonaise for its metre , much of its rhythm , and some of its melodic character , but the fantaisie is the operative formal paradigm [ clarification needed ] ( Samson , 1988 ) , and Chopin is said to have referred initially to the piece only as a Fantasy . Parallels with the Fantaisie in F minor include the work 's overall tonality , A-flat , the key of its slower middle section , B major , and the motive of the descending fourth .",

His teacher , Friedrich Wieck , a German pianist , had assured him that he could become the finest pianist in Europe , but a hand injury ended this dream . Schumann then focused his musical energies on composing . In 1840 , after a long and acrimonious legal battle with Wieck , who opposed the marriage , Schumann married Wieck 's daughter Clara . A lifelong partnership in music began , as Clara herself was an established pianist and music prodigy . Clara and Robert also maintained a close relationship with German composer Johannes Brahms . Until 1840 , Schumann wrote exclusively for the piano . Later , he composed piano and orchestral works , and many Lieder ( songs for voice and piano ) . He composed four symphonies , one opera , and other orchestral , choral , and chamber works .

Scriabin , who was influenced early in his life by the works of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin , composed works that are characterised by a highly tonal idiom ( these works are associated with his first stage of compositional output ) . Later in his career , independently of Arnold Schoenberg , Scriabin developed a substantially atonal and much more dissonant musical system , which accorded with his personal brand of mysticism . [ citation needed ] Scriabin was influenced by synesthesia , and associated colours with the various harmonic tones of his atonal scale , while his colour-coded circle of fifths was also influenced by theosophy . He is considered by some to be the main Russian Symbolist composer . Scriabin was one of the most innovative and most controversial of early modern composers . The Great Soviet Encyclopedia said of Scriabin that no composer has had more scorn heaped on him or greater love bestowed . Leo Tolstoy described Scriabin 's music as a sincere expression of genius . Scriabin had a major impact on the music world over time , and influenced composers such as Igor Stravinsky , Sergei Prokofiev , and Karol Szymanowski .

Since the 19th-century Bach Revival he has generally been regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time . The Bach family already counted several composers when Johann Sebastian was born as the last child of a city musician in Eisenach . After being orphaned at age 10 , he lived for five years with his eldest brother Johann Christoph , after which he continued his musical formation in L\u00fcneburg . From 1703 he was back in Thuringia , working as a musician for Protestant churches in Arnstadt and M\u00fchlhausen and , for longer stretches of time , at courts in Weimar , where he expanded his organ repertory , and K\u00f6then , where he was mostly engaged with chamber music . From 1723 he was employed as Thomaskantor ( cantor at St. Thomas ) in Leipzig . He composed music for the principal Lutheran churches of the city , and for its university 's student ensemble Collegium Musicum . From 1726 he published some of his keyboard and organ music . In Leipzig , as had happened during some of his earlier positions , he had difficult relations with his employer , a situation that was little remedied when he was granted the title of court composer by his sovereign , Augustus , Elector of Saxony and King of Poland , in 1736 .

After brief periods teaching in Helsinki , Boston , and Moscow , he devoted himself to composing , teaching , and touring as a virtuoso pianist in Europe and the United States . His writings on music were influential , and covered not only aesthetics but considerations of microtones and other innovative topics . He was based in Berlin from 1894 but spent much of World War I in Switzerland . He began composing in his early years in a late romantic style , but after 1907 , when he published his Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music , he developed a more individual style , often with elements of atonality . His visits to America led to interest in North American indigenous tribal melodies which were reflected in some of his works . His compositions include works for piano , among them a monumental Piano Concerto , and transcriptions of the works of others , notably Johann Sebastian Bach ( published as the Bach-Busoni Editions ) .

Despite his short lifetime , Schubert left behind a vast oeuvre , including more than 600 secular vocal works ( mainly lieder ) , seven complete symphonies , sacred music , operas , incidental music and a large body of piano and chamber music . His major works include the Piano Quintet in A major , D. 667 ( Trout Quintet ) , the Symphony No . 8 in B minor , D. 759 ( Unfinished Symphony ) , the Great Symphony No . 9 in C major , D. 944 , the three last piano sonatas ( D. 958-960 ) , the opera Fierrabras ( D. 796 ) , the incidental music to the play Rosamunde ( D. 797 ) , and the song cycles Die sch\u00f6ne M\u00fcllerin ( D. 795 ) and Winterreise ( D. 911 ) .

His father gave him his first violin lessons and his older brother gave him piano lessons , but Schubert soon exceeded their abilities . In 1808 , at the age of eleven , he became a pupil at the Stadtkonvikt school , where he became acquainted with the orchestral music of Haydn , Mozart , and Beethoven . He left the Stadtkonvikt at the end of 1813 , and returned home to live with his father , where he began studying to become a schoolteacher ; despite this , he continued his studies in composition with Antonio Salieri and still composed prolifically . In 1821 , Schubert was granted admission to the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde as a performing member , which helped establish his name among the Viennese citizenry . He gave a concert of his own works to critical acclaim in March 1828 , the only time he did so in his career .

The third and fourth pieces in the first set were published in 1857 ( although the third piece was printed by the publisher in G major , instead of G\u266d as Schubert had written it , and remained available only in this key for many years ) . The two sets are now catalogued as D. 899 and D. 935 respectively . They are considered to be among the most important examples of this popular early 19th-century genre .

  "/wiki/Kreisleriana": "Kreisleriana , Op . 16 , is a composition in eight movements by Robert Schumann for solo piano , subtitled Phantasien f\u00fcr das Pianoforte . It was written in only four days in April 1838 and a revised version appeared in 1850 . The work was dedicated to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin , but when a copy was sent to the Polish composer , he commented favorably only on the design of the title page . Kreisleriana is a very dramatic work and is viewed by some critics as one of Schumann 's finest compositions . In 1839 , soon after publishing it , Schumann called it in a letter my favourite work , remarking that The title conveys nothing to any but Germans . Kreisler is one of E. T. A. Hoffmann 's creations , an eccentric , wild , and witty conductor . In 1843 , when he had moved from writing for solo piano to much larger works , in particular Paradise and the Peri , he still listed it as one of his best piano works . The work 's title was inspired by the character of Johannes Kreisler from works of E. T. A. Hoffmann . Like the kaleidoscopic Kreisler , each number has multiple contrasting sections , resembling the imaginary musician 's manic depression , and recalling Schumann 's own Florestan and Eusebius , the two characters Schumann used to indicate his own contrasting impulsive and dreamy sides . Johannes Kreisler appears in several books by Hoffmann , including Kater Murr and most notably in the Kreisleriana section of Fantasiest\u00fccke in Callots Manier , published in 1814 . In a letter to his wife Clara , Schumann reveals that she has figured largely in the composition of Kreisleriana :",

Beethoven was born in Bonn , the capital of the Electorate of Cologne , which was part of the Holy Roman Empire . His musical talent was obvious at an early age , and he was harshly and intensively taught by his father Johann van Beethoven , who thought this would enable him to become a child prodigy like Mozart . He was later taught by the composer and conductor Christian Gottlob Neefe . At age 21 , he moved to Vienna and studied composition with Joseph Haydn . Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist , and he was soon courted by Karl Alois , Prince Lichnowsky for compositions , which resulted in Opus 1 in 1795 . The piece was a great critical and commercial success and was followed by Symphony No . 1 in 1800 . This composition was distinguished by its frequent use of sforzandi , sudden shifts in tonal centers ( which were uncommon for traditional symphonic form ) , and the prominent , more independent use of wind instruments . In 1801 , he also gained fame for his six String Quartets and for the ballet The Creatures of Prometheus .

As the creator of acknowledged masterpieces across numerous music genres , he is regarded as one of the major composers of the 20th century . His works include such widely heard pieces as the March from The Love for Three Oranges , the suite Lieutenant Kij\u00e9 , the ballet Romeo and Juliet - from which Dance of the Knights is taken - and Peter and the Wolf . Of the established forms and genres in which he worked , he created - excluding juvenilia - seven completed operas , seven symphonies , eight ballets , five piano concertos , two violin concertos , a cello concerto , a symphony-concerto for cello and orchestra , and nine completed piano sonatas . A graduate of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory , Prokofiev initially made his name as an iconoclastic composer-pianist , achieving notoriety with a series of ferociously dissonant and virtuosic works for his instrument , including his first two piano concertos . In 1915 , Prokofiev made a decisive break from the standard composer-pianist category with his orchestral Scythian Suite , compiled from music originally composed for a ballet commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev of the Ballets Russes . Diaghilev commissioned three further ballets from Prokofiev - Chout , Le pas d'acier and The Prodigal Son - which at the time of their original production all caused a sensation among both critics and colleagues . Prokofiev 's greatest interest , however , was opera , and he composed several works in that genre , including The Gambler and The Fiery Angel . Prokofiev 's one operatic success during his lifetime was The Love for Three Oranges , composed for the Chicago Opera and subsequently performed over the following decade in Europe and Russia .

  "/wiki/Toccata_(Prokofiev)": "The Toccata in D minor , Op . 11 is a piece for solo piano , written by Sergei Prokofiev in 1912 and debuted by the composer on December 10 , 1916 in Petrograd . It is a further development of the toccata form , which has been used by composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach and Robert Schumann . Other composers of well-known toccatas include Maurice Ravel , Dmitri Kabalevsky and Aram Khachaturian . Prokofiev 's Toccata starts off with a persistent repetition of the note D , interchanged between the right hand ( which plays the single note ) and the left hand ( which plays the same note but with the lower octave as well ) . After a brief development , there are chromatic leaps in the left hand while the right hand plays a repeated figuration . The two hands soon switch positions , although the leaps still continue for a while . A series of split chromatic thirds leads upwards until a descending melody ( in C ) with chromatic third accompaniments begins , with the left hand traveling in contrary motion upwards . This leads back to the main repetition 'theme ' before a very short pause . Both hands soon play a weaving series of the right hand 's repeated figuration from the start , before the split chromatic thirds pattern reappears . This leads more violently to the descending melody pattern , but this time in D , before the D repetition 'theme ' reappears , this time in alternating octaves in both hands . The Toccata slows down and halts temporarily before a chromatic rising scale leads to octave exhortations , followed by a glissando sweep up the keyboard to end on the top D. This particular piece is an extremely difficult showpiece that is very popular with virtuoso pianists and has been recorded by many .",

He was one of the foremost French composers of his generation , and his musical style influenced many 20th-century composers . Among his best-known works are his Pavane , Requiem , Sicilienne , nocturnes for piano and the songs Apr\u00e8s un r\u00eave and Clair de lune . Although his best-known and most accessible compositions are generally his earlier ones , Faur\u00e9 composed many of his most highly regarded works in his later years , in a more harmonically and melodically complex style . Faur\u00e9 was born into a cultured but not especially musical family . His talent became clear when he was a small boy . At the age of nine , he was sent to the Ecole Niedermeyer music college in Paris , where he was trained to be a church organist and choirmaster . The Ecole Neidermeyer 's pedagogy differed greatly from that of the Paris Conservatoire . Among his teachers was Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns , who became a lifelong friend . After graduating from the college in 1865 , Faur\u00e9 earned a modest living as an organist and teacher , leaving him little time for composition . When he became successful in his middle age , holding the important posts of organist of the \u00c9glise de la Madeleine and director of the Paris Conservatoire , he still lacked time for composing ; he retreated to the countryside in the summer holidays to concentrate on composition .

His compositions include songs , solo piano works , chamber music , choral pieces , operas , ballets , and orchestral concert music . Among the best-known are the piano suite Trois mouvements perp\u00e9tuels ( 1919 ) , the ballet Les biches ( 1923 ) , the Concert champ\u00eatre ( 1928 ) for harpsichord and orchestra , the Organ Concerto ( 1938 ) , the opera Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites ( 1957 ) , and the Gloria ( 1959 ) for soprano , choir and orchestra . As the only son of a prosperous manufacturer Poulenc was expected to follow his father into the family firm , and he was not allowed to enrol at a music college . Largely self-educated musically , he studied with the pianist Ricardo Vi\u00f1es , who became his mentor after the composer 's parents died . Poulenc also made the acquaintance of Erik Satie , under whose tutelage he became one of a group of young composers known collectively as Les Six . In his early works Poulenc became known for his high spirits and irreverence . During the 1930s a much more serious side to his nature emerged , particularly in the religious music he composed from 1936 onwards , which he alternated with his more light-hearted works . In addition to composing , Poulenc was an accomplished pianist . He was particularly celebrated for his performing partnerships with the baritone Pierre Bernac ( who also advised him in vocal writing ) and the soprano Denise Duval , touring in Europe and America with each , and making many recordings . He was among the first composers to see the importance of the gramophone , and he recorded extensively from 1928 onwards . In his later years , and for decades after his death , Poulenc had a reputation , particularly in his native country , as a humorous , lightweight composer , and his religious music was often overlooked .",

  "/wiki/Piano_Sonata_No._23_(Beethoven)": "Ludwig van Beethoven 's Piano Sonata No . 23 in F minor , Op . 57 ( colloquially known as the Appassionata , meaning passionate in Italian ) is among the three famous piano sonatas of his middle period ( the others being the Waldstein , Op . 53 and Les Adieux , Op . 81a ) ; it was composed during 1804 and 1805 , and perhaps 1806 , and was dedicated to Count Franz von Brunswick . The first edition was published in February 1807 in Vienna . Unlike the early Sonata No . 8 , Path\u00e9tique , the Appassionata was not named during the composer 's lifetime , but was so labelled in 1838 by the publisher of a four-hand arrangement of the work . One of his greatest and most technically challenging piano sonatas , the Appassionata was considered by Beethoven to be his most tempestuous piano sonata until the twenty-ninth piano sonata ( known as the Hammerklavier ) [ citation needed ] . 1803 was the year Beethoven came to grips with the irreversibility of his progressively deteriorating hearing . An average performance of the entire Appassionata sonata lasts about twenty-five minutes .",
  "/wiki/Piano_Sonata_No._21_(Beethoven)": "Beethoven 's Piano Sonata No . 21 in C major , Op . 53 , known as the Waldstein , is one of the three most notable sonatas of his middle period ( the other two being the Appassionata , Op . 57 , and Les Adieux , Op . 81a ) . Completed in summer 1804 and surpassing Beethoven 's previous piano sonatas in its scope , the Waldstein is a key early work of Beethoven 's Heroic decade ( 1803-1812 ) and set a standard for piano composition in the grand manner . The sonata 's name derives from Beethoven 's dedication to his close friend and patron Count Ferdinand Ernst Gabriel von Waldstein of Vienna . Like the Archduke Trio ( one of many pieces dedicated to Archduke Rudolph ) , it is named for Waldstein even though other works are dedicated to him . It is also known as L'Aurora ( The Dawn ) in Italian , for the sonority of the opening chords of the third movement , thought to conjure an image of daybreak . It is considered one of Beethoven 's greatest and most technically challenging piano sonatas . The first section of the rondo requires a simultaneous pedal trill , high melody and rapid left hand runs while its coda 's glissando octaves , written in dialogue between the hands , compel even advanced performers to play in a simplified version since it is more demanding to play on the heavier action of a modern piano than on an early 19th-century instrument . An average performance of the entire Waldstein lasts about twenty-five minutes .",

He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally , bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States . He was honored in 1884 by Emperor Alexander III , and awarded a lifetime pension . Although musically precocious , Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant . There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education . When an opportunity for such an education arose , he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory , from which he graduated in 1865 . The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five , with whom his professional relationship was mixed . Tchaikovsky 's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood . From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style - a task that did not prove easy .",

Unlike most opera composers , Wagner wrote both the libretto and the music for each of his stage works . Initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works in the romantic vein of Carl Maria von Weber and Giacomo Meyerbeer , Wagner revolutionised opera through his concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk ( total work of art ) , by which he sought to synthesise the poetic , visual , musical and dramatic arts , with music subsidiary to drama . He described this vision in a series of essays published between 1849 and 1852 . Wagner realised these ideas most fully in the first half of the four-opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen ( The Ring of the Nibelung ) . His compositions , particularly those of his later period , are notable for their complex textures , rich harmonies and orchestration , and the elaborate use of leitmotifs - musical phrases associated with individual characters , places , ideas , or plot elements . His advances in musical language , such as extreme chromaticism and quickly shifting tonal centres , greatly influenced the development of classical music . His Tristan und Isolde is sometimes described as marking the start of modern music . Wagner had his own opera house built , the Bayreuth Festspielhaus , which embodied many novel design features . The Ring and Parsifal were premiered here and his most important stage works continue to be performed at the annual Bayreuth Festival , run by his descendants . His thoughts on the relative contributions of music and drama in opera were to change again , and he reintroduced some traditional forms into his last few stage works , including Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg ( The Mastersingers of Nuremberg ) . Until his final years , Wagner 's life was characterised by political exile , turbulent love affairs , poverty and repeated flight from his creditors .",
  "/wiki/Tristan_und_Isolde": "Tristan und Isolde ( Tristan and Isolde ) , WWV 90 , is an opera in three acts by Richard Wagner to a German libretto by the composer , based largely on the 12th-century romance Tristan by Gottfried von Strassburg . It was composed between 1857 and 1859 and premiered at the K\u00f6nigliches Hof- und Nationaltheater in Munich on 10 June 1865 with Hans von B\u00fclow conducting . Wagner referred to the work not as an opera , but called it eine Handlung ( literally a drama , a plot or an action ) , which was the equivalent of the term used by the Spanish playwright Calder\u00f3n for his dramas . Wagner 's composition of Tristan und Isolde was inspired by the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer ( particularly The World as Will and Representation ) , as well as by Wagner 's affair with Mathilde Wesendonck . Widely acknowledged as one of the peaks of the operatic repertoire , Tristan was notable for Wagner 's unprecedented use of chromaticism , tonal ambiguity , orchestral colour and harmonic suspension . The opera was enormously influential among Western classical composers and provided direct inspiration to composers such as Gustav Mahler , Richard Strauss , Karol Szymanowski , Alban Berg , Arnold Schoenberg and Benjamin Britten . Other composers like Claude Debussy , Maurice Ravel and Igor Stravinsky formulated their styles in contrast to Wagner 's musical legacy . Many see Tristan as the beginning of the move away from common practice harmony and tonality and consider that it lays the groundwork for the direction of classical music in the 20th century . Both Wagner 's libretto style and music were also profoundly influential on the symbolist poets of the late 19th century and early 20th century .",
