It is located on the grounds of Shuri Castle in Naha , Okinawa , a few paces away from the Shureimon castle gate . The utaki , or more specifically its stone gate ( \u77f3\u9580 , ishimon ) , is one of a number of sites which together comprise the UNESCO World Heritage Site officially described as Gusuku Sites and Related Properties of the Kingdom of Ryukyu , and has been designated an Important Cultural Property by the Japanese national government . While the gates were once opened only for the king , today they are always closed , and so the gates have in a way become a sacred space themselves , representative of the actual sacred space behind them . Many travellers and locals come to pray at the gates . The stone gate was first built in 1519 , during the reign of Ryukyuan king Sh\u014d Shin , though the space had been recognized as a sacred utaki prior to that . Whenever the king left the castle on a journey , he would first stop at Sonohyan-utaki to pray for safe travels . The site also played an important role in the initiation of the High Priestess ( \u805e\u5f97\u5927\u541b , kikoe-\u014dgimi ) of the native religion . The gate is said to be a prime example of traditional Okinawan architecture , and shows many signs of Chinese influence , along with a Japanese-influenced gable in the karahafu style . It was severely damaged in the 1945 battle of Okinawa , but was restored in 1957 , and officially designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000 , along with a number of other sites across Okinawa Island . The utaki , i.e . the sacred grove itself , was once much larger than it is today , an elementary school and other buildings having encroached upon the space .",
  "/wiki/Okinawan_language": "The Okinawan language ( \u6c96\u7e04\u53e3/\u30a6\u30c1\u30ca\u30fc\u30b0\u30c1 , Uchin\u0101guchi , [ \u0294ut\u0361\u0255ina\u02d0\u0261ut\u0361\u0255i ] ) or Central Okinawan , is a Northern Ryukyuan language spoken primarily in the southern half of the island of Okinawa , as well as in the surrounding islands of Kerama , Kumejima , Tonaki , Aguni and a number of smaller peripheral islands . Central Okinawan distinguishes itself from the speech of Northern Okinawa , which is classified independently as the Kunigami language . Both languages are listed by UNESCO as endangered . Though Okinawan encompasses a number of local dialects , the Shuri-Naha variant is generally recognized as the de facto standard , as it had been used as the official language of the Ry\u016bky\u016b Kingdom since the reign of King Sh\u014d Shin ( 1477-1526 ) . Moreover , as the former capital of Shuri was built around the royal palace , the language used by the royal court became the regional and literary standard , which thus flourished in songs and poems written during that era . Today , most Okinawans speak Okinawan Japanese , although there is a small number who still speaks the Okinawan language , most often the elderly . Within Japan , Okinawan is often not seen as a language unto itself but is referred to as the Okinawan dialect ( \u6c96\u7e04\u65b9\u8a00 , Okinawa h\u014dgen ) or more specifically the Central and Southern Okinawan dialects ( \u6c96\u7e04\u4e2d\u5357\u90e8\u8af8\u65b9\u8a00 , Okinawa Ch\u016bnanbu Sho h\u014dgen ) . Okinawan speakers are undergoing language shift as they switch to Japanese , since language use in Okinawa today is far from stable . Okinawans are assimilating and accenting standard Japanese due to the similarity of the two languages , standardized and centralized education system , the media , business and social contact with mainlanders and previous attempts from Japan to suppress the native languages . Okinawan is still kept alive in popular music , tourist shows and in theaters featuring a local drama called Uchin\u0101 shibai , which depict local customs and manners .",
