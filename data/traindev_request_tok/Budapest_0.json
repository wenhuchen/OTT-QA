  "/wiki/Religious_education": "In secular usage , religious education is the teaching of a particular religion ( although in the United Kingdom the term religious instruction would refer to the teaching of a particular religion , with religious education referring to teaching about religions in general ) and its varied aspects : its beliefs , doctrines , rituals , customs , rites , and personal roles . In Western and secular culture , religious education implies a type of education which is largely separate from academia , and which ( generally ) regards religious belief as a fundamental tenet and operating modality , as well as a prerequisite for attendance . The secular concept is substantially different from societies that adhere to religious law , wherein religious education connotes the dominant academic study , and in typically religious terms , teaches doctrines which define social customs as laws and the violations thereof as crimes , or else misdemeanors requiring punitive correction . The free choice of religious education by parents according to their conviction is protected by Convention against Discrimination in Education . Religious education is controversial worldwide . Some countries , such as the United States , do not publicly fund religious education nor make it part of compulsory schooling . In other contexts , such as the United Kingdom , an 'open ' religious education has emerged from Christian confessionalism that it is intended to promote religious literacy without imparting a particular religious perspective . This kind of religious education has drawn criticism because , it is argued , there is no neutral perspective from which to study religions and any kind of compulsory schooling is likely to impact on the formation of a student 's religious identity",
