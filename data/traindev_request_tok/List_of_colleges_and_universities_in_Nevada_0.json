  "/wiki/Graduate_school": "A graduate school ( sometimes shortened to grad school ) is a school that awards advanced academic degrees ( i.e. , master 's and doctoral degrees ) with the general requirement that students must have earned a previous undergraduate ( bachelor 's ) degree with a high grade point average . A distinction is typically made between graduate schools ( where courses of study vary in the degree to which they provide training for a particular profession ) and professional schools , which offer specialized advanced degrees in professional fields such as medicine , nursing , business , engineering , speech-language pathology , or law . The distinction between graduate schools and professional schools is not absolute since various professional schools offer graduate degrees and vice versa . Many universities award graduate degrees ; a graduate school is not necessarily a separate institution . While the term graduate school is typical in the United States and often used elsewhere ( e.g. , Canada ) , postgraduate education is also used in English-speaking countries ( Australia , Bangladesh , Canada , India , Ireland , New Zealand , Pakistan , and the UK ) to refer to the spectrum of education beyond a bachelor 's degree . Those attending graduate schools are called graduate students ( in both American and British English ) , or often in British English as postgraduate students and , colloquially , postgraduates and postgrads . Degrees awarded to graduate students include master 's degrees , doctoral degrees , and other postgraduate qualifications such as graduate certificates and professional degrees . Producing original research is a significant component of graduate studies in the humanities , natural sciences and social sciences . This research typically leads to the writing and defense of a thesis or dissertation . In graduate programs that are oriented toward professional training ( e.g. , MPA , MBA , MHA ) , the degrees may consist solely of coursework , without an original research or thesis component . The term graduate school is primarily North American . Additionally , in North America , the term does not usually refer to medical school ( whose students are called medical students ) , and only occasionally refers to law school or business school ; these are often collectively termed professional schools .",
