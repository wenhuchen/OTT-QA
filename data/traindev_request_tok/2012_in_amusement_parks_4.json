  "/wiki/Suspended_roller_coaster": "A suspended roller coaster is a type of steel roller coaster in which the car hangs from the bottom of the rolling stock by a pivoting fulcrum or hinge assembly . This allows the car and riders to swing side to side as the train races along the track . Due to the swing designs , these roller coasters can not invert riders ."
