Named by New Zealand Antarctic Place-Names Committee ( NZ-APC ) in 1961 after Captain Robert Falcon Scott , Royal Navy , leader of the Discovery expedition ( 1901-04 ) and the British Antarctic Expedition ( 1910-13 ) , who lost his life on the return journey from the South Pole . Much of the early exploration of this coastline was accomplished by Scott and his colleagues , and many of the names in the region were bestowed by him .",
  "/wiki/Alph_River": "Alph River is a small river of Antarctica , running into Walcott Bay , Victoria Land . It is in an ice-free region at the west of the Koettlitz Glacier , Scott Coast . The Alph emerges from Trough Lake , and flows through Walcott Lake , Howchin Lake , and Alph Lake . It ends in a sub-glacial flow beneath Koettlitz Glacier to McMurdo Sound . The river was named by Thomas Griffith Taylor , member of the Terra Nova Expedition of 1911-13 , who explored the portion north of Pyramid Trough . He took the name from the opening passage of Samuel Taylor Coleridge 's poem , Kubla Khan , as the stream continues north a considerable distance under moraine and ultimately subglacially beneath Koettlitz Glacier to the Ross Sea . The nearby Xanadu Hills are named from the same poem .",
  "/wiki/Don_Juan_Pond": "Don Juan Pond is a small and very shallow hypersaline lake in the western end of Wright Valley ( South Fork ) , Victoria Land , Antarctica , 9 kilometres ( 5.6 mi ) west from Lake Vanda . It is wedged between the Asgard Range to the south and the Dais Range to the north . On the west end is a small tributary and a rock glacier . With a salinity level of 33.8% , Don Juan Pond is the saltiest of the Antarctic lakes and the second saltiest body of water on earth behind the Gaet'ale Pond . This salinity allows the pond to remain liquid even at temperatures as low as \u221250 \u00b0C ( \u221258 \u00b0F ) due to the interference of salts with the bonding of water molecules . Don Juan Pond was discovered in 1961 by George H. Meyer . It was named for two helicopter pilots , Lt. Don Roe and Lt. John Hickey , who piloted the helicopter involved with the first field party investigating the pond .",
  "/wiki/McMurdo_Dry_Valleys": "The McMurdo Dry Valleys are a row of largely snow-free valleys in Antarctica , located within Victoria Land west of McMurdo Sound . The Dry Valleys experience extremely low humidity and surrounding mountains prevent the flow of ice from nearby glaciers . The rocks here are granites and gneisses , and glacial tills dot this bedrock landscape , with loose gravel covering the ground . The region is one of the world 's most extreme deserts , and includes many features including Lake Vida , a saline lake , and the Onyx River , a meltwater stream and Antarctica 's longest river . Although no living organisms have been found in the permafrost here , endolithic photosynthetic bacteria have been found living in the relatively moist interior of rocks and anaerobic bacteria , with a metabolism based on iron and sulfur , live under the Taylor Glacier .",
  "/wiki/Hypersaline_lake": "A hypersaline lake is a landlocked body of water that contains significant concentrations of sodium chloride or other salts , with saline levels surpassing that of ocean water ( 3.5% , i.e . 35 grams per litre or 0.29 pounds per US gallon ) . Specific microbial and crustacean species thrive in these high-salinity environments that are inhospitable to most lifeforms . Some of these species enter a dormant state when desiccated , and some species are thought to survive for over 250 million years . The water of hypersaline lakes has great buoyancy due to its high salt content . The most saline water body in the world is the Don Juan Pond , located in the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica . Its volume is some 3,000 cubic meters , but is constantly changing . The Don Juan Pond has a salinity level of over 44% , ( i.e . 12 times as salty as ocean water ) . Its high salinity prevents the Don Juan from freezing even when temperatures are below \u221250 \u00b0C ( \u221258 \u00b0F ) . There are larger hypersaline water bodies , lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys such as Lake Vanda with salinity of over 35% ( i.e . 10 times as salty as ocean water ) .",

It is 7 kilometres ( 4.3 mi ) long and up to 900 metres ( 3,000 ft ) wide . A narrow channel only 50 metres ( 160 ft ) wide ( Lake Bonney at Narrows ) separates the lake into East Lake Bonney ( 3.32 square kilometres [ 1.28 sq mi ] ) and West Lake Bonney ( 0.99 square kilometres [ 0.38 sq mi ] ) . To the north and south of the lake lie peaks that are over 1,500 metres ( 4,900 ft ) above sea level , and the Taylor Glacier is positioned to the west of the lake . It is 130 feet ( 40 m ) deep and is perpetually trapped under 12 to 15 feet ( 3.7 to 4.6 m ) of ice . It was first visited by the British Antarctic Expedition of 1901-1904 . It was named by the Scott expedition of 1910-1913 , for Thomas George Bonney , professor of geology at University College London , England from 1877 to 1901 . Lake Bonney is one of the main lakes studied by the National Science Foundations , McMurdo Long Term Ecological Research site . Starting in 2007 NASA is funding an autonomous submersible robot called ENDURANCE to explore the water volume of the lake to study its shape and ecology . The robot is built by Stone Aerospace who also developed the DEPTHX submersible . The Endurance Project is led by Peter Doran with Bill Stone and John Priscu among the co-investigators . Scientists have discovered an ancient ecosystem beneath the Taylor Glacier , next to Lake Bonney .",
  "/wiki/Endorheic_lake": "An endorheic basin ( also endoreic basin or endorreic basin ) is a limited drainage basin that normally retains water and allows no outflow to other external bodies of water , such as rivers or oceans , but converges instead into lakes or swamps , permanent or seasonal , that equilibrate through evaporation . Such a basin may also be referred to as a closed or terminal basin or as an internal drainage system or interior drainage basin . Endorheic regions , in contrast to exorheic regions , which flow to the ocean in geologically defined patterns , are closed hydrologic systems . Their surface waters drain to inland terminal locations where the water evaporates or seeps into the ground , having no access to discharge into the sea . Endorheic water bodies include some of the largest lakes in the world , such as the Caspian Sea , the world 's largest saline inland sea . Endorheic basins constitute local base levels , defining a limit of erosion and deposition processes of nearby areas . The term comes from the Ancient Greek : \u1f14\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd , \u00e9ndon , within and \u1fe5\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd , rhe\u00een , to flow .",

On its shore , New Zealand maintained Vanda Station from 1968 to 1995 . Lake Vanda is a hypersaline lake with a salinity more than ten times that of seawater , more than the salinity of the Dead Sea , and perhaps even more than of Lake Assal ( Djibouti ) , which is the world 's most saline lake outside of Antarctica . ( Previous sentence , however , is not true according to List of bodies of water by salinity ) . Lake Vanda is also meromictic , which means that the deeper waters of the lake do n't mix with the shallower waters . There are three distinct layers of water ranging in temperature from 23 \u00b0C ( 73 \u00b0F ) on the bottom to the middle layer of 7 \u00b0C ( 45 \u00b0F ) and the upper layer ranges from 4-6 \u00b0C ( 39-43 \u00b0F ) .

  "/wiki/Volcanic_crater_lake": "A volcanic crater lake is a lake in a crater that was formed from explosive activity or collapse during a volcanic eruption . Lakes in calderas fill large craters formed by the collapse of a volcano during an eruption . Lakes in maars fill medium-sized craters where an eruption deposited debris around a vent . Crater lakes form as the created depression , within the crater rim , is filled by water . The water may come from precipitation , groundwater circulation ( often hydrothermal fluids in the case of volcanic craters ) or melted ice . Its level rises until an equilibrium is reached between the rates of incoming and outgoing water . Sources of water loss singly or together may include evaporation , subsurface seepage , and , in places , surface leakage or overflow when the lake level reaches the lowest point on its rim . At such a saddle location , the upper portion of the lake is contained only by its adjacent natural volcanic dam ; continued leakage through or surface outflow across the dam can erode its included material , thus lowering lake level until a new equilibrium of water flow , erosion , and rock resistance is established . If the volcanic dam portion erodes rapidly or fails catastrophically , the occurrence produces a breakout or outburst flood . With changes in environmental conditions over time , the occurrence of such floods is common to all natural dam types . A well-known crater lake , which bears the same name as the geological feature , is Crater Lake in Oregon . It is located in the caldera of Mount Mazama .",
