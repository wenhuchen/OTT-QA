  "/wiki/Political_correctness": "Political correctness ( adjectivally : politically correct ; commonly abbreviated PC ) is a term used to describe language , policies , or measures that are intended to avoid offense or disadvantage to members of particular groups in society . In public discourse and the media , the term is generally used as a pejorative with an implication that these policies are excessive or unwarranted . Since the late 1980s , the term has been used to describe a preference for inclusive language and avoiding language or behavior that can be seen as excluding , marginalizing , or insulting groups of people considered disadvantaged or discriminated against , especially groups defined by sex or race . Early usage of the term politically correct by leftists in the 1970s and '80s was as self-critical satire ; usage was ironic , rather than a name for a serious political movement . It was considered an in-joke among leftists used to satirise those who were too rigid in their adherence to political orthodoxy . The modern pejorative usage of the term emerged from conservative criticism of the New Left in the late 20th century . This usage was popularized by a number of articles in The New York Times and other media throughout the 1990s , and was widely used in the debate surrounding Allan Bloom 's 1987 book The Closing of the American Mind . The term gained further currency in response to Roger Kimball 's Tenured Radicals ( 1990 ) , and conservative author Dinesh D'Souza 's 1991 book Illiberal Education . Commentators on the political left in the United States contend that conservatives use the concept of political correctness to downplay and divert attention from substantively discriminatory behavior against disadvantaged groups . They also argue that the political right enforces its own forms of political correctness to suppress criticism of its favored constituencies and ideologies . In the United States , the term has played a major role in the culture war between liberals and conservatives .",

After briefly serving as the capital of the Texas Republic in the late 1830s , Houston grew steadily into a regional trading center for the remainder of the 19th century . The arrival of the 20th century saw a convergence of economic factors which fueled rapid growth in Houston , including a burgeoning port and railroad industry , the decline of Galveston as Texas ' primary port following a devastating 1900 hurricane , the subsequent construction of the Houston Ship Channel , and the Texas oil boom . In the mid-20th century , Houston 's economy diversified as it became home to the Texas Medical Center - the world 's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions - and NASA 's Johnson Space Center , where the Mission Control Center is located . Houston 's economy since the late 19th century has a broad industrial base in energy , manufacturing , aeronautics , and transportation .

  "/wiki/Portuguese_people": "Portuguese people are a Romance ethnic group indigenous to Portugal who share a common Portuguese culture , ancestry and language . Their predominant religion is Christianity , mainly Roman Catholicism , though large segments of the population , especially the younger generations , have no religious affiliation . The Portuguese people 's heritage largely derives from the pre-Celts ( Lusitanians , Conii ) and Celts ( Gallaecians , Turduli and Celtici ) , who were Romanized after the conquest of the region by the ancient Romans . A number of Portuguese can also trace minor descent from Germanic tribes who arrived after the Roman period as ruling elites , namely the Suebi , Vandals and Visigoths , who ruled for circa three hundred years . Finally , the Moorish occupation left a genetic contribution in the Iberian Peninsula , especially in western and southern regions . The Roman Republic conquered the Iberian Peninsula during the 2nd and 1st centuries B.C . from the extensive maritime empire of Carthage during the series of Punic Wars . As a result of Roman colonization , the Portuguese language stems primarily from Vulgar Latin . Due to the large historical extent from the 16th century of the Portuguese Empire and the subsequent colonization of territories in Asia , Africa and the Americas , as well as historical and recent emigration , Portuguese communities can be found in many diverse regions around the globe , and a large Portuguese diaspora exists . Portuguese people began an Age of Exploration which started in 1415 with the conquest of Ceuta and culminated in an empire with territories that are now part of over 50 countries . The Portuguese Empire lasted nearly 600 years , seeing its end when Macau was returned to China in 1999 . The discovery of several lands unknown to Europeans in the Americas , Africa , Asia and Oceania ( southwest Pacific Ocean ) , forged the Portuguese Empire described as the first global empire in history , also paving the way for the domination of Western civilisation by other neighbouring European nations .",

  "/wiki/Cult": "In modern English , a cult is a social group that is defined by its unusual religious , spiritual , or philosophical beliefs , or by its common interest in a particular personality , object or goal . This sense of the term is controversial and it has divergent definitions both in popular culture and academia and it has also been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study . It is usually considered pejorative . In the sociological classifications of religious movements , a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices , although this is often unclear . Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults , saying that they arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices . Groups said to be cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions . Beginning in the 1930s , cults became the object of sociological study in the context of the study of religious behavior . From the 1940s the Christian countercult movement has opposed some sects and new religious movements , and it labelled them as cults for their un-Christian unorthodox beliefs . The secular anti-cult movement began in the 1970s and it opposed certain groups , often charging them with mind control and partly motivated in reaction to acts of violence committed by some of their members . Some of the claims and actions of the anti-cult movement have been disputed by scholars and by the news media , leading to further public controversy . An older sense of the word cult is a set of religious devotional practices that are conventional within their culture and related to a particular figure , and often associated with a particular place . References to the cult of , for example , a particular Catholic saint , or the imperial cult of ancient Rome , use this sense of the word .",
  "/wiki/Rock_climbing": "Rock climbing is a sport in which participants climb up , down or across natural rock formations or artificial rock walls . The goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a usually pre-defined route without falling . Professional rock climbing competitions have the objectives of either completing the route in the quickest possible time or attaining the farthest point on an increasingly difficult route . Due to the length of time and extended endurance required , and because accidents are most likely to happen on the descent , rock climbers do not usually climb back down the route , or downclimb , especially on the larger multiple pitch class III-IV , or multi-day grade IV-VI climbs . Rock climbing is a physically and mentally demanding sport , one that often tests a climber 's strength , endurance , agility and balance along with mental control . It can be a dangerous activity and knowledge of proper climbing techniques and use of specialized climbing equipment is crucial for the safe completion of routes . Because of the wide range and variety of rock formations around the world , rock climbing has been separated into several different styles and sub-disciplines , such as scrambling , another activity involving the scaling of hills and similar formations , differentiated by rock climbing 's sustained use of hands to support the climber 's weight as well as to provide balance .",
  "/wiki/Bisexuality": "Bisexuality is romantic attraction , sexual attraction , or sexual behavior toward both males and females , or to more than one sex or gender . It may also be defined as romantic or sexual attraction to people of any sex or gender identity , which is also known as pansexuality . The term bisexuality is mainly used in the context of human attraction to denote romantic or sexual feelings toward both men and women , and the concept is one of the three main classifications of sexual orientation along with heterosexuality and homosexuality , all of which exist on the heterosexual-homosexual continuum . A bisexual identity does not necessarily equate to equal sexual attraction to both sexes ; commonly , people who have a distinct but not exclusive sexual preference for one sex over the other also identify themselves as bisexual . Scientists do not know the exact cause of sexual orientation , but they theorize that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic , hormonal , and environmental influences , and do not view it as a choice . Although no single theory on the cause of sexual orientation has yet gained widespread support , scientists favor biologically-based theories . There is considerably more evidence supporting nonsocial , biological causes of sexual orientation than social ones , especially for males . Bisexuality has been observed in various human societies and elsewhere in the animal kingdom throughout recorded history . The term bisexuality , however , like the terms hetero- and homosexuality , was coined in the 19th century .",
  "/wiki/Yoga": "Yoga ( /\u02c8jo\u028a\u0261\u0259/ ; Sanskrit : \u092f\u094b\u0917 ; pronunciation ) is a group of physical , mental , and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India . Yoga is one of the six \u0100stika ( orthodox ) schools of Hindu philosophical traditions . There is a broad variety of yoga schools , practices , and goals in Hinduism , Buddhism , and Jainism . The term Yoga in the Western world often denotes a modern form of hatha yoga and yoga as exercise , consisting largely of the postures called asanas . The origins of yoga have been speculated to date back to pre-vedic Indian traditions ; possibly in the Indus valley civilization around 3000 BCE . It is mentioned in the Rigveda , [ note 1 ] but yoga most likely developed as a systematic study around the 5th and 6th centuries BCE , in ancient India 's ascetic and \u015brama\u1e47a movements . [ note 2 ] The chronology of earliest texts describing yoga-practices is unclear , varyingly credited to Upanishads . The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali date from the 2nd century BCE , and gained prominence in the west in 20th century after being first introduced by Swami Vivekananda . Hatha yoga texts emerged sometimes between the 9th and 11th century with origins in tantra . Yoga gurus from India later introduced yoga to the West , following the success of Swami Vivekananda in the late 19th and early 20th century with his adaptation of yoga tradition , excluding asanas . Outside India , it has developed into a posture-based physical fitness , stress-relief and relaxation technique . Yoga in Indian traditions , however , is more than physical exercise ; it has a meditative and spiritual core .",

Glam artists drew on diverse sources across music and throwaway pop culture , ranging from bubblegum pop and 1950s rock and roll to cabaret , science fiction , and complex art rock . The flamboyant clothing and visual styles of performers were often camp or androgynous , and have been described as playing with nontraditional gender roles . Glitter rock was a more extreme version of glam . The UK charts were inundated with glam rock acts from 1971 to 1975 . The March 1971 appearance of T. Rex frontman Marc Bolan on the BBC 's music show Top of the Pops , wearing glitter and satins , is often cited as the beginning of the movement . Other British glam rock artists include David Bowie , Mott the Hoople , Sweet , Slade , Mud , Roxy Music and Gary Glitter .

  "/wiki/Punk_music": "Punk rock ( or simply punk ) is a music genre that emerged in the mid-1970s .

They typically produced short , fast-paced songs with hard-edged melodies and singing styles , stripped-down instrumentation , and often political , anti-establishment lyrics . Punk embraces a DIY ethic ; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through independent record labels . The term punk rock was first used by American rock critics in the early 1970s to describe 1960s garage bands and certain subsequent acts they perceived as stylistic inheritors . When the movement now bearing the name developed from 1974 to 1976 , acts such as Television , Patti Smith , and the Ramones in New York City ; the Sex Pistols , the Clash , and the Damned in London ; and the Saints in Brisbane formed its vanguard . As 1977 approached , punk became a major cultural phenomenon in the UK . It spawned a punk subculture expressing youthful rebellion through distinctive styles of clothing and adornment ( such as deliberately offensive T-shirts , leather jackets , studded or spiked bands and jewelry , safety pins , and bondage and S & M clothes ) and a variety of anti-authoritarian ideologies . In 1977 , the influence of the music and subculture became more pervasive , spreading worldwide , especially in England . It took root in a wide range of local scenes that often rejected affiliation with the mainstream .

Male peafowl are referred to as peacocks , and female peafowl as peahens , though peafowl of either sex are often referred to colloquially as peacocks . The two Asiatic species are the blue or Indian peafowl originally of the Indian subcontinent , and the green peafowl of Southeast Asia ; the one African species is the Congo peafowl , native only to the Congo Basin . Male peafowl are known for their piercing calls and their extravagant plumage . The latter is especially prominent in the Asiatic species , which have an eye-spotted tail or train of covert feathers , which they display as part of a courtship ritual . The functions of the elaborate iridescent colouration and large train of peacocks have been the subject of extensive scientific debate . Charles Darwin suggested they served to attract females , and the showy features of the males had evolved by sexual selection . More recently , Amotz Zahavi proposed in his handicap theory that these features acted as honest signals of the males ' fitness , since less-fit males would be disadvantaged by the difficulty of surviving with such large and conspicuous structures .",

The term coming out can also be used in various non-LGBT applications ( e.g . atheists ) . Framed and debated as a privacy issue , coming out of the closet is described and experienced variously as a psychological process or journey ; decision-making or risk-taking ; a strategy or plan ; a mass or public event ; a speech act and a matter of personal identity ; a rite of passage ; liberation or emancipation from oppression ; an ordeal ; a means toward feeling gay pride instead of shame and social stigma ; or even career suicide . Author Steven Seidman writes that it is the power of the closet to shape the core of an individual 's life that has made homosexuality into a significant personal , social , and political drama in twentieth-century America . Coming out of the closet is the source of other gay slang expressions related to voluntary disclosure or lack thereof . LGBT people who have already revealed or no longer conceal their sexual orientation or gender identity are out , i.e . openly LGBT . Oppositely , LGBT people who have yet to come out or have opted not to do so are labelled as closeted or being in the closet . Outing is the deliberate or accidental disclosure of an LGBT person 's sexual orientation or gender identity , without their consent . By extension , outing oneself is self-disclosure .

The Equality Act , which is currently proposed in the United States Congress , would outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity nationwide . Since June 26 , 2003 , sexual activity between consenting adults and adolescents of a close age of the same sex has been legal nationwide , pursuant to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Lawrence v. Texas . As of June 26 , 2015 [ update ] , all states license and recognize marriage between same-sex couples as a result of the Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges . The United States has no federal law outlawing discrimination nationwide other than from federal executive orders which have a more limited scope than from protections through federal legislation . This leaves residents of some states unprotected against discrimination in employment , housing , and private or public services . LGBT rights-related laws regarding family and anti-discrimination still vary by state . The age of consent in each jurisdiction varies from age 16 to 18 , with some jurisdictions maintaining different ages of consent for males/females or for same-sex/opposite-sex relations . As a result , LGBT persons in the United States still face some challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents , particularly in the Bible belt and rural areas . The strongest expansions in LGBT rights in the United States have come from the Supreme Court .

In an even narrower sense , atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities . Atheism is contrasted with theism , which , in its most general form , is the belief that at least one deity exists . The etymological root for the word atheism originated before the 5th century BCE from the ancient Greek \u1f04\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2 ( atheos ) , meaning without god ( s ) . In antiquity , it had multiple uses as a pejorative term applied to those thought to reject the gods worshiped by the larger society , those who were forsaken by the gods , or those who had no commitment to belief in the gods . The term denoted a social category created by orthodox religionists into which those who did not share their religious beliefs were placed .
