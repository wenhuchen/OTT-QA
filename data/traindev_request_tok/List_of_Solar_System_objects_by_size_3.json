They are distinguished by a very low albedo because their composition includes a large amount of carbon , in addition to rocks and minerals . They occur most frequently at the outer edge of the asteroid belt , 3.5 astronomical units ( AU ) from the Sun , where 80% of the asteroids are of this type , whereas only 40% of asteroids at 2 AU from the Sun are C-type . The proportion of C-types may actually be greater than this , because C-types are much darker ( and therefore less detectable ) than most other asteroid types except for D-types and others that are mostly at the extreme outer edge of the asteroid belt .",

  "/wiki/Centaur_(minor_planet)": "Centaurs are small Solar System bodies with either a perihelion or a semi-major axis between those of the outer planets . They generally have unstable orbits because they cross or have crossed the orbits of one or more of the giant planets ; almost all their orbits have dynamic lifetimes of only a few million years , but there is one Centaur , 514107 Ka\u02bbepaoka\u02bbawela , which may be in a stable ( though retrograde ) orbit . [ how is this a centaur if the Trojans are n't ? ] Centaurs typically behave with characteristics of both asteroids and comets . They are named after the mythological centaurs that were a mixture of horse and human . Observational bias toward large objects makes determination of the total Centaur population difficult . Estimates for the number of Centaurs in the Solar System more than 1 km in diameter range from as low as 44,000 to more than 10,000,000 The first Centaur to be discovered , under the definition of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the one used here , was 944 Hidalgo in 1920 . However , they were not recognized as a distinct population until the discovery of 2060 Chiron in 1977 . The largest confirmed Centaur is 10199 Chariklo , which at 260 kilometers in diameter is as big as a mid-sized main-belt asteroid , and is known to have a system of rings . It was discovered in 1997 . However , the lost Centaur 1995 SN55 may be somewhat larger .

Incorrect orbital calculations initially resulted in 56 Melete being mistaken for a second sighting of Daphne . Daphne was not sighted again until August 31 , 1862 . The orbit of 41 Daphne places it in a 9:22 mean motion resonance with the planet Mars . The computed Lyapunov time for this asteroid is 14,000 years , indicating that it occupies a chaotic orbit that will change randomly over time because of gravitational perturbations of the planets . In 1999 , Daphne occulted three stars , and on July 2 , 1999 , produced eleven chords indicating an ellipsoid of 213\u00d7160 km .

In brightness , Hebe is the fifth-brightest object in the asteroid belt after Vesta , Ceres , Iris , and Pallas . It has a mean opposition magnitude of +8.3 , about equal to the mean brightness of Titan , and can reach +7.5 at an opposition near perihelion .
