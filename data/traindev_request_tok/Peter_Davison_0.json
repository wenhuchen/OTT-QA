From 1968 until 1992 , when LWT 's weekday counterpart was Thames Television , there was an on-screen handover to LWT on Friday nights ( there was no handover back to Thames on Mondays , as from 1968 to 1982 there was no programming in the very early morning , and from 1983 , when a national breakfast franchise was created , LWT would hand over to TV-am at 6:00am , who would then hand over to Thames at 9:25am ) .
