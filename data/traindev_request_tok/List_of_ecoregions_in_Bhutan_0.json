  "/wiki/Terrestrial_ecozone": "A biogeographic realm or ecozone is the broadest biogeographic division of the Earth 's land surface , based on distributional patterns of terrestrial organisms . They are subdivided into ecoregions , which are classified based on their biomes or habitat types . The realms delineate the large areas of the Earth 's surface within which organisms have been evolving in relative isolation over long periods of time , separated from one another by geographic features , such as oceans , broad deserts , or high mountain ranges , that constitute barriers to migration . As such , biogeographic realm designations are used to indicate general groupings of organisms based on their shared biogeography . Biogeographic realms correspond to the floristic kingdoms of botany or zoogeographic regions of zoology . Biogeographic realms are characterized by the evolutionary history of the organisms they contain . They are distinct from biomes , also known as major habitat types , which are divisions of the Earth 's surface based on life form , or the adaptation of animals , fungi , micro-organisms and plants to climatic , soil , and other conditions . Biomes are characterized by similar climax vegetation . Each realm may include a number of different biomes . A tropical moist broadleaf forest in Central America , for example , may be similar to one in New Guinea in its vegetation type and structure , climate , soils , etc. , but these forests are inhabited by animals , fungi , micro-organisms and plants with very different evolutionary histories . The patterns of distribution of living organisms in the world 's biogeographic realms were shaped by the process of plate tectonics , which has redistributed the world 's land masses over geological history .",
  "/wiki/Biome": "A biome /\u02c8ba\u026ao\u028am/ is a community of plants and animals that have common characteristics for the environment they exist in . They can be found over a range of continents . Biomes are distinct biological communities that have formed in response to a shared physical climate . Biome is a broader term than habitat ; any biome can comprise a variety of habitats . While a biome can cover large areas , a microbiome is a mix of organisms that coexist in a defined space on a much smaller scale . For example , the human microbiome is the collection of bacteria , viruses , and other microorganisms that are present on or in a human body . A 'biota ' is the total collection of organisms of a geographic region or a time period , from local geographic scales and instantaneous temporal scales all the way up to whole-planet and whole-timescale spatiotemporal scales . The biotas of the Earth make up the biosphere .",
  "/wiki/Districts_of_Bhutan": "The Kingdom of Bhutan is divided into 20 districts ( Dzongkha : dzongkhags ) . Bhutan is located between the Tibet Autonomous Region of China and India on the eastern slopes of the Himalayas in South Asia . Dzongkhags are the primary subdivisions of Bhutan . They possess a number of powers and rights under the Constitution of Bhutan , such as regulating commerce , running elections , and creating local governments . The Local Government Act of 2009 established local governments in each of the 20 dzongkhags overseen by the Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs . Each dzongkhag has its own elected government with non-legislative executive powers , called a dzongkhag tshogdu ( district council ) . The dzongkhag tshogdu is assisted by the dzongkhag administration headed by a dzongkdag ( royal appointees who are the chief executive officer of each dzongkhag ) . Each dzongkhag also has a dzongkhag court presided over by a dzongkhag drangpon ( judge ) , who is appointed by the Chief Justice of Bhutan on the advice of Royal Judicial Service Council . The dzongkhags , and their residents , are represented in the Parliament of Bhutan , a bicameral legislature consisting of the National Council and the National Assembly . Each dzongkhag has one National Council representative . National Assembly representatives are distributed among the dzongkhags in proportion to their registered voter population as recommended by the Delimitation Commission , provided that no dzongkhag shall have less than two and more than seven National Assembly constituencies . As of the 2017 census , Thimphu is the most populous dzongkhag , with 138,736 residents ; Gasa is the least populous with 3,952 residents .",

Temperate coniferous forests sustain the highest levels of biomass in any terrestrial ecosystem and are notable for trees of massive proportions in temperate rainforest regions . Structurally , these forests are rather simple , consisting of 2 layers generally : an overstory and understory . However , some forests may support a layer of shrubs . Pine forests support an herbaceous groundlayer that may be dominated by grasses and forbs that lend themselves to ecologically important wildfires .
