  "/wiki/Naucalpan,_State_of_Mexico": "Naucalpan , officially Naucalpan de Ju\u00e1rez , is a city and municipality located just northwest of Mexico City in the adjoining State of Mexico . The name Naucalpan comes from Nahuatl and means place of the four neighborhoods or four houses . Ju\u00e1rez was added to the official name in 1874 in honor of Benito Ju\u00e1rez . The history of the area begins with the Tlatilica who settled on the edges of the Hondo River between 1700 and 600 B.C.E. , but it was the Aztecs who gave it its current name when they dominated it from the 15th century until the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire . Naucalpan claims to be the area where Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s rested on the Noche Triste as they fled Tenochtitlan in 1520 , but this is disputed . It is the home of the Virgin of Los Remedios , a small image of the Virgin Mary which is strongly associated with the Conquest and is said to have been left here . Today , the city of Naucalpan is actually larger than the municipality itself , with part of it extending into neighboring Huixquilucan Municipality . It is a major center of industry in Mexico . It is , however , best known as the location of Ciudad Sat\u00e9lite , a development from the 1960s and the site of the Toreo de Cuatro Caminos bullring , which was demolished in the 2010s to build the Toreo Parque Central mixed-use development . The only unurbanized areas of the municipality are the Los Remedios National Park and a number of ejidos , but the lack of housing has put serious pressure on these areas .",

It is bordered to the north by the United States ; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean ; to the southeast by Guatemala , Belize , and the Caribbean Sea ; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico . Covering almost 2,000,000 square kilometers ( 770,000 sq mi ) , the nation is the fifth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent state in the world . With an estimated population of over 129 million people , Mexico is the tenth most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world , while being the second most populous nation in Latin America after Brazil . Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states plus Mexico City ( CDMX ) , which is the capital city and its most populous city . Other metropolises in the country include Guadalajara , Monterrey , Puebla , Toluca , Tijuana , and Le\u00f3n . Pre-Columbian Mexico dates to about 8000 BC and is identified as one of six cradles of civilization and was home to many advanced Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Olmec , Toltec , Teotihuacan , Zapotec , Maya , and Aztec before first contact with Europeans . In 1521 , the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the territory from its politically powerful base in Mexico-Tenochtitlan ( part of Mexico City ) , which was administered as the viceroyalty of New Spain . The Roman Catholic Church played a powerful role in governing the country as millions were converted to the faith , although King Charles III expelled the Jesuits in the 1770s . The territory became a nation state following its recognition in 1821 after the Mexican War of Independence . The post-independence period was tumultuous , characterized by economic inequality and many contrasting political changes .",
