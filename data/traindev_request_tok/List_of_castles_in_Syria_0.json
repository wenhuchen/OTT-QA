  "/wiki/Citadel_of_Aleppo": "The Citadel of Aleppo ( Arabic : \u0642\u0644\u0639\u0629 \u062d\u0644\u0628 ) is a large medieval fortified palace in the centre of the old city of Aleppo , northern Syria . It is considered to be one of the oldest and largest castles in the world . Usage of the Citadel hill dates back at least to the middle of the 3rd millennium BC . Occupied by many civilizations over time - including the Greeks , Byzantines , Ayyubids and Mamluks - the majority of the construction as it stands today is thought to originate from the Ayyubid period . An extensive conservation work took place in the 2000s by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture , in collaboration with Aleppo Archeological Society . Dominating the city , the Citadel is part of the Ancient City of Aleppo , a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1986 . During the 2010s , the Citadel received significant damage during the lengthy Battle of Aleppo . It was reopened to the public in early 2017 with repairs to damaged parts underway .",

It is the most populous governorate in Syria with a population of more than 4,868,000 ( 2011 Est . ) , almost 23% of the total population of Syria . The governorate is the fifth in area with an area of 18,482 km2 ( 7,136 sq mi ) , about 10% of the total area of Syria . The capital is the city of Aleppo . The governorate is represented by 52 deputies in the parliament ( out of 250 ) , of whom 20 come from the city of Aleppo . Together , with the Idlib Governorate , the Aleppo Governorate make up the Northern Region of Syria . Historically , the Northern Region was the most fertile and the most densely populated in Syria . This explains why the Governorate of Aleppo has by far the largest number of towns ( 32 towns ) , villages ( 1,430 villages ) , and farms ( 1,424 farms ) in Syria ( compare to 28 towns , 190 villages , and 82 farms in Rif Dimashq Governorate ) . It also explains why the Northern Region has a much larger number of archaeological sites and remains than elsewhere in Syria .",
  "/wiki/Tell_(archaeology)": "In archaeology , a tell or tel ( derived from Arabic : \u062a\u064e\u0644 , tall , 'mound ' or 'small hill ' ) , is an artificial mound formed from the accumulated remains of mudbricks and other refuse of generations of people living on the same site for hundreds or thousands of years . A classic tell looks like a low , truncated cone with sloping sides and can be up to 30 metres high . Tells are most commonly associated with the archaeology of the ancient Near East , but they are also found elsewhere , such as Central Asia , Eastern Europe , West Africa and Greece . Within the Near East , they are concentrated in less arid regions , including Upper Mesopotamia , the Southern Levant , Anatolia and Iran , which had more continuous settlement .",

It was founded at the end of the 13th century in northwestern Anatolia in the town of S\u00f6\u011f\u00fct ( modern-day Bilecik Province ) by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman I . Although initially the dynasty was of Turkic origin , it was Persianised in terms of language , culture , literature and habits . After 1354 , the Ottomans crossed into Europe , and with the conquest of the Balkans , the Ottoman beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire . The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror . During the 16th and 17th centuries , at the height of its power under the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent , the Ottoman Empire was a multinational , multilingual empire controlling most of Southeast Europe , parts of Central Europe , Western Asia , parts of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus , North Africa and the Horn of Africa . At the beginning of the 17th century , the empire contained 32 provinces and numerous vassal states . Some of these were later absorbed into the Ottoman Empire , while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries . [ note 7 ] With Constantinople as its capital and control of lands around the Mediterranean Basin , the Ottoman Empire was at the centre of interactions between the Eastern and Western worlds for six centuries . While the empire was once thought to have entered a period of decline following the death of Suleiman the Magnificent , this view is no longer supported by the majority of academic historians . The empire continued to maintain a flexible and strong economy , society and military throughout the 17th and much of the 18th century . However , during a long period of peace from 1740 to 1768 , the Ottoman military system fell behind that of their European rivals , the Habsburg and Russian empires .",

It is part of the Ancient City of Damascus , which was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979 . The location of the current citadel was first fortified in 1076 by the Turkman warlord Atsiz bin Uvak , although it is possible but not proven that a citadel stood on this place in the Hellenistic and Roman periods . After the assassination of Atsiz bin Uvak , the project was finished by the Seljuq ruler Tutush I . The emirs of the subsequent Burid and Zengid dynasties carried out modifications and added new structures to it . During this period , the citadel and the city were besieged several times by Crusader and Muslim armies . In 1174 , the citadel was captured by Saladin , the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt , who made it his residence and had the defences and residential buildings modified . Saladin 's brother Al-Adil rebuilt the citadel completely between 1203 and 1216 in response to the development of the counterweight trebuchet . After his death , power struggles broke out between the other Ayyubid princes and although Damascus switched hands several times , the citadel was taken by force only once , in 1239 . The citadel remained in Ayyubid hands until the Mongols under their general Kitbuqa captured Damascus in 1260 , thereby ending Ayyubid rule in Syria . After an unsuccessful revolt broke out in the citadel , the Mongols had most of it dismantled . After the defeat of the Mongols in 1260 by the Mamluks , who had succeeded the Ayyubids as rulers of Egypt , Damascus came under Mamluk rule .",

  "/wiki/Zenobia": "Septimia Zenobia ( Palmyrene : ( Btzby ) , pronounced Bat-Zabbai ; c. 240 - c. 274 AD ) was a third century queen of the Palmyrene Empire in Syria . Many legends surround her ancestry ; she was probably not a commoner and she married the ruler of the city , Odaenathus . Her husband became king in 260 , elevating Palmyra to supreme power in the Near East by defeating the Sassanians and stabilizing the Roman East . After Odaenathus ' assassination , Zenobia became the regent of her son Vaballathus and held de facto power throughout his reign . In 270 , Zenobia launched an invasion which brought most of the Roman East under her sway and culminated with the annexation of Egypt . By mid-271 her realm extended from Ancyra , central Anatolia , to southern Egypt , although she remained nominally subordinate to Rome . However , in reaction to Roman emperor Aurelian 's campaign in 272 , Zenobia declared her son emperor and assumed the title of empress ( declaring Palmyra 's secession from Rome ) . The Romans were victorious after heavy fighting ; the queen was besieged in her capital and captured by Aurelian , who exiled her to Rome where she spent the remainder of her life . Zenobia was a cultured monarch and fostered an intellectual environment in her court , which was open to scholars and philosophers . She was tolerant toward her subjects and protected religious minorities . The queen maintained a stable administration which governed a multicultural multiethnic empire .

Archaeological finds date back to the Neolithic period , and documents first mention the city in the early second millennium BC . Palmyra changed hands on a number of occasions between different empires before becoming a subject of the Roman Empire in the first century AD . The city grew wealthy from trade caravans ; the Palmyrenes became renowned as merchants who established colonies along the Silk Road and operated throughout the Roman Empire . Palmyra 's wealth enabled the construction of monumental projects , such as the Great Colonnade , the Temple of Bel , and the distinctive tower tombs . Ethnically , the Palmyrenes combined elements of Amorites , Arameans , and Arabs . The city 's social structure was tribal , and its inhabitants spoke Palmyrene ( a dialect of Aramaic ) , while using Greek for commercial and diplomatic purposes . Greco-Roman culture influenced the culture of Palmyra , which produced distinctive art and architecture that combined eastern and western traditions . The city 's inhabitants worshiped local Semitic deities , Mesopotamian and Arab gods . By the third century AD Palmyra had become a prosperous regional center . It reached the apex of its power in the 260s , when the Palmyrene King Odaenathus defeated Persian Emperor Shapur I .

  "/wiki/Byzantine_Empire": "The Byzantine Empire , also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire , or Byzantium , was the continuation of the Roman Empire in its eastern provinces during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages , when its capital city was Constantinople ( modern Istanbul , formerly Byzantium ) . It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 . During most of its existence , the empire was the most powerful economic , cultural and military force in Europe . Byzantine Empire is a term created after the end of the realm ; its citizens continued to refer to their empire simply as the Roman Empire ( Greek : \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd , tr .

Several signal events from the 4th to 6th centuries mark the period of transition during which the Roman Empire 's Greek East and Latin West diverged . Constantine I ( r. 324-337 ) reorganised the empire , made Constantinople the new capital and legalised Christianity . Under Theodosius I ( r. 379-395 ) , Christianity became the state religion and other religious practices were proscribed . In the reign of Heraclius ( r. 610-641 ) , the Empire 's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use in place of Latin . Although the Roman state continued and its traditions were maintained , modern historians distinguish Byzantium from ancient Rome insofar as it was centred on Constantinople , oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture and characterised by Eastern Orthodox Christianity . The borders of the empire fluctuated through cycles of decline and recovery . During the reign of Justinian I ( r. 527-565 ) , the empire reached its greatest extent , after reconquering much of the historically Roman western Mediterranean coast , including North Africa , Italy and Rome , which it held for two more centuries .",

During his reign , Justinian sought to revive the empire 's greatness and reconquer the lost western half of the historical Roman Empire . Justinian 's rule constitutes a distinct epoch in the history of the Later Roman empire , and his reign is marked by the ambitious but only partly realized renovatio imperii , or restoration of the Empire . Because of his restoration activities , Justinian has sometimes been known as the Last Roman in mid 20th century historiography . This ambition was expressed by the partial recovery of the territories of the defunct Western Roman Empire . His general , Belisarius , swiftly conquered the Vandal Kingdom in North Africa . Subsequently , Belisarius , Narses , and other generals conquered the Ostrogothic kingdom , restoring Dalmatia , Sicily , Italy , and Rome to the empire after more than half a century of rule by the Ostrogoths . The prefect Liberius reclaimed the south of the Iberian peninsula , establishing the province of Spania . These campaigns re-established Roman control over the western Mediterranean , increasing the Empire 's annual revenue by over a million solidi . During his reign , Justinian also subdued the Tzani , a people on the east coast of the Black Sea that had never been under Roman rule before . He engaged the Sasanian Empire in the east during Kavad I 's reign , and later again during Khosrow I 's ; this second conflict was partially initiated due to his ambitions in the west .",

It is located off the western banks of the Euphrates River , adjacent to the city of Mayadin and 42 kilometers ( 26 mi ) southeast of Dayr az-Zawr . Situated atop a mound with an elevation of 244 meters ( 801 ft ) , al-Rahba oversees the Syrian Desert steppe and historically guarded the Euphrates valley . It has been described as a fortress within a fortress ; it consists of an inner keep measuring 60 by 30 meters ( 197 ft \u00d7 98 ft ) , protected by an enclosure measuring 270 by 95 meters ( 886 ft \u00d7 312 ft ) . Al-Rahba is largely in ruins today as a result of erosion . The original site , which was known as Rahbat Malik ibn Tawk after its Abbasid namesake and founder , was located along the Euphrates . It was viewed by Muslim armies , caravans and travelers as the key to Syria from Iraq and sometimes vice versa . Bedouin tribes often took control of it and used it as a launching point for invasions of northern Syria .

The dynasty ruled large parts of the Middle East during the 12th and 13th centuries . Saladin had risen to vizier of Fatimid Egypt in 1169 , before abolishing the Fatimid Caliphate in 1171 . Three years later , he was proclaimed sultan following the death of his former master , the Zengid ruler Nur al-Din . For the next decade , the Ayyubids launched conquests throughout the region and by 1183 , their domains encompassed Egypt , Syria , Upper Mesopotamia , the Hejaz , Yemen and the North African coast up to the borders of modern-day Tunisia . Most of the Crusader states including the Kingdom of Jerusalem fell to Saladin after his victory at the Battle of Hattin in 1187 . However , the Crusaders regained control of Palestine 's coastline in the 1190s . After Saladin 's death in 1193 , his sons contested control of the sultanate , but Saladin 's brother al-Adil ultimately became the paramount sultan in 1200 . All of the later Ayyubid sultans of Egypt were his descendants . In the 1230s , the emirs of Syria attempted to assert their independence from Egypt and the Ayyubid realm remained divided until Sultan as-Salih Ayyub restored its unity by conquering most of Syria , except Aleppo , by 1247 . By then , local Muslim dynasties had driven out the Ayyubids from Yemen , the Hejaz and parts of Mesopotamia . After his death in 1249 , as-Salih Ayyub was succeeded in Egypt by al-Mu'azzam Turanshah .",
