  "/wiki/Euro-Fighter_roller_coaster": "The Euro-Fighter is a type of steel roller coaster developed by Gerstlauer . First launched in 2003 , the trademark feature of the roller coaster is its beyond-vertical drop , which reaches an angle greater than 90 degrees . Although the majority of Euro-Fighters are custom designed for each installation , every design so far has included the trademark drop . A number of different track elements are possible , including vertical loops , diving loops and barrel rolls . Almost all Euro-Fighter models have a vertical chain-driven lift hill , although LSM launch systems are also available . Riders are transported in individual cars around the track , which feature two rows of four seats . Two exceptions are Huracan at the Belantis amusement park in Germany and Dare Devil Dive at Six Flags Over Georgia , which both feature cars similar to those used on Gerstlauer 's launched roller coasters . The cars have over-the-shoulder restraints and may be themed ( to an extent ) according to the customer 's requirements . Dare Devil Dive 's cars were the first to use a new lap-bar only restraint system . Fluch von Novgorod , located at Hansa Park in Germany , was the first Euro-Fighter to incorporate both a vertical lift and an LSM launch in the same circuit .",

  "/wiki/Wild_Mouse_roller_coaster": "A Wild Mouse roller coaster ( also Mad Mouse or Crazy Mouse ) is a type of roller coaster characterized by small cars that seat four people or fewer and ride on top of the track , taking tight , flat turns ( without banking ) at modest speeds , yet producing high lateral G-forces . The track work is characterized by many turns and bunny hops , the latter producing abrupt negative vertical G forces . When approaching a turn from a straight section , the intended impression is that one will simply continue straight , and thus plunge off of the device , this since there are no transition sections as are in a conventional high speed roller coaster track and the turn itself is obscured upon close approach . Almost all Wild Mice feature switchback sections , consisting of several of these unbanked turns , separated by straight sections . Usually the turns on the switchback section are 180\u00b0 , but some coasters feature 90\u00b0 turns as well as more rarely steep runs with loops ( for example Crazy Mouse at Tobu Zoo in Japan , which is no longer operating ) . Some riders , usually among taller people , report sustaining whiplash after being subjected to these turns . [ citation needed ] The feeling of a Wild Mouse coaster is amplified by using cars that are wider than the track itself , giving the impression that the riders are hanging off the side or that they might fly out , thus giving it the name wild . Some may include trick-track - a straight piece of track banked slightly side to side designed to throw the rider left to right . Some wild mouse coasters , such as Primeval Whirl , also have spinning cars . The modern Wild Mouse was invented by German designer Franz Mack . In the original wooden Wild Mouse coasters of the 1960s and 1970s , the cars were so small that they could only fit two adults in close contact . While the low capacity of these rides led to long lines , the cars were small by design .",

  "/wiki/Steel_roller_coaster": "A steel roller coaster is a roller coaster that is defined by having a track made of steel . Steel coasters have earned immense popularity in the past 50 years throughout the world . Incorporating tubular steel track and polyurethane-coated wheels , the steel roller coasters can provide a taller , smoother , and faster ride with more inversions than a traditional wooden roller coaster . Arrow Dynamics first introduced the steel roller coaster to feature tubular track to the thrill industry with their creations of the Matterhorn Bobsleds ( Disneyland ) in 1959 and the Runaway Mine Train ( Six Flags Over Texas ) in 1966 . As of 2006 , the oldest operating steel roller coaster in North America is Little Dipper at Memphis Kiddie Park in Brooklyn , Ohio and has been operating since April 1952 . The oldest operating steel rollercoaster in the world is Monta\u00f1a Suiza at Parque de Atracciones Monte Igueldo ( Spain ) . It has been operating since 1928 .",
  "/wiki/Wooden_roller_coaster": "A wooden roller coaster is most often classified as a roller coaster with running rails made of flattened steel strips mounted on laminated wooden track . Occasionally , the support structure may be made out of a steel lattice or truss , but the ride remains classified as a wooden roller coaster due to the track design . The type of wood typically used in the construction of wooden coasters is Southern Yellow Pine , usually grown in the US and the rest of North America . Because of the limits of wood , wooden roller coasters , in general , do not have inversions ( when the coaster goes upside down ) , steep drops , or extremely banked turns ( overbanked turns ) . However , there are exceptions , such as the original loop on Son of Beast at Kings Island ; a corkscrew and 90-degree banked turn at Hades 360 at Mount Olympus Water and Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells , Wisconsin ; a steel structure at The Voyage at Holiday World ; and banked turns at Ravine Flyer II at Waldameer Park and Outlaw Run at Silver Dollar City .",
