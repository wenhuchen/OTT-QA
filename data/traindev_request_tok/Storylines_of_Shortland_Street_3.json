  "/wiki/Jewish_Wedding": "A Jewish wedding is a wedding ceremony that follows Jewish laws and traditions . While wedding ceremonies vary , common features of a Jewish wedding include a ketubah ( marriage contract ) which is signed by two witnesses , a chuppah ( or huppah ; wedding canopy ) , a ring owned by the groom that is given to the bride under the canopy and the breaking of a glass . Technically , the Jewish wedding process has two distinct stages : kiddushin ( sanctification or dedication , also called erusin , betrothal in Hebrew ) and nissuin ( marriage ) , when the couple start their life together . The first stage prohibits the woman to all other men , requiring a get ( religious divorce ) to dissolve , and the final stage permits the couple to each other . The ceremony that accomplishes nisuin is known as chuppah . Today , erusin/kiddushin occurs when the groom gives the bride a ring or other object of value with the intent of creating a marriage . There are differing opinions as to which part of the ceremony constitutes nissuin/chuppah ; they include standing under the canopy - itself called a chuppah - and being alone together in a room ( yichud ) . While historically these two events could take place as much as a year apart , they are now commonly combined into one ceremony .",
