( Kangchenjunga , which is higher , is on the border of India and Nepal . ) It is the 23rd-highest peak in the world . It was considered the highest mountain in the world before computations in 1808 proved Dhaulagiri to be higher . It was also the highest mountain in India until 1975 when Sikkim , the state in which Kangchenjunga is located , joined the Republic of India . It is part of the Garhwal Himalayas , and is located in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand , between the Rishiganga valley on the west and the Goriganga valley on the east . The peak , whose name means Bliss-Giving Goddess , is regarded as the patron-goddess of the Uttarakhand Himalaya . In acknowledgment of its religious significance and for the protection of its fragile ecosystem , the peak as well as the circle of high mountains surrounding it - the Nanda Devi sanctuary - were closed to both locals and climbers in 1983 . The surrounding Nanda Devi National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988 .",
  "/wiki/India": "India ( Hindi : Bh\u0101rat ) , officially the Republic of India ( Hindi : Bh\u0101rat Ga\u1e47ar\u0101jya ) , is a country in South Asia . It is the seventh-largest country by area , the second-most populous country , and the most populous democracy in the world . Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south , the Arabian Sea on the southwest , and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast , it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west ; [ e ] China , Nepal , and Bhutan to the north ; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east . In the Indian Ocean , India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives ; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia . Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",

Nanda Kot is connected to the Sanctuary wall by a high pass known as the Pindari Kanda , 5,269 m ( 17,287 ft ) . This pass , Nanda Kot itself , and the ridge proceeding south from the peak together form the divide between the Pindar and Ghori Ganga River valleys , with Dana Dhura Pass connecting the two sides . The Kaphni ( or Kafani ) , Pindar , Lawan , and Shalang Glaciers drain the south , west , north , and east sides of the peak respectively . The first attempt to climb Nanda Kot was made in 1905 by T.G . Longstaff , who proceeded by way of the Lawan Valley and Lawan Glacier . The first successful ascent of the summit came in 1936 by a Japanese team led by Yaichi Hotta [ ja ] . A new route involving a direct ascent of the south face was successfully undertaken by a British expedition led by Martin Moran in 1995 . Mountaineering expeditions to Nanda Kot today typically follow the route through Loharkhet , Dhakuri Pass , Khati Village to Dwali base camp . Outlying subpeaks of Nanda Kot include :"
