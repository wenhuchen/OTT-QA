The Tang capital at Chang'an ( present-day Xi'an ) was the most populous city in the world in its day .

Yet , even when the central government was breaking down and unable to compile an accurate census of the population in the 9th century , it is estimated that the population had grown by then to about 80 million people .

He is officially considered to have been the Northern pretender from May 24 , 1382 to October 21 , 1392 , when upon Emperor Go-Kameyama 's abdication , Go-Komatsu is understood to have been a legitimate emperor ( the 100th sovereign ) from that date .

The oldest sutras of Hinduism are found in the Brahmana and Aranyaka layers of the Vedas . Every school of Hindu philosophy , Vedic guides for rites of passage , various fields of arts , law , and social ethics developed respective sutras , which help teach and transmit ideas from one generation to the next . In Buddhism , sutras , also known as suttas , are canonical scriptures , many of which are regarded as records of the oral teachings of Gautama Buddha . They are not aphoristic , but are quite detailed , sometimes with repetition . This may reflect a philological root of sukta ( well spoken ) , rather than sutra ( thread ) .

  "/wiki/Censer": "A censer , incense burner , perfume burner or pastille burner ( these may be hyphenated ) is a vessel made for burning incense or perfume in some solid form . These vessels vary greatly in size , form , and material of construction , and have been in use since ancient times in many cultures , in both secular and religious contexts . They may consist of simple earthenware bowls or fire pots to intricately carved silver or gold vessels , small table top objects a few centimetres tall to as many as several metres high . Many designs use openwork to allow a flow of air . In many cultures , burning incense has spiritual and religious connotations , and this influences the design and decoration of the censer . Often , especially in Western contexts , censer is used for pieces made for religious use , especially those on chains that are swung through the air to spread the incense smoke widely , while perfume burner is used for objects made for secular use . The original meaning of pastille was a small compressed mixture of aromatic plant material and charcoal that was lit to release the odour , and pastille-burners were designed for this , for use in the home . The pastilles were made at home until their heyday in the early 19th century , and the burners are often made in pottery or porcelain . Some types could also be used as pomanders , where the perfume diffuses slowly by evaporation rather than burning ."
