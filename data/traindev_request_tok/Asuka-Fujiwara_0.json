  "/wiki/List_of_National_Treasures_of_Japan_(paintings)": "The term National Treasure has been used in Japan to denote cultural properties since 1897 . The definition and the criteria have changed since the inception of the term . These paintings adhere to the current definition , and were designated national treasures when the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties was implemented on June 9 , 1951 . As such , they are restricted in transfer and may not be exported . Owners are required to announce any changes to the National Treasures such as damage or loss and need to obtain a permit for changes in location , transfer of ownership or intended repairs . The items are selected by the Ministry of Education , Culture , Sports , Science and Technology based on their especially high historical or artistic value . This list contains 162 paintings from 7th-century Asuka period to the early modern 19th-century Edo period . In fact the number of paintings presented is more than 162 , because in some cases groups of related paintings are combined to form a single entry . The paintings listed show Buddhist themes , landscapes , portraits and court scenes . Some of the paintings were imported directly from China . The titles of the works are descriptive rather than the artists ' titles ; therefore it is possible to find alternate names in the literature for a given work . Beginning in the mid-6th century , as Buddhism was brought to Japan from Baekje , religious art was introduced from the mainland .",

Once a common practice , with the move towards preservation in situ , detachment is now largely restricted to cases where the only alternative is total loss . According to the International Council on Monuments and Sites ( ICOMOS ) , detachment and transfer are dangerous , drastic and irreversible operations that severely affect the physical composition , material structure and aesthetic characteristics of wall paintings . These operations are , therefore , only justifiable in extreme cases when all options of in situ treatment are not viable .",

  "/wiki/Kitora_Tomb": "The Kitora Tomb ( \u30ad\u30c8\u30e9\u53e4\u58b3 , Kitora Kofun ) is an ancient tumulus ( kofun in Japanese ) located in the village of Asuka , Nara Prefecture , Japan . The tomb is believed to have been constructed some time between the 7th and early 8th centuries , but was only discovered in 1983 . A small stone chamber , the Kitora Tomb is a little over 1 metre in height and width and about 2.4 metres long , just large enough to bury a single person . The four walls are aligned with the cardinal points of the compass , and respectively feature the Black Divine Tortoise of the North , the Azure Dragon of the East , the Red Phoenix of the South , and the White Tiger of the West . On the ceiling of the chamber there is also a astronomical chart that has been the focus of much research and debate by scholars in the field of archaeoastronomy . In addition , the 12 zodiac animals-headed figures with human body are painted on the wall , which may be one of the oldest remaining zodiac murals in East Asia . Fragments of a lacquered wooden coffin , torn apart when the tomb was robbed , lay 5 cm thick on the chamber floor , mixed with grave goods and human bone . A gilded bronze fitting and sword decorations were discovered , both executed with superbly inlaid patterns . Based upon analysis of the bone fragments and items found in the tomb , it is believed the interred was a middle-aged or older male of aristocratic background . The paintings have suffered the ravages of time , and , as National Treasure of Japan and World Heritage , their preservation has been accorded the highest priority . The entire tomb has been roofed over , and a series of adjoining antechambers were constructed to isolate the central chamber from temperature and humidity fluctuations , and prevent contamination by airborne mold spores and microorganisms .",

  "/wiki/Nihon_Shoki": "The Nihon Shoki ( \u65e5\u672c\u66f8\u7d00 ) , sometimes translated as The Chronicles of Japan , is the second-oldest book of classical Japanese history . The book is also called the Nihongi ( \u65e5\u672c\u7d00 , Japanese Chronicles ) . It is more elaborate and detailed than the Kojiki , the oldest , and has proven to be an important tool for historians and archaeologists as it includes the most complete extant historical record of ancient Japan . The Nihon Shoki was finished in 720 under the editorial supervision of Prince Toneri and with the assistance of \u014c no Yasumaro dedicated to Empress Gensh\u014d . The Nihon Shoki begins with the Japanese creation myth , explaining the origin of the world and the first seven generations of divine beings ( starting with Kuninotokotachi ) , and goes on with a number of myths as does the Kojiki , but continues its account through to events of the 8th century . It is believed to record accurately the latter reigns of Emperor Tenji , Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jit\u014d . The Nihon Shoki focuses on the merits of the virtuous rulers as well as the errors of the bad rulers . It describes episodes from mythological eras and diplomatic contacts with other countries . The Nihon Shoki was written in classical Chinese , as was common for official documents at that time . The Kojiki , on the other hand , is written in a combination of Chinese and phonetic transcription of Japanese ( primarily for names and songs ) .
