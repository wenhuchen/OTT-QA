  "/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science": "A Bachelor of Science ( Latin Baccalaureus Scientiae , B.S. , BS , B.Sc . or BSc ; or , less commonly , S.B. , SB , or Sc.B. , from the equivalent Latin Scientiae Baccalaureus ) is an undergraduate academic degree awarded for programs that generally last three to five years . The first university to admit a student to the degree of Bachelor of Science was the University of London in 1860 . Whether a student of a particular subject is awarded a Bachelor of Science degree or a Bachelor of Arts degree can vary between universities . For example , an economics degree may be given as a Bachelor of Arts ( BA ) by one university but as a BS by another , and some universities offer the choice of either . Some liberal arts colleges in the United States offer only the BA , even in the natural sciences , while some universities offer only the BS , even in non-science fields . At universities that offer both BA and BS degrees in the same discipline , the BS degree is usually more extensive in that particular discipline and is targeted toward students who are pursuing graduate school or a profession in that field .",

  "/wiki/Biosynthesis": "Biosynthesis is a multi-step , enzyme-catalyzed process where substrates are converted into more complex products in living organisms . In biosynthesis , simple compounds are modified , converted into other compounds , or joined together to form macromolecules . This process often consists of metabolic pathways . Some of these biosynthetic pathways are located within a single cellular organelle , while others involve enzymes that are located within multiple cellular organelles . Examples of these biosynthetic pathways include the production of lipid membrane components and nucleotides . Biosynthesis is usually synonymous with anabolism . The prerequisite elements for biosynthesis include : precursor compounds , chemical energy ( e.g . ATP ) , and catalytic enzymes which may require coenzymes ( e.g.NADH , NADPH ) . These elements create monomers , the building blocks for macromolecules . Some important biological macromolecules include : proteins , which are composed of amino acid monomers joined via peptide bonds , and DNA molecules , which are composed of nucleotides joined via phosphodiester bonds .",
  "/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate": "Adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) is a complex organic chemical that provides energy to drive many processes in living cells , e.g . muscle contraction , nerve impulse propagation , and chemical synthesis . Found in all forms of life , ATP is often referred to as the molecular unit of currency of intracellular energy transfer . When consumed in metabolic processes , it converts either to adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) or to adenosine monophosphate ( AMP ) . Other processes regenerate ATP so that the human body recycles its own body weight equivalent in ATP each day . It is also a precursor to DNA and RNA , and is used as a coenzyme . From the perspective of biochemistry , ATP is classified as a nucleoside triphosphate , which indicates that it consists of three components : a nitrogenous base ( adenine ) , the sugar ribose , and the triphosphate .",

  "/wiki/Disruptive_technology": "In business theory , a disruptive innovation is an innovation that creates a new market and value network and eventually disrupts an existing market and value network , displacing established market-leading firms , products , and alliances . The term was defined and first analyzed by the American scholar Clayton M. Christensen and his collaborators beginning in 1995 , and has been called the most influential business idea of the early 21st century . Not all innovations are disruptive , even if they are revolutionary . For example , the first automobiles in the late 19th century were not a disruptive innovation , because early automobiles were expensive luxury items that did not disrupt the market for horse-drawn vehicles . The market for transportation essentially remained intact until the debut of the lower-priced Ford Model T in 1908 . The mass-produced automobile was a disruptive innovation , because it changed the transportation market , whereas the first thirty years of automobiles did not . Disruptive innovations tend to be produced by outsiders and entrepreneurs in startups , rather than existing market-leading companies . The business environment of market leaders does not allow them to pursue disruptive innovations when they first arise , because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from sustaining innovations ( which are needed to compete against current competition ) . A disruptive process can take longer to develop than by the conventional approach and the risk associated to it is higher than the other more incremental or evolutionary forms of innovations , but once it is deployed in the market , it achieves a much faster penetration and higher degree of impact on the established markets . Beyond business and economics disruptive innovations can also be considered to disrupt complex systems , including economic and business-related aspects .",

  "/wiki/Television": "Television ( TV ) , sometimes shortened to tele or telly , is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome ( black and white ) , or in colour , and in two or three dimensions and sound . The term can refer to a television set , a television program ( TV show ) , or the medium of television transmission . Television is a mass medium for advertising , entertainment and news . Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s , but it would still be several years before the new technology would be marketed to consumers . After World War II , an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain , and television sets became commonplace in homes , businesses , and institutions . During the 1950s , television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion . In the mid-1960s , color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries . The availability of multiple types of archival storage media such as Betamax and VHS tapes , high-capacity hard disk drives , DVDs , flash drives , high-definition Blu-ray Discs , and cloud digital video recorders has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material - such as movies - at home on their own time schedule . For many reasons , especially the convenience of remote retrieval , the storage of television and video programming now occurs on the cloud . At the end of the first decade of the 2000s , digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity . Another development was the move from standard-definition television ( SDTV ) ( 576i , with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i ) to high-definition television ( HDTV ) , which provides a resolution that is substantially higher . HDTV may be transmitted in various formats : 1080p , 1080i and 720p .",

  "/wiki/Hearing_aid": "A hearing aid is a device designed to improve hearing by making sound audible to a person with hearing loss . Hearing aids are classified as medical devices in most countries , and regulated by the respective regulations . Small audio amplifiers such as PSAPs or other plain sound reinforcing systems can not be sold as hearing aids . Early devices , such as ear trumpets or ear horns , were passive amplification cones designed to gather sound energy and direct it into the ear canal . Modern devices are computerised electroacoustic systems that transform environmental sound to make it audible , according to audiometrical and cognitive rules . Modern devices also utilize sophisticated digital signal processing to try and improve speech intelligibility and comfort for the user . Such signal processing includes feedback management , wide dynamic range compression , directionality , frequency lowering , and noise reduction . Modern hearing aids require configuration to match the hearing loss , physical features , and lifestyle of the wearer . The hearing aid is fit to the most recent audiogram and is programmed by frequency . This process is called fitting and is performed by a Doctor of Audiology , also called an audiologist ( AuD ) , or by a Hearing Instrument Specialist ( HIS ) . The amount of benefit a hearing aid delivers depends in large part on the quality of its fitting . Almost all hearing aids in use in the US are digital hearing aids .",

  "/wiki/Valedictorian": "Valedictorian is an academic title of success used in the United States , Canada , Philippines , and Armenia , ( and elsewhere in limited number of schools ) for the student who delivers the closing or farewell statement at a graduation ceremony ( called a valediction ) . The chosen valedictorian is traditionally the student with the highest ranking ( highest Grade Point Average , or GPA ) among their graduating class . The term is an Anglicised derivation of the Latin vale dicere ( to say farewell ) , historically rooted in the valedictorian 's traditional role as the final speaker at the graduation ceremony before the students receive their diplomas . The valedictory address generally is considered a final farewell to classmates , before they disperse to pursue their individual paths after graduating . In Australia , New Zealand , South Africa , Ireland and India the title valedictorian is not used frequently . In Australia , the title is sometimes awarded to a member of a graduating university class on the basis of contribution to the school rather than academic success . The highest-ranking student in a graduating class is often referred to as dux ( Latin for leader ) , and may or may not give a speech .

Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of Earth and its human and natural complexities - not merely where objects are , but also how they have changed and come to be . Geography is often defined in terms of two branches : human geography and physical geography . Human geography deals with the study of people and their communities , cultures , economies , and interactions with the environment by studying their relations with and across space and place . Physical geography deals with the study of processes and patterns in the natural environment like the atmosphere , hydrosphere , biosphere , and geosphere . The four historical traditions in geographical research are spatial analyses of natural and the human phenomena , area studies of places and regions , studies of human-land relationships , and the Earth sciences .

He specialized in obstetrics and gynaecology , and contributed significant research to the field of women 's health , in particular about menopause and hormone replacement therapy . Judd was born in Los Angeles to George and Emmeline Judd . His father was an obstetrician , and his older brother Lewis went on to become chairman of the psychiatry department of University of California , San Diego . Howard went on to study medicine at George Washington University after attending Occidental College and Brigham Young University . Judd completed his residency in obstetrics and gynaecology at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , and later trained in endocrinology at Massachusetts General Hospital . In 1970 , he joined the medical faculty at the University of California , San Diego , and later in 1977 joined the University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) . He would remain at the university until his retirement in 2005 , and became a professor of obstetrics and gynecology , and the executive director of the division of reproductive endocrinology and infertility . In his early research , Judd and his collaborators showed that the ovaries of postmenopausal women could secrete amounts of androgen , which can act as precursors to estrogen . He then began investigating the physiology of hot flushes , a characteristic symptom of menopause . He developed techniques to monitor the onset and severity of hot flushes , using electrodes to measure rises in skin temperature due to vasodilation , and pulse rate . These objective measurements of hot flushes later assisted in assessing the effectiveness of treatments mitigating the signs and symptoms of menopause , including hormone replacement therapy .",
  "/wiki/Women's_health": "Women 's health refers to the health of women , which differs from that of men in many unique ways . Women 's health is an example of population health , where health is defined by the World Health Organization as a state of complete physical , mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity . Often treated as simply women 's reproductive health , many groups argue for a broader definition pertaining to the overall health of women , better expressed as The health of women . These differences are further exacerbated in developing countries where women , whose health includes both their risks and experiences , are further disadvantaged . Although women in industrialised countries have narrowed the gender gap in life expectancy and now live longer than men , in many areas of health they experience earlier and more severe disease with poorer outcomes . Gender remains an important social determinant of health , since women 's health is influenced not just by their biology but also by conditions such as poverty , employment , and family responsibilities . Women have long been disadvantaged in many respects such as social and economic power which restricts their access to the necessities of life including health care , and the greater the level of disadvantage , such as in developing countries , the greater adverse impact on health . Women 's reproductive and sexual health has a distinct difference compared to men 's health . Even in developed countries pregnancy and childbirth are associated with substantial risks to women with maternal mortality accounting for more than a quarter of a million deaths per year , with large gaps between the developing and developed countries . Comorbidity from other non reproductive disease such as cardiovascular disease contribute to both the mortality and morbidity of pregnancy , including preeclampsia . Sexually transmitted infections have serious consequences for women and infants , with mother-to-child transmission leading to outcomes such as stillbirths and neonatal deaths , and pelvic inflammatory disease leading to infertility . In addition infertility from many other causes , birth control , unplanned pregnancy , unconsensual sexual activity and the struggle for access to abortion create other burdens for women .",

Individuals who have earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree may , in many jurisdictions , use the title Doctor ( often abbreviated Dr or Dr. ) with their name , although the proper etiquette associated with this usage may also be subject to the professional ethics of their own scholarly field , culture , or society . Those who teach at universities or work in academic , educational , or research fields are usually addressed by this title professionally and socially in a salutation or conversation . Alternatively , holders may use post-nominal letters such as Ph.D. , PhD , or DPhil ( depending on the awarding institution ) . It is , however , considered incorrect to use both the title and post-nominals at the same time . The specific requirements to earn a PhD degree vary considerably according to the country , institution , and time period , from entry-level research degrees to higher doctorates . During the studies that lead to the degree , the student is called a doctoral student or PhD student ; a student who has completed all their coursework and comprehensive examinations and is working on their thesis/dissertation is sometimes known as a doctoral candidate or PhD candidate ( see : all but dissertation ) . A student attaining this level may be granted a Candidate of Philosophy degree at some institutions or may be granted a master 's degree en route to the doctoral degree . Sometimes this status is also colloquially known as PhD ABD , meaning All But Dissertation .",

  "/wiki/Zion_National_Park": "Zion National Park is an American national park located in southwestern Utah near the town of Springdale . A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile ( 590 km2 ) park is Zion Canyon , which is 15 miles ( 24 km ) long and up to 2,640 ft ( 800 m ) deep . The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River . The lowest point in the park is 3,666 ft ( 1,117 m ) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726 ft ( 2,660 m ) at Horse Ranch Mountain . Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau , Great Basin , and Mojave Desert regions , the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity . Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds , 75 mammals ( including 19 species of bat ) , and 32 reptiles inhabit the park 's four life zones : desert , riparian , woodland , and coniferous forest . Zion National Park includes mountains , canyons , buttes , mesas , monoliths , rivers , slot canyons , and natural arches . Human habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans , one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Anasazi ( c. 300 CE ) . Subsequently , the Virgin Anasazi culture ( c. 500 ) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities . Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes . Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s . In 1909 , President William Howard Taft named the area Mukuntuweap National Monument in order to protect the canyon ."
