  "/wiki/Hectare": "The hectare ( /\u02c8h\u025bkt\u025b\u0259r , -t\u0251\u02d0r/ ; SI symbol : ha ) is a non-SI metric unit of area equal to a square with 100-metre sides ( 1 hm2 ) , or 10,000 m2 , and is primarily used in the measurement of land . There are 100 hectares in one square kilometre . An acre is about 0.405 hectare and one hectare contains about 2.47 acres . In 1795 , when the metric system was introduced , the are was defined as 100 square metres and the hectare ( hecto- + are ) was thus 100 ares or \u200b1\u2044100 km2 ( 10,000 square metres ) . When the metric system was further rationalised in 1960 , resulting in the International System of Units ( SI ) , the are was not included as a recognised unit . The hectare , however , remains as a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI and whose use is expected to continue indefinitely . Though the dekare/decare daa ( 1,000 m2 ) and are a ( 100 m2 ) are not officially accepted for use , they are still used in some contexts .",
  "/wiki/Acre": "The acre is a unit of land area used in the imperial and US customary systems .

Based upon the International yard and pound agreement of 1959 , an acre may be declared as exactly 4,046.8564224 square metres . An internationally recognised symbol for the acre is ac . The acre is a statute measure in the United States , in the United Kingdom and in almost all countries of the former British Empire : in most it is lawful to 'use for trade ' if given as supplementary information and is not used for land registration . In the United States both the international acre and the US survey acre are in use , but they differ by only two parts per million : see below . The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land . Traditionally , in the Middle Ages , an acre was defined as the area of land that could be ploughed in one day by a yoke of oxen .",

  "/wiki/Eel_River_(California)": "The Eel River ( Cahto : Taanchow ) is a major river , about 196 miles ( 315 km ) long , of northwestern California . The river and its tributaries form the third largest watershed entirely in California , draining a rugged area of 3,684 square miles ( 9,540 km2 ) in five counties . The river flows generally northward through the Coast Ranges west of the Sacramento Valley , emptying into the Pacific Ocean about 10 miles ( 16 km ) downstream from Fortuna and just south of Humboldt Bay . The river provides groundwater recharge , recreation , and industrial , agricultural and municipal water supply . The Eel River system is among the most dynamic in California because of the region 's unstable geology and the influence of major Pacific storms . The discharge is highly variable ; average flows in January and February are over 100 times greater than in August and September . The river also carries the highest suspended sediment load of any river of its size in the United States , in part due to the frequent landslides in the region . However , the river basin also supports abundant forests - including some of the world 's largest trees in Sequoia sempervirens ( Coastal redwood ) groves - and historically , one of California 's major salmon and steelhead trout runs . The river basin was lightly populated by Native Americans before , and for decades after the European settlement of California . The region remained little traveled until 1850 , when Josiah Gregg and his exploring party arrived in search of land for settlement . The river was named after they traded a frying pan to a group of Wiyot fishermen in exchange for a large number of Pacific lampreys , which the explorers thought were eels . :91 Explorers ' reports of the fertile and heavily timbered region attracted settlers to Humboldt Bay and the Eel River Valley .",

Notable Sierra features include the General Sherman ( tree ) , the largest tree in the world by volume ; Lake Tahoe , the largest alpine lake in North America ; Mount Whitney at 14,505 ft ( 4,421 m ) , the highest point in the contiguous United States ; and Yosemite Valley sculpted by glaciers from one-hundred-million-year-old granite , containing high waterfalls . The Sierra is home to three national parks , twenty wilderness areas , and two national monuments . These areas include Yosemite , Sequoia , and Kings Canyon National Parks ; and Devils Postpile National Monument . The character of the range is shaped by its geology and ecology . More than one hundred million years ago during the Nevadan orogeny , granite formed deep underground . The range started to uplift four million years ago , and erosion by glaciers exposed the granite and formed the light-colored mountains and cliffs that make up the range . The uplift caused a wide range of elevations and climates in the Sierra Nevada , which are reflected by the presence of five life zones ( areas with similar plant and animal communities ) . Uplift continues due to faulting caused by tectonic forces , creating spectacular fault block escarpments along the eastern edge of the southern Sierra .",

  "/wiki/Fort_Ord": "Fort Ord is a former United States Army post on Monterey Bay of the Pacific Ocean coast in California , which closed in 1994 due to Base Realignment and Closure ( BRAC ) action . Most of the fort 's land now makes up the Fort Ord National Monument , managed by the United States Bureau of Land Management as part of the National Conservation Lands , while a small portion remains an active military installation under Army control designated as the Ord Military Community . Before construction and official designation as a fort in 1940 , the land was used as a maneuver area and field-artillery target range during 1917 . Fort Ord was considered one of the most attractive locations of any U.S. Army post , because of its proximity to the beach and California weather . The 7th Infantry Division was its main garrison for many years . When Fort Ord was converted to civilian use , space was set aside for the first nature reserve in the United States created for conservation of an insect , the endangered Smith 's blue butterfly . Additional endangered species are found on Fort Ord , including Contra Costa goldfields and the threatened California tiger salamander . While much of the old military buildings and infrastructure remain abandoned , many structures have been torn down for anticipated development . California State University , Monterey Bay ( CSUMB ) and the Fort Ord Dunes State Park , along with some subdivisions , the Veterans Transition Center , a commercial strip mall , a tandem skydiving drop zone , military facilities and a nature preserve occupy the area today . On April 20 , 2012 , President Barack Obama signed a proclamation designating a 14,651-acre ( 5,929 ha ) portion of the former post as the Fort Ord National Monument .

The valley also has many major cities , including the state capital Sacramento ; as well as Chico , Redding , Stockton , Modesto , Fresno , and Bakersfield . The Central Valley watershed comprises 60,000 square miles ( 160,000 km2 ) , or over a third of California . It consists of three main drainage systems : the Sacramento Valley in the north , which receives well over 20 inches ( 510 mm ) of rain annually ; the drier San Joaquin Valley in the south ; and the Tulare Basin and its semi-arid desert climate at the southernmost end . The Sacramento and San Joaquin river systems drain their respective valleys and meet to form the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta , a large expanse of interconnected canals , stream beds , sloughs , marshes , and peat islands . The delta empties into the San Francisco Bay , and then ultimately flows into the Pacific . The waters of the Tulare Basin essentially never flow to the ocean ( with the exception of Kings River waters diverted northward for irrigation ) , though they are connected by man-made canals to the San Joaquin and could drain there again naturally if they were ever to rise high enough .",
