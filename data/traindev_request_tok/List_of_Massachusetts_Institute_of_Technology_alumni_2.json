  "/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Economics": "The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences , commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize in Economics , is an award for outstanding contributions to the field of economics , and generally regarded as the most prestigious award for that field . The award 's official name is The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel ( Swedish : Sveriges riksbanks pris i ekonomisk vetenskap till Alfred Nobels minne ) . The prize was established in 1968 by a donation from Sweden 's central bank Sveriges Riksbank to the Nobel Foundation to commemorate the bank 's 300th anniversary . As it is not one of the prizes that Alfred Nobel established in his will in 1895 , it is not technically a Nobel Prize . However , it is administered and referred to along with the Nobel Prizes by the Nobel Foundation . Laureates are announced with the Nobel Prize laureates , and receive the award at the same ceremony . Laureates in the Memorial Prize in Economics are selected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences . It was first awarded in 1969 to Dutch and Norwegian economists Jan Tinbergen and Ragnar Frisch , for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes .",
