All of the players on the 1953 recording were at that time members of the Lionel Hampton Orchestra , and subsequently toured europe with Hampton from September to December 1953 , except Sonny Johnson .

  "/wiki/Horace_Silver": "Horace Ward Martin Tavares Silver [ note 1 ] ( September 2 , 1928 - June 18 , 2014 ) was an American jazz pianist , composer , and arranger , particularly in the hard bop style that he helped pioneer in the 1950s . After playing tenor saxophone and piano at school in Connecticut , Silver got his break on piano when his trio was recruited by Stan Getz in 1950 . Silver soon moved to New York City , where he developed a reputation as a composer and for his bluesy playing . Frequent sideman recordings in the mid-1950s helped further , but it was his work with the Jazz Messengers , co-led by Art Blakey , that brought both his writing and playing most attention . Their Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers album contained Silver 's first hit , The Preacher . After leaving Blakey in 1956 , Silver formed his own quintet , with what became the standard small group line-up of tenor saxophone , trumpet , piano , bass , and drums . Their public performances and frequent recordings for Blue Note Records increased Silver 's popularity , even through changes of personnel . His most successful album was Song for My Father , made with two iterations of the quintet in 1963 and 1964 . Several changes occurred in the early 1970s : Silver disbanded his group to spend more time with his wife and to concentrate on composing ; he included lyrics in his recordings ; and his interest in spiritualism developed . The last two of these were often combined , resulting in commercially unsuccessful releases such as The United States of Mind series . Silver left Blue Note after 28 years , founded his own record label , and scaled back his touring in the 1980s , relying in part on royalties from his compositions for income . In 1993 , he returned to major record labels , releasing five albums before gradually withdrawing from public view because of health problems .",
