Chiaramonti was also a monk of the Order of Saint Benedict in addition to being a well-known theologian and bishop throughout his life . Chiaramonti was made Bishop of Tivoli in 1782 , and resigned that position upon his appointment as Bishop of Imola in 1785 . That same year , he was made a cardinal . In 1789 , the French Revolution took place , and as a result a series of anti-clerical governments came into power in the country . In 1796 , during the French Revolutionary Wars , French troops under Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Rome and took as prisoner Pope Pius VI . He was taken as prisoner to France , where he died in 1799 . The following year , after a sede vacante period lasting approximately six months , Chiaramonti was elected to the papacy , taking the name Pius VII . Pius at first attempted to take a cautious approach in dealing with Napoleon . With him he signed the Concordat of 1801 , through which he succeeded in guaranteeing religious freedom for Catholics living in France , and was present at his coronation as Emperor of the French in 1804 . In 1809 , however , during the Napoleonic Wars , Napoleon once again invaded the Papal States , resulting in his excommunication . Pius VII was taken prisoner and transported to France .",

Leo XII was in ill health from the time of his election to the papacy to his death less than 6 years later , although he was noted for enduring pain well . He was a deeply conservative ruler , who enforced many controversial laws , including one forbidding Jews to own property . Papal finances were also poor , even though he reduced taxes . As a result , Leo XII 's reign was unpopular and provoked widespread discontent within the Papal States .",

Pius VIII 's pontificate was the shortest of the 19th century , and is likely the least remembered . His brief papacy witnessed the Catholic Emancipation in Great Britain in 1829 , which he welcomed , and the July Revolution in France in 1830 , which he reluctantly accepted . Pius VIII is often remembered for his writings on marriages between Catholics and Protestants in the 1830 encyclical Litteris altero abhinc , in which he declared that a marriage could only be properly blessed if proper provisions had been made to ensure the bringing up of children in the Catholic faith . His death less than two years after his election to the papacy has led to speculation of a possible murder .",

It took a long time for the conclave to elect a new pope due to conflict between secular governments concerning who should be elected . Cardinal Emmanuele De Gregorio was the proposed candidate of the pro-French faction and the zelanti ( conservative cardinals ) , whilst Bartolomeo Pacca was proposed by the more moderate cardinals but was not accepted by the French government of the Bourbon Restoration period . At the time , France was governed by Charles X and Prime Minister Jean Baptiste Gay , vicomte de Martignac .

He had adopted the name Mauro upon entering the religious order of the Camaldolese . Strongly conservative and traditionalist , he opposed democratic and modernising reforms in the Papal States and throughout Europe , seeing them as fronts for revolutionary leftism . [ citation needed ] Against these trends Gregory XVI sought to strengthen the religious and political authority of the papacy ( see ultramontanism ) . In the encyclical Mirari vos , he pronounced it false and absurd , or rather mad , that we must secure and guarantee to each one liberty of conscience . He encouraged missionary activity abroad and condemned the slave trade . However , his harsh repression , financial extravagance and neglectfulness left him deeply unpopular domestically . He is the most recent pope to take the pontifical name Gregory , and the most recent non-bishop to become pope .",

  "/wiki/Pope_Pius_IX": "Pope Pius IX ( Italian : Pio IX , pronounced Pio nono ; born Giovanni Maria Mastai Ferretti ; [ a ] 13 May 1792 - 7 February 1878 ) was head of the Catholic Church from 16 June 1846 to his death on 7 February 1878 . He was the longest-reigning elected pope , serving for over 31 years . During his pontificate , Pius IX convened the First Vatican Council ( 1869-70 ) , which decreed papal infallibility , but the council was cut short owing to the loss of the Papal States . Europe , including the Italian peninsula , was in the midst of considerable political ferment when the bishop of Imola , Giovanni Maria Cardinal Mastai Ferretti , was elected pope . He took the name Pius , after his generous patron and the long-suffering prisoner of Napoleon , Pius VII . He had been elected by the faction of cardinals sympathetic to the political liberalization coursing across Europe , and his initial governance of the Papal States gives evidence of his own moderate sympathies . A series of terrorist acts sponsored by Italian liberals and nationalists , which included the assassination of ( among others ) his Minister of the Interior , Pellegrino Rossi , and which forced Pius himself to briefly flee Rome in 1848 , along with widespread revolutions in Europe , led to his growing skepticism towards the liberal , nationalist agenda . Through the 1850s and 1860s , Italian nationalists made military gains against the Papal States , which culminated in the seizure of the city of Rome in 1870 and the dissolution of the Papal States . Thereafter , Pius IX refused to accept the Law of Guarantees from the Italian government , which would have made the Holy See dependent on legislation that the Italian parliament could modify at any time . Pius refused to leave Vatican City , declaring himself a prisoner of the Vatican . His ecclesiastical policies towards other countries , such as Russia , Germany or France , were not always successful , owing in part to changing secular institutions and internal developments within these countries . However , concordats were concluded with numerous states such as Austria-Hungary , Portugal , Spain , Canada , Tuscany , Ecuador , Venezuela , Honduras , El Salvador , and Haiti .",

He was the oldest pope ( reigning until the age of 93 ) , and had the third-longest confirmed pontificate , behind those of Pius IX ( his immediate predecessor ) and John Paul II . He is well known for his intellectualism and his attempts to define the position of the Catholic Church with regard to modern thinking . In his famous 1891 encyclical Rerum novarum , Pope Leo outlined the rights of workers to a fair wage , safe working conditions , and the formation of trade unions , while affirming the rights of property and free enterprise , opposing both socialism and laissez-faire capitalism . He influenced Mariology of the Catholic Church and promoted both the rosary and the scapular . Leo XIII issued a record of eleven papal encyclicals on the rosary earning him the title as the Rosary Pope . In addition , he approved two new Marian scapulars and was the first pope to fully embrace the concept of Mary as Mediatrix . He was the first pope to have never held any control over the Papal States , after they had been dissolved by 1870 .

Pius X is known for vigorously opposing modernist interpretations of Catholic doctrine , promoting liturgical reforms and orthodox theology . He directed the production of the 1917 Code of Canon Law , the first comprehensive and systemic work of its kind . Pius X was devoted to the Marian title of Our Lady of Confidence ; while his papal encyclical Ad diem illum took on a sense of renewal that was reflected in the motto of his pontificate . He advanced the Liturgical Movement as the only pope to favor the use of the vernacular language in teaching catechesis , he encouraged the frequent reception of holy communion , and he lowered the age for First Communion , which became a lasting innovation of his papacy . In addition , he strongly defended the Catholic religion against indifferentism and relativism . Like his predecessors , he promoted Thomism as the principal philosophical method to be taught in Catholic institutions . As Roman pontiff , he vehemently opposed modernism and various nineteenth-century philosophies , which he viewed as an import of secular errors incompatible with Catholic dogma . Pius X was known for his overall firm demeanor and sense of personal poverty . He frequently gave homily sermons in the pulpit every week , a rare practice at the time .

His pontificate was largely overshadowed by World War I and its political , social , and humanitarian consequences in Europe . Between 1846 and 1903 , the Catholic Church had experienced two of its longest pontificates in history up to that point . Together Pius IX and Leo XIII ruled for a total of 57 years . In 1914 , the College of Cardinals chose della Chiesa at the relatively young age of 59 at the outbreak of World War I , which he labeled the suicide of civilized Europe . The war and its consequences were the main focus of Benedict XV . He immediately declared the neutrality of the Holy See and attempted from that perspective to mediate peace in 1916 and 1917 . Both sides rejected his initiatives . German Protestants rejected any Papal Peace as insulting . The French politician Georges Clemenceau regarded the Vatican initiative as being anti-French . Having failed with diplomatic initiatives , Benedict XV focused on humanitarian efforts to lessen the impacts of the war , such as attending prisoners of war , the exchange of wounded soldiers and food deliveries to needy populations in Europe .

He was the first sovereign of Vatican City from its creation as an independent state on 11 February 1929 . He took as his papal motto , Pax Christi in Regno Christi , translated The Peace of Christ in the Kingdom of Christ . Pius XI issued numerous encyclicals , including Quadragesimo anno on the 40th anniversary of Pope Leo XIII 's groundbreaking social encyclical Rerum novarum , highlighting the capitalistic greed of international finance , the dangers of socialism/communism , and social justice issues , and Quas primas , establishing the feast of Christ the King in response to anti-clericalism . The encyclical Studiorum ducem , promulgated 29 June 1923 , was written on the occasion of the 6th centenary of the canonization of Thomas Aquinas , whose thought is acclaimed as central to Catholic philosophy and theology . The encyclical also singles out the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas , Angelicum as the preeminent institution for the teaching of Aquinas : ante omnia Pontificium Collegium Angelicum , ubi Thomam tamquam domi suae habitare dixeris ( before all others the Pontifical Angelicum College , where Thomas can be said to dwell ) . To establish or maintain the position of the Catholic Church , Pius XI concluded a record number of concordats , including the Reichskonkordat with Nazi Germany , whose betrayals of which he condemned four years later in the encyclical Mit brennender Sorge ( With Burning Concern ) . During his pontificate , the longstanding hostility with the Italian government over the status of the papacy and the Church in Italy was successfully resolved in the Lateran Treaty of 1929 . He was unable to stop the persecution of the Church and the killing of clergy in Mexico , Spain and the Soviet Union . He canonized important saints , including Thomas More , Peter Canisius , Bernadette of Lourdes and Don Bosco . He beatified and canonized Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Lisieux , for whom he held special reverence , and gave equivalent canonization to Albertus Magnus , naming him a Doctor of the Church due to the spiritual power of his writings .

While the Vatican was officially neutral during World War II , the Reichskonkordat and his leadership of the Catholic Church during the war remain the subject of controversy - including allegations of public silence and inaction about the fate of the Jews . After the war , he advocated peace and reconciliation , including lenient policies towards former Axis and Axis-satellite nations . During his papacy , the Church issued the Decree against Communism , declaring that Catholics who profess Communist doctrine are to be excommunicated as apostates from the Christian faith . In turn , the Church experienced severe persecution and mass deportations of Catholic clergy in the Eastern Bloc . He explicitly invoked ex cathedra papal infallibility with the dogma of the Assumption of Mary in his Apostolic constitution Munificentissimus Deus .

He was one of the most travelled world leaders in history , visiting 129 countries during his pontificate . As part of his special emphasis on the universal call to holiness , he beatified 1,340 and canonised 483 people , more than the combined tally of his predecessors during the preceding five centuries . By the time of his death , he had named most of the College of Cardinals , consecrated or co-consecrated a large number of the world 's bishops , and ordained many priests . John Paul II was the second longest-serving pope in modern history after Pope Pius IX . Born in Poland , John Paul II was the first non-Italian pope since the 16th-century Pope Adrian VI . John Paul II 's cause for canonisation commenced one month after his death with the traditional five-year waiting period waived .",
