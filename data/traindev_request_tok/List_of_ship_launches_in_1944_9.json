Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

Kaiser ranked 20th among U.S. corporations in the value of wartime production contracts . The shipyards were owned by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company , a creation of American industrialist Henry J. Kaiser ( 1882-1967 ) , who established the shipbuilding company around 1939 in order to help meet the construction goals set by the United States Maritime Commission for merchant shipping . Four of the Kaiser Shipyards were located in Richmond , California , and were called the Richmond Shipyards . Three other shipyards were located in the Pacific Northwest along the Columbia and Willamette rivers : the Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation and the Swan Island Shipyard in Portland , Oregon , and the Vancouver Shipyard in Vancouver , Washington . Henry Kaiser was known for developing new methods of ship building , which allowed his yards to outproduce other similar facilities and build 1,490 ships , 27 percent of the total Maritime Commission construction . Kaiser 's ships were completed in two-thirds the time and a quarter the cost of the average of all other shipyards . Liberty ships were typically assembled in a little over two weeks , and one in less than five days . Kaiser Shipyards shut down at the end of the war . The Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park was dedicated October 25 , 2000 on the site of one of the shipyards in Richmond .",

The Jacksonville metropolitan area has a population of 1,523,615 and is the fourth largest metropolitan area in Florida . Jacksonville is centered on the banks of the St. Johns River in the First Coast region of northeast Florida , about 25 miles ( 40 km ) south of the Georgia state line and 328 miles ( 528 km ) north of Miami . The Jacksonville Beaches communities are along the adjacent Atlantic coast .

Under British rule , a settlement grew at the narrow point in the river where cattle crossed , known as Wacca Pilatka to the Seminole and the Cow Ford to the British . A platted town was established there in 1822 , a year after the United States gained Florida from Spain ; it was named after Andrew Jackson , the first military governor of the Florida Territory and seventh President of the United States .

The class was developed to meet British orders for transports to replace ships that had been lost . Eighteen American shipyards built 2,710 Liberty ships between 1941 and 1945 ( an average of three ships every two days ) , easily the largest number of ships ever produced to a single design . Their production mirrored ( albeit on a much larger scale ) the manufacture of Hog Islander and similar standardized ship types during World War I .

The city is named after former General Sam Houston , who was president of the Republic of Texas and had won Texas ' independence from Mexico at the Battle of San Jacinto 25 miles ( 40 km ) east of Allen 's Landing . After briefly serving as the capital of the Texas Republic in the late 1830s , Houston grew steadily into a regional trading center for the remainder of the 19th century . The arrival of the 20th century saw a convergence of economic factors which fueled rapid growth in Houston , including a burgeoning port and railroad industry , the decline of Galveston as Texas ' primary port following a devastating 1900 hurricane , the subsequent construction of the Houston Ship Channel , and the Texas oil boom . In the mid-20th century , Houston 's economy diversified as it became home to the Texas Medical Center - the world 's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions - and NASA 's Johnson Space Center , where the Mission Control Center is located . Houston 's economy since the late 19th century has a broad industrial base in energy , manufacturing , aeronautics , and transportation .

Commissioned on 3 June 1945 , Lake Champlain did not participate in World War II , but did serve as a transport , bringing troops home from Europe as part of Operation Magic Carpet . Like many of her sister ships , she was decommissioned shortly after the end of the war , but was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s , and redesignated as an attack carrier ( CVA ) . She participated in the Korean War but spent the rest of her career in the Atlantic , Caribbean , and Mediterranean . In the late 1950s , she was redesignated as an antisubmarine carrier ( CVS ) . She was the prime recovery ship for the first manned Project Mercury mission ( Freedom 7 ) , the second unmanned Gemini mission ( Gemini 2 ) , and for the third manned Gemini ( Gemini 5 ) space mission . Lake Champlain had a unique modernization history . She was the only Essex-class ship to receive the SCB-27 conversion which was a rebuild of the superstructure , flight deck and other features but without also receiving the SCB-125 conversion which would have given her an angled flight deck and hurricane bow . Therefore , she had the distinction of being the last operational US aircraft carrier with an axial flight deck . Lake Champlain was decommissioned in 1966 and sold for scrap in 1972 .

  "/wiki/Type_XXI_submarine": "Type XXI submarines were a class of German diesel-electric Elektroboot ( German : electric boat ) submarines designed during the Second World War . One hundred and eighteen were completed , with four being combat ready . During the war only two were put into active service and went on patrols , but these were not used in combat . They were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged , rather than spending most of their time as surface ships that could submerge for brief periods as a means to escape detection . They incorporated many batteries to increase the time they could spend submerged , to as much as several days , and they only needed to surface to periscope depth for recharging via a snorkel . The design included many general improvements as well : much greater underwater speed by an improved hull design , greatly improved diving times , power-assisted torpedo reloading and greatly improved crew accommodations . However , the design was also flawed in many ways , with the submarines being mechanically unreliable and vulnerable to combat damage . The Type XXI submarines were also rushed into production before design work was complete , and the inexperienced facilities which constructed the boats were unable to meet necessary quality standards . After the war , several navies obtained XXIs and operated them for decades in various roles and large navies introduced new submarine designs based on them .
