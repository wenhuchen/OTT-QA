Brazil is one of the founding unions of CONSUR ( now Sudam\u00e9rica Rugby ) and played in the inaugural South American tournament . Brazil has not qualified for a Rugby World Cup , but participated in the first edition of rugby 7s in the Olympics . Brazil currently ranks 3rd in South America ( behind Argentina and Uruguay ) and 5th in the Americas region . Rugby union in Brazil has a long history , dating back to the late 19th century when British immigrants brought the game to Brazil 's urban ports . Despite Brazil 's success in association football , Brazil has historically been one of the weaker teams of the Americas , having less success than that of Argentina , Uruguay or Chile . In the 21st century , efforts were made to revitalize the sport in Brazil . With rugby sevens being added to the Olympic calendar , Brazil was invited to the World Rugby Sevens Series , showing improvement in both the men 's and women 's series . In 2016 , a meeting with the unions of Argentina , Brazil , Canada , Chile , the United States and Uruguay established the Americas Rugby Championship , meant to mirror the Six Nations and The Rugby Championship , and give consistent tests to the top teams in the region . After 3 close games , two of which Brazil came close to victory , Brazil beat the USA Eagles , 24-23 , their first victory in the championship , as well as over the United States and a Tier Two nation . Brazil later went to have its first victories over Belgium and Portugal , marking the first time the team beat any European side and , later , a historical win against Argentina XV . This latter game , along with two wins against Chile and Colombia , secured Brazil its first South American Rugby Championship title , in 2018 .",

Part of the city has been designated as a World Heritage Site , named Rio de Janeiro : Carioca Landscapes between the Mountain and the Sea , by UNESCO on 1 July 2012 as a Cultural Landscape . Founded in 1565 by the Portuguese , the city was initially the seat of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro , a domain of the Portuguese Empire . Later , in 1763 , it became the capital of the State of Brazil , a state of the Portuguese Empire . In 1808 , when the Portuguese Royal Court transferred itself from Portugal to Brazil , Rio de Janeiro became the chosen seat of the court of Queen Maria I of Portugal , who subsequently , in 1815 , under the leadership of her son , the Prince Regent , and future King Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal , raised Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom , within the United Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil , and Algarves . Rio stayed the capital of the pluricontinental Lusitanian monarchy until 1822 , when the War of Brazilian Independence began . This is one of the few instances in history that the capital of a colonising country officially shifted to a city in one of its colonies . Rio de Janeiro subsequently served as the capital of the independent monarchy , the Empire of Brazil , until 1889 , and then the capital of a republican Brazil until 1960 when the capital was transferred to Bras\u00edlia . Rio de Janeiro has the second largest municipal GDP in the country , and 30th largest in the world in 2008 , estimated at about R $ 343 billion ( nearly US $ 201 billion ) .

The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores ; both are now neighborhoods of the city . The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy , hence its formal name of Autonomous City of Buenos Aires ( Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires ; CABA ) . Its citizens first elected a chief of government ( i.e . mayor ) in 1996 ; previously , the mayor was directly appointed by the President of the Republic .
