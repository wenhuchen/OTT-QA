  "/wiki/Ethnographer": "Ethnography is defined as an illuminative account of social life and culture in a particular social system based on multiple detailed observations of what people actually do in the social setting being observed . Ethnography can be described as both qualitative and quantitative research methods that are used by sociologists when studying specific groups , communities or institutions found being a part of a larger complex society . These larger societies that sociologists could possibly observe in are entities such as gangs . The use of ethnography is most commonly used by sociologists who take a more specific look into society as well as proposed research for studies involving participant observation . Within society it can be used for organizations , communities , cults , etc . As we look at different types of ethnographies today , the research still focuses on social aspects such as digital or virtual ethnographies . Since generation social anthropology is derived within the ideas of ethnography , but the use of ethnography today is described in a less severe matter such as research , opinions and other forms of social studies .",
  "/wiki/Linear_A": "Linear A is a writing system used by the Minoans ( Cretans ) from 1800 to 1450 BCE to write the hypothesized Minoan language . Linear A was the primary script used in palace and religious writings of the Minoan civilization . It was discovered by archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans . It was succeeded by Linear B , which was used by the Mycenaeans to write an early form of Greek . No texts in Linear A have been deciphered . Linear A belongs to a group of scripts that evolved independently of the Egyptian and Mesopotamian systems . During the second millennium BCE , there were four major branches : Linear A , Linear B , Cypro-Minoan , and Cretan hieroglyphic . In the 1950s , Linear B was deciphered as Mycenaean Greek . Linear B shares many symbols with Linear A , and they may notate similar syllabic values . But neither those nor any other proposed readings lead to a language that scholars can read .",

The Rhodes Scholarship was founded by English businessman and politician Cecil John Rhodes , to promote unity between English-speaking nations and instill a sense of civic-minded leadership and moral fortitude in future leaders irrespective of their chosen career paths . Although initially restricted to male applicants from countries which are today within the British Commonwealth , as well as Germany and the United States , today the scholarship is open to applicants from all backgrounds and from across the globe . Since its creation , controversy has surrounded both its former exclusion of women ( thus leading to the establishment of the co-educational Marshall Scholarship ) , and Rhodes ' white supremacist beliefs and legacy of colonialism . Prominent recipients of the Rhodes Scholarship include politicians , academics , scientists , authors and entrepreneurs . Notable American politicians include former president of the United States Bill Clinton , former United States national security advisor and United States ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice , former governor of Louisiana Piyush Bobby Jindal , former United States secretary of the Air Force and former congresswoman Heather Wilson , and former United States secretary of health and human services Sylvia Matthews Burwell .

It was probably brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the mid-5th century , and the first Old English literary works date from the mid-7th century . After the Norman conquest of 1066 , English was replaced , for a time , as the language of the upper classes by Anglo-Norman , a relative of French . This is regarded as marking the end of the Old English era , as during this period the English language was heavily influenced by Anglo-Norman , developing into a phase known now as Middle English . Old English developed from a set of Anglo-Frisian or Ingvaeonic dialects originally spoken by Germanic tribes traditionally known as the Angles , Saxons and Jutes . As the Anglo-Saxons became dominant in England , their language replaced the languages of Roman Britain : Common Brittonic , a Celtic language , and Latin , brought to Britain by Roman invasion . Old English had four main dialects , associated with particular Anglo-Saxon kingdoms : Mercian , Northumbrian , Kentish and West Saxon . It was West Saxon that formed the basis for the literary standard of the later Old English period , although the dominant forms of Middle and Modern English would develop mainly from Mercian . The speech of eastern and northern parts of England was subject to strong Old Norse influence due to Scandinavian rule and settlement beginning in the 9th century . Old English is one of the West Germanic languages , and its closest relatives are Old Frisian and Old Saxon . Like other old Germanic languages , it is very different from Modern English and difficult for Modern English speakers to understand without study . Within Old English grammar nouns , adjectives , pronouns and verbs have many inflectional endings and forms , and word order is much freer .",

  "/wiki/Robin_Hood": "Robin Hood is a legendary heroic outlaw originally depicted in English folklore and subsequently featured in literature and film . According to legend , he was a highly skilled archer and swordsman . In some versions of the legend , he is depicted as being of noble birth , and in modern retellings he is sometimes depicted as having fought in the Crusades before returning to England to find his lands taken by the Sheriff . In the oldest known versions he is instead a member of the yeoman class . Traditionally depicted dressed in Lincoln green , he is said to have robbed from the rich and given to the poor . Through retellings , additions , and variations , a body of familiar characters associated with Robin Hood has been created . These include his lover , Maid Marian , his band of outlaws , the Merry Men , and his chief opponent , the Sheriff of Nottingham . The Sheriff is often depicted as assisting Prince John in usurping the rightful but absent King Richard , to whom Robin Hood remains loyal . His partisanship of the common people and his hostility to the Sheriff of Nottingham are early recorded features of the legend , but his interest in the rightfulness of the king is not , and neither is his setting in the reign of Richard I . He became a popular folk figure in the Late Middle Ages , and the earliest known ballads featuring him are from the 15th century ( 1400s ) .

  "/wiki/King_Arthur": "King Arthur was a legendary British leader who , according to medieval histories and romances , led the defence of Britain against Saxon invaders in the late 5th and early 6th centuries . The details of Arthur 's story are mainly composed of folklore and literary invention , and modern historians generally agree that he is unhistorical . The sparse historical background of Arthur is gleaned from various sources , including the Annales Cambriae , the Historia Brittonum , and the writings of Gildas . Arthur 's name also occurs in early poetic sources such as Y Gododdin . Arthur is a central figure in the legends making up the Matter of Britain . The legendary Arthur developed as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth 's fanciful and imaginative 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae ( History of the Kings of Britain ) . In some Welsh and Breton tales and poems that date from before this work , Arthur appears either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore , sometimes associated with the Welsh otherworld Annwn . How much of Geoffrey 's Historia ( completed in 1138 ) was adapted from such earlier sources , rather than invented by Geoffrey himself , is unknown . Although the themes , events and characters of the Arthurian legend varied widely from text to text , and there is no one canonical version , Geoffrey 's version of events often served as the starting point for later stories . Geoffrey depicted Arthur as a king of Britain who defeated the Saxons and established a vast empire . Many elements and incidents that are now an integral part of the Arthurian story appear in Geoffrey 's Historia , including Arthur 's father Uther Pendragon , the magician Merlin , Arthur 's wife Guinevere , the sword Excalibur , Arthur 's conception at Tintagel , his final battle against Mordred at Camlann , and final rest in Avalon . The 12th-century French writer Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes , who added Lancelot and the Holy Grail to the story , began the genre of Arthurian romance that became a significant strand of medieval literature .",
