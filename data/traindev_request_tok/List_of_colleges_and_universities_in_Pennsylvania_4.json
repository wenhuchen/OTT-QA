  "/wiki/Secular": "Secularity ( derived from the word secular which comes from Latin saeculum meaning worldly , of a generation , temporal , or a span of about 100 years ) is the state of being separate from religion , or of not being exclusively allied with or against any particular religion . Historically , the word secular was not related or linked to religion , but was a freestanding term in Latin which would relate to any mundane endeavour . However , the term , saecula saeculorum ( saecul\u014drum being the genitive plural of saeculum ) as found in the New Testament in the Vulgate translation ( circa 410 ) of the original Koine Greek phrase \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f30\u1ff6\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03b1\u1f30\u03ce\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd ( eis to\u00f9s aionas ton ai\u1e53n\u014dn ) , e.g . at Galatians 1:5 , was used in the early Christian church ( and is still used today ) , in the doxologies , to denote the coming and going of the ages , the grant of eternal life , and the long duration of created things from their beginning to forever and ever . The idea of a dichotomy between religion and the secular originated in the European Enlightenment . Furthermore , since religion and secular are both Western concepts that were formed under the influence of Christian theology , other cultures do not necessarily have words or concepts that resemble or are equivalent to them . In many cultures , little conceptual or practical distinction is made between 'natural ' and 'supernatural ' phenomena and the very notions of religious and nonreligious dissolve into unimportance , nonexistence , or unawareness , especially since people have beliefs in other supernatural or spiritual things irrespective of belief in God or gods . Conceptions of what is and what is not religion vary in contemporary East Asia as well . The shared term for irreligion or no religion ( \u7121\u5b97\u6559 , Chinese pron . w\u00fa z\u014dngji\u00e0o , Japanese pron . mu sh\u016bky\u014d ) with which the majority of East Asian populations identify themselves implies non-membership in one of the institutional religions ( such as Buddhism and Christianity ) but not necessarily non-belief in traditional folk religions collectively represented by Chinese Shendao ( sh\u00e9n d\u00e0o ) and Japanese Shinto ( both meaning ways of gods ) . [ a ] In modern Japan , religion has negative connotation since it is associated with foreign belief systems so many identify as nonreligious ( mushukyo ) , but this does not mean they have a complete rejection or absence of beliefs and rituals relating to supernatural , metaphysical , or spiritual things .",
