This engine was the result of a deal between BMW and Brabham , which resulted in the team 's chassis being powered by BMW engines from 1982 until 1987 , a period in which Nelson Piquet won the 1983 championship driving a Brabham BT52-BMW . BMW also supplied the M12/13 on a customer basis to the ATS , Arrows , Benetton and Ligier teams during this period , with various degrees of success . In 1988 , Brabham temporarily withdrew from the sport and BMW withdrew its official backing from the engines , which were still used by the Arrows team under the Megatron badge . Turbocharged engines were banned by the revised Formula One Technical Regulations for 1989 , rendering the M12/13 obsolete . BMW decided to return to Formula One in the late 1990s by signing an exclusive contract with the Williams team , which needed a new long-term engine supplier after the withdrawal of Renault in 1997 . The programme resulted in the creation of a new V10 engine which made its race d\u00e9but in the Williams FW22 in 2000 . The following year saw the partnership move from the midfield to challenging for race victories , but the desired championship remained elusive due to the dominance of Michael Schumacher and Ferrari in the first half of the 2000s . By 2005 , the relationship between BMW and Williams had deteriorated , and BMW chose to part company and buy the rival Sauber team outright .

Following these successes Alfa Romeo withdrew from Formula One . During the 1960s , although the company had no official presence in the top tier of motorsport a number of Formula One teams used independently developed Alfa Romeo engines to power their cars . In the early 1970s , Alfa provided Formula One support for their works driver Andrea de Adamich , supplying adapted versions of their 3-litre V8 engine from the Alfa Romeo Tipo 33/3 sports car to power Adamich 's McLaren ( 1970 ) and March ( 1971 ) entries . None of these engine combinations scored championship points . In the mid-1970s , Alfa engineer Carlo Chiti designed a flat-12 engine to replace the T33 V8 , which achieved some success in taking the 1975 World Sportscar Championship . Bernie Ecclestone , then owner of the Brabham Formula One team , persuaded Alfa Romeo to supply this engine free for the 1976 Formula One season . Although the Brabham-Alfa Romeo 's first season was relatively modest , during the 1977 and 1978 World Championships their cars took 14 podium finishes , including two race victories for Niki Lauda . The company 's sporting department , Autodelta , returned as the works team in 1979 .",
